[Episode 5]

2
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,280
Thank you. Thank you for saving my life.

3
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,160
What do we do with this lady?

4
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,659
Bring her to the inn.

5
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,260
Yes.

6
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,899
Get a doctor.

7
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,340
Yes.

8
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,040
Brother!

9
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,540
Brother!

10
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,620
Don't touch me!

11
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,839
Brother. I think you can tolerate the touch of a woman now.

12
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,959
You and the mistress of Moon Embrace...

13
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,400
were so intimate and holding each other's hands.

14
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,019
I am not sure either.

15
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,720
Brother, in order to prove if you can let a lady touch you...

16
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,540
A handsome reward awaits after it's done.

17
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,920
Mother!

18
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,920
Get her out!

19
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,080
Brother? Are you all right? Calm down.

20
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,260
You said everything is set.

21
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,760
How did it fail?

22
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,799
Your Highness, I received some news.

23
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,619
Prince Li was ambushed at the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

24
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,480
Is this somehow connected to Your Highness?

25
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,659
You told His Highness about this foul plan?

26
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,659
Did you learn nothing from the last mistake?

27
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,379
How could you be so reckless?

28
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,139
If Prince Li can be so easily killed,

29
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,540
he would have been dead long ago.

30
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,939
Minister, do not blame Wen Jie for this.

31
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,060
Wenjie does have a point.

32
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,379
Zongzheng Wuyou is ambitious and that is known by all.

33
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,219
If we hadn't come prepared...

34
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,899
and gotten rid of those related to the rank-selling case,

35
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,479
I am afraid... we would have been put on trial for this case.

36
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,700
Which is why Zongzheng Wuyou must be eliminated.

37
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,679
Father, rest assured.

38
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,619
The assassination attempt may have failed,

39
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,859
but the Creed of Vengeance acts in secrecy.

40
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,960
Everything will be fine.

41
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,579
The Creed of Vengeance?

42
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,499
It's an organization that came to rise in recent years.

43
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,579
It has many capable assassins under its employment.

44
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,099
They are hired to get rid of trouble and gather information.

45
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,539
They do their job in a subtle way.

46
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,779
Even if something went wrong, we would not be exposed.

47
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,260
So, you told His Highness about the Creed and kept me in the dark?

48
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,979
Don't you understand? Whether we failed or not,

49
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,979
if this information reaches His Majesty,

50
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,219
he will suspect that this is Crown Prince's doing.

51
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,619
As long as we have no evidence,

52
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,720
Crown Prince will be in danger all the time.

53
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,600
What if we do have the evidence?

54
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,940
Wenjie, get it done now.

55
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,480
Seal off Moon Embrace, arrest them and gather evidence.

56
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes.

57
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,420
Brother.

58
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,180
Brother!

59
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,160
Brother, I am sorry.

60
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,899
I should have thought about the consequences.

61
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,120
I shouldn't have taken the risk to test you.

62
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,080
I am sorry, Brother.

63
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,980
Brother, you were ambushed by assassins at the teahouse.

64
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,739
I am sure you know who planned it.

65
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,099
Other than the crown prince and his ilk,

66
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,680
no one would try so hard to have you killed.

67
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,779
They were in hiding for years.

68
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,619
They are finally making a move.

69
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,619
Brother, what do we do next?

70
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,679
The killers are no ordinary thugs.

71
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,619
Should we send our men to Moon Embrace to investigate...

72
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,539
and see if there is any clue?

73
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,420
Don't bother.

74
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,579
The teahouse is nothing but empty.

75
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,179
We won't find anything there.

76
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,100
You should get a good night sleep instead.

77
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,120
Perhaps tomorrow... something big might happen.

78
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,780
Tomorrow?

79
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,060
[East Village Guesthouse]

80
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,840
That was nice.

81
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,520
You are awake.

82
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,059
I was attacked by thugs last night.

83
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,100
Fortunately, you saved me. I am deeply grateful.

84
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,840
It's no big deal. You are welcome.

85
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,419
I got you a doctor.

86
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,720
He read your pulse.

87
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,459
The wounds are dressed.

88
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,579
But you did suffer from some internal injuries.

89
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,880
You will need a couple of days to heal.

90
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,740
Are you feeling better now?

91
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,960
I am fine now. Thank you for your concern.

92
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,880
If it's inconvenient in any way, I apologize in advance.

93
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,700
You passed out back there.

94
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,139
I brought you here without your permission.

95
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,420
I hope you are not offended.

96
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,160
You saved my life. I should be grateful.

97
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,499
I listened to the melody you were playing.

98
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,060
It's rather unique.

99
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,060
Judging by your tone, do you play an instrument yourself?

100
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,979
- Only on paper.
- Only on paper?

101
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,040
So, what do you think about this song?

102
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,499
The melody... is far-reaching and tranquil.

103
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,760
It's actually a lighter tone on the outside.

104
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,340
But it carries a certain sorrow with it.

105
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,899
You could tell there was sorrow...

106
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,620
just by listening to the tranquility behind the tunes?

107
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,960
It seems like you know a lot more than you claim.

108
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,779
I named this song "The Past."

109
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,420
I wrote this song seven years ago.

110
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,260
You look to be in your early twenties.

111
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,720
You were just a teenager seven years ago.

112
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,980
But you could already feel such a degree of sorrow?

113
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,179
I was simply asking. I mean no disrespect.

114
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:43,659
You have my thanks for saving my life.

115
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,419
I will never forget your kindness.

116
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,420
I shall repay you one day when I have the chance.

117
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,520
I have been here long enough. I should be on my way now.

118
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,780
I ordered the cook to prepare breakfast for you.

119
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,300
My Lady, stay for breakfast before leaving.

120
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,079
I appreciate the offer.

121
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,219
I have some urgent matters to see to.

122
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:07,120
I wish to go home.

123
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,680
In that case, I shall not make you stay.

124

Guards.

125
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,260
Yes, Master.

126
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,940
See this lady off for me.

127
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,020
Yes.

128
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,260
Thank you, Sir. So long.

[Being Fast and Diligent Brings Harmony]

130
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,200
How have you been lately, Father?

131
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,859
Much better.

132
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,659
Good, I am glad to hear that.

133
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,580
Thank you for the concern.

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,580

Slowly.

Your Highness, this way.

137
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,930
His Highness is here?

138
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,420
This way.

139
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,040
- Your Highness.
- Prince Li and Prince Chen.

140
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,140
At ease.

141
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,059
I heard you are ill, so I came to pay a visit.

142
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,899
Thank you for your concern.

143
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,979
Your Highness has never been interested in politics.

144
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,339
You avoided meeting with all the other officers.

145
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,659
Yet, Your Highness still cares about my well-being.

146

I am grateful for it.

147
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,020
I was under your teachings for years.

148
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,920
I know you are a man with knowledge and honor.

149
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,740
I can't compare you with those men.

150
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,099
I simply taught you how to read and write.

151
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,979
It was my duty as your teacher.

152
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,280
I can never replace Chief Minister Qin.

153
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,039
I understand. Sir Qin holds a place in your heart as your true mentor.

154
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,659
Teacher, that is not entirely true.

155
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,659
My brother has a lot of respect for you.

156
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,919
When he learned that you were ill, he came here to visit you.

157
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,939
Seeing that you are still in good spirit, you seem to be fine.

That is a relief for us students.

159
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,179
I am old. Sickness is nothing unusual for me.

160
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,180
Your Highness need not be worried about me.

161
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,300
I haven't been to the Imperial Court for days.

162
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,939
But I did hear about the marriage you turned down.

163
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,899
Your Highness refused to marry Princess Rong Le.

164
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,499
What is your plan for the future?

165
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,440
I have no plan in particular.

166
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,940
I simply refuse to become a pawn for the game of power.

167
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,219
Your Highness hold onto your belief and follow your heart, that is truly respectable.

168
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:53,459
But Your Highness is still young.

169
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,700
You need not be burdened by the past.

170
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,659
Spring is here and the blossoms are blooming.

171
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,299
Maybe Your Highness can talk a stroll outside.

172
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,019
Indeed. The scenery at Clearwater River is beautiful.

173
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,420
It's the best time to enjoy some songs and wine.

174
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,419
Well, why not take Ya Li with you?

175
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,339
She is the only child I have.

176
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,139
Her mother passed away while she was young.

177
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,020
She is not a very outgoing girl.

178
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,620
Great, can I tag along?

179
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,260
I love looking at the scenery.

180
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,939
- Your Highness.
- What is it?

181
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,939
General Fu returned victorious from battle.

182
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,440
Your Highness is being summoned by the emperor.

183
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,460
Brother, is this what you mentioned last night?

184
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,339
- It's General Fu!
- General Fu is back.

185
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,720
General Fu is back.

186
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,540
It's General Fu.

187
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,180
This is great!

188
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,700
As decreed by His Majesty!

189
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,780
General Fu is ordered to enter the palace at once.

190
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,940
I shall do as I am ordered.

191
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,259
At your service, Your Majesty.

192
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,259
Your Majesty, the mutiny at the southern border has been pacified.

193
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,299
The leader of the mutiny has been beheaded.

194
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,959
From now on, no one shall disrespect Your Majesty's authority.

195
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:59,120
Well done. I knew I was right about you all along.

196
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,819
General Fu, you are young and capable. You always return victorious.

197
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:06,680
The borders of Northern Lin shall be free from all skirmishes.

198
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,759
Send my words. The battle at the south is a victory.

199
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,819
All the soldiers and warriors shall be rewarded.

200
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

201
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,739
General Fu Chou is a fine commander. He returned victoriously.

202
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,939
He will now be granted the title of "General of Defense,"

203
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,860
promoted to first rank and a thousand taels of gold.

204
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,320
I thank Your Majesty for the reward.

205
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,080
Your Majesty, I was able to secure a victory all thanks to Prince Li's tactics.

206
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,380
The credit is not mine alone.

207
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,460
That is not an issue.

208
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,540
General, at ease.

209
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,419
I reward you for the feat you achieved.

210
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,939
As for Prince Li, I know what must be done.

211
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,980
He will be rewarded as well.

212
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,339
Very wise indeed, Your Majesty.

213
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,440
Your Majesty is wise.

214
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,360
The skirmishes at the south were caused by officers that neglected their duties.

215
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,320
In order to prevent such incidents,

216
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,839
I was planning to let Wuyou be in charge of the three provinces in the south.

217
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,620
What are your thoughts on this?

218
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,360
Father, that is a wise decision.

219
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,699
Prince Li has a brilliant mind.

220
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,139
If Prince Li is in charge of the southern provinces,

221
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,080
there will be no more mutiny at the borders.

222
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,179
Very wise indeed, Father.

223
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,579
If Wuyou is here, I am sure he will be grateful.

224
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,680
I have always had my trust in General Fu.

225
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,899
I remember the first time I met you.

226
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,539
You remind me of who I was when I was your age.

227
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:10,799
I have always believed you will be the pillar for the army of Northern Lin.

228
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,300
It seems like you have lived up to my expectations.

229
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,720
It's all thanks to Your Majesty's guidance.

230
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,980
A moment, General Fu.

231
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,500
Greetings, Crown Prince.

232
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,819
The campaign has been a long journey.

233
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,340
I will hold a feast at the Eastern Palace as a token of welcoming your return.

234
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,020
Do I have the honor to invite you?

235
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,179
I appreciate the offer, Your Highness.

236
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,379
However, I suffered much bloodshed through many battles.

237
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,259
I am still carrying wounds.

238
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,800
My presence might bother the serenity of Eastern Palace.

239
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,800
May I revisit the manor when my injuries are healed?

240
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,459
Sure.

241
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,140
I shall await your visit to the Eastern Palace.

242
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,290
[Qianlin Palace]

243
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:38,719
Brother! Brother!

244
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,739
Brother! Great news!

245
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,819
It's a shame you weren't at the court this morning.

246
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:46,319
Let me have some water first.

247
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,319
Father is putting you in charge of the three provinces...

248
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,440
in the South while the officers just watched.

249
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,019
The Crown Prince and his ilk were so shocked.

250
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,839
The South is a land of prosperity.

251
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,760
Father is giving you the land as your reward.

252
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,360
Brother! Once you have the land, you can have your troops.

253
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,079
Even if the Crown Prince got the throne, it won't be easy for him to make a move on you.

254
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,120
That is nonsense.

255
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,999
Brother. I know you have no interest in getting the throne.

256
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,959
But the victory in the South is thanks to your tactics.

257
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,719
Luckily, Fu Chou is a man of decency.

258
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:25,439
He was still humble after he got the title of General of Defense.

259
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:27,199
He praised you in front of Father.

260
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,780
Then, Father gave...

261
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,340
What else did he say?

262
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,059
What else can he say?

263
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,979
You know him well enough.

264
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:39,959
He has no background in the Imperial Court.

265
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,340
But he is disciplined and cautious.

266
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,199
Thanks to you, he got a promotion of two ranks.

267
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:46,379
He is sure to support Father's decision to put you in charge.

268
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:49,220
Those officers have nothing to say about this.

269
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,400
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

270
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,320
Are you the mistress of Moon Embrace Teahouse?

271
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,679
Sir, what is the crime I am charged with?

272
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,999
What is your crime?

273
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:15,879
Prince Li was ambushed at your premise.

274
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,359
His Majesty is now furious.

275
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,119
The Ministry of Justice is investigating.

276
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,699
Anyone who is connected to the case must be brought in for questions.

277
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,759
- Take her away!
- Yes.

278
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,340
Move!

279
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,799
The princess was arrested?

280
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,239
The Ministry of Justice arrested Her Highness.

281
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:36,159
I knew it, she was out there all night because she was in trouble.

282
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,599
What do we do now?

283
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,519
Prince Li is His Majesty's favorite son.

284
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,500
We might be in deep trouble this time.

285
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,399
Brother Xiao, think of something to help the princess.

286
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:46,719
Or...

287
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,959
Or we can tell His Majesty about her true identity.

288
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:53,299
No. Revealing her identity is the last resort.

289
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:54,980
Otherwise, we will put Her Highness in greater risk.

290
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,280
What do we do then?

291
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,419
Calm down and keep watch at the manor.

292
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:03,399
I will find a way to meet the princess.

293
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:06,079
I know. If someone is here for Her Highness,

294
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,759
I will tell them she was startled by the accident.

295
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,159
She has a headache and needs to rest.

296
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,220
She can't see any guests.

297
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,580
Come in.

298
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,599
Sir Xiao, an order from the palace.

299
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,879
The empress heard about Princess Rong Le's illness.

300
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:29,899
Her Majesty will be here for a visit this afternoon.

301
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:31,519
Please, be ready for it.

302
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:33,079
Very well, you may go now.

303
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,760
Yes.

304
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,539
Oh no! What do we do now?

305
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,500
We can't possibly refuse to let Her Majesty in.

306
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,630
What do we do now?

307
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,020
This way, Princess.

308
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,459
Greetings, Princess.

309
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,539
How is Princess Rong Le?

310
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:57,599
I have been here a few times.

311
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,159
I want to thank her for helping me out that day.

312
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,119
I heard she is ill because she was frightened.

313
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,940
She can't meet any guests.

314
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,939
I was so happy when Sir Xiao let me in just now.

315
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:11,399
Princess Rong Le couldn't bear to disappoint your kindness.

316
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,139
But Her Highness is suffering from a weird sickness.

317
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:15,799
She is bedridden.

318
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,699
Even Ling Yue is infected.

319
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:20,079
I am the only one left to look after them.

320
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,419
We can't let that happen. We need a doctor now!

321
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,899
- You must not go any closer!
- Princess Rong Le!

322
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,040
- Sister?
- Your Highness.

323
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,800
Sister. Sister?

324
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,380
Your Highness?

325
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,359
Sir Xiao's incense is amazing. I was so scared just now.

326
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,000
Help! Princess Zhao Yun fainted!

327
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,100
Princess Zhao Yun!

328
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,619
I sent words to the palace.

329
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,419
Princess Zhao Yun might have been infected with the illness.

330
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:15,539
The empress is the lady of this nation.

331
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,940
She must not risk coming here.

332
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Get in!

333
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,780
Close the door!

334
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,559
Mistress, your hand is hurt.

335
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,320
I am fine.

336
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,540
What happened to Chen Yu?

337
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,480
She is ill.

338
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,519
The officers came to arrest us at dawn.

339
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,160
They said we are all suspects of the assassination.

340
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,939
But they beat Chen Yu without any reason.

341
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:53,199
They were even trying to kill everyone in the teahouse.

342
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,679
I had no choice but to stand out.

343
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,860
However, I was brought here nonetheless.

344
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,220
What happened last night after I left?

345
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,719
After you left, I was investigating the scene.

346
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:11,339
All the people in the teahouse passed out.

347
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,579
Those assassins came prepared.

348
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,519
They were targeting our teahouse for some time.

349
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,159
But don't worry about it.

350
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,859
I got everything in the teahouse settled.

351
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,919
I told Wei and the others to leave.

352
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,099
Only servants that know nothing were left behind.

353
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:27,180
The officers won't get anything from them.

354
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,260
Well done. I was too sloppy. What do we do now?

355
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,379
These killers... must have someone unknown to back them up.

356
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:39,500
They are cunning and skilled.

357
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,500
They were hired to kill Prince Li in our teahouse.

358
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,959
Who else could it be?

359
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,859
They wanted us dead because we were in their way.

360
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:04,519
When Sir Zhao was killed, I should have seen this coming.

361
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,060
I doubt the people out there are going to put us on trial.

362
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,480
This matter is more complicated than it seems.

363
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,500
They are looking for a scapegoat for the failed assassination.

364
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,339
If they do put us on trial,

365
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:22,539
if we are in danger, maybe we can tell them...

366
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:26,159
No. We cannot be compromised.

367
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,499
We might be charge with an even greater crime.

368
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:31,060
- Qi might be caught up in this.
- But your safety...

369
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,879
It doesn't matter.

370
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:35,660
I regret I couldn't be of help to my brother.

371
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,940
I don't want to cause him even more trouble.

372
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,020
Remember what I said.

373
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,939
Take them out of here.

374
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:50,620
Yes.

375
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,790
Let's go.

376
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,850
[A Clean Heart Is As White As Snow]

377
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,219
Your Majesty, this is urgent. I must come here without your summons.

378
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,240
Did something happen to the physician?

379
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,699
It's about him. The kite bears news.

380
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:16,619
Prince Li was ambushed at Moon Embrace Teahouse.

381
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,320
Long Yue and the others are nowhere to be found.

382
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,999
Anything about the princess?

383
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:25,979
They didn't send any news about her.

384
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:27,800
Everything seems normal at her manor.

385
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,599
Your Majesty need not be worried.

386
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,579
If Prince Li was in Moon Embrace Teahouse,

387
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:35,999
with Her Highness's brilliant mind, she will avoid being in contact.

388
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:37,379
Inform the kite.

389
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:40,279
Find out if Princess Rong Le is safe.

390
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:43,639
Meanwhile, find Long Yue and the others.

391
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:45,320
Yes.

392
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,500
Rong Le.

393
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,380
Move!

394
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,180
Chen Yu?

395
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,539
This is the person-in-charge of hiring assassins to kill Prince Li.

396
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,979
Be smart and sign this paper.

397
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:18,660
You don't have to suffer any pain.

398
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,359
Not even a trial?

399
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,819
You are forcing me to surrender?

400
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:23,879
This is the fact.

401
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:26,180
There is no need for a trial.

402
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,099
Fact?

403
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:30,619
Prince Li is a noble royal.

404
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,620
He is my regular customer.

405
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,179
I am but a businesswoman.

406
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:37,619
Why would I want to kill him and ruin my own business?

407
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:39,419
Why would I cut offmy source of income?

408
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,459
Because you are a spy from Wei.

409
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,779
You have no evidence, you are framing me.

410
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,360
I don't need evidence to accuse a spy from Wei.

411
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,059
You run a teahouse. That is just for your cover.

412
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:54,599
Your real objective is to bring about war to our land.

413
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:59,100
You want the Northern Lin to lose the fight before it even starts.

414
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,359
Stop! You scoundrels step on people's lives.

415
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,260
Insolent fool!

416
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,999
- Long Yue!
- Tie them up!

417
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:07,859
- Yes.
- You!

418
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,519
- Mistress!
- Beat her!

419
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,599
Let go of me!

420
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,879
- Let go of me!
- Let them go!

421
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:15,079
- Let me go!
- Beat them up!

422
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,740
Let me go, you scoundrel!

423
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,399
Still not yielding? Admit your crime!

424
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,679
Stop it!

425
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,880
Stop!

426
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,960
Isn't this the famous Miss Chen Yu?

427
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,000
Your delicate figure is only suited to play music.

428
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,459
Stop!

429
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:39,720
Let her go! Stop!

430
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,420
- Stop!
- Yield!

431
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,299
You want to save her? Admit your crime now!

432
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,879
Mistress, no.

433
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:51,180
Miss, I promise you I'll hold on.

434
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,530
I can't stand here while they are beating you!

435
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,559
Let them go!

436
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:01,280
Stop!

437
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,380
Sir Yu.

438
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,080
This concerns the life and death of Prince Li.

439
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,879
Why are you still wasting your time on them?

440
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:13,140
Understood. I will make them sign the paper now.

441
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,140
Go!

442
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,079
Your Highness! Moon Embrace is sealed off.

443
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,659
Mistress and the shopkeeper were taken by the guards!

444
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,399
What? They sure are acting fast.

445
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,180
They just couldn't wait to get a scapegoat.

446
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,999
Brother!

447
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,759
Brother! Are you not going to save them?

448
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,619
Why should I save them?

449
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,900
I thought you like...

450
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,400
You knew Moon Embrace Teahouse was connected to all of these, didn't you?

451
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,600
As for what to do next, I am sure you know.

452
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,239
Yes. The people from the teahouse confessed.

453
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,019
The interrogation was too much for them. They died.

454
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:18,579
You imbeciles!

455
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:21,800
You framed good people! You are worse than demons!

456
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,719
Mistress!

457
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,560
Mistress!

458
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,980
Wait!

459
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,359
The mistress of Moon Embrace... is actually a beauty?

460
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,600
I heard Prince Li is your regular customer.

461
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,119
What a shame.

462
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,300
He has no interest in women and wine.

463
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,519
- What a waste for your pretty face.
- Don't touch me!

464
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,960
You have quite a temper too!

465
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,659
This is the kind of lady I like.

466
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:08,739
If you die in here... that would be a shame.

467
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:11,259
- What a shame.
- Let go of me!

468
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:14,599
If Your Highness likes her, we can take her outside.

469
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,200
She can serve you before we execute her.

470
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,240
Don't you dare!

471
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,639
Yes, I do.

472
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,859
Stop!

473
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:26,100
You fiends! Stay away from her!

474
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,390
If you violate me,

475
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:31,919
one day... I will make you pay in blood!

476
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,740
Is that so?

477
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,000
This might actually be worth my time... if I make use of her now!

478
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,320
Let go of me! Let go!

479
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,239
Your Highness!

480
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,319
Who is it? Guards!

481
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:55,500
Your Highness, are you all right?

482
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,800
Wuyou?

483
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,779
The girl you are carrying... is the major suspect of the assassination attempt!

484
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:07,739
She confessed to her crime.

485
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,619
And now you are taking her away?

486
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,639
What exactly do you want?

487
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:17,379
So, the ambush last night was just part of your plan?

488
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:20,620
You can tell that to everyone if you want.

489
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,799
But I know well enough who is trying to kill me.

490
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:28,150
Wuyou! What was that supposed to mean?

491
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,140
Explain yourself!

492
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,239
This is but a small case.

493
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,040
Do they really need you for investigation?

494
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,060
My mother's dying won't protect you forever.

495
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,280
This is the last chance you will ever have.

496
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,979
If you insist on going against me, I won't show any mercy.

497
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:48,640
Wuyou!

504
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Brother!

505
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,919
You... You are carrying her again.

506
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,259
Is she all right?

507
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,799
Brother, you just openly challenged the crown prince.

508
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:36,119
You are leaving him in the prison alone?

509
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,059
Find out what happened from the ladies of Moon Embrace.

510
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,119
Supreme Court, Ministry of Justice, or His Majesty, you will explain to them.

511
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,860
Brother, you are starting to get nosy.

512
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,999
Did you fall for her?

513
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,779
- What are you saying?
- That is not nonsense.

514
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:58,439
Any woman that touches you ends up getting punched.

515
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:02,579
If you didn't fall for her, why would you hug or even carry her?

516
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,280
I wish I knew.

517
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,010
Brother, this is good news. Don't run away from it.

518
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,730
[To Bind the Sky]

519
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:30,019
- Prince Chen, just now...
- Miss Long Yue, say no more.

520
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:32,539
I will get my men to the doctor.

521
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:35,059
Then, you can explain to me what happened.

522
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:37,160
Thank you, Prince Chen.

523
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,420
Zongzheng Wuyou!

524
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,219
Zongzheng Wuyou! How dare he do that to me!

525
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,839
All of you, get out!

526
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:55,660
- Yes.
- Scram!

527
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,940
Get lost!

528
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,899
Your Highness, what happened?

529
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,759
You just came back.

530
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:12,299
Why are you so mad?

531
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,380
Get out!

532
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,539
I am the wife of the crown prince.

533
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:29,659
I must not neglect my duty. I must give you my advice.

534
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:31,779
Your Highness is the crown prince.

535
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,379
Anger harms the body.

536
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:35,259
It taints the reputation of the nation.

537
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:37,620
The crown prince?

538
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,899
Zongzheng Wuyou has no respect for me at all!

539
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,920
The throne of the crown prince...

540
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,299
would have been his if he ever tried to take it!

541
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:48,800
Crown Prince?

542
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,259
If my place in the Eastern Palace is taken,

543
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:53,780
you will no longer be a consort either!

544
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,219
Don't worry, Your Highness.

545
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:58,659
My father will muster the strength of my clan...

546
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,320
and help Your Highness in securing the throne.

547
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,760
With your family that is growing weaker by the day?

548
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,820
You are nothing in face of the whole nation of Qi!

549
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,320
Marrying a failure like you...

550
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,040
is my greatest regret!

551
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,539
If I were to marry the Princess of Qi,

552
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:21,360
Zongzheng Wuyou would be a speck of dust to me!

553
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,519
Where are Long Yue and Chen Yu?

554
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,519
You are barely out of danger yourself. Mind your own health.

555
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,899
Don't worry. Wuyu is with them.

556
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:12,880
They are safe.

557
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,720
As for your wounds...

558
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,559
It's just some scrapes.

559
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,760
I am fine.

560
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,079
I thank you for saving me today.

561
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,600
For what?

562
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,779
Do you mean... you weren't innocent?

563
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:32,420
Of course, I am innocent.

564
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,899
In order to save me, you had a fallout with the crown prince.

565
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:42,240
People might take it wrongly if word got out.

566
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,020
What they think is none of your concern.

567
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,160
But for me, you are...

568
00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:00,360
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

569
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:06,070
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

570
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,980
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

571
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:19,900
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

572
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:26,690
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

573
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:33,320
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

574
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:39,660
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

575
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:46,190
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

576
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:56,730
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

577
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:03,250
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

578
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:09,570
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

579
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:16,390
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

580
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:33,260
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

581
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:40,080
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

582
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,180
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

583
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:53,490
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

584
00:44:53,490 --> 00:45:04,660
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
