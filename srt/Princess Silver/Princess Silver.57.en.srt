00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,290
[Episode 57]

2
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,940
The three of you, come out!

3
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,520
Lin Shen?

4
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,620
Don't you think this scene... seems quite familiar?

5
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,820
But you have long forgotten.

6
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,680
What do you want?

7
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,140
Don't worry.

8
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,920
Your death is yet to come.

9
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,580
After you finished your mission,

10
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,160
I will send you to the afterlife myself.

11
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,000
Two of the traitors from our Creed are inside this house.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Bring them out here now.

13
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,819
Other than me, there is no one else here.

14
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,860
If you don't believe me, have a look inside.

15
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,960
Run!

16
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,300
Run!

17
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,180
Run!

18
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,080
Xiang Ying!

19
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,939
If we don't go now, Xiang Ying will die in vain.

20
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,580
- Xiang Ying!
- Let's go!

21
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,140
A lowlife like you is no match for me.

22
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,460
The men of the Creed have no emotions or attachment.

23
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,360
You broke this rule.

24
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,920
You brought this onto yourself.

25
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,580
Hen Xiang.

26
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,200
Don't rush to your own death.

27
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,119
You deserve a better life.

28
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,220
Wherever you will go,

29
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,320
whatever you plan to do,

30
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,260
I can be there to help you.

31
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,779
You are the only family I have in this world.

32
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:44,000
I will definitely do my best to keep you safe.

33
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,319
This time, we will go our separate ways.

34
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,740
Should fate brings us together,

35
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,820
I will be waiting for you.

36
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,300
Man'er!

37
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,860
Your Majesty, you are awake! You are awake!

38
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,099
I was so worried!

39
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:27,760
I asked desperately for Empress Dowager to get some medicine.

40
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,699
Your Majesty, she is not exactly heartless to you.

41
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,640
Why don't you just do as she says?

42
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,080
Stop risking your life.

43
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,760
Your Majesty, there was trouble at the Cold Harem.

44
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,179
What is it?

45
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,260
Princess Rong Le has gone missing.

46
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,939
Please, Your Majesty! Spare me!

47
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,380
We need to go, now!

48
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,099
So the Empress Dowager of Western Qi really is Fu Yuan.

49
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,840
My daughter!

50
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,820
- Guards!
- Yes!

51
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,140
Search this place!

52
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,740
Hide yourself and don't come out.

53
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,140
- Go!
- Sister!

54
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,020
You escaped from the Cold Harem once again.

55
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,660
So, you are the mastermind that staged everything.

56
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,139
With your brilliant mind,

57
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,340
you should have seen this coming.

58
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,019
I sent you to Northern Lin...

59
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,840
as a pawn to alienate the twin brothers.

60
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,720
Just as I expected, they are madly in love with you.

61
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,300
Well done, you didn't disappoint.

62
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,700
We need to be cautious.

63
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,539
There is someone else here.

64
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,720
- Keep searching.
- Yes!

65
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,060
What is going on?

66
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,039
The two traitors of the Creed sneaked into the Cold Harem.

67
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,780
Xiang Ying has already been taken care of.

68
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,700
Hen Xiang rescued this girl.

69
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,840
I bet Hen Xiang is still here with her.

70
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,240
Where is Hen Xiang right now?

71
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,840
She left the palace.

72
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,459
Her daughter is still in my hand.

73
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,959
Why would she leave?

74
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,140
Where is my son?

75
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,980
Send her back to the Cold Harem and keep watch on her.

76
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,719
If anything goes wrong there before noon tomorrow,

77
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,539
all of you will lose your heads.

78
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:24,120
Yes.

79
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,440
Let go of me!

80
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,820
I can walk on my own.

81
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,819
Why did you bring me here? What do you want?

82
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,980
I just saved you.

83
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,539
If I were to hurt you,

84
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,980
you would have died by Lin Shen's blade.

85
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,740
I know who you really are.

86
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,340
You are the daughter of Qin Yong, Qin Xiang.

87
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,380
You are Rong Le's sister.

88
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,980
I know you are worried for her,

89
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,939
I have a plan to save her.

90
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,640
But I need you to cooperate with me.

91
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,439
Why should I trust you?

92
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:34,360
It was you who took my sister and her son.

93
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,180
You can stick that blade into me now.

94
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,820
But Rong Le will surely get killed.

95
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,079
- Who is it?
- Stop right there!

96
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,640
Stop!

97
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,440
Come.

98
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,300
- Man'er?
- Do not come any closer.

99
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,680
Put that away.

100
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,199
I won't hurt you.

101
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,340
Enough of your pretending.

102
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,040
I know it all.

103
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,200
Your mother... is that cursed Fu Yuan.

104
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,780
You are the child she gave birth to.

105
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,520
Man'er, you remember it now?

106
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,060
- So... do you remember we once...
- All I want to know now...

107
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,440
is whether I was poisoned because of you.

108
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,400
Or was it... your mother's plan all along?

109
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,180
Were you forced to do her bidding?

110
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,780
You were poisoned...

111
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,500
because of me.

112
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,440
I have a bad memory.

113
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,360
I always thought you were only forced into being her pawn...

114
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,760
and you had your own reasons.

115
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,559
But somehow, I may have kept my guard against you,

116
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,040
there is always a voice telling me that you would never hurt me.

117
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,580
But in the end,

118
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,720
it only made me hate you even more.

119
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,580
I did what I did...

120
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,380
because I had...

121
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,180
I had my own motives.

122
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,320
Your motives... are to use my son and Hen Xiang's daughter...

123
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
as leverage against Fu Chou and Wuyou.

124
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,020
You want to take over the whole of Northern Lin...

125
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,720
and realize your ambition of unifying the whole land.

126
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,020
Yes!

127
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,820
All emperors have the ambition to conquer the world!

128
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,080
But...

129
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,320
I don't regret my actions.

130
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,060
If I were to be given another chance,

131
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,680
I would still do the same.

132
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,580
If I had another chance,

133
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,380
I would wish I'd never been to Northern Lin and met Wuyou.

134
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,980
I wish I had never met you either.

135
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,220
Man'er?

136
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,080
Man'er? Man'er?

137
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,979
Man'er, stay still.

138
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,640
The poison inside of you is acting up again.

139
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,040
It seems like I will be the winner.

140
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,419
In this little game of power we are having,

141
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,400
I am destined to be the victor.

142
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,019
What do you think about my last move?

143
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:28,420
Isn't it spectacular?

144
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,060
Your precious son will be here soon.

145
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,539
Have a guess. Is he here to save you...

146
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:42,180
or is he here for his wife and son?

147
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,119
Right. The other man that comes with him...

148
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,720
is my beloved Fu Chou.

149
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,760
I forgot to mention.

150
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,519
The truth is, Chou was never my son to begin with.

151
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,420
Back then,

152
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,280
the child I gave birth to after being violated by Rong Yi...

153
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,420
was safely taken to Western Qi as soon as he was born.

154
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,400
As for Chou,

155
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,120
do you still remember...

156
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,160
your son with Lady Yun that was deceased?

157
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,559
That day, I ordered Lin Shen to get an infant's corpse...

158
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,940
and swap it with your son while Yun was unaware of it.

159
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,519
I raised that boy by my side.

160
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,079
Right under your nose, I shaped him into your enemy.

161
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,740
I gave him the name Fu Chou.

162
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,420
Isn't this hard to believe?

163
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,959
You once came to the Cold Harem to check the birthmark on his arm.

164
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,480
But I came prepared and fooled you.

165
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,940
Are you all right?

166
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,380
I will kill him right away!

167
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,479
Even until now, you still can't bear to kill him?

168
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,800
Because of you,

169
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,120
I was willing to become a eunuch.

170
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,160
I gave up on my pride...

171
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,400
and single-handedly... laced the Shilixiang Wine...

172
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,719
Qin Yong sent to the emperor with the Scorpion Toxin.

173
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:53,579
From that moment on, my heart... has been all yours.

174
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,520
But him?

175
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,800
He used you.

176
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
He tortured you.

177
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,780
Even now, you still can't have the resolve to kill him.

178
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,060
Of course, I would rather have him dead right now,

179
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,500
but he deserves an end much worse than a swift death.

180
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,680
You have done so much for me, after our plan unfolds tomorrow,

181
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,460
you will earn the reward you are due.

182
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,020
Our plan for tomorrow... must go on without error.

183
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,400
Send more men to keep watch on Qi as well.

184
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,120
He tried everything just to save that girl.

185
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,000
I just checked.

186
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,720
There is nothing unusual in his room.

187
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,000
Send out the words now.

188
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,539
Tell the world I will be waiting for Fu Chou and Wuyou to rescue their loves.

189
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,299
You... wicked woman and scoundrel!

190
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:12,479
Curse you! Curse you!

191
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:14,100
Wait!

192
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,740
We still have use for him.

193
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,620
You can go now.

194
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,019
Your Highness, the Hidden Ones have confirmed.

195
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,419
Consort Rong Le is being imprisoned inside the Cold Harem.

196
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,759
That place is heavily guarded.

197
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,199
The men from the Creed are there, too.

198
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,439
- The Creed of Vengeance?
- Yes, they are there.

199
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:46,859
The Creed has risen up again, they must be planning something.

200
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,080
Your Highness, please be cautious.

201
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,370
At midnight, I will infiltrate the palace.

202
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,110
The rest of you, stay put outside the palace.

203
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,079
Bad news! I just saw the billboard of the royal palace.

204
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,979
At midnight, Empress Dowager is going to execute...

205
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:06,180
Princess Rong Le at the Qide Gate.

206
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,080
Man'er.

207
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,160
Your love... and hate...

208
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,840
are always so resolute.

209
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,800
When you love someone,

210
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,099
you give up your life... and die for him.

211
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,080
When you hate someone,

212
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,000
you would be heartless... and spare no mercy.

213
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,320
If that is what you think, you should be letting me go...

214
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,980
so I won't hate you even more.

215
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,980
It was my destiny... that when you came into my life,

216
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,920
you gave my life an actual purpose.

217
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,600
But in the end... fate can be so cruel to me.

218
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,800
It gave me a chance... to meet you,

219
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,360
fall in love with you,

220
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,320
but I could never be with you.

221
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,220
What are you talking about?

222
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,980
I don't understand at all.

223
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
You don't need to.

224
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,259
I only hope for you to be well.

225
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,340
That is all I ask.

226
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,320
No plan is perfect.

227
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,080
Life is fragile to begin with.

228
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,500
That's what makes it so precious.

229
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,700
I want you to live well.

230
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,500
You must remember what I told you.

231
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,740
Don't put yourself through hardship...

232
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,620
or any suffering.

233
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,700
Live on happily ever after.

234
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,940
What is this all about?

235
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,360
What do you want with me?

236
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,900
Man'er.

237
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,780
Get some sleep if you are weary.

238
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,540
Once you are awake, everything will be over.

239
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,680
I made this decision,

240
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,360
I am ready to endure anything.

241
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:15,259
From the moment... I decided to send you to Northern Lin,

242
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,080
I was ready for what came next.

243
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,500
If...

244
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,520
I can't be the one to make you happy,

245
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,220
I might as well grant you the happiness you deserve.

246
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,499
Never forgive me for this.

247
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:41,820
Hate me with all you have.

248
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,820
Only when the person you hate is gone...

249
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,140
will you not mourn in sorrow.

250
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,340
As of now,

251
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,580
my wish came true.

252
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,260
I am willing to carry your hate and love...

253
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,050
as I leave this world.

254
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,960
♫ I'm the one who made you leave me ♫

255
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,420
♫ It's the ultimate goal that I'm trying to achieve ♫

256
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:29,759
♫ When the cloud and the rain hear about your life ♫

257
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,470
♫ Even they will stop and wait for you ♫

258
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Your Majesty, everything is ready.

259
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
I am ready as well.

260
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,900
Are you certain about this?

261
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Let's start.

262
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
Yes.

263
00:23:53,430 --> 00:24:01,000
♫ So, I fearlessly face the wind and the rain ♫

264
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
♫ Like a stubborn person playing chess, I must make my one last move ♫

265
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
♫ I promise you that I'll stop after everything is done ♫

266
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
♫ If you are willing to believe in this world again ♫

267
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,300
♫ Please remember that... ♫

268
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,000
♫ I once loved you ♫

269
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
There is no one inside. She is not in the Cold Harem.

270
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This could be a trap.

271
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
Brother, I will cover you. Go!

272
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
You must find our father and Rong Le.

273
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
Agent Wu, we will split up.

274
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,700
You know this place well.

275
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,800
I will search the area ahead.

276
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,510
[Yongyang Palace]

277
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Western Qi still has three thousand Royal Guards and over a hundred thousand soldiers.

278
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,000
They are going to execute Man Yao.

279
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
They must have known we are coming.

280
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Why isn't anyone here?

281
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,200
The two of you are finally here.

282
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,700
Qi and I have been waiting for quite a while.

283
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,400
I wonder if the scenery of this land...

284
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,600
is good enough for the two of you.

285
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,000
So, you really are the Empress Dowager of Western Qi.

286
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,300
Chou'er, I haven't seen you in some time.

287
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,800
Don't you have the slightest interest in what I've been through recently?

288
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,400
We are only interested in your death!

289
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,600
If you plan to let them die,

290
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,200
come on and slay me.

291
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Emperor of Western Qi!

292
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,200
How could you be so cruel to your sister!

293
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,700
Chou'er,

294
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,200
they are Zongzheng Wuyou's father and lover.

295
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,000
Why are you coming here so anxiously?

296
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,700
Even now, you are still trying to fool me.

297
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,600
You may have raised me,

298
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,700
but you murdered my parent and set me against my own brother.

299
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,900
You tricked me into believing you were my mother.

300
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,800
And now you are holding my father hostage.

301
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,400
I shall sever all ties with you once and for all.

302
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,400
I know you reconciled as brothers.

303
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,200
But I am surprised that you have grown so close.

304
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,500
I might as well... give you another opportunity.

305
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
A chance to save a life.

306
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,300
What do you want?

307
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,800
The same thing I have always wanted.

308
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,600
I want the two of you to have a deathmatch.

309
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,800
I will hand over Rong Le and your father to whoever survives.

310
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,000
Both of you have great skills in martial arts.

311
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,200
I am curious.

312
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,600
Which of you will come up on top.

313
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,800
After all the scheming, you have only one motive.

314
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,400
You want our father to watch as his sons kill each other.

315
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,900
Correct.

316
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,300
How about it?

317
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,000
Isn't this game rather intriguing?

318
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,600
Yunhe, who do you think will be the victor?

319
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Who will be bested by the other?

320
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Fu Yuan.

321
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,200
If Man Yao and my father die here,

322
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,700
I swear in the name of Heaven,

323
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,000
all of you will be the tributes for their funeral!

324
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I was waiting for you to be here,

325
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,400
naturally, life and death don't matter to me now.

326
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,300
Have you made up your mind?

327
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:53,100
I don't have time to wait for your deliberations.

328
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,400
Wuchou.

329
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,500
Draw your blade.

330
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,100
Fine.

331
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,200
This is inevitable.

332
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,800
I was wondering which of us would be the winner.

333
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,500
Father?

334
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,900
Father?

335
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,000
Well, you are twin brothers after all.

336
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,800
You coordinated with each other's moves flawlessly.

337
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,100
My Princes, wipe those smirks from your faces.

338
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,000
The show is just starting.

339
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,300
My child!

340
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,100
My child! Give me back my child!

341
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,200
If you hand my child over,

342
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,800
I am willing to do anything!

343
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,200
This is a beautiful child.

344
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
Such a shame.

345
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Fu Chou,

346
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,600
stop staring at your brother's child.

347
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,700
Look at her.

348
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,800
She is your daughter.

349
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,200
Hen Xiang gave birth to her...

350
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,100
and hid her away to keep it a secret from you.

351
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,800
Isn't that right, Hen Xiang?

352
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,200
I was the one who taught you the mastery of disguise.

353
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Do you think your trick can fool me?

354
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
Hen Xiang?

355
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Qi, you are rather quiet today.

356
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,000
Did you swap them right under my nose again?

357
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,200
Your Majesty, calm down.

358
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,900
The emperor has been ill.

359
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,200
He was holding off the pain just to be here.

360
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
He had been coughing before Your Majesty arrived.

361
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,800
The emperor lost his voice from the coughing.

362
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,700
Please, forgive His Majesty's manner.

363
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,400
Fu Yuan!

364
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,200
Let go of the child.

365
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
I will trade my life for them!

366
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,800
Come up here.

367
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,800
Hen Xiang?

368
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,900
Hen Xiang!

369
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,800
Did you think I would fall for your trick again?

370
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,600
Take a closer look.

371
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,400
That is your sister's child.

372
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,300
If you push your sister's son into the fire,

373
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,500
I will give you back your daughter.

374
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
Stop!

375
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,500
Hen Xiang, stop right there.

376
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,600
Hen Xiang, listen to me.

377
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,900
Fu Chou, look at your daughter.

378
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,400
Her name is Nian.

379
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
She is a year old.

380
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,500
Hen Xiang, if you kill their son,

381
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,200
I can be sure to tell you I will never forgive you!

382
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,600
I am warning you, Hen Xiang!

383
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,800
Lay down that dagger.

384
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,100
Chou'er, you do share the same trait as your father.

385
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,600
You are just as cruel as he is.

386
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,100
Qi'er, did you see that?

387
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,200
In the face of desperate choices,

388
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,700
everyone can be selfish and despicable.

389
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,800
Only you would rather betray your mother

390
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,600
and aid these outsiders!

391
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,600
Why aren't you saying anything?

392
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,200
Are you trying to defy me again?

393
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,500
Qi'er?

394
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,700
Qi'er? Qi'er?

395
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,200
Say something to me!

396
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,600
I won't force you to do anything.

397
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,400
You can talk to me.

398
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,400
Say something to me. Please!

399
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,700
Say something!

if the writings on this paper are actually yours?

415
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
You liked my handwriting.

416
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,600
You often tried to copy me.

417

Your handwriting is getting better.

418
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,800
This is the jade pendant I have been carrying since a child.

Carry it with you.

It will protect you...

This is for you.

Princess Rong Le.

438
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,800
Princess Rong Le, you are finally awake.

439
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,900
Ke'er, how long have I been asleep?

440
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,800
Just a while, about an hour or so.

441
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,400
Brother Qi, where is he now?

442
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,600
I mean the emperor.

443
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,700
Ke'er, tell me.

444
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,700
Why does this medicine... have the stench of blood?

445
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,900
Answer me. Answer me!

446
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,800
Princess Rong Le, stop asking me.

447
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,400
All you need to know... is that you have been cured of the poison.

448
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,300
How did it happen?

449
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,000
You told me there was only one way to cure this.

450
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,200
You said I have to transfuse the poison to my child during labor.

451
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,800
Was there any other way?

452
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,300
You found another tome?

453
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,800
What is this? What is going on?

454
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,000
Tell me, Ke'er! Tell me what happened!

455
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,600
Please, Princess Rong Le. I can't tell you.

456
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,800
Princess Rong Le, where are you going?

457
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,700
Princess Rong Le!

458
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,200
Fine, Princess Rong Le, I will tell you.

459
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Fu Yuan was once tormented by the "Destined Poison."

460
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
In order to survive,

461
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,400
she transfused the poison to her newborn son.

462
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,600
That is why His Majesty had always been ill since a young age.

463
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,000
He could only prolong his life with medicine every month.

464
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,800
This is why his blood contains the antidote that can extend your life.

465
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,600
My master recorded another way to remove

466
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,400
the poison in another tome:

467
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,400
blood for blood,

468
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,800
a life for a life.
