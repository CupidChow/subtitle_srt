00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,600
[Episode 47]

2
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Sir Sun, why do you think I will agree?

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,400
We have known each other for many years.

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,000
I think that I had been of help to you.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You became a well-known general for your contribution to the southern border.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
With the Sun family's support, you'll rise to be the master of this country.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,300
Now, I have the secret information about the southern border's defense.

8
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,600
It can help you take down the southern border.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,300
Sir Sun, the friendship we had before this...

10
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,600
was just for our own benefits.

11
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
But now, you want to change your allegiance to me.

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,300
I have to be clear then.

13
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,600
What is the value of your loyalty?

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,100
Today, you betray the secret of the southern border to me.

15
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,100
Will you betray Northern Lin's secret

16
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,200
to Zongzheng Wuyou in the future?

17
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
Of course not.

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,000
You can even barter away your own daughter.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
And you can even betray Wuyou who was your student for so many years.

20
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,500
How am I going to trust your loyalty?

21
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Besides, you had taught Zongzheng Wuyou so many years for nothing.

22
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,100
Even I understand Zongzheng Wuyou better than you.

23
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,000
If he can share with you secret information...

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
that you talked of, then it means, they are not so secret anyway.

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,600
And your daughter will be safer off with him than with me.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,300
Guards.

27
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,400
Your Highness, this...

28
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Sir Sun, don't put up a fight. Just go.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Forgive me for not being able to see you off. Bring him away.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,900
Your Highness, have you lost your trust in me

31
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,800
because I failed the Silver-Haired Demon mission?

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Your Highness!

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,800
How dare you mention this to me.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,500
You used this lowly tactic in my name...

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,600
to put Rong Le in dire straights.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
And you even kept information from me...

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
until I almost died in Qingzhou.

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,800
Sir Sun, you have planned it out so well.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,500
Take him away and chop off his head.

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,600
Fu Chou, you promised me that...

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
you'd spare my family's life if I carried out this Silver-Haired Demon plan.

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,600
How could you break your promise, scoundrel!

43
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,000
You've always been my favorite.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,600
I remember that when I first saw you,

45
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,400
I felt that... you were quite similar to the younger me.

46
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,400
I really never thought that you,

47
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,500
Zongzheng Yunhe,

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
who is my greatest enemy and my greatest villain...

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,500
that was burned into my mind since young...

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,600
would turn out like this today, a useless man.

51
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
A useless man weighed down with age.

52
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
If I were you,

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I would have cursed myself hundreds and thousands of times.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,700
"Fu Chou, you and your ulterior motives.

55
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,200
You usurped the throne and hurt your father and brother."

56
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Or perhaps, you want to curse my mother...

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,600
for being evil and sinister.

58
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,300
After all, she had murdered your beloved one...

59
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,000
right in front of you.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,400
But if others had gone through the same as what she had,

61
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
they might have become even more...

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
sinister and scarier than her.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,600
After all, she did it to save me.

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,400
The sin that my mother had committed...

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,800
can only be borne by... this son of hers.

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,400
Now, I too have experienced...

67
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,000
the pain of losing someone you love.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
But back then,

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,400
you really shouldn't have destroyed my mother's lifetime happiness...

70
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
for the person you love.

71
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,400
Back then, if only...

72
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,200
you had some conscience as a father and husband,

73
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,800
this tragedy might not have happened.

74
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,600
Now,

75
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I feel that my mother's temperament has changed drastically.

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,000
She is too resentful in some things.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
I keep on feeling that...

78
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,000
she is doing something behind my back.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,200
West... West...

80
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
What are you trying to say?

81
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,300
What else can you say?

82
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,800
West...

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Yes, for the past year and a half,

84
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
the curses that were pointed to me and my mother...

85
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,000
were quite a handful.

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,700
West...

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know something?

88
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,100
West?

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,500
What you wrote is the word "west"?

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Chou'er.

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
Mother.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,500
Chou'er, if you want to see me,

93
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,000
you can just ask Chang Jian to inform me.

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,600
No need to come to this place by yourself.

95
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,200
This man here... will just be an eyesore to you.

96
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,100
You have to nurse your injuries in peace.

97
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Look at your legs.

98
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,800
Mother.

99
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,400
Are you in touch... with Sun Jizhou in Qingzhou?

100
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm just a woman in a palace.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
How can I be in touch with a person who is miles away?

102
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Chou'er, don't let your imagination run wild.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,900
Nurse your injuries in peace.

104
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,400
When you have recovered,

105
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,600
you can wage war against the southern border...

106
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,400
and cut Zongzheng Wuyou into pieces.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,600
But now, the snow storm has cut off the road along with the food supplies.

108
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
I think that...

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,500
it's better to go back to Zhongshan to regroup and recuperate first.

110
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,600
When I have fully recovered,

111
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
I'll take down the southern border.

112
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,100
- Chou'er.
- Mother, this is a national affair.

113
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,200
I can't discuss it with you.

114
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,400
I'll have to take my leave now.

115
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,600
Miss Sun.

116
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Don't come near me.

117
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,000
Ling Yue, finally, you are here.

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
You are here to get me out, right?

119
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Yali.

120
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,800
Yali, this must be hard on you.

121
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,100
Xiao Sha is just following orders.

122
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
Please don't blame him.

123
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,300
I'm in such a dire state right now.

124
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,500
There is no use for me... to blame anybody.

125
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't say that.

126
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,600
You are just grounded here for the moment.

127
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,500
You'll be fine then after they manage to recapture Sir Sun.

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
I don't want him to.

129
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,400
I would rather hope that he doesn't come back forever.

130
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,600
He can't come back.

131
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
By the way, here. I brought you some food.

132
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,500
Quick. Come here.

133
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,700
Eat it while it's hot.

134
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Yali, I've brought you some of my clothes.

135
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,000
I know that you had worn better clothes than these in the past.

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,100
So, please don't mind about the quality.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm not in the position to be picky now.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm already very happy that... you are here to visit me.

139
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,400
By the way, you've brought so many things with you.

140
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,300
Will Rong Le scold you if she knows about it?

141
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,400
She won't.

142
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,800
You know that she treats the servants very well.

143
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,400
Moreover, she's in a sweet cocoon with His Highness now.

144
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,700
She doesn't have time for us.

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,600
- Is that so?
- Yes.

146
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
Good then.

147
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,000
[A Jade World is Brilliant]

148
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,300
Why are you here?

149
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,400
I came here because I heard that you'd brought a huge bag with you.

150
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
I never thought that you were here to visit her.

151
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
She plotted against His Highness...

152
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,260
and destroyed His Highness and Princess's relationship.

153
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,600
She is evil.

154
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,700
You should stay away from her person like her.

155
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
Xiao Sha, she is not a person like that.

156
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,000
Besides, she is my friend.

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When she was still a noble lady, she had treated me very well.

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,100
Now, she has fallen and nobody is here to take care of her.

159
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
I can't possibly leave her alone, right?

160
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,600
Besides, for the incident last time,

161
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Yali must have done that by mistake because she was forced by her father.

162
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
- She was not like that in the past.
- No matter how she was in the past,

163
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
she has changed now.

164
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,600
For some things, if she has done it once,

165
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
she will do it again and again.

166
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,800
If you help her this time...

167
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,000
and if she wants to hurt the princess in the future, you'll become an indirect accomplice.

168
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,200
She won't do it.

169
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,600
Moreover, it's impossible that I will...

170
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Enough. I know you won't.

171
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
But she will.

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
She is Princess's enemy now.

173
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
You can't be kind to your enemy.

174
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,500
Or else, you'll be disloyal to the princess.

175
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,000
All right, I get it.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
By the way,

177
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,600
don't tell Princess that I came to visit her.

178
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Or else, she will be mad for sure.

179
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,400
Make sure that there's no next time.

180
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's go.

181
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,000
[Man Yin Chamber]

182
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,800
He killed my father.

183
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
And he destroyed my mother.

184
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,400
My hatred for him is bone deep.

185
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,800
But compared to your life,

186
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,700
it's nothing for me...

187
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,600
to owe him a favor.

188
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,000
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
It's all because of me.

191
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,200
No need to blame yourself.

192
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
This is my choice.

193
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,500
It's not your fault.

194
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,100
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

195
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,600
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

196
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,600
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

197
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,199
Princess, this Blood Raven Root is indeed very effective.

198
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Look at you now. You are as beautiful as ever and you are glowing.

199
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,100
Later, when you go to the hall for a meeting with the officials,

200
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,600
they will be in for a shock.

201
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,600
At first, I thought that...

202
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,800
it would be a happy thing if I could...

203
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,200
restore my past look one day.

204
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,400
I never thought that I'd feel like this.

205
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Princess Consort Rong Le.

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
His Highness left Qingzhou last night to go to the border.

207
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,200
Today's morning court has been canceled.

208
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,800
What?

209
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,500
Princess, walk slowly.

210
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,400
I think hatred must be burning in his veins now.

211
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
He had led his troops to the border without waiting for the snow to melt.

212
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm afraid that he's going to fight to the death with Northern Lin.

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,200
I just never thought that he would leave without telling you first.

214
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
I understand.

215
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,600
Actually, I don't dare to face him either.

216
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,800
How can I force him to face me as well?

217
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
How can His Highness be like that?

218
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,600
Princess's leg is still wounded.

219
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,500
How can he leave without a word? There are so many things here...

220
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,900
I have something else to report.

221
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,300
We received word from The Hidden Ones.

222
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,600
Sun Jizhou has been murdered by the people of Northern Lin.

223
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,200
Yali has been staying in her manor recently.

224
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I wonder how she is.

225
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't tell Yali about this first...

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
in case she lets her imagination run wild.

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Princess, I think...

228
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,600
it's better if you forget about Miss Sun.

229
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
What is it?

230
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,600
You are very close with her.

231
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,400
You haven't gon to visit her recently?

232
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,700
No.

233
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,100
I didn't go to visit her. Xiao Sha...

234
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,300
Xiao Sha has forbidden me to do so.

235
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,600
By the way, Princess,

236
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,300
Miss Sun's maidservant, Chun Ni...

237
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,400
has requested to see you.

238
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Chun Ni?

239
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Then something might have happened to Yali.

240
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,000
Xiao Sha, bring Chun Ni here. Let me ask her.

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
Yes, Princess.

242
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,400
- Leng Yan!
- Here!

243
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,000
Order the troops to set out now!

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,700
We have to reach the borderand set up our camp before sunset!

245
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,300
Yes, Your Highness.

246
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
March forward!

247
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Greetings, Princess Consort Rong Le.

248
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
Chun Ni,

249
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,400
Ling Yue said that you wanted to see me.

250
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,000
What is it?

251
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
Please accept me under your wings...

252
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
and let me serve you.

253
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,800
Why?

254
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
I remember that when the Sun Manor was confiscated,

255
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,600
you were the only one...

256
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,400
who was willing to stay by Yali's side to serve her.

257
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,300
Why would you leave her now?

258
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't want to be a person who will leave a fallen mistress, either.

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
But...

260
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,000
Miss Sun hits you?

261
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Ever since Miss Sun is grounded in her manor,

262
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,700
it's like she has changed into another person.

263
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,800
Now, she always hits me without any reason.

264
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
She thinks too much.

265
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,100
She can't forget her past humiliation.

266
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
But still, she shouldn't hit you.

267
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
I don't blame her.

268
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,800
I think... it might be because I've seen her go through everything.

269
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,600
As long as I'm by her side, I'll be a thorn that reminds her of the past.

270
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
If I leave Miss Sun,

271
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,600
maybe she will get better.

272
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,800
Princess Consort Rong Le, please help me out...

273
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,000
and let me serve you.

274
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,600
- Get up first.
- Princess Consort Rong Le.

275
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,500
Why don't you allow her to leave the manor so that she can choose her own life?

276
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,800
I don't wish to leave the manor.

277
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
I was abandoned by my parents since young.

278
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
I have no one to rely on.

279
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,800
Luckily, Miss Sun was willing to keep me.

280
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,400
Now, I don't even have a family member that I can rely on.

281
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,900
I know that... Miss Sun has done you wrong.

282
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm willing to serve you with all my heart...

283
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
to atone for Miss Sun's sins.

284
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,300
- Please, Princess.
- Get up first.

285
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,400
Chun Ni, get up first.

286
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,800
Her Highness has agreed.

287
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,700
Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness.

288
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,400
Xiao Sha, bring Chun Ni to Ke'er so that Ke'er can treat her wounds.

289
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,000
After that, ask her to go to the side palace to take a look at Yali.

290
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,900
Yes, Your Highness.

291
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Princess, slowly.

292
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,500
You have always been close to Yali.

293
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,800
But because of me, you haven't gone to visit her recently.

294
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,500
If it wasn't for Chun Ni,

295
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm afraid that we wouldn't know about Yali's condition.

296
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,500
Please punish me, Princess.

297
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,800
Actually, after Miss Sun was grounded in this manor,

298
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,400
I had gone to visit her a couple of times in secret.

299
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,000
And I too found out that something was wrong with her.

300
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,400
But after that, Xiao Sha... told me not to visit her anymore.

301
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,300
After I thought about it, I was afraid that she'd harm you.

302
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,900
So, I didn't tell you about it.

303
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Slowly, Princess.

304
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Now, Sun Jizhou is dead...

305
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,600
and Chun Ni has left her.

306
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,200
Yali is all alone now.

307
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,700
From what Chun Ni had described, something is wrong with Yali.

308
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,000
Why don't you come with me while I visit her?

309
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,300
All right.

310
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,800
Princess, walk slowly.

311
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
You've scared me.

312
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Don't come near me.

313
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You are indeed sick.

314
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
You are pale.

315
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
Your breathing labored,

316
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,200
low vital energy, and are delirious.

317
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Have you been having delusions lately?

318
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Do you feel that somebody wants to hit you, scold you, or even kill you?

319
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,200
No.

320
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Nobody is here to kill me. Nobody is here to kill me.

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Princess Rong Le.

322
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,000
What is wrong with her?

323
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,200
This is a mental disease.

324
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,400
But luckily, her symptoms show that she's in the first stage.

325
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,800
She'll be fine after some medication.

326
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
I don't want to take any medication.

327
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm not sick. You are sick.

328
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,700
Who knows that you won't poison my medicine.

329
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,859
Don't come here. Don't come near me.

330
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:24,980
Demon. You are a demon!

331
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,100
You can just go and seduce all those men. Don't come here.

332
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,860
Don't come over here.

333
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,300
She has silver hair. This black hair is just a delusion.

334
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,119
That's right. It's just a delusion. All of them are just delusions.

335
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,880
All of them are just delusions.

336
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,060
Princess, I think... Miss Sun has really gone crazy.

337
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,859
Ling Yue.

338
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,719
You are here, Ling Yue.

339
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,080
Finally, you are here, Ling Yue. That's great.

340
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,539
That's not right.

341
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,180
You can't be with her. She's a demon.

342
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,119
If you are with her, you'll get hurt. Do you know that?

343
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,239
You can't be with her.

344
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,040
Yali.

345
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,800
Yali.

346
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,739
Princess, Miss Sun has really gone crazy. Let's leave at once.

347
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:32,820
Ling Yue, are you going to leave me, too?

348
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,459
My father has escaped alone.

349
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:36,919
And I don't know where Chun Ni went.

350
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,919
Now, are you going to abandon me as well?

351
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
Or is it that... since the very beginning,

352
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,799
you were sent here to spy on me?

353
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,820
Yali!

354
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,560
Don't come near me, all of you!

355
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,979
Princess Rong Le, you'll only upset her further if you are here.

356
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,880
How about we go back first? I'll give her some medication.

357
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,240
She'll be better after she takes it.

358
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,670
[A Jade World is Brilliant]

359
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,820
Let me out! Let me out!

360
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,580
Let me out.

361
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,780
Greetings, Princess Consort Rong Le.

362
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,120
Uncle, please have a seat.

363
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,899
Recently, His Highness has sent us some urgent letters...

364
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:18,979
to ask for backup troops.

365
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:22,640
But you've been absent from the morning court for the reason of being sick.

366
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,379
You wouldn't send forward any backup troops.

367
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:27,020
May I know the reason?

368
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,099
Do you think... this is the best time to go into war with Northern Lin?

369
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,939
I had been pondering about it for the past few days.

370
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:40,660
But I didn't manage to get an answer for it.

371
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,839
Based on reason, we have rested for more than one year...

372
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,739
because we wanted to wait for the best chance...

373
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,979
to achieve the greatest victory with the lowest cost.

374
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:52,420
But it is really risky to march...

375
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,880
our troops to them so recklessly now.

376
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,080
But based on emotion...

377
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,420
Based on emotion,

378
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,699
all of us can understand Wuyou's actions.

379
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:05,099
Fu Chou had killed his father and stolen the country.

380
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,000
Now, even Wuyou's mother is...

381
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,019
Such bone deep hatred.

382
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,580
Even I want to kill Fu Chou for revenge.

383
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,320
Let alone Wuyou who is their son.

384
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,459
When the late emperor was in dire straits,

385
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:20,140
I had to leave the camp to find help.

386
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,120
That had resulted in the death of the late emperor.

387
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,539
Until now, I still have a nightmare about him every night...

388
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,520
where he is covered in blood.

389
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,900
Such keenly felt pain...

390
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,220
is what I share with Wuyou.

391
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,499
If it wasn't because I'm too old and weak,

392
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,720
I'd definitely join the battle.

393
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,000
I want to kill Fu Chou with my own hands.

394
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,540
But I don't dare to let him take that risk.

395
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,900
You just know that it'll be a slim victory if we wage war in haste...

396
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,920
while the snow has cut off the road along with the food supplies.

397
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,040
But you don't know that... we have a bigger issue here.

398
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,419
Only me and Wuyou know about it.

399
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,300
If I tell you about it,

400
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,179
I beg you not to disclose this secret to others.

401
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,300
What issue is it? Tell me now.

402
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,879
You may leave first.

403
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,520
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,500
After the earthquake in Zhuo, together with the spreading of the plague,

405
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,480
a lot of the army's fine horses died.

406
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,419
We are left with less than a third compared to the original numbers.

407
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:45,439
General Luo Zhi had won those battles at the border by bluff and bluster only.

408
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,059
They don't dare to attack.

409
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,199
And that's because they lack horses.

410
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:52,399
So, with the numbers we have now,

411
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,660
even if we can win by chance,

412
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,020
we can't drive straight into the core of Zhongshan to defeat them.

413
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,180
We can only fight with them at the border of Northern Lin and...

414
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,820
wasting the strength of the country and the army that didn't come by easy.

415
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,160
This is what you are worried about?

416
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,200
That's right.

417
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,840
I had tossed and turned, pondering about this issue.

418
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,800
Because I can't discuss this secret with our fellow officials...

419
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,499
and at the same time, I'm in bitter regret that because of me,

420
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,920
Wuyou lost his parents and abandoned the country.

421
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,579
You don't have an answer to whether or not we should go into battle.

422
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:31,580
And I am tortured by it as well.

423
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,460
But I'm clear about one thing.

424
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,460
I can't let Wuyou get hurt...

425
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,560
and I can't let the people of the southern border get hurt.

426
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,280
I understand what is in your thoughts now.

427
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,179
To make a decision that can affect the country,

428
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:50,140
it's indeed too much of a burden for you to carry by yourself.

429
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,060
Don't worry. I'll help you reassure and deal with the officials in the court.

430
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,180
Thank you, Uncle.

431
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,860
But you need to be clear.

432
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,659
The officials obey you...

433
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,000
because of Wuyou's determination to have turned gray for you.

434
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,300
If you keep on delaying the decision to send backup...

435
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,459
and leave Wuyou alone at the front line,

436
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,980
I think there will be an uproar in the court.

437
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,140
I have already wrote a letter for Wuyou.

438
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,620
I believe that he will make the best decision.

439
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,040
Since you already have a plan, I don't have to worry for now.

440
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,859
If you face any difficulties in the court,

441
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:29,400
you can come to me.

442
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,899
Thank you, Uncle.

443
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,480
Farewell.

444

445
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,620
Princess Consort Rong Le.

446
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,539
Go to the border and give this letter to Wuyou.

447
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,780
This is a very important letter. Keep it by your side always.

448
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,900
You have to personally give it to Wuyou himself.

449
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,100
Tell him that I'll wait for his decision.

450
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,100
Don't worry, Princess Consort Rong Le. I'll depart at once.

Xiao Sha!

452
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,320
Why are you here?

453
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,160
You are going to the border just like this?

454
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,460
Don't you knowthat it's cold up north?

455
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,260
Can't you wear more clothes?

456
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,940
Take it.

457
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,080
You always forget to take care of yourself when you are busy.

458
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,860
Are you a little bit angry at me?

459
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,539
Actually, I'm going there on Princess's order.

460
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,819
It's not dangerous. Wait for my return.

461
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:36,419
- I'll spend my time with you then.
- Look at you. All words no action.

462
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,960
You said that you'd accompany me but how many times have you done that?

463
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,659
At any rate, for you,

464
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:44,379
Princess has always been more important than me.

465
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:46,700
Are you jealous?

466
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,459
Princess and we depend on each other. We are one.

467
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:54,120
For me, you are as important as her.

468
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,260
When I come back this time,

469
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,780
I'll ask Princess to let me marry you.

470
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,420
When the time comes, if you don't want to stay in the manor,

471
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,260
I'll beg Princess to free us.

472
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,440
She won't stop us for sure.

473
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,140
From now on, no matter where you want to go,

474
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,200
I'll go with you.

475
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,900
Enough.

476
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,779
It's late already.

477
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:25,679
Go now. Be careful on the road. Come back earlier.

478
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,020
All right. I'll leave now.

481
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,760
Don't go.

What is it, Princess?

485
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,000
Are you having a nightmare again?

486
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,140
I'm fine now.

487
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,379
Ever since His Highness left,

488
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,579
you haven't been sleeping well.

489
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,920
Maybe you've gotten used to His Highness sleeping by your side.

490
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,820
How about I keep watch tonight...

491
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,820
and sit by your bed to serve you?

492
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,460
It's fine.

493
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,659
You have been taking care of my leg wound for the past few days.

494
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,360
You must be exhausted.

495
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,660
Your Highness, you have taken me in.

496
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,539
It's like you have saved my life.

497
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,099
I'm grateful for you but I don't have a way to repay you.

498
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:02,899
Please agree to let mekeep watch for you at night.

499
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,460
Let me repay you.

500
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,179
I'll have to trouble you then.

501
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:12,660
I'll go and get ready then.

502
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,320
Tomorrow night, I'll come here to keep watch for you.

503
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,460
Princess, I don't have to worry then.

504
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,160
I'll take my leave now.

505
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880
Wuyou.

506
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,720
Will you agree with my decision...

507
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,680
after you get my letter?

508
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,780
[Lin Entrance]

509
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,659
Your Highness, we received 20 emergency letters from the front line.

510
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,259
Please lead a troop forward to back them up.

511
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,619
Prince Li's troops are already stationed at Tong Pass.

512
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,040
He might attack anytime now.

513
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,600
Chang Jian, pass down my order.

514
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,739
No matter how Zongzheng Wuyou provokes us with his troops,

515
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,820
we will stay inside this stronghold and put up our defense.

516
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,840
We have enough arrows, sand and boulders to defend the city.

517
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,540
If Zongzheng Wuyou attacks us,

518
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,380
our soldiers on the front lines...

519
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,320
will fight to their last breath to protect the city.

520
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,699
Five days.

521
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,319
We just need to hold it for five days.

522
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:48,220
I believe that he will retreat.

523
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,820
Arrival of Her Majesty.

524
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,299
Chou'er! You have already recovered.

525
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:57,059
Why are you still delaying your time for the past few days?

526
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:59,799
Now, Zongzheng Wuyou is wobbly on his feet.

527
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:01,779
And his backup is not here yet.

528
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:03,999
As long as our troops reach him first...

529
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,499
and attack him, we can kill him easily.

530
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:08,219
I already told you.

531
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:12,640
I have my own plans regarding the military and political affairs.

532
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,000
Moreover, I didn't say that I wouldn't attack them.

533
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,419
I'm just waiting for the best time to do so.

534
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:24,579
As for when the best time to do it is, there's no need for you to know.

535
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:26,740
You just need to know one thing.

536
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,340
As long as Zongzheng Wuyou makes the first move, he will lose for sure.

537
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,420
Are you going to... keep your plan a secret from me, too?

538
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,819
I'm not trying to keep it a secret.

539
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:45,660
I just don't want to lose again.

540
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,539
Zongzheng Wuyou has marched here out of anger.

541
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,560
It's rare that he'd be so rash.

542
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,959
When he has exhausted himself and his soldiers are weak,

543
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:57,280
we can return fire... and destroy them once and for all.

544
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,939
This is the best strategy to defeat him.

545
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:02,219
Please don't meddle with my plan.

546
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:05,679
I feel that Zongzheng Wuyou's rashness out of anger...

547
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,240
is better than you being indecisive.

548
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,199
If you are still so indecisive,

549
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,679
I think I can only wait in Senyan Palace...

550
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,360
until Zongzheng Wuyou comes and kills me face to face!

551
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,380
Your Highness, now, what should we do?

552
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,500
I'll decide again after five days.

553
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,040
Yes, Your Highness.

554
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,219
Tong Pass is a strategic location with difficult access.

555
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,140
It's easy to defend and hard to be attacked.

556
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,019
If we attack them first, our chance for victory is slim.

557
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:44,799
And as soon as the battle starts, we need at least half a month to take it down.

558
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,139
The snow has cut off the road.

559
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,360
And it's difficult for Qingzhou to supply food to us.

560
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,940
With the food supplies that we have now,

561
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,400
it's enough for five days only at most.

562
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,780
We have conserved our strength for more than one year...

563
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,460
just to prepare for this battle with Northern Lin.

564
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,580
Although it's risky to attack,

565
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm not doing it all because I'm swayed by my feelings.

566
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,579
Fu Chou has gone back to Zhongshan because he is hurt.

567
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:19,300
It looks like their numbers are increasing day by day in Tong Pass,

568
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,820
but actually, it's just bluff and bluster.

569
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,620
From the news we gathered,

570
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,220
our enemy is in the same situation as us.

571
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,620
Their supplies are cut off, too.

572
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,299
If that's the case, speed is paramount in war.

573
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:31,859
We attack them while Fu Chou is not here...

574
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,099
and while they are still unprepared.

575
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,179
We might be able to take down Tong Pass in five days' time.

576
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:39,499
We have conserved our strength for quite a while.

577
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:42,920
If we press on without letup, we might not lose.

578
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,699
Wuyou, an army with a grievance is bound to prevail.

579
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,860
No matter if it's public or personal, as officials or as sons,

580
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,920
we have to battle them.

581
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,980
But this battle is too risky.

582
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,060
If we want to go into battle, it's better for us to wait for backup.

583
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,800
Your Highness, a secret letter from Her Highness.

584
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,919
Wuyou, what did Man Yao say?

585
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,380
Please leave us first.

586
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,220
I need to discuss something with Agent Wu.

587
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,220
Yes, Wuyou.

588
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,530
Is Consort Rong Le against this battle as well?

589
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,140
Just now, you had opposed to us drawing swords first.

590
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,060
Although I don't think that we will lose for sure.

591
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,640
But you are still opposed to the idea, right?

592
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,779
Because I know that although we might not lose,

593
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:09,040
our chance of victory is slim.

594
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,959
Wuyou, you and Consort Rong Le don't wish to drag...

595
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,779
the people of Qingzhou into a long-lasting war either.

596
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:19,900
But my heart is in constant turmoil, tortured by regret and hatred.

597
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,500
For the past year, Wuyu had advised me again and again...

598
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,740
to wage war against Northern Lin to take revenge on Fu Chou.

599
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,400
But I had stopped him every time.

600
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,900
But in my heart, I know that...

601
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,080
from the moment my mother's remains were destroyed,

602
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,680
I could no longer convince myself with those words...

603
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,899
that I used to convince him back then.

604
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:42,760
For your teacher's case back then,

605
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
when I luckily escaped,

606
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,619
while my whole family was exterminated,

607
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:50,480
I, too, wanted to kill off all of them regardless of the cost.

608
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,680
But in the end, I forced myself to stop.

609
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,920
If I had acted recklessly and given away my life back then,

610
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,160
I wouldn't be standing here now.

611
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,999
And there will be no The Hidden Ones today.

612
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:06,360
But Brother, my father and mother...

613
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,280
Wuyou, if they are looking down from up there,

614
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,800
they would hope that you could put the people first.

615
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,420
You are a leader.

616
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,460
There are hundreds and thousands of people behind you.

617
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,659
Consort Rong Le understands the pain you feel as well.

618
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:26,620
But she still wrote a letter to stop you from beginning this war.

619
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,339
That's because she doesn't hope that...

620
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:32,740
you'll become the sinner that put our people into dire suffering.

621
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,859
But she is not trying to stop me from going into war...

622
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:40,280
or endure sufferings that others can't.

623
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,400
Instead, she wants me to choose another path.

624
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,880
She wants me to do something that others can't.

625
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,840
Here, Princess.

626
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,020
After Chun Ni watched you the whole night,

627
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,820
I think you look so much better now.

628
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,579
Thanks to Chun Ni for watching me the whole night.

629
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,039
And thanks to you for taking care of my leg wound every day. I'm much better now.

630
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,340
These are just our duties.

631
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,580
Princess, it's late already.

632
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,640
You should rest now.

633
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:42,900
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

634
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,300
♫ We have been through so much ♫

635
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,690
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

636
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:56,120
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

637
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:03,120
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

638
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,600
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

639
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:17,390
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

640
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,890
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

641
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:30,260
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

642
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:37,090
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

643
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:43,580
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:50,410
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:57,580
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:33,620
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
