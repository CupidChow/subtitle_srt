1
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,680
[Episode 25]

2
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,140
I'll confer you the title as Royal Princess Zhao Yun immediately.

3
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,740
And you'll be married off to Chen in two days' time.

4
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,639
Please forgive Prince Chen.

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,820
I and Prince Chen are young, foolish, and reckless.

6
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,540
We almost caused a disaster.

7
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,320
I'll take on all the blame.

8
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,699
I hope that you'll allow me to marry to a faraway country without any worries.

9
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:03,199
This time, Prince Chen has defied the law of the worst offense.

10
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,359
He should be punished as a warning.

11
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,839
But since he's already hurt, I'll punish him as I see fit.

12
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:13,100
He will be caned 50 times and will be jailed in the Supreme Court.

13
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,639
After you leave the border of Northern Lin safely,

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,180
I'll release him and I won't pursue this matter anymore.

15
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,900
I still have a presumptuous request.

17
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,600
If you need anything, please call for me.

18
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,460
Zhao Yun, you are here.

19
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,619
I'm fine. My legs are just a bit stiff because I sat too long.

20
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,540
No need to care about me. Go and find Wuyou.

21
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,360
Ask him to bring you out from here and wait for me outside.

22
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,360
Come. Let's take a seat first.

23
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,460
Be careful.

24
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm fine, Zhao Yun.

25
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,840
Wuyu.

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,879
This time, I won't wait for you anymore.

27
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,220
And there is no need to come and find me anymore.

28
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,839
Because from now on, the husband that I'll give myself to is Prince Zhenbei from Chen.

29
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,520
I'll grow old and gray with him.

30
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,239
I know. Father and the others must have forced you to do it. Right?

31
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,759
One day soon, I'll kill that Prince Zhenbei.

32
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,619
Nobody has forced me to do it. I'm doing it willingly.

33
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,580
Impossible.

34
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,500
I don't believe you. We were doing so well together before this.

35
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,240
Zhao Yun, we promised each other that we'd travel the world together.

36
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,740
Why? Why did it turn out like this?

37
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,140
Because I can rely on Prince Zhenbei.

38
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,900
Since young, I lost my parents.

39
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,180
I have had only you and Brother Wuyou.

40
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,900
But both of you can do nothing when I'm chosen as the alliance bride.

41
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,180
You said you want to travel the world with me.

42
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,900
But the reality is, you were hurt and you collapsed in front of me.

43
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,440
You can't protect me.

44
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,059
If I'm with you, I'll always be in a state of anxiety.

45
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,540
Zhao Yun.

46
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,520
So all along, in your heart,

47
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,779
I'm... such a weak and useless person.

48
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,880
It's up to you to believe it or not.

49
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,320
But these are my real thoughts.

50
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,020
Rather than giving myself to you who has no achievements,

51
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,100
it's better if I give myself to the future emperor of Chen.

52
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,560
When that day comes, I'll be the empress of Chen.

53
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,500
I'll have ultimate power...

54
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,440
and I won't be bullied or looked down upon by others again.

55
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,380
He is the future emperor.

56
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,220
But can he sacrifice everything for you?

57
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,880
Prince Chen.

58
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,740
Take care.

59
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,480
Zhao Yun.

60
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,780
Wuyu, as long as you live,

61
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,159
you'll be able to find a lady in the future that can soothe the hurt that I've brought upon you.

62
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:11,079
Both of you will hold your child's hand and live together until you are old and gray.

63
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,819
- You can see the world without needing to lead a vagabond life.
- Zhao Yun!

64
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,639
Zhao Yun!

65
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,720
Wuyu, leaving you...

66
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,280
is the bravest thing that I've done in my entire life.

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,900
From now on, we will be worlds apart.

68
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,720
I hope that you won't miss me...

69
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,100
or yearn for me in the future.

70
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,260
Lady Rong Le has been staying put in the Tranquil Garden.

71
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,820
Just like you've asked, we've rejected all requests from those who want to meet her.

72
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,140
You may leave now.

73
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,760
Yes, General.

74
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,519
General Fu, the crown prince has sent words that he wants to meet you immediately.

75
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,720
Prepare my horse. I'll go to Eastern Palace now.

76
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,260
General Fu, the crown prince has asked you to go to the House of Fragrance.

77
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,420
Master.

78
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,299
Come. Let me kiss you.

79
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,360
- Here.
- Come over here.

80
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,780
- Come. We are here.
- Where are you?

81
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,060
I can't catch anyone.

82
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,860
I'm here. Come here now, quickly.

83
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm going to catch you now.

84
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,099
Who is it? How dare you make me fall down!

85
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,260
You want to be kicked out from here?

86
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,019
I didn't get to announce my presence in time. Please pardon me for my lack of manners.

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,560
It's you, General Fu.

88
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,180
You lack manners in too many things.

89
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,560
Let me tell you.

90
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,740
He might look sanctimonious all of the time,

91
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,380
but he's just a hypocrite!

92
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,760
A wolf in sheep's skin!

93
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,160
Fu Chou, how dare you play me.

94
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,580
Who am I?

95
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,819
I'm the crown prince. The son of the emperor.

96
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,760
What about you?

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,560
You are nothing!

98
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,460
I still have work to do. Farewell.

99
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,860
You! Stop right there!

100
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,700
What are you laughing at?

101
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,920
Do you want to die?

102
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,140
Let me ask someone to send you back to the Eastern Palace.

103
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,020
Enough.

104
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,319
No need to pretend anymore.

105
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,419
After what you did to me that day, we are no longer on good terms.

106
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,279
I admit that I was too rude to you on that day.

107
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,800
But I had no other choice.

108
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,739
Crown Prince, that day, you had backed me into a corner.

109
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,120
That's why I had lost control of myself.

110
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,440
I hope that you can forgive me for my rudeness.

111
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,199
Please forgive me for the words that I had uttered in a fit of rage.

112
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,980
You have to see the bigger picture here.

113
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,840
I had indeed... made things too difficult for you that day, General Fu.

114
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,480
But I had done it for your own good.

115
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,639
I want you to see clearly how fickle and lascivious your wife is.

116
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,580
I took great pains to do that for you.

117
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,220
Thank you, Crown Prince.

118
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,920
Enough.

119
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,079
Of course, you need to thank me.

120
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,860
But I need something practical.

121
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,379
I heard that Zhao Yun has been conferred the title of Royal Princess for the alliance.

122
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,340
She's going to be married to a faraway place soon.

123
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,940
She's under Zongzheng Wuyou.

124
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,100
I've already devised a plan that can kill two birds with one stone.

125
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,919
The marriage alliance of Princess Zhao Yun is under Zongzheng Wuyou's responsibility.

126
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,820
And His Majesty has already decreed that...

127
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,260
tonight, he will be responsible for...

128
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,100
Princess Zhao Yun's safety at the inn.

129
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,079
General Fu, Lady Rong Le has ordered us to prepare a carriage for her.

130
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,979
She wants to go to the inn with Miss Sun to pay Princess Zhao Yun a visit.

131
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:32,059
I'm worried that if she goes there, she might affect our plan for tonight.

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,779
Make sure that everything goes according to plan. Nothing can go wrong.

133
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,240
Yes, General Fu.

134
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,220
General Fu, sorry for disturbing you at your manor.

135
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,199
It's rare for you to come here.

136
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,160
No need to be so polite. Come, have a seat.

137
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,300
General Fu, Zhao Yun will be married off to Chen tomorrow.

138
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,319
Me and Miss Sun wish to pay her a visit at the inn.

139
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,099
After she left, I'm not sure if I'll ever see her again.

140
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:18,280
I hope that you can understand.

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,959
You treat Zhao Yun like a sister.

142
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,199
It's only right for you to give your sister who is...

143
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,039
going to be married to Chen a farewell.

144
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,020
Why would I stop you?

145
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,360
I wouldn't let you interfere with this before, because I knew that...

146
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,600
you wouldn't be able to turn the tables.

147
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,079
It would have been pointless even if you tried to stop it.

148
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,540
Now, everything is already on its due course.

149
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,239
You should go and give her some advice.

150
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,399
After all, both of you are princesses for an alliance.

151
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,280
I think both of you can understand each other well.

152
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,660
I'll go and get ready then.

153
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,560
Please excuse me.

154
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,600
Miss Sun, I lost my composure in Linglong Palace that day.

155
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,100
I've embarrassed myself.

156
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,200
You think too much.

157
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,940
I understand the difficult position you were in at that time.

158
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,580
I still have some work to do.

159
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,700
Please feel free at home. Goodbye.

160
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,300
Tonight, no matter what, we have to guard Royal Princess Zhao Yun's safety.

161
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,999
Make sure that nobody comes in.

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,820
Yes, Your Highness!

163
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,159
Do you like me?

164
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,300
I like you, too.

165
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,519
After my father is done with the marriage alliance affair,

166
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,319
I'm going to tell him about our marriage.

167
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,479
Who says I'm marrying you?

168
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,819
You haven't even proposed to me.

169
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:12,020
I'm already hooked on you. You can't get rid of me.

170
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,999
From now on, there will be...

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,300
no prince and princess, no wealth and status,

172
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,079
and no duties for the country.

173
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,240
In our world, there will be only me and you.

174
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,080
Zhao Yun.

175
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,320
Brother Wuyou.

176
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,239
From tomorrow onwards, I won't be by your side.

177
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,840
You have to take good care of yourself.

178
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,639
Brother Wuyou,

179
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,959
don't worry. I'm all grown up now.

180
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,599
I'm no longer that little girl...

181
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
who always trods behind you.

182
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,139
From tomorrow onwards, I'll try my best to be a qualified alliance princess.

183
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,860
How I hope that...

184
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,800
you can be my sister forever.

185
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,799
I hope that you can always be...

186
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,120
a wilful, cute, and cheerful little girl.

187
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,319
I hope that whenever I turn my back,

188
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,879
I can see you running towards me...

189
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,700
while calling me Brother Wuyou.

190
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,000
Brother Wuyou, don't worry.

191
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,720
Zhao Yun.

192
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,119
You and Wuyu are my family who I care about most in this world.

193
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:05,060
I couldn't get both of you to be together although I tried my best.

194
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,980
Do you blame me?

195
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
Not only do I not blame you,

196
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,119
I feltvery touched whenever I saw you...

197
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,580
doing your best to help me.

198
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,360
To be able to have a great brother like you in this lifetime,

199
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,560
I can live without any regrets.

200
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,860
How nice would it be if you can never grow up.

201
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,940
Brother Wuyou,

202
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,440
I need you to help me with something.

203
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,840
You want me to advise Wuyu, right?

204
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,960
But you have to wait...

205
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,620
until he has found his beloved one...

206
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,720
to tell him this.

207
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,599
In my heart,

208
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,820
he has always been the bravest man that I have known.

209
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,500
When I was with him,

210
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,180
I had never once felt lonely.

211
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,480
All right. I promise you.

212
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,580
I'll tell him that.

213
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,540
Wuyu has asked me to give this to you.

214
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,600
When he gave you this ring before,

215
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,039
he hoped that it could bring you peace...

216
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,400
and luck for your whole life.

217
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,700
Now, he gives it to you again...

218
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,120
to wish you a life of happiness.

219
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,120
This way, please.

220
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,899
Zhao Yun, I'm sorry that I've only come to see you now.

221
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:44,179
Princess Rong Le, I'm very happy you are here to see me today.

222
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,879
Miss Sun, are you all right?

223
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,140
I'm fine.

224
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,220
It's better if you go inside the room to rest.

225
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,620
Come.

226
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,400
Guards.

227
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,439
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Get me a physician.

228
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,920
Yes, Your Highness.

229
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,159
Thank you, Prince Li.

230
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,540
You are welcome.

231
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,919
I still need to take care of Princess Zhao Yun's safety.

232
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,880
I'll have to take my leave now.

233
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,660
When can General Fu care for me like this?

234
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,640
I would be satisfied even if...

235
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,820
it's just a care from a stranger to another.

236
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,460
Zhao Yun, I'm sorry.

237
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,860
I can't help you this time.

238
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,080
Princess Rong Le, no need to blame yourself or feel sorry for me.

239
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,420
This time, I'm doing it willingly.

240
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,159
- You and Wuyu...
- Before this,

241
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,079
I didn't understand you and Brother Wuyou.

242
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,680
Why couldn't you be together even though you love each other?

243
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,560
Until now, only did I understand.

244
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,919
Brother Wuyou loves you deeply.

245
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,000
But he can only guard and protect you from afar.

246
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,800
This kind of love... is even more precious than him forcing you to be with him.

247
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,380
Zhao Yun.

248
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,880
I have a peaceful life right now.

249
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
But are you happy?

250
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,879
Princess Rong Le, although General Fu is very kind to you,

251
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:04,240
you don't like him.

252
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,580
So, how can you be happy?

253
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,420
It's already impossible between me and Wuyou.

254
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,980
I once loved him.

255
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,580
But now...

256
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,680
Princess Rong Le.

257
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,359
Although I hope that you can be together with Brother Wuyou,

258
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,139
now I know that the fate of marriage cannot be forced.

259
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:34,719
I don't hope that there is any misunderstanding...

260
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,919
between you and Brother Wuyou.

261
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,519
Although you can't be lovers or husband and wife,

262
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,260
you can still be friends.

263
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,560
Zhao Yun, what happened between me and Wuyou...

264
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,239
is not as simple as just a misunderstanding.

265
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,740
Princess Rong Le.

266
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,940
Although I don't know what happened between the both of you,

267
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm sure that Brother Wuyou loves you truly.

268
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,079
Princess Rong Le, you only see the Brother Wuyou now.

269
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,680
But you've never seen the past him.

270
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,319
The past him?

271
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
When he was young,

272
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,759
he was a very forthright and hearty person.

273
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,240
He was even more playful and cheerful than Wuyu.

274
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,260
When he was seven,

275
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,519
after Lady Yun's sudden death,

276
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,819
he locked himself in Yun's Tomb and refused to eat or drink.

277
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:32,320
He almost lost his life.

278
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,660
From then on, he changed drastically.

279
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,240
He was so cold towards everything.

280
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,780
So, Wuyou was once a young and carefree boy.

281
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,399
I never thought that his mother's passing...

282
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,080
was something so traumatic to him.

283
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,959
Who is it?

284
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,540
Miss, I'm the physician they called.

285
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,300
Come in.

286
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
This way, please.

287
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,560
Miss, have a seat.

288
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,639
Princess Rong Le.

289
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,999
For you, Brother Wuyou had caused such a ruckus in your wedding.

290
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,440
And he said something so hurtful to you.

291
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,380
And for you,

292
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,860
he had left Zhongshan and stayed in Qingzhou for more than half a year.

293
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,560
He had never stayed away from his mother for so long.

294
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,380
All of these are proof that he loves you truly.

295
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,740
But his heart has been encased in ice for too long.

296
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,480
He doesn't know how to show his love anymore.

297
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,800
Thank you, Zhao Yun.

298
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,700
No matter how I and Wu You will end up,

299
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,799
I'm very thankful for what you told me today.

300
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,319
You've grown up.

301
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,000
You know more about love than me.

302
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,959
There's no chance for me and Wuyu anymore in this life.

303
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,420
But there might still be a chance...

304
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,460
for you and Brother Wuyou.

305
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,760
Promise me that...

306
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,479
if there's a chance, no matter how slim,

307
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,879
you'll hold it tightly with your two hands.

308
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,380
Because in this world,

309
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,799
you are the only one who can bring happiness...

310
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
to Brother Wuyou.

311
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,279
Princess Rong Le, II think you are exhausted.

312
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,400
How about you go back to your room and rest first?

313
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,200
I'll check on Yali then.

314
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,260
Princess Rong Le, didn't you...

315
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,840
Is your leg feeling better?

316
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,880
I'm fine now.

317
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,990
[Relaxing Wind, Flourishing Nature]

318
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,900
Zhao Yun!

319
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,400
Wuyou, save me.

320
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,600
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

321
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,620
Princess Rong Le.

322
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,959
Leng Yan! She is not Man Yao. Chase after her!

323
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,520
- Yes, Your Highness!
- Guards!

324
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,439
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Tonight, keep your eyes wide open.

325
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,679
We can't let Princess Zhao Yun face any danger again.

326
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,959
- Yes, Your Highness!
- Go there! The rest, follow me!

327
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,740
Yes, Sir!

328
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,039
Zhao Yun.

329
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,879
Zhao Yun, wake up.

330
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,260
Zhao Yun.

331
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,759
Who are you?

332
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,360
Princess Rong Le won't hurt me. Who are you?

333
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,840
You can't even recognize me?

334
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,360
Lady Rong Le saved you just now.

335
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,040
Princess Rong Le.

336
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,020
You saved me just now.

337
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,479
Just now, that person looked exactly like you.

338
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,180
Don't worry.

339
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,919
She ran away.

340
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,220
Prince Li has sent someone to chase after her.

341
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,600
I'll stay by your side.

342
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,740
Princess Zhao Yun, don't be afraid.

343
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,359
We are here.

344
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,340
Zhao Yun!

345
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,999
Are you all right, Zhao Yun?

346
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,160
Brother Wuyou.

347
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,960
I'm fine.

348
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,479
Just now, Princess Rong Le fought with that assassin.

349
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,160
I wonder if she's hurt.

350
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,719
All right, I get it. Don't worry.

351
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,000
Get some good rest. I'll stand guard outside.

352
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,299
Princess Rong Le has seen the assassin, she has something to tell you.

353
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,439
Lady Rong Le has fought with the assassin.

354
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,559
She can indeed help you to find out about the assassin's identity.

355
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,180
Don't worry, Lady Rong Le. I'll take care of Princess Zhao Yun.

356
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,199
If that's the case, please follow me outside...

357
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,960
and tell me everything in detail.

358
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,560
- You...
- You...

359
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,460
You first.

360
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,540
That person is a master of disguise.

361
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,179
She had disguised herself as me and tricked Zhao Yun.

362
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,520
I think she is from the Creed of Vengeance.

363
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Zhao Yun is going to get married soon.

364
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,680
I hate having to part with her.

365
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,199
She's growing up.

366
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,900
And she's more mature now.

367
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,639
Sometimes, I think that she has a clearer picture of things... more so than me.

368
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,759
What about you?

369
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,700
How are you?

370
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,279
I never thought that someone would disguise as you to frame you.

371
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,700
I can't help but feel that ever since I came back to the city,

372
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,600
danger lurks on your every side and there are so many hidden dangers.

373
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,420
It's almost like one mistake and you'll fall into a bottomless abyss.

374
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,960
Perhaps... I shouldn't have left you alone in the city back then.

375
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,079
I didn't protect you well enough.

376
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,559
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

377
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,960
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

378
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,899
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

379
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:05,379
Actually, when I was in Qingzhou for a year and a half, I've faced a lot of things.

380
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,000
I went to Qingzhou to forget about...

381
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,820
the past grievance in the capital.

382
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,600
But I also went there because of my father's secret decree.

383
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,999
He purposely sent me to Qingzhou because he wants me to investigate the cause...

384
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,920
of the frequent revolts that have happened on the southern border recently.

385
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,820
When putting down the rebellion, not only do I have to face death...

386
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,799
on the blood-washed battlefield,

387
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,360
I have to defend myself against both open and covert attacks.

388
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,879
I already found out that

389
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,360
the scholars on the southern border have colluded with the rebel forces.

390
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,580
They robbed the people of their lands and exploited them.

391
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,199
You might be suspicious of...

392
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,960
why I would share with you this kind of secret.

393
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,940
I just hope that... I'll keep no secret from you.

394
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,859
From now on, I'll not keep anything about me from you.

395
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,620
I won't force you.

396
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,470
As long as you are living well,

397
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,920
I'll accept the fact that you've become General Fu's wife.

398
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,560
I just hope that I can protect you well.

399
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,960
Prince Li.

400
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,559
I heard that Zhao Yun was hurt by an assassin. How is she?

401
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,139
Don't worry, Zhao Yun is fine.

402
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,039
That's good then.

403
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,639
I want to check on her.

404
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Even if it's just a glance.

405
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,980
That day in Yun's Tomb, you told me that...

406
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,460
you were sincere towards Zhao Yun.

407
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,839
I believe that you are a gentleman.

408
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,559
Please abide by the customs...

409
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,120
and check on her from outside the door for just a glance.

410
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,620
All right.

411
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,800
Over there!

412
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,120
Who asked you to disguise as her?

413
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,479
This is not the first time I have done it.

414
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,079
What is it? You can't even face her right now?

415
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,919
Do you know that...

416
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,099
your action will ruin our whole plan?

417
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,719
It's not the first time she has seen you.

418
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,359
- She'll know that it's you.
- So what if she does?

419
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,980
She just knows that I'm a stand-in hired by the Emperor of Qi.

420
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,380
Even if she suspects you, she has no proof about it.

421
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,359
But you are so nervous about it.

422
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,540
Are you afraid that she'll find out about the real you?

423
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,360
Hen Xiang, let me warn you.

424
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,800
Don't drag her into this, and don't challenge my limit.

425
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,999
Moreover, don't ruin the whole plan...

426
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,719
because of your selfishness.

427
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,780
Remember that.

428
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,900
You can't fall in love with her.

429
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,660
It's none of your business!

430
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,840
Now that you've made an unnecessary move,

431
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,159
they'll be more alert now.

432
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,820
It'll be hard for us to find a chance to attack again.

433
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,130
You should just stick to your own task.

434
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,240
Go back to the crown prince and keep a close eye on him.

435
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,720
Make sure that he doesn't bring me trouble again.

436
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,959
I can't take it anymore.

437
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,560
I don't want to stay at his side.

438
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,199
You've given me to him because of your plan.

439
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,159
But have you ever thought about my feelings and about my situation?

440
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,040
I know.

441
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,980
Although... I know that it must be difficult for you,

442
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,880
everything that we do now...

443
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,400
must be for the benefit of the whole.

444
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,839
My entire plan is already fanned out in my brain.

445
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,639
Don't worry.

446
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,120
After everything is done,

447
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,840
I'll get you out from there. Trust me.

448
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,280
Although you are my best right-hand man,

449
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,920
you've failed your mission today because of you selfishness.

450
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,940
You have to be punished.

451
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,840
Take her away.

452
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,100
It's not up to you to question my thinking.

453
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,540
Hen Xiang, let me warn you.

454
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,479
Don't drag her into this,

455
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,960
and don't challenge my limit.

456
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,259
Rong Le, I won't let you off the hook so easily.

457
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,260
- General Fu.
- What is it?

458
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,920
His Majesty has ordered you to be in charge of the transport to send Princess Zhao Yun to Chen tomorrow.

459
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I told Eunuch Chen that you've gone to the inn with your wife and managed to deceive him.

460
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,760
But you have no chance but to accept the decree.

461
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,999
Looks like Zongzheng Wuyou has known that...

462
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,359
tonight's assassination in the inn is connected to me.

463
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,519
That's why he hands over the task of protecting the princess to me.

464
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,919
He puts me in a difficult situation so that I don't dare to attack Princess Zhao Yun.

465
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:57,560
If something happens to Princess Zhao Yun,

466
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,560
I'll be the first one to be blamed.

467
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,540
So, what's your plan?

468
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,760
I have to take on this task for sure.

469
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,140
But Zongzheng Wuyou better keeps his guard up.

470
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,700
We'll do it like this. Bring Lady Rong Le back first.

471
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,260
Tell them that we've heard about the incident in the inn.

472
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,940
And the safety of Lady Rong Le comes first.

473
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,580
After that, make sure that...

474
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,799
they don't see each other anymore from now on.

475
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,639
- Yes. I understand.
- Go.

476
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,600
[Southern City Inn]

477
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,039
Greetings, Prince Li.

478
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,919
I have some questions for you, General Fu.

479
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,300
I still have important work to do.

480
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,980
Please ask your question.

481
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,719
Not long ago, I met a group of assassins by Qingliang Lake...

482
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,559
trying to assassinate Prince Zhenbei.

483
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,879
Yesterday night, someone went into the inn to assassinate Princess Zhao Yun.

484
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,800
Looks like their aim is to stop Prince Zhenbei from marrying Zhao Yun by hook or by crook.

485
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,200
Do you think that those assassins might be one and the same?

486
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,199
I'm not sure.

487
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,599
Prince Li, you've fought against them many times.

488
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,639
You should know more than me.

489
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,100
The ones I faced are of the bad sort.

490
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,679
Just like the Creed of Vengeance...

491
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,320
that dips their hands into those criminal activities.

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,240
Greetings, Prince Zhenbei.

494
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Prince Zhenbei, His Majesty has ordered me...

495
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,660
to be your escort and to protect you and Princess Zhao Yun

496
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,679
until you reach the border of our nation.

497
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,420
Thank you for taking the trouble to do that.

498
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:11,059
Before we leave the border, I'll have to trust you with the safety of me and my future wife.

499
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:14,319
But if something happens during the journey,

500
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,759
you'll greatly disappoint the Emperor of Northern Lin...

501
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,839
and it'll bring troubles to you too, General Fu.

502
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,080
Thank you for your reminder.
