[Qingzhou]

3
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,399
Recently, you've worked so hard until you forgot to eat and sleep.

4
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,780
Why did you suddenly have the mood to fly a kite with me?

5
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,159
I saw that during spring,

6
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,560
guys will always ask their lovers out to fly kites together.

7
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,580
So...

8
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,500
Princess Rong Le.

9
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,180
You are flying kite here as well? Greetings...

10
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,740
Today, Man Yao and I...

11
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,979
are just here to have fun as normal husband and wife.

12
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,740
No need to be courteous.

13
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,819
Since you are the one who said it,

14
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,180
how about we have a kite flying competition?

15
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,140
But there will be punishment if you lose.

16
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,320
Let's do it then.

17
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,300
Let's.

18
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,259
Be careful, Wuyou.

19
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,280
Xiao Sha, make it fly now.

20
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,500
Didn't you say that you are unbeatable at flying kites?

21
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,880
- Why did you lose?
- I'm nervous with you standing behind me.

22
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,700
Sir Xiao, are you saying that you lost because of me?

23
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,220
No, of course not. I lost because I'm not as skillful as he is.

24
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,500
Wuyou, why did you release the kite?

25
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,180
There's a saying that when a kite flies away,

26
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,060
it'll bring along all the sufferings and disaster with it.

27
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,180
I prayed to Heaven so that you, me...

28
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,980
and all the people beside us...

29
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,240
will live in peace, happiness, and without illness and calamity.

30
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,019
Ling Yue, just now, you said that the losing party has to be punished.

31
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,280
What is the punishment?

32
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,159
The punishment is...

33
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,519
- Brother Li!
- Hello, Brother Li!

34
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,399
Hello, Sister Rong Le!

35
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,660
This is the punishment you meant? Taking care of kids?

36
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,800
That's right.

37
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,619
Princess, don't you know that...

38
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,340
because Xiao Sha is surrounded by these kids every day,

39
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,540
I don't even have a chance to date him.

40
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,499
All right. Today, I'll be taking care of these kids.

41
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:40,500
And then, you can have a date with Xiao Sha as long as you want.

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,900
- Kids.
- Brother Li!

43
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,119
Sister Rong Le!

44
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,760
- Be careful.
- Brother Li.

45
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,379
Your Highness. Lady Rong Le.

46
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,420
It's my fault for not disciplining them well enough.

47
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,100
Kids, come here.

48
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,539
- I'll give you some sweets.
- Yes!

49
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:01,099
Come here.

50
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,759
Did you finish your work on time?

51
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,819
- Yes.
- Here, take it.

52
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,580
After the earthquake in Zhuo,

53
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,319
the children who came here after they lost their parents...

54
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,099
wouldn't talk at all at first.

55
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,219
Now, after they are being...

56
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:15,499
taken care of by a taciturn like him for half a year,

57
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,940
they've become so lively.

58
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,419
- Come.
- That's right.

59
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,860
For the past half-year, he only cared about those children.

60
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,440
- He didn't think about me at all.
- Don't fight. There's enough for all.

61
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,800
Come.

62
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,740
Sister Ling Yue.

63
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,540
Brother Xiao has asked me to give this flower bouquet to you.

64
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,240
Thank you. Such a good girl.

65
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,940
Go to him now.

66
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,419
Come here, children.

67
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,879
- Come to me.
- All right.

68
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,180
- Come, come to us.
- Sister Rong Le.

69
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,499
Go now.

70
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:00,239
Leave the kids to me and Wuyou.

71
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,880
Go now.

72
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,719
- We want to play a game.
- All right.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,720
- What do you want to play?
- Eagle catches the chickens.

74
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,600
Xiao Sha, look.

75
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:20,940
Although His Highness is busy with the government affairs every day,

76
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,019
he'll eat dinner with the princess every night.

77
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:27,840
They are a real couple that is in love with each other.

78
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,219
We've been together for more than one year, but you...

79
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:36,300
I understand now. I promise that from now on, as long as I'm in Prince Li's manor,

80
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,040
I'll make sure to eat dinner with you every day.

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,340
Is food the only thing in your mind? Dummy.

82
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,380
Ling Yue.

83
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,240
Then are you willing to...

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,700
marry this dummy?

85
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm coming!

86
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,520
- This side!
- Come and catch me!

87
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,599
Don't move!

88
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,140
I caught you!

89
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,119
Come and catch me!

90
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,080
We won!

91
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,000
Come!

92
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,400
Don't look.

93
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,139
Your Highness. Princess.

94
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,459
How is it? It's not hard to take care of kids, right?

95
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,200
For me, I'm fine.

96
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,400
But I think Wuyou... is not doing that well.

97
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,219
Xiao Sha, it's time they go back to class. Right?

98
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:07,099
Don't worry. I'll bring them away now.

99
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,260
Children, let's go.

100
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,359
- Let's go back to study.
- Let's go! Goodbye.

101
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,499
- Goodbye.
- Brother Li, goodbye.

102
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:17,100
- Goodbye, Sister Rong Le.
- Goodbye.

103
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,460
- Listen to Brother Xiao Sha, all right?
- Be good.

104
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,580
Man Yao, you like children so much.

105
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,040
How about we make some children of our own?

106
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,399
Who wants to have children with you?

107
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,440
I want to have children with you.

108
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,200
Man Yao, for the past year, were you happy?

109
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,780
The past year has been the happiest of my life.

110
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,820
Because I can be with you.

111
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,700
Marry me then.

112
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,980
Be my only wife.

113
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,019
We'll raise our own children...

114
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,480
and build our own family.

115
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
We won't give up on each other forever...

116
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,000
and we'll live until we are old and gray.

117
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,640
Wuyou.

118
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,360
I won't let you wait for too long.

119
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,959
One day, we'll be free from this southern and northern area...

120
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,800
and we'll be free from this national enmity.

121
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,980
And just like today, we'll rewrite the painful past...

122
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,360
with beautiful memories.

123
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,160
Are you willing to wait for me?

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,760
[Thinking About Coming Home]

125
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,300
- He's back.
- Prince Chen is back.

126
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,399
Prince Chen!

127
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,340
One year ago, General Fu used the Phoenix Seal of Empress Fu.

128
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,859
Wei feared General Fu's fierce reputation...

129
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:58,259
until they didn't dare attack us when Northern Lin was in civil strife.
[Serene Hill Inn]

130
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,499
What a great man he is.

131
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:03,459
This hero is indeed the descendants of royalty;

132
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,580
a true son of Heaven.

133
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,200
- Good!
- Your Highness, this storyteller...

134
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,059
As for Empress Fu, everybody knows that...

135
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:15,619
she had passed away in the blaze that burned down Senyan Palace.

136
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:18,379
But we never thought that she was still alive.

137
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,459
Turns out that she was saved by a handmaiden back then.

138
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:25,859
But unfortunately, her outstanding beauty was lost on that very day.

139
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,980
She was so shocked until she lost her mind.

140
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,540
That's really too bad.

141
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,919
- I heard that back then, she was very famous for her beauty.
- Yes.

142
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,600
Empress Fu is the Princess of Chen.

143
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,499
She was elegant and with an over-the-top beauty.

144
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,179
Back then, in order to marry her, the late emperor...

145
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,980
had put in so much effort to court her.

146
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,300
Unfortunately, her beauty was short-lived.

147
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,280
Now, although she has lost her mind,

148
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,579
luckily, Prince Regent is a very filial son.

149
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,100
He searched everywhere for famous physician to treat his mother.

150
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,800
I think it won't be long for her to regain her sanity.

151
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,040
My fellow storyteller,

152
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,940
why do you keep on telling stories about Northern Lin?

153
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,939
Talk about the southern border, too.

154
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,059
- That's right!
- Although Prince Regent from Northern Lin is great,

155
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,199
our Prince Li at this southern border is not too bad either.

156
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,039
- Everybody, am I right?
- That's right!

157
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,500
Speaking of the southern border,

158
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,179
Prince Li who was once the most rightful heir to the throne...

159
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:27,339
had given it up because of a woman back then.

160
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,539
Now, he's hiding at the southern border...

161
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,939
and is still using the same title given by the late emperor of Northern Lin.

162
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:36,039
And he still bears the infamy of being a traitor.

163
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,959
Traitor or not, I just know that...

164
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,420
after Prince Li came here and carried out the People-Based Transformation,

165
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,300
we were no longer exploited by scholars. Am I right?

166
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,540
You are wrong, Sir.

167
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,100
Although Prince Li's transformation has shown results,

168
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,940
the scholars are deeply rooted here.

169
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,059
I'm afraid that this transformation won't last long.

170
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:55,019
We just settled the civil strife, but Northern Lin is eyeing us like prey.

171
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,939
And our borders are frequently disturbed. If there's a war,

172
00:12:57,939 --> 00:12:59,939
I'm afraid that we'll lose.

173
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:02,739
- And we are the ones who will suffer.
- Sir.

174
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:06,800
That's right!

175
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,100
Prince Chen! It's Prince Chen!

176
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,879
- Prince Chen is back.
- Prince Chen is back!

177
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,239
- Let's go!
- Prince Chen!

178
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,719
- Look.
- It's really Prince Chen.

179
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,759
I heard that the Luo Army of General Luo Zhi has won the war at our border.
[Serene Hill Inn]

180
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,039
I think he'll be back soon.

181
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,799
- That's great!
- That's right!

182
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,500
Finally, they are back!

183
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,219
The news of victory about the Luo Army has spread.

184
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:39,560
Even the envloy of Chen has come to Qingzhou in haste to congratulate us.

185
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,179
But where did Prince Li go?

186
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,280
Why isn't he here personally to welcome the envoy?

187
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,699
Prince Li has other things to do today.

188
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:51,339
I'm going to take care of thegovernment affairs in his stead.

189
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,140
Everybody has seen the letter of credence just now.

190
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,019
The envoy has requested a meet-up of an emperor to an emperor.

191
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,299
They had invited Prince Li to visit Chen for an alliance.

192
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,419
It is indeed inappropriate.

193
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:05,680
What's so inappropriate for an emperor to meet another emperor?

194
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,379
Now, the people are talking about this.

195
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:11,219
The bad sort even spread rumors, saying that...

196
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,459
Prince Li doesn't call himself an emperor...

197
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,379
because he is a traitor and is guilty of it.

198
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,139
And they say that he is no match to Zongzheng Wuchou.

199
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:23,459
But in truth, Prince Li is the real bloodline of the late emperor.

200
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:27,359
As soon as he ascends the throne to become emperor, the people will turn back to him.

201
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,980
That's right.

202
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,099
Sir Cai, Prince Li has made a vow to use the title given by the late emperor.

203
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,899
It shows his loyalty and filial piety towards the late emperor.

204
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,860
He doesn't wish for the north and south to be at war.

205
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,660
He doesn't want to cause harm to Northern Lin.

206
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,700
Besides, Prince Li has repeatedly...

207
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
made his standing clear towards Chen.

208
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,599
He wants to unite the whole Northern Lin first...

209
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,620
and bring peace to it before deciding on other matters.

210
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,060
But this time, Chen is even more desperate to invite Prince Li...

211
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,260
for an alliance compared to previous invitations.

212
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,420
They even offered to lend us their army.

213
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,159
With Chen's support, it'll further strengthen our army to take down Northern Lin.

214
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,059
I think His Highness might agree to it.

215
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,180
Although meeting them as emperor is an overstep,

216
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,259
it's not that His Highness is disqualified to be an emperor.

217
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,820
Sir Sun, what do you think?

218
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,699
I support Prince Li's decision.

219
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,699
But Prince Li is not here now.

220
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,499
But is this idea of not being the emperor...

221
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:30,380
Prince Fanyang's idea or Prince Li's idea?

222
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,200
How are we going to be sure of that?

223
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,040
Rude!

224
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,860
Uncle.

225
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,800
Sir Cai, when my father was in peril, my uncle came...

226
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,359
to stabilize the situation here despite his serious wounds.

227
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,699
He's the reason for the peace you have today.

228
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,939
But all of you just want to be the founders of a country.

229
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:07,579
You just want to be awarded.

230
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:11,860
Have you no regard for my uncle and my brother's national enmity?

231
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,580
Prince Chen, this...

232
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Why didn't you inform us if you were back?

233
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,299
Wuyou won't betray the country like Fu Chou.

234
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:24,120
He won't be disloyal, unfilial, cruel, and unjust.

235
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,399
As long as Northern Lin is not in order,

236
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,219
Wuyou won't call himself emperor.

237
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,739
My fellow ministers,

238
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,440
if any of you dare advise Wuyou to forget about revenge...

239
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,520
and have him call himself emperor,

240
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,659
please join me at the front line.

241
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:40,720
Let's bathe in blood while bodies pile high, how about that?

242
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,460
Prince Li has already given his order.

243
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,819
If the envoy of Chen requests to meet him,

244
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:49,819
tell him that His Highness is not in Qingzhou.

245
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,459
So, Sir Cao will go to Chen instead...

246
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,979
to discuss the opening of our border to encourage more trading.

247
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:59,640
As for the alliance between two countries,

248
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,880
we'll discuss it next time.

249
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,560
Yes, Prince Fanyang. I will fulfill my mission.

250
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,619
So, Wuyou has a plan in mind already.

251
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,659
For this war fought by the Luo Army, before we achieve victory,

252
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:14,980
Wuyou had already written to me to hold a feast for the soldiers.

253
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,459
Sir Cai, I came back earlier to Qingzhou this time to tell you that...

254
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,759
before General Luo Zhi comes back to the court,

255
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,619
please transfer the special fund to comfort and compensate the soldiers.

256
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,019
This is not to be delayed.

257
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,599
We have a lot on our plates now.

258
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,439
I can't get my hands on so much money in such a short time.

259
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:32,920
Under Wuyou's order, I've checked the military account.

260
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,179
Since the implementation of the transformation, the military fund is separated from others.

261
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,679
If there's a shortage, I'm afraid that there must be corruption or dereliction of duty.

262
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,099
You know General Luo Zhi's temperament.

263
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,419
If any of the Luo Army's money is lost,

264
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:50,079
I'm afraid that the Cai family property will be used for military expenditure.

265
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,820
Your Highness, you are just making things difficult for me.

266
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Your Highness, in order to thank the soldiers on the front line who had fought bravely to protect us,

267
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,000
I am willing to donate 100 taels of gold to reward the soldiers.

268
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,699
You are indeed the most understanding man, teacher.

269
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:12,819
Based on what I know, ever since the implementation of the transformation,

270
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,179
the Sun family has had most of their lands confiscated.

271
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,960
But you've never once stopped the implementation of the transformation.

272
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,660
It is the right thing to do.

273
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,120
Then, Sir Cai, what do you think?

274
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,820
I, before the Luo Army comes back,

275
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,800
I'll get the reward to their hands.

276
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,640
That's great then.

277
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,659
Man Yao, Luo Zhi's celebratory feast will be in two days' time.

278
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,780
Attend it together with me.

279
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,819
Wuyou, I know that you don't mind the way I look.

280
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:08,739
And I don't hide in the manor because of my looks.

281
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:12,980
Just that... I'm in an awkward position now.

282
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,819
If I just show myself like that in front of the officials,

283
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:19,919
not only will I be censured, but you'll also be dragged into it as well.

284
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,020
This transformation is not easy to start with.

285
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,860
I don't want to cause further trouble because of this measly thing.

286
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,400
Man Yao, I don't care about the things that you've mentioned.

287
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,100
I don't care about others' censure.

288
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,219
I just know that since you can face an army together with me,

289
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:40,080
you shouldn't hide behind me.

290
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,700
Because of the things in the past,

291
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,059
you are not willing to accept the title of my wife.

292
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,880
I can kind of understand that.

293
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,160
But if you can't even stand by my side with your head held high,

294
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,560
how am I going to feel at ease?

295
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,819
All right, I promise you. I'll attend the feast with you.

296
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,859
For the past year, half of the credit for the results...

297
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,420
of the transformation should go to you.

298
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,859
Since we can go through hardship together,

299
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,920
we should enjoy this honor together as well.

300
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,560
Besides that, there's another thing that I need your help with.

301
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,240
Is it about Luo Zhi?

302
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,300
I can never hide my thoughts from you.

303
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,459
For the past year, after the implementation of the transformation,

304
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,100
we've weakened the scholars.

305
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,220
At the same time, General Luo Zhi has achieved multiple battle merits.

306
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,679
And now, he and his soldiers from poor backgrounds have increased in power.

307
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:40,860
Luo Zhi has always been arrogant.

308
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,860
If we leave him alone like that,

309
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,380
he might become rampant and hard to be controlled.

310
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,060
Yes. That's why I purposely arranged for Wuyu to be in his troop.

311
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,760
Wuyu and I think that although Luo Zhi is crude and aggressive,

312
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,460
he can manage the military troops very well.

313
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,020
He's a very rare and talented general.

314
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,460
This kind of hot-blooded man won't bow to power...

315
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,220
and he cares not about money or women.

316
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,580
He will only serve us with loyalty after he has fully accepted us.

317
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,260
Don't worry. I have a plan.

318
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,019
I'll make Luo Zhi submit to you.

319
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,460
What plan is that?

320
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,939
Prince Chen!

321
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:23,780
- Prince Chen!
- Wuyou. Man Yao.

322
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,059
I heard that you went out to play today.

323
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,120
No wonder there was no one to welcome me.

324
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,639
Your Highness. Princess.

325
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,279
I tried to stop him but I failed.

326
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,299
I'm not an outsider. No need to announce my arrival.

327
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,579
Prince Chen, you don't know.

328
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,979
After you went to the military camp for a year, we have new rules here.

329
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:47,499
When His Highness is having dinner with Princess, nobody can disturb them.

330
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:51,480
Dinner is ready. Please enjoy your dinner.

331
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,019
Get another set of cutlery for Prince Chen.

332
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,600
Yes, Princess.

333
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,319
Wuyou. Man Yao. This is what you eat every day?

334
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,719
It's worse than the food in the military camp.

335
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,979
I thought that the food would be better after I come back to the manor.

336
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:20,979
Man Yao did this for the sake of the soldiers battling at the border.

337
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,680
She has ordered us to dispense all unnecessary expenditure in the manor.

338
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,119
This food was cooked by Man Yao herself.

339
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,480
We've been eating like this for a year.

340
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,879
I knew that she was the one who cooked the food just by looking at it.

341
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,819
But... why do I think that Wuyou doesn't really enjoy it that much?

342
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,799
Looks like your fighting skills have improved after a year in the army.

343
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,359
Of course. I trained myself every day while I was in the military camp.

344
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,679
How about we find a day to have a friendly match?

345
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,039
Compete with Man Yao first.

346
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,839
Man Yao has been training hard for the past year.

347
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,639
She's good at riding and shooting as well.

348
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,799
You can come and challenge me if you can defeat her.

349
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,439
I don't dare to do that.

350
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,279
If I accidentally hurt her,

351
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,660
you would kill me.

352
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,559
Princess,

353
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,740
Ke'er has specially cooked this tonic for you.

354
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,830
Tonic cooked by Ke'er? I have to taste that.

355
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,960
[Medical Prescription]

356
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,140
Are you going to give this book to Ke'er?

357
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,300
Let's eat. Let me taste your cooking skills, Man Yao.

358
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,679
Uncle, I found it!

359
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,680
- You found it?
- This is the Blood Raven Roots.

360
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,760
What Blood Raven Root? I can find it for you, too.

361
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,599
You won't be able to find it.

362
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,519
This kind of root grows in the most dangerous and weirdest places.

363
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,440
Only a person with skills like uncle can find it.

364
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,119
Besides, this Blood Raven Root is related to Princess Rong Le's life.

365
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,200
Are you saying that this will affect Man Yao's life?

366
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,019
But the messages that I received for the past year said that she's healthy.

367
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,919
I thought that she was fully cured.

368
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,340
Besides, when I saw her just now, she looked quite well.

369
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,459
Princess Rong Le looks like a normal person now...

370
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:55,520
because I think she took the cure at one point in the past year.

371
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,519
Although her pulse reading is stable, there are some hidden issues.

372
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,580
Maybe the poison is not completely neutralized yet.

373
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,060
Are you saying that Blood Raven Root can neutralize the poison completely?

374
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,519
I've read all the medical books but I still can't determine the poison...

375
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,399
contracted by the Princess in Western Qi.

376
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:20,479
But I found this magical Blood Raven Root in this medical book.

377
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,919
It can neutralize the poison in the body and blacken the hair.

378
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,540
What are you waiting for? Let's tell Wuyou at once.

379
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,919
Wait!

380
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,359
We can tell him after we found the Blood Raven Root.

381
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,879
Isn't it good to let him think that Princess Rong Le is fine and well now?

382
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,959
If we can't find it,

383
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:39,260
it'll be such a disappointment.

384
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,320
You've become more mature after one year.

385
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,039
Yes, you are right.

386
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,759
Wuyou and Man Yao have indeed gone through so much hardship...

387
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,780
for them to be together happily just like today.

388
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,659
Uncle, let's look for the location of the Blood Raven Root.

389
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:57,180
All right.

390
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,359
Uncle, let's go.

391
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,979
All right.

392
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:09,460
Wait!

393
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,199
I'm too bored in the manor.

394
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,719
I'm on my way to go out, too.

395
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,840
Where are you going to find the Blood Raven Root?

396
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,260
Here.

397
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,300
Youji Mountain?

398
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,399
I never heard of this place.

399
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,239
Is your source correct?

400
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:37,839
Last night, I had to tell so many lies to Wuyou in order to join you today.

401
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,460
If we come back empty-handed, it'll be such a waste.

402
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,559
Why do you keep on staring at Agent Wu?

403
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,280
Uncle, why are you always frowning?

404
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,919
If you are so strict all the time,

405
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,279
it'll be harmful to your spleen and stomach because of worrying too much.

406
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,019
Most importantly...

407
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:03,599
What?

408
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,479
When your spleen and stomach are unwell, you'll have wrinkles.

409
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,559
You'll look old if you have wrinkles.

410
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,079
It shouldn't be like that.

411
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,359
People who practice martial arts are very energetic.

412
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,659
Usually, we will look younger than others.

413
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,640
- It would be impossible that I'd look old.
- Of course, you look old.

414
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,959
Too bad I don't have a mirror.

415
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:24,460
Or else, I can show you how old you look when you are frowning.

416
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,920
How about you look into my eyes. You'll be able to see your reflection.

417
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,939
My eyes are bigger.

418
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:35,960
Do you want to look into my eyes?

419
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,880
Ke'er, how old do you think I look now?

420
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,899
Forty.

421
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,160
I look that old?

422
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,000
See. It's much better if you are not frowning.

423
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,979
It's late and Youji Mountain is quite far.

424
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:52,840
What are you doing?

425
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,839
It's late already.

426
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,660
Let's depart now. Let's go.

427
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,200
[Sun Manor]

428
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,399
Miss Sun, the songs that you play now...

429
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:44,640
are way better than those depressing songs that you used to play.

430
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,639
You just think that it sounds nice.

431
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,780
But you don't understand it.

432
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,399
If you understand it,

433
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,940
you wouldn't look so gleeful now.

434
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,959
Sometimes, I am quite envious of you.

435
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,140
Ignorant is bliss after all.

436
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,699
Miss Sun, you are so smart but you are envious of dummies like us?

437
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,599
So unappreciative of you.

438
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,679
Ling Yue, why are you here?

439
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,519
I thought that you wouldn't come to visit me since Sir Xiao is back.

440
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,599
Are you saying that you don't welcome me? I'll leave then.

441
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,079
Ling Yue.

442
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,359
For the past year, you had always visited me and kept me company.

443
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,599
Now, we are like sisters who have gone through hardship together.

444
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,399
Usually, I always treat you as my equal.

445
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,239
I've never wanted you to call me "Miss."

446
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:33,399
How could you just leave like that because of a joke?

447
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,340
I'm just joking with you.

448
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,280
This is a new tea given by Princess Rong Le.

449
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
- Chun Ni.
- Yes, Miss Sun.

450
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,559
Steep it with the tea that Rong Le gave me last month.

451
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,160
Yes, Miss Sun.

452
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,840
Help me thank Rong Le.

453
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,999
Help me thank Lady Rong Le for thinking about me for the past year.

454
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:57,159
She will send me the new tea at the beginning of every season.

455
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,679
Not only her,

456
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,999
even Prince Li has always mentioned you.

457
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,759
- Is that so?
- Yes.

458
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,980
Prince Li always talked about the past incidents with you in Qingzhou.

459
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,779
No matter what, it's all in the past.

460
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,119
Ling Yue, please express my thanks to His Highness and Lady Rong Le.

461
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,399
It's sweet after sweat for His Highness and Lady Rong Le now.

462
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,199
Finally, they've become husband and wife.

463
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,039
Such envy they've caused.

464
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,680
Yali.

465
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,199
How about you come to Prince Li's Manor with me?

466
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:34,159
Say your thanks to His Highness and Princess Rong Le yourself.

467
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,100
They would be ecstatic if they saw you.

468
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,319
I'll pass.

469
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,199
I've never gone out of this manor for a year.

470
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:43,240
I don't wish to meet others as well.

471
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,379
Yali.

472
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,999
Truthfully, if you go out and walk around,

473
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:51,239
you'll realize that others' have already forgotten about the past.

474
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:54,360
They won't cast weird glances at you anymore.

475
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,799
Moreover, if you spend time with your zither in the manor every day,

476
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,739
how are you going to find someone that understands you?

477
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:02,079
His Highness and Princess Rong Le know a little about music...

478
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,479
but they are too busy with work recently.

479
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,480
They haven't been playing together for so long.

480
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,400
Miss Sun, the tea is here.

481
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,139
So fragrant.

482
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:19,320
It's a newly steeped tea.

483
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,000
Miss Sun.

484
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,720
Princess Rong Le, look who's here.

485
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,159
Yali?

486
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:47,340
Long time no see.

487
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,239
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

488
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,479
Quick, get up. No need to be so courteous.

489
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,099
Lady Rong Le, this is a calming incense that I made.

490
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:57,419
A small gift for you. Please accept it.

491
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,879
Thank you, Yali.

492
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:02,060
After so long, you are still so courteous.

493
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,279
I have to thank you for your calming incense then.

494
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,240
You've taken care of my worries.

495
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,360
You are having trouble sleeping lately?

496
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,719
It's not me. It's Wuyou.

497
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,679
He's too busy with work recently.

498
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,920
He is always coming back very late and he can't fall asleep.

499
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,359
If this calming incense can help His Highness to rest,

500
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,519
I can make more of them for you, Lady Rong Le.

501
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,540
You have my thanks.

502
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,700
Yali, this way, please.

503
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,879
How have you been for the past year?

504
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:40,639
I've asked Ling Yue to invite you to my manor quite a few times.

505
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,239
But I heard that...

506
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:45,080
you are not feeling well and wouldn't come out from your manor.

507
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,639
Thank you for asking after me.

508
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:50,560
I'm feeling fine now.

509
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,360
Have a seat. Let's sit and chat.

510
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,660
Lady Rong Le, you are playing chess?

511
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,599
I was in a middle of a game with His Highness.

512
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:07,519
We were interrupted half way through.

513
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,420
That's why it turned out like this.

514
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,999
If you are willing, how about we finish it?

515
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,600
Sure.

516
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,999
His Highness is both your lover and your best friend.

517
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,080
How envious.

518
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,759
Unlike me, I'm all alone.

519
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,579
I have no one.

520
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:30,860
And it's been a long time since I last played chess.

521
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,900
An unexpected way out.

522
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,120
Such a good move.

523
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,159
Although you've given up on a lot of your chess pieces,

524
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
you've found another way out.

525
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,560
Lost will be balanced out by gain.

526
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,379
If you give up on the past,

527
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,639
you'll see a bright future ahead of you.

528
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:01,039
Yali,

529
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,719
you've been locking yourself up in the manor for the past year.

530
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:06,120
You must be brushing up your chess skills, right?

531
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,519
It's true that I haven't been playing chess for a year.

532
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm out of practice now.

533
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,479
Although I've found a way out,

534
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:20,839
I've lost a huge amount of my chess pieces.

535
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:22,839
With the declining amount of the white chess piece,

536
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,319
the ending is set.

537
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:26,639
No matter how I try,

538
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,580
I'll still lose this round.

539
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,760
Since you no longer play chess, do you still play your zither?

540
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,040
I don't play it anymore.

541
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,299
After all, I can't play it as well as you anyway.

542
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,859
Lady Rong Le, I remembered that I made a promise to my father.

543
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:53,760
I have to go back.

544
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,200
Father.

545
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,520
You went to Prince Li's manor.

546
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,120
Yes.

547
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,240
Looks like you've finally understood.

548
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,839
In the past year, I had advised you so many times...

549
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,820
to visit Princess Rong Le and use that chance to get closer to Prince Li.

550
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,359
Father, I went there today to visit Rong Le and play chess.

551
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,300
I didn't see His Highness at all.

552
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,540
Looks like you are still oblivious to my efforts.

553
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,599
His Highness and Rong Le are a devoted couple.

554
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,600
There is no chance for me to get between them.

555
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,679
As long as you are willing to do it,

556
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,000
you will succeed.

557
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,439
Luo Zhi will be back tomorrow.

558
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:58,879
Prince Li has prepared a feast for him.

559
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:02,480
Bring your zither along and attend the feast with me tomorrow.

560
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,980
You need to let His Highness know that you still exist.

561
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,519
Father, I don't wish to go to a place with many people...

562
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,359
and to be the talk of the town.

563
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,079
I don't care if you are willing or not. You have to go.

564
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,159
His Highness has no like for a feast.

565
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,839
If it wasn't because Luo Zhi loved wine,

566
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,220
you wouldn't even have that chance!

567
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,659
We are not what we used to be.

568
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:26,759
Luo Zhi and his soldiers from the poor class are more and more in favor.

569
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,679
I've even put down my dignity.

570
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,240
Why would I care about your interest?

571
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,500
Yes, Father. I'll do as you say.

572
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,719
Congratulations, General Luo.

573
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:56,679
Congratulations on your victory, General Luo.

574
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,520
Thank you.

575
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,940
This way, please.

576
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,239
- I'm sorry, Miss Sun.
- It's all right.

577
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:35,720
The lady with the zither.

578
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,439
I'm bored.

579
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:42,039
Can you play me a song to appease my boredom?

580
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,680
General Luo, she is my daughter, Yali.

581
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,599
She's here to play zither with Lady Rong Le today.

582
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,499
Since she is Lord Sun's daughter,

583
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm sure that she can play very well.

584
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,839
His Highness is late anyway.

585
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,139
It's boring for us to just sit here.

586
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:01,119
And it's no fun for me to drink alone.

587
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,979
Are you willing to play a song for me?

588
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,259
Yali, play a song for General Luo.

589
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,860
Yes, Father.

590
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,180
Congratulations on your victory, General Luo.

591
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,079
General Luo, His Highness is not here yet.

592
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:19,399
So what if I drink a few cups of wine?

593
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,119
His Highness is late.

594
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,359
Is he going to blame me for drinking some wine?

595
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,519
You've achieved high merits.

596
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,599
And this feast was set up for you.

597
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,100
I'm sure His Highness won't blame you for drinking a few cups of wine first.

598
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,079
But none of us here are doing the same thing as you.

599
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,159
What has caused His Highness to be late?

600
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:46,060
He's late for almost one hour. Why isn't he here yet?

601
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,440
General Luo.

602
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,680
Recently, the country is very peaceful and there is no important work.

603
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,419
I'm afraid that His Highness is late because of someone.

604
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:01,999
Who is the person that can stall him?

605
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,879
At this southern border,

606
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:07,979
the only one who can stall him is his wife.

607
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:11,159
You've been fighting wars outside, so you don't know about this.

608
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,519
Now, in His Highness's heart,

609
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,319
I'm afraid that there's nothing in this world...

610
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:17,439
that is more important than his consort.

611
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:19,900
She's the future consort.

612
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,780
Future consort?

613
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,620
She is still not married to His Highness?

614
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,519
His Highness has just brought her back to his manor.

615
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,059
She doesn't have the title as consort yet.

616
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,599
But Prince Li dotes on her a lot.

617
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,279
He always travels around the world with her.

618
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,919
It has affected his work adversely.

619
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:40,439
Besides, His Highness listens to her.

620
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,959
Sometimes, he even discusses...

621
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,839
the government affairs with her first...

622
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,300
and then, makes the decision.

623
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,399
What does a woman know?

624
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,559
Even I know about the femme fatale theory.

625
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,639
His Highness is way smarter than I am.

626
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,140
How can he be seduced by her?

627
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,239
My fellow officials, Prince Li can't attend this feast because...

628
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,439
Lady Rong Le is not well.

629
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,719
Please let the feast commence at once.

630
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,860
Let's celebrate General Luo's victory.

631
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,300
Sir Sun.

632
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,439
She was still fine yesterday.

633
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:38,559
How can she be ill today all of a sudden?

634
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,340
Could it be that she doesn't wish to meet General Luo?

635
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,959
It's understandable, I heard that the mistress in Prince Li's Manor...

636
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:49,679
is a very talented, gentle, and virtuous lady.

637
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,340
Usually, she wouldn't be seen with unrefined person like you, General.

638
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,799
Although I'm from the poor class,

639
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,879
I have bled and have been covered in wounds...

640
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:03,740
to help His Highness secure this country.

641
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,039
Luo Army had rendered great services.

642
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,980
Even His Highness has to show respect to me.

643
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:14,240
Now, he is absent from this feast because of a bewitching woman?

644
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,540
This is so absurd!

645
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,100
Who are you calling a bewitching woman?

646
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,899
Who are you?

647
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:27,079
How dare you talk back to your superior?

648
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,199
I am the captain of Lady Rong Le's bodyguards.

649
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,319
I belong to her alone.

650
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:33,219
Talking back to my superior?

651
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:35,360
You are not my superior.

652
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,920
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

653
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,330
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

654
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:25,690
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

655
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:31,450
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

656
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:35,420
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

657
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:44,840
♫ You are keeping me out with your care
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

658
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,500
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

659
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:54,100
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

660
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:02,250
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

661
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,120
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

662
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,300
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

663
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:22,060
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

664
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:27,230
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

665
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,800
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

666
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:40,910
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

667
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,830
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

668
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,900
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

669
00:44:49,900 --> 00:45:03,220
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
