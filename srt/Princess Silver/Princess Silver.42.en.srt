00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,200
[Episode 42]

2
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,620
Mother.

3
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,900
Making them submit by force is the worst plan.

4
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,200
Although I can't say that I'll be a sage,

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
I don't want to be a tyrant as well.

6
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,900
Don't worry, Mother.

7
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,200
I've already made a vow.

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,400
I'll make the people in Northern Lin accept me wholeheartedly.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,500
One day soon, I'll make all the officials...

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,800
pledge their allegiance to me and swear their loyalty to me.

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
Mother,

12
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,300
after the issue with the Ministry of Rites dies down,

13
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,600
I'll choose a good day for your coronation.

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,200
In my heart,

15
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
you are as important as the nation.

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,400
What is it?

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Nothing.

18
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,500
I just haven't slept very well.

19
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Recently, I've been thinking a lot about the past.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,700
I think it'll be better if I take a walk outside.

21
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,200
All right.

22
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,000
Chou'er.

23
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,200
It'll be the crown prince's death anniversary in a few days' time.

24
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
I want to go to the temple to pay my respect and pray for good fortune.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,000
I want to commemorate the crown prince.

26
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Chou'er.

27
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Sir Yang and the others have left.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,800
I think some of the officials in the court are still dissatisfied with us.

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,200
I want to commemorate the crown prince...

30
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,600
as a way to win their support.

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,500
Besides, I can pray for your good fortune as well.

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,600
Lately, for the past few days,

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I've been dreaming about the crown prince who is covered in blood.

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,000
And I dream about that evil man, Zongzheng Yunhe.

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Don't be afraid.

36
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,400
Don't be afraid.

37
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Mother, I'll go and take a look.

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,500
All right.

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
You, stop right there.

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,400
Greetings, Young Master. Please spare my life.

41
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
What are you doing here?

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,400
Please spare my life. I'm just following our master's order.

43
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Lin Shen?

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

45
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,400
Half a year ago, he had ordered me to stay here.

46
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,600
And after that, he never came back.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
Please spare me. I'm just following orders to torture him.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
I'm just following orders.

49
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
Guards.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Please spare my life!

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm just following orders, Your Highness.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,500
- Bring him away.
- Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,700
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

54
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm just following orders, Your Highness!

55
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

56
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,500
I remember that when I first saw you,

57
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,800
I felt that... you are quite similar to the younger me.

58
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
So, I've decided to break off this marriage.

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
End of discussion.

60
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,300
General Fu, you just need to write the letter of dissolution as soon as possible.

61
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,000
In order to have the upper hand,

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
I've decided to attack them first.

63
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,200
And this time, I'll lead the troops myself.

64
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
Get yourself prepared at once.

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,800
You'll come along with me for the war in three days' time.

66
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,100
General, the mutiny was successful.

67
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,000
His Majesty is gone.

68
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
[Emperor Sejong Gwangmu of the Zongzheng Clan]

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
You are still alive.

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,100
Don't touch me.

71
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Zongzheng Yunhe.

72
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Why are you here?

73
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,000
It's him.

74
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,400
It's him!

75
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,000
- Zongzheng Yunhe!
- Mother!

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
- Don't arrest me!
- Don't be afraid, Mother!

77
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Don't be afraid, Mother.

78
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
- No!
- Don't be afraid.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He won't be able to hurt you with his condition right now.

80
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,600
He's going to play me for my feelings.

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,800
He's going to destroy my father's country.

82
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Because of Lady Yun, that wench,

83
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,400
he's going to give me to the emperor of Western Qi to be humiliated!

84
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,500
Emperor of Western Qi?

85
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,600
What do you mean by the emperor of Western Qi?

86
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,700
Your Highness.

87
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,000
Lady Fu suffers from acute anxiety.

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,100
She fainted because she was too anxious.

89
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,800
It's not because of a relapse in her hysteria,

90
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,600
but her body is very weak now.

91
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,200
Her previous illness might have taken a toll on her health.

92
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,600
She needs to rest well and nurse back her health.

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,700
Senyan Palace is too damp and cold.

94
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,500
It's best if she stop staying in this place.

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
All right, I get it. You may leave now.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
This way, please.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Mother.

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,500
Chou'er, come.

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,300
No need to be too worried.

101
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,740
I'm fine.

102
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,600
It's just that...

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,500
It's just that when I saw him,

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,600
I couldn't control myself.

105
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
I had lost my composure.

106
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Zongzheng Yunhe.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
Where is he now?

108
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,800
In order to prevent news from spreading,

109
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,400
he is still under lock and key in the Eastern Palace.

110
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,600
Mother, no need to overtax yourself...

111
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,900
for a person like that.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Whenever I see him,

113
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,379
I'll be reminded of the humiliation that I had suffered in the past.

114
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,600
I'll think about his evil doings.

115
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,500
And I'll think about Creed of Vengeance.

116
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,200
The Creed of Vengeance had tortured me for 10 whole years.

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
That's why I went insane.

118
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm traumatized.

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Chou'er.

120
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,600
How did you get rid of the Creed of Vengeance?

121
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
I've already given my order...

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,700
to wipe out all members of the Creed of Vengeance within the country.

123
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,600
What about Lin Shen?

124
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Among all the members of the creed, only Lin Shen and Hen...

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,800
Only Lin Shen is unaccounted for.

126
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,400
But don't worry.

127
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,700
I'll arrest him and bring him to you so that you can mete out the punishment.

128
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,400
Mother,

129
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,500
Senyan Palace is too cold and damp.

130
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,600
How about you listen to me...

131
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,800
and move to the boiler room to nurse back your health?

132
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,000
I insist on staying in Senyan Palace...

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
as a reminder to myself all the time...

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,000
so that I won't forget about my past sufferings.

135
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,600
And it's to remind you...

136
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,400
so that you won't forget about our vengeance.

137
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,900
I'll never forget about it.

138
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,600
Since you've never forgotten about it,

139
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,000
why haven't you launched an attack on the southern border...

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,600
to kill Zongzheng Wuyou?

141
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't ever forget. As long as...

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,800
the son of that wench is still running rampant in this world,

143
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
it means that our revenge is not over yet.

144
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,100
Chou'er.

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,300
I know. You've done a lot of things.

146
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,400
It's just that...

147
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,500
one of them has gotten away scot-free.

148
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,000
Whenever I think about him,

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
I just can't take it.

150
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,700
- I will...
- Mother.

151
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,600
...have no appetite

152
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,000
and I can't sleep at night.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,400
Don't worry, mother. Zongzheng Wuyou won't be able...

154
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,200
to live freely at the southern border for much longer. I'm just waiting.

155
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,600
I can't afford to wait anymore.

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,900
Mother.

157
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,600
How long will I be able to wait?

158
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,800
I had lived in darkness for so many years and days...

159
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,600
until I'm plagued by illness.

160
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
Chou'er.

161
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,500
Tell me. How much longer can I wait?

162
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,000
The royal physician will help you recover.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,700
You'll be able to live a long life.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,300
Chou'er.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I heard that one year ago,

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
you worked smoothly and very decisively.

167
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,500
But why are you like this now?

168
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,600
You are indecisive and you are being so overcautious.

169
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
If you are like this, how are you going to do great things?

170
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,800
How are you going to be the master of the world?

171
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,800
Is there anything at the southern border...

172
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,000
that is stopping you from going there?

173
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,500
There's nothing.

174
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,700
There's nothing worthwhile for me there.

175
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,800
I have nothing anyway.

176
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,200
Mother, I'm the master of Northern Lin now.

177
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,400
No matter what I do,

178
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
I have to think of the overall situation.

179
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,800
By the way, Mother.

180
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
When we were in the Eastern Palace,

181
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,000
you mentioned about the emperor of Western Qi.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,400
What is it?

183
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,100
My head is going to burst.

184
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,800
Here, slowly. This way.

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,000
It's all right. I'll be fine after lying down for a bit.

186
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,600
Mother, rest well then.

187
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
I shall take my leave now.

188
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,400
[School of Wisdom]

189
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

190
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Teacher.

191
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,700
What is your reason for summoning me to come here?

192
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,600
Please have a seat.

193
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
There's a difference between royalty and his subjects.

194
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
Even if we are in a school,

195
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,600
I can't possibly sit above you.

196
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,300
A teacher for a day is a father for a lifetime.

197
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,200
No need to be so modest.

198
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,100
All right then.

199
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Natural endowment is called character.

200
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Following your character is called principle.

201
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,400
Nurturing yourself according to principle is called teachings.

202
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,300
You can't go against your principle.

203
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,300
If you do, then it's not principle.

204
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,699
You summoned me here today just to...

205
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,000
recite the rudimentary passage you had learned when you were young?

206
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Teacher.

207
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,700
You had taught me...

208
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,000
this rudimentary passage personally back then.

209
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,580
Yes.

210
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,819
Back then, I didn't know that...

211
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,699
you had already learned about the Four Books and Five Classics.

212
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,400
That ended up with me testing you with such a simple thing.

213
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
Not only you are smarter than the others,

214
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
you are very humble and polite.

215
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,400
You even told me that the art of studying is that...

216
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,000
you'll always learn something new.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,600
You told me that it's interesting to revise old books.

218
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,299
Back then, after my mother and my teacher passed away,

219
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,200
I had become naughty, unruly, arrogant,

220
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
stubborn, and eccentric.

221
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,500
Everybody in the court treated me like a troublesome kid.

222
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,600
All of them stayed away from me.

223
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,200
But you were the only one who had...

224
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,300
offered to be my teacher.

225
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,800
You taught me and you brought me up to become a man.

226
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,400
Back then, I was very rude to others.

227
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,000
But to you,

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was truly grateful to you and I respected you.

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
I'm overwhelmed with your compliments.

230
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,800
I knew that being naughty and unruly was not in your nature.

231
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,600
I knew that you were gifted and brilliant.

232
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,300
- You just needed to be polished and you'd be a great man.
- What's your definition of a great man?

233
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
A great man... is, of course, the chosen one who can bear important duties.

234
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,200
A master of the world who can save the people.

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,900
You could already tell that...

236
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,400
I'd be able to become the master of the world one day?

237
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Of course.

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,900
Although there was a minor setback because of Fu Chou,

239
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,700
given time, you'd be able to rule the world.

240
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I would like to ask you.

241
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Were you hoping to teach me how to become the master of the world...

242
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,400
or you chose to teach me...

243
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,200
because I can be the master of the world?

244
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,600
I don't understand what you mean.

245
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,200
Are you going to make me walk the path that you've chosen...

246
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,600
or no matter what path I choose,

247
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,000
you'll still help and follow me along with all your might?

248
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's put it like this.

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,300
If our political views are at odds,

250
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,000
are you going to choose another person...

251
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,700
and throw away this student?

252
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,200
Just as you had said just now.

253
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,500
A teacher for a day is a father for a lifetime.

254
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,400
I won't desert you.

255
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,800
But I'm afraid that your wings have hardened.

256
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
And sooner or later, you'll abandon me.

257
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
You can't go against your principles.

258
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
If you do, then it's not a principle.

259
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm still willing to address you as my teacher today...

260
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,600
because I'm grateful to you for setting me on the right path.

261
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,700
But if you insist on running counter to me,

262
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,100
you'll be deserting your principles,

263
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,600
the Sun family, and Northern Lin.

264
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,400
Your Highness,

265
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,500
I was just joking with you just now.

266
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,200
Recently, Yali has told me that...

267
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,600
you were too busy with work...

268
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
until you were so tense.

269
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,600
I do hope that it was just a joke.

270
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,800
I remember that when you taught me back then,

271
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,600
you always joked that...

272
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
if I didn't study well,

273
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,600
you'd retire and go back to your hometown...

274
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,000
to live a simple life as a farmer.

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
There's a residence with a field in Yi.

276
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
The lands are lush and it's surrounded by mountains and water.

277
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,700
It's a very good place to live in seclusion after retirement.

278
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,700
If you are still interested in that,

279
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,400
you can always go there to live a life like that.

280
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Now, it's still not too late to do that.

281
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,400
Although I'm already getting old,

282
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I still have great aspirations.

283
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,700
Living in seclusion is the work of a coward.

284
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,100
In this life, I'd rather die in the court...

285
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,800
than living a life of degradation in the wild.

286
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
Your Highness,

287
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
there is no need to be so serious about my joking remarks back then.

288
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
So, after all these years,

289
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,600
I have never once understood you.

290
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,200
And you have never once understood me.

291
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,800
After paying my respect today, we will no longer be a teacher and a student.

292
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,200
From now on, there will be only a royal and his subject.

293
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,800
Let me remind you once again.

294
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
If you take one more step forward,

295
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,300
there will be no coming back for you.

296
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,200
[Retreat]

297
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,800
[Retreat]

298
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Usually, when you play chess with Princess Rong Le,

299
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,700
who is the more frequent winner?

300
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,000
Of course, it's her.

301
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,600
You are so hesitant. Of course, you'll lose to her.

302
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,100
Yali, the arrow is already being notched.

303
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,800
If you are not ruthless and firm enough,

304
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,400
how can you win her?

305
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
If you are always so hesitant,

306
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,000
you'll suffer a crushing defeat.

307
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,300
And you won't be able to turn the table.

308
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
You have indeed outmatched me.

309
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,600
I've lost.

310
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,200
But I won't lose again and again.

311
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,200
I've lost once.

312
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,600
I won't lose again.

313
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,000
Life is just like chess. We achieve victory by taking risks.

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
If you want to win,

315
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,200
fight with all you've got.

316
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Those who achieve great things will always press on steadily.

317
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
They won't leave leeway to their opponents.

318
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Although it's risky,

319
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,300
you'll be able to give a fatal blow.

320
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
Please guide me, Father.

321
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,200
I heard that you've been giving the calming incense to His Highness.

322
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
So many rumors are flying around.

323
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,000
But His Highness is still so at ease.

324
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Isn't it the effect of the calming incense?

325
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,800
If you act first,

326
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,300
it's possible that you'll be able to turn the table around.

327
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
Please have some rest.

328
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
We've been back from Youji Mountain for so many days.

329
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
And you've been working without sleeping or eating.

330
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
The Blood Raven Root is a magical herb.

331
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,000
It won't be so easy to find something to replace it.

332
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,400
But as long as I can't find the Blood Raven Root,

333
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,200
I won't have the guts to face Princess Rong Le.

334
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
And you've promised me...

335
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,200
not to tell Wuyou about the Blood Raven Root.

336
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,800
I know.

337
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,600
Luckily I didn't tell him before.

338
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
But Wuyou is so smart.

339
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
He will find out eventually.

340
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,700
I remembered.

341
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,200
When we first reached Qingzhou, he had asked me for a rare herb.

342
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,900
Rare herb?

343
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,400
- What...
- Ke'er!

344
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
Ke'er!

345
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,600
- What happened?
- Please take a look at her.

346
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,000
When Miss Sun came to the manor to pay a visit to Princess Rong Le,

347
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,300
we don't know why, but she fainted suddenly.

348
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,000
Have a seat.

349
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
- This...
- What happened?

350
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
It's not a serious illness.

351
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,200
She just thinks too much and it disturbs her vital energy.

352
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,000
But normally, she won't faint because of it.

353
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Sorry to trouble you, Miss Xiao Ke.

354
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,600
I don't think that it was a big deal as well.

355
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,000
But Lady Rong Le insisted to let you have a look at me...

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
in order to assure her.

357
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Sorry to trouble you.

358
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,800
I think that it's not appropriate for me to stay in the manor.

359
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,100
I'll go back now.

360
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,000
- Lie down.
- Help her to lie down.

361
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,080
Miss Sun is too weak.

362
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,539
And it's late already.

363
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,500
I don't feel at ease for her to go back now.

364
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,419
Princess Rong Le will feel apologetic as well.

365
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,579
I still have some work to do in the manor.

366
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,020
Can you please take care of Miss Sun?

367
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,200
I'll do as the princess says.

368
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,640
A man shouldn't be in here with two women. You have to leave now.

369
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,740
- Go.
- I'm just trying to help.

370
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,680
Don't push me.

371
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,420
[Lingyun Pavilion]

372
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:26,270
[Lingyun Pavilion]

373
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,259
Your Highness, it's time for the morning court.

374
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,420
Please wake up and change your attire.

375
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Your Highness, yesterday night...

376
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,780
[Lingyun Pavilion]

377
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,800
Did you see that?

378
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,200
Why is Miss Sun here? And she's not properly dressed.

379
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,859
Miss, why aren't you dressing properly in the reading room?

380
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,120
Are you trying to practice some martial arts?

381
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,160
Princess, what's wrong?

382
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,860
It has been such a long time.

383
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,140
But I still can't get used to the way I look...

384
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,380
when I look at myself.

385
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,540
Princess, it's just some silver hair.

386
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,699
You are still the most beautiful lady in this manor...

387
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:37,779
No, you are the prettiest lady in Qingzhou.

388
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,859
Even Miss Sun is not your match.

389
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,760
If you don't like looking at yourself in the mirror, let's not use it then.

390
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,960
You are talking sweet to me again.

391
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,019
I am not upset because of Yali.

392
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,859
Moreover, in this world,

393
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,440
there's nothing that can preserve one's beauty and youth forever.

394
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,519
Ke'er has such an outstanding master, but even she can't do it.

395
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:06,720
I just never thought that... there would be a day...

396
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,940
where my looks... would become a weapon used by others to hurt Wuyou.

397
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,299
Provincial Governor of Qingzhou, Sir Sun Jizhou is here...

398
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,320
to see you with his daughter, Yali.

399
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
So early.

400
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,459
Please tell Sir Sun that...

401
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,160
I won't be able to meet him now because I'm not properly dressed yet.

402
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,420
Ask him to wait for me in the garden. I'll meet him in a while.

403
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,600
- Yes, Princess.
- Princess.

404
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,779
It's better if you don't meet him.

405
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,760
Why?

406
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,000
Please stop, Sir Sun.

407
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,280
Princess.

408
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,440
Princess...

409
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,720
Sir Sun.

410
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
You may leave now.

411
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,860
I'm sorry for not being properly dressed.

412
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,520
Lady Rong Le, it's me who should be sorry.

413
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,920
Kneel.

414
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,339
What do you mean by this, Sir Sun?

415
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,560
Lady Rong Le, His Highness had favored Yali last night.

416
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,420
We didn't get to inform you beforehand.

417
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,720
So, we are here to apologize.

418
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,160
You knew about this, too?

419
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,740
Princess, Ke'er told me about it.

420
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,360
This morning, when the maidservants...

421
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,339
went to get His Highness to attend the morning court,

422
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,779
they saw Miss Sun lying on top of His Highness's bed.

423
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,419
I saw that you didn't sleep well last night.

424
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,920
I didn't dare to disturb you. So I...

425
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,740
So, all the people in the manor knew about it...

426
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,460
except me who's still in the dark.

427
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,039
Who had asked you to keep it from me?

428
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,980
Of course, it's His Highness's order.

429
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,680
I know that you and His Highness love each other very much.

430
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,720
But what is done cannot be undone.

431
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,760
Yali has lived a rough life full of ups and downs.

432
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,920
Fortunately, His Highness favors her.

433
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,040
I hope that you can be magnanimous...

434
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,700
and accept Yali into the manor...

435
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,739
to serve His Highness together with you.

436
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,260
And both of you can provide heirs for His Highness to continue his legacy.

437
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,120
Yali, what happened?

438
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,160
I want you to tell me.

439
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,220
What has been done cannot be undone now.

440
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,739
His Highness and Yali have known each other for a long time.

441
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:46,539
They had done something wrong in the moment of passion.

442
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,259
It's Yali's fault for not coming clean to you on time.

443
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,779
But this is about my daughter's reputation.

444
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,840
I have no choice but to humble myself to ask for your help.

445
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,540
Please give them your blessing.

446
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,700
I don't agree.

447
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,480
I don't agree to let her in to this manor...

448
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,119
and serve the same husband with me.

449
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,619
You don't believe it?

450
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:17,199
I only believe in Wuyou.

451
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:19,939
I've put down my pride to beg you.

452
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:23,060
But you are not willing to show me any respect at all?

453
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,439
Don't you think you are too arrogant and selfish?

454
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,979
Since the beginning of time, all the emperors have a harem.

455
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,859
None of them are loyal to only one.

456
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,379
Sir Sun, since you address me as Lady Rong Le,

457
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,520
you should know that...

458
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,740
in this manor, besides His Highness,

459
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,139
nobody can make a decision for me.

460
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,980
Even if it's His Highness,

461
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,219
before I know about the truth,

462
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,100
I will believe that his heart has never wavered.

463
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,460
And I will never betray the promise that I had made with him.

464
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,160
I'm very pleased... with your statement.

465
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,159
I think you've gotten... some things wrong, Sir Sun.

466
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,120
Am I right?

467
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,500
Since you are so confident about it,

468
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,000
I won't disturb the both of you any longer.

469
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,680
But I want to remind you.

470
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,119
Your marriage is not something you can decide by yourself.

471
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,399
It will affect the situation at this southern border.

472
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,640
If you shake the foundation of this nation for the same woman again,

473
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,779
I won't be able to control whether or not...

474
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,240
the people of Northern Lin will continue to believe in you.

475
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,320
Thank you for your reminder.

476
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,140
Let's go.

477
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
Ling Yue, you may leave first.

478
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
Yes, Your Highness.

479
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,800
Why did you come here suddenly?

480
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,600
Are you feeling guilty?

481
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,100
Are you afraid that I won't trust you?

482
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,200
When I heard what you said just now,

483
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,300
I knew that our hearts beat as one.

484
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,700
There's nothing that can shake us.

485
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,200
Looks like Sir Sun...

486
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,700
has cut off all means of retrea to fight until his last breath.

487
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Man Yao, no need to trouble yourself with it anymore.

488
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Just leave everything to me.

489
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,600
This is...

490
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,800
Do you still remember the time we acted like others...

491
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,900
and wrote down our wishes...

492
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,200
when we attended the Lantern Festival in Zhongshan?

493
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
We hung our wishes on the interlocked trees.

494
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,500
I remember.

495
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,000
Back then, you lied to me about you wishing to have many children.

496
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
Then, that paper had disintegrated because it fell into the water.

497
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,500
I don't even know what you wrote on it.

498
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,580
Come. Open it up and read for yourself.

499
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,000
This is what I wished for back then.

500
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,390
And my wishes have come true.

501
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,000
I wish for no other except one.

502
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,800
I wish to grow old with her and never be apart.

503
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,600
Do you know what I wrote back then?

504
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,200
I've made a lot of wrong turns,

505
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,400
but I wish to gaze at him for eternity.

506
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,900
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

507
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:13,600
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

508
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,800
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

509
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,200
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

510
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,800
[Man Yin Chamber]

511
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,300
Man Yao,

512
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,800
you've suffered so much because of me.

513
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,200
And now, you are criticized for your silver hair.

514
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,500
When we came to Qingzhou, I told you that...

515
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,800
from now on, you just need to rely on me alone.

516
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,700
I will not let anyone hurt you anymore.

517
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,800
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

518
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,900
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

519
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:26,900
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫

520
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,600
Who are you? Who sent you?

521
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,300
We are just normal robbers.

522
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,400
We just robbed you when you were on your way home.

523
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
And then, we'll burn you to death.

524
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,000
Even if they investigate it, this is all they will get.

525
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,300
If you were normal robbers,

526
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,400
you'd just kill me.

527
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,800
Why did you put in so much effort to torture me...

528
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,600
- before killing me off?
- No wonder he was an official.

529
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,300
So smart.

530
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,600
Sir Yang, we received orders from the top...

531
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
to burn you to death.

532
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,300
We are just following orders.

533
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,200
You have suffered enough.

534
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,100
You may die in peace now.

535
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,200
Fire?

536
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,000
So, it's her.

537
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,100
Fu Yuan!

538
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
The evil wench!

539
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,800
She'll bring ruins to the country and the people!

540
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
The country is going to fall soon!

541
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,800
The country is going to fall soon!

542
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,500
What is it?

543
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,600
You had a nightmare again?

544
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:24,300
Did you... dream about me again?

545
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,740
The raging flames in Senyan Palace.

546
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,200
My bloodcurdling scream in the fire.

547
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,300
I'll dream about it every night.

548
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,100
Every night,

549
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,800
I'll have to experience the same pain again and again.

550
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,200
It's all because of you!

551
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,200
But don't worry.

552
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,600
My plan is going on very smoothly.

553
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,700
For the past year, I had acted like a crazy woman.

554
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,400
I've made Chou'er feel very guilty towards me.

555
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Because of what I said, for me, he had to exterminated the Creed of Vengeance.

556
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,000
He had freed me from Lin Shen's control and nagging.

557
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,900
I have kept you alive...

558
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,000
because I want to let you watch...

559
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,400
while two brothers fight to death with each other.

560
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Don't forget.

561
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,300
Back then,

562
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,500
you had forced the poison into me just like this.

563
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,600
And you let the scoundrel, that emperor of Western Qi...

564
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,500
When you ruined my life forever,

565
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,800
you should have known that you'd be getting what you deserve.

566
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,900
Your Highness.

567
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,300
Come in.

568
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

569
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,400
By the way,

570
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,900
I'm going to leave Zhongshan...

571
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,900
to do something... that I should have done a long time ago.

572
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,300
Your Highness.

573
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,200
How can you risk yourself by leaving Zhongshan?

574
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,500
How about you let me do it for you...

575
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,200
- or let me escort you... so that I can protect you?
- Chang Jian!

576
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,900
Your Highness.

577
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,000
Are you trying to control me as well?

578
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,700
I wouldn't dare.

579
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,000
Place a substitute of me... in my bedchamber.

580
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,900
Tell others that I can't attend court because I am ill.

581
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,500
As for other important tasks in the court,

582
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,300
you'll take care of it in my stead.

583
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:39,200
Remember. The important thing now is to gain the officials' trust.

584
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Yes.

585
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,500
As for my mother, don't tell her first.

586
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,110
I'll come back in half a month's time.

587
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,400
- Yes, Your Highness.
- You may leave now.

588
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,000
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

589
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,320
♫ We have been through so much ♫

590
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,800
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

591
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,400
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

592
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:37,200
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

593
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,800
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

594
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:51,600
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

595
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,000
♫ I cried when you leave and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

596
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,600
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

597
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:11,200
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

598
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,800
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

599
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,600
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

600
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:31,500
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

601
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:07,000
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
