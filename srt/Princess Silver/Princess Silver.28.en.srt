00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,000
[Episode 28]

2
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,640
Miss Yali, if you may.

3
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,919
Your Highness, I'll go and take a look.

4
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,460
Go on.

5
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,839
Father.

6
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,399
Focus when you are playing the lute.

7
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,980
Come, let me show you how.

8
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Man Yao, you never cease to amaze me.

9
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,879
I am still an amateur.

10
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,239
My lack of control broke the cord and caused that awful sound.

11
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,260
I apologize for that.

12
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,039
You may be an amateur,

13
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,680
but the song you played has a vigorous spirit.

14
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,320
Each of you have your own prowess.

15
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600
Indeed.

16
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
The melody of your song was more elegant than what Yali played.

17
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,799
But you still have a lot of training to do.

18
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,620
There were still some mistakes.

19
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,359
Your Majesty, you enjoyed both the tea and the music.

20
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:32,519
It's about time. We should go now.

21
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,040
Goodbye, Your Majesty and Empress.

22
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,480
General Fu, send the empress back to the palace.

23
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,379
There are some matters... I must discuss with Lady Rong Le in private.

24
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

25
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,620
Empress, if you may.

26
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,300
- Move on.
- Yes.

27
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,200
Goodbye, Empress.

28
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,119
Your Majesty, I finally realized...

29
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,060
there are always people with more talents than we do.

30
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,559
I wish to learn from Lady Rong Le.

31
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,099
I will be in Prince Li's manor in a few days.

32
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,219
I was thinking about playing some new songs for him.

33
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,620
Sure, I understand what you are trying to do.

34
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,519
General Fu, let Yali stay for a couple of days.

35
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,679
Let Lady Rong Le share some of her techniques with Yali.

36
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:09,500
Your wish is my command, Empress.

37
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,360
Your Majesty, you wish to talk to me?

38
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,020
Calm down, I come in peace.

39
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,319
When I met you at Lady Yun's tomb,

40
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:39,540
I knew that you were not one that would cross the line.

41
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,239
Now that we meet again,

42
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:44,520
I can tell you are special.

43
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

44
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,460
That melody of yours... carries an intense and strong message,

45
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,839
so strong that it felt like the charging of an army.

46
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,759
It reminds me of the time I spent on the battlefield.

47
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,800
It is reminiscent of my past.

48
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,819
I know. You care for the peace of the world.

49
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,259
Even if your homeland gave up on you,

50
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,919
you never stop defending the pride of its people.

51
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,520
I had always held prejudice against you.

52
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,620
But I finally understand why Wuyou is so madly in love with you.

53
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,919
Your Majesty, you told me to never overstep the line.

54
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,200
Why are you telling me these now?

55
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,560
That is because I remember what happened in the past.

56
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,499
I feel like I should not let Wuyou repeat the same mistake as mine.

57
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:43,860
I don't want him to live in regret like me.

58
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,620
So, I am asking for your thoughts on his behalf.

59
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,840
I don't know.

60
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,930
Reconsider what I said.

61
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,900
It took me so long to realize.

62
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,580
If you want to live without regret,

63
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,040
you must cherish what you have.

64
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,219
The small gathering with you was very pleasant.

65
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,439
Your Majesty came to visit us in person,

66
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:24,460
I am greatly honored and grateful.

67
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,759
You are one of the most important officers.

68
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,920
You contributed to the peace of the land.

69
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,980
I granted you this marriage...

70
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,199
as it was supposed to be a reward.

71
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,880
But I never expected it would turn out to be a joke.

72
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,679
You are mocked by many.

73
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:48,239
I know it must have been hard on you.

74
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:50,360
Not at all, Your Majesty.

75
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,359
For my emperor and the nation,

76
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,079
this is what I should do.

77
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,660
You are very devoted.

78
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,120
But I cannot be a heartless emperor...

79
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,040
and let you suffer from humiliation.

80
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,900
The marriage alliance with Western Qi is as good as an empty hush.

81
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,059
This is why I have decided to terminate this marriage.

82
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,559
No, Your Majesty.

83
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,679
There is no interest for us to gain from the marriage alliance.

84
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,399
There is no need for it to continue.

85
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,280
Do you have another opinion about this decision?

86
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,000
My marriage with Rong Le was for the sake of our nations.

87
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But after spending months together,

88
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have grown very fond of Rong Le.

89
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,100
I don't want to leave her.

90
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,200
I hope Your Majesty can withdraw that decision.

91
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,100
What about you?

92
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,400
Why? Do you also grow fond of General Fu?

93
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
You don't want to leave him?

94
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,600
Ever since we are married,

95
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,500
General Fu has never mistreated me.

96
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,300
I know I have brought him shame.

97
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,600
I don't deserve to be his wife.

98
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,000
I am willing to accept Your Majesty's decision.

99
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,300
I will accept this dissolution.

100
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,900
Since you understand the gravity of this matter, then so be it.

101
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,800
General Fu, submit your letter of dissolution as soon as possible.

102
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,000
Princess' house is so noisy.

103
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Those people charged right into her house

104
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
wearing those weird clothes.

105
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,700
They walked in like they are the bosses around.

106
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,800
That was so rude.

107
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
Come again!

108
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Lady, you didn't pay for that!

109
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Pay for what?

110
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,700
You took my food and pretend nothing happened?

111
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,400
It's just some candied berries.

112
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Had you spoken nicely I might have even give it to you.

113
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,900
Now that you stole from me, and you lied!

114
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,800
I am taking you to the officers.

115
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,100
What?

116
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,600
Stop! Everyone, gather around!

117
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,700
Everyone, gather around! Look!

118
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,400
- What is going on?
- Gather around!

119
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,700
Gather around.

120
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,400
This lady over here took the food from my stall.

121
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,800
She refuses to pay and denies knowing anything!

122
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,500
Gather around!

123
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,400
This girl took the food from me and didn't pay!

124
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,700
How should I deal with her now?

125
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,900
This girl took the food from me and didn't pay!

126
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,600
She lied about it!

127
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Everyone, be my witness. I am taking her to the officers.

128
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,300
Sir, excuse me. This is my sister.

129
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
She has some mental problems.

130
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,200
She sneaked out while we weren't looking.

131
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,300
Would you be so generous and let her go this time?

132
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,400
There you go.

133
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,000
Judging by your outfit, you seem to be from a rich family.

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,700
If she is ill, why didn't you take her to a doctor?

135
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,200
And now she took my stuff and caused me trouble.

136
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,500
Fine, I will let it slide this time.

137
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,700
Back to your work!

138
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,200
- You can go now.
- It's okay.

139
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Everything is fine here.

140
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
- Get up.
- Don't touch me.

141
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,600
It's you again! How dare you touch me!

142
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,999
Don't use your poison on me.

143
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,600
I just saved your neck.

144
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Then do me a favor.

145
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
You are in the capital.

146
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,900
You are not in the mountain anymore.

147
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,200
If you want something or get anything done,

148
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
you need money to pay for them.

149
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,700
- Do you get it?
- Are you going to help me?

150
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,400
Okay, what is it?

151
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
A bunch of people just came to the princess' house.

152
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
They walked right in without a word.

153
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,700
The Moon Embrace Teahouse may be noisy,

154
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,800
but at least no one is trespassing.

155
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,600
Are you seriously asking me to bring Man Yao out of the manor?

156
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
You really are a nutcase.

157
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,600
It's the General of Defense's manor.

158
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,400
It's heavily guarded. Who would dare to trespass?

159
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
I am telling the truth.

160
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,100
Are you helping me or not?

161
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,200
If you won't, not only will I make you feel the itch,

162
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,800
I will make you feel the pain for days!

163
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Fine, you won.

164
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200
I am going with you.

165
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
Come.

166
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,799
Ling Yue.

167
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,400
- Did you find her?
- No.

168
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
- Let's go inside and look.
- Let's go.

169
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,800
Sir Xiao, you know the rules here.

170
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,700
No one can enter or leave the manor.

171
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,600
- But I am...
- Brother!

172
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,300
- Ke'er?
- Ke'er.

173
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,200
Come over here.

174
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Where did you go?

175
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
I went to get us help.

176
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,700
Prince Chen, I know you enjoy the company of women,

177
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,000
but please stay away from my sister.

178
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,700
This is none of my business.

179
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,000
You and your sister sure love to wrong the good guys.

180
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I found her on the street.

181
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
She insisted that I come with her.

182
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,400
She mentioned there arepeople making noises here.

183
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,200
Please, Your Highness, His Majesty is visiting the manor.

184
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,000
He is still inside.

185
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,000
I was just passing by.

186
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Take it as I was never here.

187
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,000
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

188
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,200
- Ke'er.
- Where are you going?

189
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,100
Brother? Brother?

190
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,000
Brother, I get what you are doing.

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
In order to protect Man Yao, you went to great efforts.

192
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,800
You sent your men to watch over her house.

193
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,900
Both you and I know that... Fu Chou is planning something ill.

194
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,700
Man Yao will most likely be caught up in it.

195
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,200
But I was so surprised today.

196
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,400
I never thought our father would go in person...

197
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,600
just to make Fu Chou end the marriage.

198
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,100
He is doing it for your own good.

199
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,800
If Man Yao is freed, you can be with her again.

200
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,000
This is great.

201
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,500
But to win her back, it will take true love.

202
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,900
Any means by force... will only push her away from me.

203
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,800
However, leaving General Fu... is still what's best for her.

204
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes, we also severed the connection between Fu Chou and Qi.

205
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
It's two birds with one stone.

206
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
Father made a very wise move!

207
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
I am afraid Fu Chou won't give up so easily.

208
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Perhaps behind all of his patience,

209
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
a greater plot is brewing.

210
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
Your Highness.

211
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,900
Your Highness, it's from the Hidden Ones.

212
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,300
There are disturbances in the south.

213
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,900
Agent Wu wishes to remind you...

214
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,800
the main routes in the south are blocked by natural and human causes.

215
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,700
Delivery of messages will be obstructed.

216
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,300
If anything does happen,

217
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,500
we might not receive the news at once.

218
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,100
I knew it.

219
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,700
Someone might use the campaign as an opening for an uprising.

220
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,300
My father set his mind on taking down Wei,

221
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,200
but there are others that wait to strike from the dark.

222
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Leng Yan, inform the Hidden Ones.

223
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
There is a change of plans.

224
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,100
Defense of the south is our priority.

225
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,600
Yes.

226
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
- General Fu, I am...
- Get out!

227
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
You can talk to me,

228
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,800
but please show some respect.

229
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
You are jealous because of Yali and Zongzheng Wuyou.

230
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,700
While the Emperor and Empress were here,

231
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,500
you tried to show off your skill to Zongzheng Wuyou's fiancée.

232
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
When you did that,

233
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,800
had you thought about respecting me?

234
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
You took it wrongly.

235
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,500
- Your shoulder was...
- I misunderstood?

236
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,600
Haven't you noticed?

237
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
You have been overstepping the line since he returned to the capital.

238
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
You were in the water with him at Linglong Palace. I let it pass.

239
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
On Zhao Yun's wedding day,

240
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
you two spent the night at the inn, I let that pass too.

241
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,800
You were secretly meeting him in the tomb, I look past that too!

242
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,200
Do you know what the tomb means to me?

243
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,600
It's humiliation.

244
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,200
The greatest shaming of all!

245
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
If you know everything, you should realize that...

246
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,600
all of those are mere coincidence.

247
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200
- The Linglong Palace...
- It's coincidence?

248
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Once? Maybe.

249
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,400
Twice? Maybe.

250
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,600
But it happened again and again.

251
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,100
How is that coincidence?

252
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,400
Rong Le, when it comes to Zongzheng Wuyou,

253
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
you will always forget that I am your husband.

254
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,500
So this is how you see me?

255
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,200
Every time I came back here, I could feel someone watching me.

256
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,400
You were spying on me, eavesdropping, and tailing me.

257
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
You are living under fear and suspicion.

258
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
You don't even have the slightest trust for me.

259
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
What more do you expect from me?

260
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,600
I want to be there for you all the time.

261
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,000
Every time I come home, the first thing I want...

262
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,100
is to see your face and hear your voice.

263
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,300
But what do I get in the end?

264
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Zongzheng Wuyou refused to marry you.

265
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
His Majesty searched for a replacement.

266
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,600
Now that Zongzheng Wuyou is deeply in love with you,

267
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,200
he wants me to end this marriage.

268
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,800
What is this all about?

269
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
Do you take me as a fool?

270
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,000
The emperor wants to terminate this marriage,

271
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
and you said you don't deserve me.

272
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Such a noble excuse!

273
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,000
All of you only ever care about Zongzheng Wuyou!

274
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
You only care about Zongzheng Wuyou!

275
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,100
What am I? What I am to you?

276
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,000
Why is everyone giving up on me because of him?

277
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
- Why?
- Let go of me!

278
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Today, I will let you know you are my wife!

279
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Let go of me! Let go of me!

280
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Let go of me!

281
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,600
Your broke our agreement.

282
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,000
I have nothing more to say to you.

283
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
From now on, we will never see each other again.

284
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,800
If you really want to leave,

285
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,400
I won't stop you.

286
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,600
But I hope... for the sake of my reputation...

287
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,800
and the alliance between Western Qi and Northern Lin,

288
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,300
for the next three months, please don't meet Zongzheng Wuyou again.

289
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,600
If you won't agree with this,

290
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,000
I would rather have the two of us die in here.

291
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Fine.

292
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
You have my word.

293
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,200
After three months, it's all over for the two of us.

294
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,000
♫ I can't help but to ask after you ♫ -

295
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,300
♫ Our hearts are a lifetime apart ♫

296
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,000
♫ No one comes, also no one asks ♫

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,800
♫ How do we keep living this life? ♫

298
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,400
♫ Finally, I've learned how to trust ♫ -

299
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,600
♫ But I've underestimated love and hate ♫ -

300
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,300
♫ We've thrown away fate that we'd received by chance ♫ -

301
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,000
♫ I have to admit to my mistakes ♫

302
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,800
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

303

♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

306
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,500
General Fu, why are you doing this?

307
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,300
That was embarrassing.

308
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,500
I shall send you home right away.

309
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,600
No, I am not leaving!

310
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Don't you understand my love for you?

311

♫ I must preserve the memories that are wonderful ♫

312

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,400
♫ My heart is beating senselessly ♫

314
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,800
Miss Sun, what exactly do you want?

315
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,700
All the officers in the Imperial Court know that Prince Li is your fiancé.

316
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
No!

317
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,200
You know what I mean.

318
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,600
Prince Li is just using me as an excuse.

319
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,200
It's just like the marriage you had with Rong Le.

320
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,200
I always suspected you were not having any joy in this marriage.

321
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,400
But today, I finally know the two of us are the same.

322
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,900
We are all shackled by love.

323
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I really do love you.

324
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,400
You are the only one I will love.

325
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,800
If you can't escape from this fake marriage,

326
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
I am willing to spend my life with you.

327
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,200
I don't care if I am banished from my family.

328
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,200
I don't care... if I can only become a lowly servant of yours.

329
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,400
I will be there for you.

330
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,600
♫ I won't let our love be a regret ♫

331
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,200
♫ Living without sorrow, dying without any hate ♫

332
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,600
♫ This is the leniency that you've shown to me ♫

333
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,900
♫ We are not holding hands, but you are holding my heart ♫

334
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,400
♫ Although this might not be forever ♫

335
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,800
♫ I've locked you in my heart and I've locked you in my dreams ♫

336
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,800
Princess, the curfew of the city is in effect.

337
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,200
If General Fu did something awful to you,

338
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
there is no need to leave in such a hurry.

339
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Xiao Sha, ready the carriage.

340
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,600
Ling Yue, pack up all the things.

341
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
I don't want to stay here for another moment.

342
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

343
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Your Highness.

344
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,100
Are we really leaving?

345
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,200
General Fu is actually very nice to you.

346
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,000
Look. After the two of you came back from Lady Yun's tomb,

347
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,800
you refused to wear this wedding gown for the wedlock ceremony.

348
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,000
But he didn't say anything about it.

349
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,800
He even hired the best tailor in the city to mend it.

350
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,000
After some repairing, it looks like new.

351
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,800
All General wanted was to see you wear this dress...

352
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,000
and become his real wife.

353
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,200
But you never even batted an eye for this dress.

354
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,400
It's been kept inside the closet.

355
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,200
It looks a little old now.

356
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,600
All his effort just went down the drain.

357
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,690
[Letter of Dissolution]

358
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,800
Rong Le.

359
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,000
It takes three lifetimes of fate to become husband and wife.

360
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,200
We may be married,

361
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,100
but the two of us are not part of fate's plan.

362
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,200
I couldn't swallow it.

363
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,900
I forced you to be my wife.

364
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
It was our wedding day.

365
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,000
I still hold a wee bit of hope that in one year...

366
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,500
I can turn things around for us and be a real couple.

367
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,800
If while you are reading this letter...

368
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,200
and still have not the slightest bit of love for me or even hate me,

369
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
I am willing to set you free.

370
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,200
Let this be the end of us.

371
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
Let us part in peace.

372
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,600
Princess, are we taking this with us?

373
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,800
Take everything.

374
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,600
Don't leave anything behind.

375
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,100
Yes.

376
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,400
Have some tea.

377
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,000
General Fu wrote you this letter?

378
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,600
Have you thought about what you will do next?

379
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,000
Right now, I am just as lost as I was before.

380
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
When I am leaving, I am so determined and bold.

381
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,800
I just want to leave this place for good.

382
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,000
I won't let them hurt or use me again.

383
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
I want to leave this cage.

384
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,500
But when I step out of it,

385
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,400
as soon as I walk out from the shadow,

386
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,800
I have no idea...

387
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,200
what danger lies ahead of us.

388
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,300
You mean...

389
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,400
not only will you leave the manor,

390
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
you are also leaving Zhongshan?

391
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,200
I must sever all ties with Fu Chou.

392
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
He is frustrated, so am I.

393
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,500
Three months from now, all the burden will be released.

394
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,200
I will leave Zhongshan.

395
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,700
But if you leave just like that,

396
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,400
aren't you going to find out who you are?

397
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,900
I remember you saying that...

398
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,000
the secret of your past might be hidden inside Fort Yu.

399
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,400
I remember now.

400
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,200
While I was playing the lute,

401
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,600
some flashes of memories came to me.

402
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
Perhaps Ke'er's treatment...

403
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
is making those memories much clearer for me.

404
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,100
Why don't we go to Fort Yu before you leave this place?

405
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,200
It might bring back even more memories of the past.

406
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,100
Miss Man Yao, do you know the person on this drawing?

407
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,900
It feels familiar to me, but I am not sure.

408
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,600
I hope this is the truth.

409
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,400
With that, I can know for sure...

410
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,500
that I once had a mother and a happy family.

411
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,400
But I also wish it's not the truth.

412
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,800
I don't have to face the truth of my family being killed...

413
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
and the pain of losing everything again.

414
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Please, don't see it that way.

415
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,200
Sir Qin may be dead,

416
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,400
but he lives on inside the people's hearts.

417
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,300
After I got here,

418
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,500
it reminds me a lot of my childhood.

419
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,000
What do you remember?

420
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,600
You have been here before?

421
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,500
Maybe.

422
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,400
Everything here seems so familiar to me.

423
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
When my father wrote...

424
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,200
"The Book of Mountains and Rivers" with Sir Qin,

425
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
this is where they were.

426
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,800
The woman on the drawing would be Lady Qin.

427
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,400
I remember she gave me some candies before.

428
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
What else can you recall?

429
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,000
Have you seen the two daughters of Sir Qin?

430
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,500
I wish we had more time.

431
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,600
We can spend more time here to recall the past.

432
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,700
Miss Man Yao, now that you are here,

433
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,800
it means you have found the book.

434
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,300
Why don't we look around?

435
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,900
Maybe we can find more clues.

436
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,500
The book is not with me.

437
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,400
Where are you keeping it?

438
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,400
You only told Long Yue about its location?

439
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,900
You must be curious...

440
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,600
about the fallout I had with Prince Li.

441
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,800
That's because I handed over the book to him.

442
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,600
But I later found out he was using me to get the book.

443
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,800
You mean... the book is now with Prince Li?

444
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,500
Yes.

445
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
I am sorry.

446
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,200
I cannot let you go.

447
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,800
Your Highness, there is a letter for you.

448
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,400
Your Majesty, the Court started over an hour ago.

449
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,200
We can't just wait and do nothing.

450
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,400
Father, you knew my brother had some objections to the campaign.

451
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Why must we wait for him to discuss it?

452
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,800
Besides, you know very well about his temper.

453
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Even if you drag him here,

454
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,400
he wouldn't give any constructive ideas.

455
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Just shut it.

456
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't care how many objections he has for the campaign.

457
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
There are rules to follow in the Imperial Court.

458
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,800
He can't just be absent without any reason.

459
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
I sent Captain Xiang to search for him.

460
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,700
Let's see what he has to say.

461
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
Captain Xiang arrives!

462
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
Your Majesty.

463
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,600
What took you so long? Where is Prince Li?

464
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,000
Your Majesty, when I arrived at the manor,

465
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,300
the guard said Prince Li left in the night and hasn't come back since.

466
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,000
I led my men to the places and shops His Highness frequented.

467
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But he is nowhere to be found.

468
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Curse him!

469
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,200
He hides himself right when I need him!

470
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,600
Does he think the campaign can't go on without him?

471
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Father, Wuyou was never been interested in the politics of the Imperial Court.

472
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
All the national affairs he worked on... are mere covers.

473
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,400
His old habits have started to kick in.

474
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,200
Father, just let him be.

475
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,900
I have some suggestions for the campaign.

476
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,200
I shall gladly discuss them with the fellow officers...

477
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
and be at your services.

478
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Forget it.

479
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,200
I am getting tired of this.

480
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,400
Let's get this over with and dismiss.

481
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,000
As for your plans, write them down and submit your proposal.

482
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,800
- I'll read it when I am free.
- Yes!

483
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,200
Dismissed!

484
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,300
Long live Your Majesty.

485
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,200
Rong Le?

486
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,300
Rong Le?

487
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,780
Where is she?

488
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
I don't know.

489
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,800
After the quarrel you had that day, she left in the night.

490
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
She hasn't come back since.

491
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,600
We never intervene with your matters with Lady Rong Le.

492
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,800
I wouldn't dare to stop her without your permission.

493
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,900
We could only let her leave.

494
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,800
Why didn't you inform me she was leaving?

495
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
- I apologize for that.
- Look for her now!

496
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,200
Yes, I will look for her right away.

497
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,600
I didn't have the courage to talk to you.

498
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,200
I couldn't face you.

499
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,800
But I never thought...

500
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,500
it was just my wishful thinking.

501
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,800
You were in such a hurry to leave me.

502
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
Can't you wait for another moment?

503
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,300
You broke our agreement.

504
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,200
I have nothing more to say to you.

505
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,400
From now on,

506
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,500
we will never see each other again.

507
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,600
Your Majesty, when I arrived at the manor,

508
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,200
the guard said Prince Li left in the night and hasn't come back since.

509
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,200
I brought this down upon myself.

510
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,000
I can't even have a fake marriage.

511
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,100
Rong Le, I should have sworn...

512
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,400
to never deceive you again on our wedding day.

513
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,300
That dissolution letter took me fourteen times just to complete it.

514
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,100
But I never thought you would be so cruel.

515
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,500
As soon as you are freed, you eloped with him.

516
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
Hen Xiang?

517
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,800
What are you doing here?

518
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,900
Are you searching for Rong Le?

519
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,600
Is this all your doing?

520
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,000
Tell me where she is now!

521
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,300
So, in your eyes,

522
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,700
every harm done to her is my doing?

523
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
But not this time.

524
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,400
It's Chen Yu, the person she trusts the most.

525
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,800
Chen Yu?

526
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,000
As for Chen Yu's true identity,

527
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
not even our master knows about her.

528
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,400
I don't know why she would take Rong Le with her.

529
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,500
But we found out that she informed Zongzheng Wuyou.

530
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,800
We can know her target is not Rong Le.

531
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,600
We have Zongzheng Wuyou to rescue Rong Le.

532
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,400
You don't need to worry.

533
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,600
Are you sure Zongzheng Wuyou will be there?

534
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,200
If he doesn't go, Rong Le will be in grave danger.

535
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
He definitely will.

536
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,800
We tried it so many times, isn't that right?

537
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,300
I can't trust him.

538
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
Stand aside.

539
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,600
Zongzheng Wuyou is not the one you can't trust.

540
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,200
You are afraid after he saves Rong Le,

541
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,100
they will fall in love again.

542
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,400
Stand aside!

543
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,500
Young Master, our plan is in motion.

544
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,600
This is a crucial time for us.

545
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,800
There are other matters you must see to.

546
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,700
You can't give up the greater good for the sake of a woman.

547
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,000
I know what the greater good is.

548
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,200
I don't need you to lecture me.

549
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,100
Stand aside now...

550
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,400
or I won't show any mercy.

551
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,200
You can't go!

552
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Even if you kill me,

553
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,000
I still won't let you go to her.

554
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But if I am dead,

555
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,900
no one in this world will ever truly care for you.

556
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,350
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

557
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:25,800
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

558
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:34,400
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

559
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,900
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

560
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,000
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

561
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:52,400
♫ You are keeping me out with your care,
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

562
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,000
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

563
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,600
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

564
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:10,700
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

565
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,600
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

566
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,800
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

567
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:28,400
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

568
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,600
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

569
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,300
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

570
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:48,400
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

571
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,200
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

572
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,600
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

573
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:09,800
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
