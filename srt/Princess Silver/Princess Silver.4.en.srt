[Episode 4]

2
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,379
But this letter means nothing to me.

3
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,400
It's not worth a person's life.

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,180
Brother!

5
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,000
But for me, Miss Chen Yu is worth more than any treasure.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,739
Fine.

7
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,980
You may trade your hand...

8
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,020
for her life.

9
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,299
I have no other forte.

10
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,939
My only strong point...

11
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,659
is that I know a little bit about the art of steeping.

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,339
I heard that you love tea.

13
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,059
At first, I thought that if I can show my skills in front of you,

14
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,480
I would live a life with no regrets.

15
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,419
But from the looks of it now,

16
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,820
I will not have that chance anymore.

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,640
Can you lend me your sword?

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,659
- Leng Yan.
- Yes, Your Highness.

19
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,140
My sword.

20
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,520
Brother, wait for me.

21
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,180
I thought he was going to kill us all.

22
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,700
Madam Qin.

23
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,379
Since Miss Chen Yu has offended Prince Li,

24
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,979
she'll only bring trouble for you if she stays here.

25
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,739
I'm very close with Prince Li.

26
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,539
I can buy her from you.

27
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,520
But now, she has no value anymore.

28
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,139
Chen Yu was once the famous steal of the show here.

29
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,779
How much do you want?

30
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,080
- 500 tael.
- 100 tael.

31
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,139
I had taken care of her for so many years.

32
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,600
- 100 tael is not enough.
- 50 tael.

33
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,520
100 tael and no less. She's considered sold to you.

34
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,219
What a wench you are.

35
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,899
How dare you ruin my business.

36
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,660
Go now!

37
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,400
Thank you, Mister.

Owner.

40
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,280
Thank you for your kindness.

41
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,699
This is Long Yue.

42
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,459
Long Yue, she is the new instrumentalist that I hired,

43
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,600
Chen Yu.

44
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,739
From now on, you can stay in the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

45
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,459
You had taken good care of me.

46
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,019
If you want to ask me anything,

47
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,500
I'll gladly answer your question without pause.

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,140
Quick, get up now.

49
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,939
Your father is the former subordinate of Chief Minister Qin.

50
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,379
I think you know a thing or two about Qin family.

51
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,460
I wonder if you have heard about The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

52
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,859
Yes.

53
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,499
My father was once the co-writer of this book.

54
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,860
Where is this book now?

55
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,059
I've no clue. I was only seven when they confiscated the house.

56
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,080
My father hit me unconscious and asked somebody to bring me away.

57
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,299
When I woke up, everything had changed.

58
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,699
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,580
I've reminded you of your depressing past.

60
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,980
This is my fate. It's not your fault.

61
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,939
From then on, I was stripped to nothing...

62
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,420
and led a vagabond life.

63
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,660
And after that, I never heard anything about the Qin family.

64
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,539
Miss, for the things that you ask me today,

65
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,339
I'll not tell anybody about it...

66
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,720
and I'll bring this secret to my grave.

67
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,539
- Long Yue.
- Bring her to her room to rest.

68
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,280
- Yes, Owner.
- Thank you, Miss.

69
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,180
This way, please.

70
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,339
It is indeed the work of the crown prince and his gang.

71
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,859
Brother, if we continue to investigate along this evidence,

72
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,379
we can bring him down for sure.

73
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,940
We can't let Sir Zhao die for nothing.

74
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,299
By the way, the owner of Moon Embrace Teahouse...

75
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,899
is indeed courageous.

76
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,699
If we can really reveal the truth of this case,

77
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,299
she would have done the country a good deed.

78
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,659
She is not as simple as you think she is.

79
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,699
She didn't lie but she was not telling the truth either.

80
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,019
I think she already...

81
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,019
discovered this letter since a long time ago.

82
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,380
As for the matter regarding Chen Yu,

83
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,020
I think that mistress is the only one...

84
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,940
who dares to complicate things for me.

85
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,400
Who is it?

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,120

- Captain, the kitchen is on fire.

- Princess.
- Where is Lian Xin?

- Fire!
- Please stay calm.

I'll check on Lian Xin.

99

The kitchen is quite far from here. Please wait inside the room.

100

Don't go near the fire.

101

Don't be afraid.

- The guards are doing patrol when...

107
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,459
we spotted the flames here.

We are ordered to protect the princess and the safety of this city.

109

- We can help with the fire.
- You came at the right time.

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,819
We don't have enough people here.

- Yes, Sir!

- Step aside! Princess.
- I was sleeping just now.

Then I saw someone walking up to me and tried to take advantage of me.

163

I was so scared. So, I hit him with a vase and ran outside.

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,499
If any of you dare to stop me,

168
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,100
don't blame me for being heartless towards you.

169
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,320
Our dereliction of duty has caused such disgrace to you, My Princess.

170
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,400
Please punish us.

171
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,920
Stop, Xiao Sha.

172
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,620
I'm getting a headache.

173
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,499
Princess.

174
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,699
Princess, are you all right?

175
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,760
Are you all right, Princess?

176
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,299
Your Majesty, the pulse condition of the princess is chaotic.

177
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,299
I think she was too frightened...

178
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,379
until it caused her a headache.

179
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,579
She needs to rest well.

180
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,180
I'll treat her again after a few days.

181
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,499
All right, you may leave.

182
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,780
I'll take my leave then.

183
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,379
Scoundrel.

184
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,779
How dare you do something so obscene.

185
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,139
You are a disgrace to our country.

186
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,739
Why do I need to keep you?

187
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,219
My sins are punishable by death.

188
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,739
But it was an emergency.

189
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,139
I went into the princess's room in order to pursue the assassin.

190
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,259
All the servants in the Princess Manor can attest to that.

191
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,259
I went into the princess's room...

192
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,939
and fell onto her bed after I was wounded by the assassin.

193
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,939
I thought that the princess fancied me.

194
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,419
That's why I acted inappropriately.

195
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,419
But all in all, I just wanted to protect the princess.

196
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,859
I fancy the princess.

197
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,859
I'm willing to atone for my misbehavior.

198
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,220
Such nonsense!

199
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,579
You said that you were there to arrest the assassin.

200
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,579
Where is the assassin?

201
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,779
The people that you brought along can attest that...

202
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,059
when I opened the door, you were the only one inside.

203
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,699
We didn't see any assassin.

204
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,939
I'm innocent.

205
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,979
I really went into the princess's room in pursuit of the assassin.

206
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,419
After that, I lost to the enemy...

207
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,179
and he managed to escape.

208
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,659
General Yu.

209
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,159
You made up the story... about that assassin.

210
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,179
The assassin is fake.

211
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,240
The truth is, you wanted to take advantage of the princess.

212
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,800
Your Majesty.

213
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,940
Ever since the princess has come here...

214
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,939
First, she was barred from coming in.

215
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,800
Then, she was rejected in a full court.

216
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,819
Now, General Yu is creating a story about an assassin...

217
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,459
in order to destroy my princess's innocence.

218
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,059
So much humiliation.

219
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,019
Looks like Northern Lin...

220
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,659
is treating Western Qi as a nobody.

221
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,619
May I ask, where is the etiquette of Northern Lin?

222
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,399
Where is the sincerity from this alliance?

223
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,359
Your Majesty, I didn't teach my son well...

224
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:50,219
until he did this kind of thing that will bring harm to the country.

225
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,339
After I heard the news yesterday, I searched the whole city immediately.

226
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,499
And I managed to arrest the assassin.

227
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,899
You can interrogate him.

228
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,620
Bring him in.

229
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,419
Your Majesty, he has already confessed his crime.

230
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,979
He is the spy planted in our country by Chen.

231
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,259
He wanted to assassinate the princess in order to...

232
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,880
destroy the alliance between us and Western Qi.

233
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,059
I already asked...

234
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,699
those guards that went along with my son yesterday night.

235
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,219
They said that this man...

236
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,760
looks like the assassin who barged into the Princess Manor yesterday.

237
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,880
Take him away and off with his head.

238
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,499
This time, it's my subject who had done you wrong.

239
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,139
As for how to deal with him,

240
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,200
it'll be up to you, Princess.

241
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,340
Your Majesty,

242
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,179
I think that no matter if it's a misunderstanding or not,

243
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,500
I hope that we can resolve this quietly.

244
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,219
I'm an unmarried woman.

245
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,619
And I came to Northern Lin for this alliance marriage.

246
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,579
First, I don't wish to make a big fuss about this matter...

247
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,040
because it'll ruin my reputation.

248
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,419
Secondly, if my brother hears about this news,

249
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,379
he'll be distressed and anxious.

250
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,339
And it will affect the relationship between the two countries.

251
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,219
The princess is indeed very virtuous.

252
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,940
Thank you, Princess.

253
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,060
Princess, do you have any other requests?

254
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,040
Princess.

255
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,419
Your Majesty, I have a severe headache.

256
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,340
I just want to rest.

257
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,619
Your Majesty, I think that...

258
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,419
the assassin can barge into Princess Manor while there was no one...

259
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,579
because the guards don't really understand her living habit.

260
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,539
That's why there was an oversight.

261
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,139
Please return the guards of Western Qi back to Princess Manor.

262
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,099
I don't trust anybody else besides them.

263
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,160
All right, I'll grant your wish.

264
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

265
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,580
Yu Wenjie, although it's with reason,

266
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,020
it's still true that...you had offended the princess.

267
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,659
No capital punishment, but you'll be punished nevertheless.

268
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,039
Fifty beatings... and two ranks down.

269
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,440
- Bring him away.
- Yes, Your Majesty!

270
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,400
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

271
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,820
I'm innocent!

272
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,200
Father!

273
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,179
I'm innocent!

274
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,819
Your Majesty, I don't feel well.

275
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,539
I'll take my leave first.

276
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,460
Please go back and rest.

277
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,779
Princess, all the guards from Northern Lin have been changed.

278
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,640
Now, we are surrounded only by our guards and Madam Qiu Yi is here.

279
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,940
Princess.

280
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,059
Princess, if you still need my service after this,

281
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,940
please don't forget to come to me.

282
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,699
Madam, the way you said it, those who know will think that you are diligent.

283
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,099
Those who don't will think that our princess...

284
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,240
chased you away because she's petty.

285
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,459
Move along then.

286
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,260
Move along.

287
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,140
I'll take my leave.

288
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,260
- Xiao Sha.
- Yes, Princess.

289
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,819
- Princess.
- Minister Yu had found a scapegoat.

290
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,819
And we can't revolt against Northern Lin.

291
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,259
Although the real assassin is in our hands, we can't expose them.

292
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,819
From now on, we have to be more careful.

293
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,360
Yes, Princess.

294
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,219
Ling Yue and Lian Xin must have been in a shock, too.

295
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,580
Lian Xin, treat your wound with care.

296
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,339
Now, the manor is surrounded by our people.

297
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,940
Both of you can be more relaxed.

298
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,139
By the way, where is the assassin that was knocked unconscious?

299
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,059
That day, after I changed...

300
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,179
and came out from the room, I saw that the hiding spot for the assassin...

301
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,299
was not very secure. I was afraid that he'd cause trouble if he woke up.

302
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,379
That's why me and Lian Xin tied up his hands and legs...

303
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,099
and threw him into the firewood storeroom.

304
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,819
After that, we rushed to your side...

305
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,179
and we don't know what happened next.

306
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,140
That's right.

307
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,680
I already took care of him.

308
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,760
Are you all right?

309
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm all right. The princess cameright on time yesterday.

310
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,699
I had failed my duty...

311
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,659
and gave those low-lives an opportunity to cause harm.

312
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,640
Don't worry. I'll not let that person off the hook so easily.

313
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,259
Actually, you don't need to feel unfair towards me.

314
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,659
This kind of grievance is nothing.

315
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,280
Our main concern is the princess. We can't let the princess be affected.

316
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,700
This is for you.

317
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,080
I had already washed it.

318
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,020
I'll return it to you.

319
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,139
Your Majesty, Prince Fanyang is here.

320
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,260
Greetings, Your Majesty.

321
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,819
Xuanming.

322
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,899
Be at ease. Sit down.

323
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

324
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,059
Xuanming.

325
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,699
What do you think about the assassination attempt that happened...

326
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,280
in Princess Manor last time?

327
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,899
You already have your conclusion.

328
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,740
Why do you ask me?

329
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,379
This matter... is clearly the work of the crown prince and Yu Shihai.

330
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,779
But in order to preserve the dignity of Northern Lin,

331
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,140
I have to cover it up.

332
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,099
The crown prince has disappointed me so many times.

333
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,019
I'm really worried to entrust him with... the whole nation.

334
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,939
I know that your preferred choice for the crown prince is Wuyou.

335
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,619
But... the misunderstanding between you and Wuyou...

336
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,780
Today, it's Yun'er's death anniversary.

337
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,739
She had reminded me over and over... before her passing.

338
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,720
How can I not keep my word?

339
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,420
Yun'er.

340
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,360
Yun'er.

341
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,320
Your Majesty.

342
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,740
I don't have much time left.

343
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,880
Promise me.

344
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,240
Wuyou is a very sentimental person.

345
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,320
He has no interest in power.

346
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,640
If you force him,

347
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,840
you'll only push him into...

348
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,420
the abyss of endless sufferings.

349
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,900
Yun'er.

350
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,760
I...

351
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,080
If you really care about Wuyou,

352
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,560
when he grows up,

353
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,160
give him a rank where he can live freely.

354
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,800
Let him live a carefree life.

355
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,520
Promise me. Promise me.

356
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,720
Useless thing.

357
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,120
- Pardon me, Your Majesty.
- Get lost!

358
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,260
Quick.

359
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,019
Useless thing. You are not sensible at all.

360
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,400
How can you make a mistake today? Leave now.

361
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,060
Escort me.

362
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,820
Escort me to Yun's Tomb.

363
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,200
Your Majesty.

364
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,200
Brother.

365
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,060
[Yun's Tomb]

366
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,859
Lady Yun, I'm here to pay you respect.

367
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,440
I hope that you can rest in peace.

368
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,120
Father.

369
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,080
Why are you here?

370
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,280
When Lady Yun was still alive, I remember...

371
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,260
her care towards me.

372
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,700
For me, Lady Yun is just like my real mother.

373
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,139
Today is her death anniversary.

374
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,660
Of course, I need to come and pay her respect.

375
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,260
At least you still remember her care towards you.

376
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,160
Lady Yun, I remember your kindness towards me.

377
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,699
Don't worry. In this life,

378
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,000
I'll take good care of Wuyou...

379
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,060
just like how you had taken care of me.

380
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,300
[Yun's Tomb]

381
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,780
Mother.

382
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,500
I'm here to see you.

383
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,720
You are humble, modest,

384
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
and always compromised for the sake of others.

385
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,800
In the end,

386
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,000
remorse and regrets are the only things you get.

387
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,160
I promise you.

388
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,120
I won't be like that.

389
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,840
I'll live freely for my whole life.

390
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,420
I won't give anybody a chance to let me down.

391
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,020
Mother.

392
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,400
Yun'er.

393
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,660
I'm here to see you.

394
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,240
My mother doesn't want to see you.

395
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,560
You are the cause of her death.

396
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,480
Please leave.

397
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,280
Fu Yuan had spiked my drinks.

398
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,020
And that's why...

399
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,800
I hurt Yun'er.

400
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,240
You brought Fu Yuan here, have you forgotten?

401
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,740
In order to gain power,

402
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,939
in order to secure your position,

403
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,000
you betrayed your promise to my mother.

404
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,820
You married with others. You have an imperial harem.

405
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,400
You are the one who broke her heart and ended her life.

406
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,800
I had no other choice.

407
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,760
Everything I did was for our country.

408
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,659
I did it for the greater cause of the Zongzheng family.

409
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,240
Your Majesty.

410
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,240
You are too greedy.

411
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,019
You just sized up the situation and took everything beneficial to you.

412
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,640
You clearly know that in this life, you can't be loyal to one woman only.

413
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,480
But in order to gain my mother's heart,

414
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,980
you made a false promise.

415
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,979
You tricked her.

416
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,080
Your mother is the only one I love.

417
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,940
Why can't you be understanding of me?

418
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,780
Why should I be understanding towards you?

419
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,800
Because of your lies and your betrayal,

420
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,960
my mother had suffered her whole life in depression.

421
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Wuyou, your mother's death...

422
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,240
hurt me more than it hurt you.

423
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,460
She has left us for 16 years.

424
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,210
Are you going to blame me forever?

425
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,560
Yes.

426
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,140
I won't forgive you.

427
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,980
You'll disturb my mother... if you stay here.

428
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,680
Please leave.

429
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,530
According to a secret message from the kite, the fire in Princess Manor...

430
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,440
was indeed planned by the father-son duo of the Yu family.

431
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,580
Anything else?

432
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,540
Qiu Yi, the housekeeper from Princess Manor...

433
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,219
went missing after that day.

434
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,120
But not long ago, we found her dead inside a manor in a village.

435
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,220
I think she had accepted the bribe from the Yu family.

436
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,080
But after the plan failed, she was silenced with death.

437
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,400
This father-son duo from the Yu family is indeed cruel and merciless.

438
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,379
The Yu family has stayed in Northern Lin for three generations.

439
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,280
Their power is deeply rooted here.

440
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,020
And they help the crown prince with his personal gain.

441
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,360
In the future, you have to guard against them.

442
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,000
However, when I investigated the father-son duo of the Yu family,

443
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,560
I found a clue about The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

444
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,480
The Yu family is related to The Book of Mountains and Rivers as well?

445
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,740
The Yu family's fort didn't belong to them originally.

446
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,019
That mansion used to be the house of Qin Yong.

447
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,539
After Qin Yong and his family were killed,

448
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,199
it was given to the new minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Yu Shihai.

449
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:56,360
Qin Yong?

450
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,080
So, did you find anything in the Yu family's fort?

451
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,200
Yu Shihai is a very petty and cautious man.

452
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,560
He renovated the whole mansion after he got it.

453
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,860
And he turned the mansion into a well-guarded fort.

454
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,320
Now, the Yu family is very well-known.

455
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,740
That is because... many people have forgotten

456
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,140
that it was once the house of Qin Yong.

457
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,980
Report this news to my brother immediately.

458
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,379
One more thing. Please pass this letter to him.

459
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,780
Yes, Princess.

460
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,760
Miss Long Yue. Prince Li is here.

461
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,360
- He is alone?
- Yes.

462
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,280
Today is his mother, Imperial Consort Yun's death anniversary.

463
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,720
Why would he come here?

464
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

465
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,800
I didn't get a good look before.

466
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,420
But the scenery here is amazing.

467
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,900
This is indeed the best teahouse in Zhongshan.

468
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,060
Thank you for the compliment.

469
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,320
But Moon Embrace Teahouse is not famous for its scenery...

470
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,960
but for it's tea.

471
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,739
I had tasted the tea from Moon Embrace Teahouse quite a few times.

472
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,820
I don't think that it's any special.

473
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:00,080
I think the way to enjoy tea is not about the tea itself...

474
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,380
but the state of mind one has when one drinks tea.

475
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,880
How about you taste it again today?

476
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,340
All right.

477
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,780
Taste it, Your Highness.

478
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,220
You said that tea tasting is about the state of mind.

479
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,400
What do you think about...

480
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,440
my state of mind right now?

481
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,340
Looks like you are troubled by something.

482
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,600
Looks like you know how to read a person, too.

483
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,620
Your Highness,

484
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,360
you can't change the past but you can build the future.

485
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,320
How about you relax your mind...

486
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,900
and taste the tea in earnest?

487
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,460
You are really different from the other girls that I had met.

488
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,920
You are smart and you talk very well.

489
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,040
Just that sometimes, you are too reckless.

490
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,820
You are indeed not as simple as you seem.

491
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,960
Just because we have no guidance,

492
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,380
it doesn't mean that we are uncultured.

493
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,040
You are not a simple man either.

494
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,779
Are you complimenting me...

495
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,760
or are you complimenting yourself?

496
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,140
You know how to play chess, right?

497
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,280
When we first started, you seemed unsure.

498
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,579
But after a few rounds,

499
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,879
you can obviously win the game...

500
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:51,859
but every time, you let me win instead.

501
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,120
And every time, you just play it half-heartedly.

502
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,939
It's been a long time since I last played so I'm quite rusty.

503
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,859
You are not in a good mood today.

504
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,440
So, I thought you wanted to relax by drinking tea.

505
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,019
Chess is just a game.

506
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,080
I don't think I need to be too serious about it.

507
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,640
Man Yao?

508
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,499
"Like the blooming flowers...

509
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,699
that are bright and colorful,

510
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,619
a lady is going to get married on a wondrous day."

511
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,680
Is that what your name means?

512
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,859
As for your name,

513
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,699
I think your parents...

514
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,220
hope that you can live a carefree life.

515
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,099
To be exact, it is to have nothing.

516
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,899
It means I'll have nothing.

517
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,779
I'll live an empty life, I'll have nothing...

518
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,700
and nothing will stay.

519
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,460
Since you are here, show yourselves.

520
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,960
♫ I think of you when the moon is full, ♫

521
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,500
♫ when it's a crescent and when it's white ♫

522
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:31,360
♫ You who came to a strange land to build our lands together ♫

523
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,319
♫ I think of you when night has fallen... ♫

524
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:41,480
♫ and when the fog has parted ♫

525
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,600
♫ My yearning for you has turned you into my reason ♫

526
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:55,400
♫ You are my happiness, my worries, and my abyss ♫

527
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:01,900
♫ I can't touch you for you are like the reflection in water ♫

528
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,879
♫ I don't want distance but I stayed away from you ♫

♫ I want to do it but I can't ♫

530

♫ I just want to watch you in this cold world ♫

531
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,020
♫ I'm envious of your shadow that follows you ♫

532
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,720
♫ Do you want to have a drink with me? ♫

533
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:36,200
♫ The useless tears that we are born with are for us to waste ♫

534
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,500
♫ Rather than having no worries and having a dull life ♫

535
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,659
♫ I'd rather pursue you ♫

536

♫ Even though the flower might wilt and I might fail... ♫

537
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,120
Brother.

538
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,200
You can touch women now?

539
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,340
- Search the place!
- Yes.

540
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,180
Brother.

541
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,699
Brother, why can you touch a woman now?

542
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,280
Brother, why did you break your taboo? What happened? Brother!

543
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,100
Mistress, are you all right?

544
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,539
Long Yue, this place has become a target.

545
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,979
We have to leave immediately.

546
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,760
Don't worry. I'll stay and tie up the ends.

547
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,260
