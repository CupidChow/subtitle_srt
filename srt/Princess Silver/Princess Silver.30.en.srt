00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
[Episode 30]

2
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,500
In order to have the upper hand,

3
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,000
I've decided to attack them first.

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,600
And this time, I'll lead the troops myself.

5
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,100
You can't do that, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,900
It's a long journey to Wei.

7
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,600
The battlefield is dangerous and unpredictable.

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,300
You are the master of this country.

9
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,700
You can't just go into war.

10
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,400
Sir Yang is right. Please reconsider your decision.

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Please reconsider your decision!

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,200
I've already made up my mind. No need to advise me against it.

13
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,000
For the war this time,

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,800
I'll bring along a right-hand man with me.

15
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,400
Father, I recommend Wuyou.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Wuyou has studied hard since young and is an expert in the art of war.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,600
If you bring Wuyou along, you'll gain a speedy success.

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,400
I'm willing to go into war to be of service as well.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Please allow me to do so.

20
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
No, Father. Although Wuyou is good in the art of war,

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
he lacks experience in an actual war. Rrather than bringing him along,

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,200
it's better to bring along a general who has fought countless battles.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,800
Please reconsider.

24
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
If so, in your opinion,

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,800
who will be the best choice?

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,500
Father, I recommend...

27
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Father, I've been away from military affairs for too long.

28
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,900
I don't know about the conditions of our generals.

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,500
How about you ask General Fu for his opinion?

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Your Majesty, I think that...

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Prince Chen is very right.

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Prince Li is an expert in the art of war.

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
And he had led the war at the southern border.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,600
And he knows the situations of every war like the back of his hand.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,100
He's a fast learner.

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,800
I feel inadequate compared to him.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
So I think,

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,700
it's best to bring along Prince Li for the war this time.

39
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Even General Fu has recommended Prince Li.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
All right.

41
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,600
Wuyou, you'll come along with me for the war against Wei.

42
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,700
I'm not willing.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,500
I already said that...

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,200
we need to pacify the people first before we attack others.

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,300
Now, there are pirates running wild along the coast.

46
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Western Qi and Chen are eyeing us covetously.

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,700
We suffer from natural continuous calamities and we are out of money.

48
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,400
The Southwest region is in a state of famine.

49
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
We have both domestic and foreign troubles.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,900
It's better for us if we wait until we are strong again...

51
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,400
and our people are well-rested and are in unity.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Only then can we send out our troops...

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
to bring peace to our country.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Nonsense.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,100
Northern Lin has enjoyed propitious weather and good harvest constantly.

56
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,500
The people are living peacefully and we are in unity.

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,100
We don't have calamities.

58
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,700
And we don't have domestic unrest or a famine problem.

59
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,200
What nonsense it is.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,600
Guards!

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Prince Li has disobeyed my order. The war is almost upon us.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
He has exaggerated things to cause alarm to the people.

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,300
Throw him out.

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,700
You sit in your precious palace all year long and you have...

65
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,400
no regards for the people's sufferings.

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
You just know how to praise yourself and try to cheat the people.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,000
My teacher was right back then.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
People like you will never be a brilliant emperor.

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Insolent fool! How dare you say that I'm not a brilliant emperor?

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,200
Unfilial son.

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
You are indeed the best student of Qin Yong.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,600
You never listen to me.

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,100
He has been gone for so many years.

74
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,000
But you still remember each and every word he has uttered.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Why are you standing there for? Throw him out!

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,800
No need!

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
I've never wanted to be here in the first place.

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,800
From now on, don't think that I'll ever come back again!

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,500
You!

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Get lost! Go back to your southern border!

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Don't come back every again!

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,000
- Father, Wuyou is just...
- Shut up!

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll throw you out if you say another word.

84
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
Please calm down.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Since Wuyou is not willing to go into war with you,

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
I would like to recommend the General of Defense to go with you.

87
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,600
General Fu is very experienced on the battlefield and has never lost in one.

88
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,300
He can help you achieve victory.

89
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,600
We'll go with Prince Fanyang's advice then.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,300
General Fu, get yourself prepared immediately.

91
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,200
You'll come along with me for the war in three days' time.

92
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,900
When I'm at war,

93
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,600
all public affairs will be handled by the crown prince

94
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
with Prince Chen as an assistant.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
The court is dismissed.

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you, Father.

97
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,500
Farewell, Your Majesty!

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,300
I heard that you are tagging along with him for the war against Wei.

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,600
He had moved 300,000 soldiers from all over the place to join the war...

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,400
except for my Armour Troops.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,300
He ordered me to go into war with him on my own.

102
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,500
Of course, I know... the real reason behind his actions.

103
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,900
Looks like we have to move our plan forward.

104
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,200
We've waited for so many years. Finally, we have our chance.

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,500
When do you plan to make a move?

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,200
The entire plan is in my head. I know what to do.

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,800
As for you, you just need to act according to my orders.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,100
Hen Xiang told me that you want to change your plan for a woman.

109
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,300
Is it true?

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,800
We have been planning for many years to get this far.

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Victory is in sight.

112
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,500
We have to go with the plan.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
I address you as Uncle Lin...

114
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,400
because you are my mother's most loyal servant.

115
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,000
You've saved me before.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,800
And you've taken great pains to teach and train me.

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
The bone-piercing pain that I suffered every year...

118
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,600
is a burning reminder of my mother's hatred.

119
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
They are burned into my mind.

120
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,100
But I want to remind you.

121
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,400
You are just an assistant to help me complete this revenge.

122
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,200
As for the how,

123
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,200
it's entirely up to me.

124
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,100
Looks like you have deep hatred against me.

125
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,800
I wasn't trying to make the decision for you.

126
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,100
I'm just reminding you that...

127
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,200
our master has been waiting for too long in the dark.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Don't worry.

129
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
For those who've hurt my mother,

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll make them pay a terrible price for it.

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,700
Good.

132
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,400
This is the young master that I know.

133
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,200
Only by doing so, can you repay our master who had suffered in order to protect you.

134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,400
If we want to take revenge,

135
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
we have to get rid of Zongzheng Wuyou.

136
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,300
Rong Le is his biggest weakness.

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Only by using her, can we make sure that nothing will go wrong.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,500
I don't need to use Rong Le to get rid of Zongzheng Wuyou.

139
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Is that so?

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
From the surface, you are at an advantage.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,600
But Zongzheng Wuyou's strength lurks in the shadows.

142
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
If you want to fight him in the open,

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,400
you'll ruin the plan that we've spent so many years on.

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,100
You have always been the illegitimate son who lives in darkness.

145
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,400
Why do you want to fight him in the open?

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,300
Do you think that Rong Le will like you by doing so?

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
Stop dreaming.

148
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,300
As long as Zongzheng Wuyou lives,

149
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,000
you won't stand a chance.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
Go.

151
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,500
Go and feel the bone-piercing pain that your mother had once suffered from.

152
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,800
Remember that suffering...

153
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
and you'll remember your identity.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,800
At the same time, it'll clear your mind.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Guards!

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
Young Master.

157
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,200
Master, Young Master has done nothing wrong.

158
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,800
Why do you want to punish him again?

159
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Hen Xiang,

160
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,600
you've healed so quickly in such a short time?

161
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Don't think that I know nothing just because you kept it a secret.

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,000
In order to save Rong Le,

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Young Master had hurt one of his own seriously.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
And he tried to change the plan.

165
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,900
I know everything.

166
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,400
How did you know...

167
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,600
when I've never told you about it?

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Since you are already hurt,

169
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,400
I won't punish you today.

170
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,500
But remember.

171
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm the one who saved you from the gate of hell.

172
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
I taught you martial arts...

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,700
and trained you into a remarkable assassin.

174
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,900
You like Young Master.

175
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,800
I don't mind it if you want to keep his secrets for him.

176
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,000
But if it'll affect the plan of our revenge,

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,400
I will not forgive you easily.

178
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,200
I wouldn't dare to do so.

179
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,000
In order to initiate this plan sooner,

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,800
I have a task for you.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
Disguise yourself as Rong Le...

182
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,879
No.

183
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,379
No. I can't do that.

184
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,619
I can't do that.

185
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:25,620
Only by doing so, will you be able to avenge your family.

186
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,559
Maybe after that, you'll have a chance to marry the person you like.

187
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,230
Two birds in one stone.

188
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,420
I can't do that.

189
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,700
You already know about my plan.

190
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,950
If you are not going to do it,

191
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,760
then I can't let you live.

192
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,720
Guards.

193
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,160
- Take her out!
- Let go of me.

194
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,380
You can't kill me now.

195
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,699
I need to help Young Master control the crown prince.

196
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,659
If I die now, it'll affect his plan for revenge.

197
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,300
He won't forgive you for that.

198
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,859
He's just a useless crown prince.

199
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:11,520
It's not that hard... to control him.

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,879
Let me tell you truthfully, Hen Xiang.

201
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,839
I've already planned this... for quite some time.

202
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,820
If you don't want to do it, there will be others to do it.

203
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,140
Rather than letting others do it,

204
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,860
it's better for you to do it instead.

205
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,219
Brother, although Fu Chou will be joining you in the war,

206
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:37,460
his Armour Troops are still here in Zhongshan.

207
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,740
And there is a sudden influx of refugees to the city.

208
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,179
I think that something is not right with it.

209
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,160
Would you reconsider delaying the war?

210
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,460
We have the Royal Army here.

211
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,380
I'll leave behind a secret decree.

212
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,520
If something is amiss with the Armour Troops,

213
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,239
the Royal Army will be under Wuyu's command.

214
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,699
Besides, the generals of the Armour Troops...

215
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,260
are under the close surveillance of Wuyou.

216
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,320
There won't be any problems.

217
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,480
As for the refugees,

218
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,500
something is not right with it indeed.

219
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,980
Wuyou will take care of it.

220
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,420
Wuyou?

221
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,760
He was already banished from this city by you, right?

222
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,939
The date for war is already set.

223
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:26,819
We'll agitate our soldiers if we delay it again.

224
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:29,060
We can't change our plan for the war against Wei.

225
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,140
What about the crown prince?

226
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,859
When Fu Chou is gone, the crown prince can't do much alone.

227
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:37,499
He's under Wuyu's surveillance.

228
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:40,459
And Wuyou won't be too far away from Zhongshan...

229
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,100
to give them a loophole to exploit.

230
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,500
Wuyou!

231
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,200
Wuyou.

232
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,680
This is not for me.

233
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,160
Are you really going to go back to the southern border at a time like this?

234
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,419
Today, Father said those words in a fit of rage.

235
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,680
Don't take it to heart.

236
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,500
Besides, are you really not going to join father in the war?

237
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,900
If you go with him and come back with victory,

238
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,779
you'll be welcomed by the officials and cheered by the people.

239
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,019
And everyone will forget about Fu Chou's contributions.

240
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,219
When that time comes, naturally, you'll hold the military power.

241
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,880
Why did you refuse to do this kind of beneficial thing?

242
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,539
I...

243
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,700
Did I say something wrong again?

244
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,960
You might be right if you told me about this one year ago.

245
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,739
That time, Fu Chou was still at the frontier pass...

246
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:13,039
and didn't have real power in the court yet.

247
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,059
But now, Fu Chou has expanded his clique...

248
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,019
and he has ganged up with the crown prince.

249
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,079
Besides, he's cooperating with Rong Qi, the emperor of Western Qi in secret.

250
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,759
All the generals in the Armour Troops are his trusted aides.

251
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,039
If I join the war together with Father now...

252
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,000
with only the crown prince and Fu Chou in command of the capital,

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,719
what do you think would happen?

254
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,419
Are you saying that they'd revolt?

255
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,620
Crown Prince is not that brave.

256
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,720
He is not.

257
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,160
But Fu Chou is.

258
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,340
Wuyou, since you already knew, why did you fight with Father then?

259
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,080
I get it now. Both of you did it on purpose.

260
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,059
No. What happened today...

261
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,140
is just a show that you'd planned together with Father. Right?

262
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,119
I'm just afraid that Fu Chou won't be so easily fooled like the others.

263
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,580
It's impossible that he'd go against the order to stay out from the war.

264
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,820
Father has left you in the capital to spy on the crown prince anyway.

265
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,860
Make sure to keep a close eye on him.

266
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,820
About that, I was still puzzled about why Father trusted me so much...

267
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,340
to let me help the crown prince with the public affairs.

268
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,140
So, he wants me to keep watch on the crown prince.

269
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,780
Now, there are more and more refugees in the city.

270
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,739
Find a way to lure them out to the city.

271
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:35,300
Open up more food relief centers and give out food all day long.

272
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,460
Keep a close eye on the response of the refugees.

273
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,839
If you see someone suspicious, find a reason to lock them up for interrogation.

274
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,280
But don't use force.

275
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,240
I understand.

276
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,639
Wuyou, don't you have anything else for me to help out with?

277
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:57,039
For example, Man Yao?

278
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,660
Don't make things difficult for her.

279
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,659
I wouldn't dare to do so. She is the one you like.

280
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:05,360
When I'm not here, look out for her.

281
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,960
If there's anything, report to me at once.

282
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
All right. I get it.

283
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,160
This way please, Generals.

284
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,480
The Royal Army?

285
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,700
This way, please.

286
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,059
Princess Rong Le, take this medicine.

287
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,099
Although it's just a supplement, at least it can replenish your energy.

288
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,439
Thank you.

289
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:49,150
Princess, actually, His Majesty...

290
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,840
Don't mention him.

291
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,659
If he so much thinks of me as his sister,

292
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:55,619
he wouldn't try to control me with poison.

293
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,220
He even lied to me saying that it was the aftereffect of my escape.

294
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,700
The cure that he gave me can only suppress the effect of the poison temporarily.

295
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,179
It can't neutralize the poison at all.

296
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:10,980
If I beg him now, I'd be his string puppet for sure to do his bidding forever.

297
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,419
I don't want that.

298
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,099
Maybe... you wouldn't be controlled forever.

299
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:19,099
After we get the medicine, Xiao Ke can study it.

300
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,579
If she can find the original prescription for the poison,

301
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:23,960
she might be able to find a cure.

302
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,979
- He's right.
- Princess, I realized that many people were led into...

303
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,779
the general's study by Chang Jian for a secret discussion.

304
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,739
Among them are the generals from the army.

305
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,599
And they were wearing the plates of the Royal Army.

306
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,220
Royal Army?

307
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,259
The Royal Army answers to His Majesty. Why are they here with Fu Chou?

308
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:42,580
I don't know.

309
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,780
Recently, that place has been heavily guarded.

310
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,340
It's hard for me to spy on them.

311
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,519
The war against Wei is going to start soon.

312
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,420
What is the reason for Fu Chou to meet these generals in secret?

313
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,340
I have to get into his study.

314
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,079
Xiao Sha, go back to Western Qi to get the medicine.

315
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,499
Tell my brother that I'm at the death's door.

316
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,660
If he still wants me to work for him, give me the cure immediately.

317
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,719
Roger that.

318
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,280
- Be careful.
- All right.

319
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,420
Why are you here?

320
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,179
I'm here to get some food from the kitchen.

321
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,779
General's Manor is so strange. Why are there so many people guarding the kitchen?

322
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,479
This is General's Fu study. Nobody can come near it. Leave now.

Do you still have time for me?

388
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,059
From the way you are talking,

389
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,539
looks like you are still mad at me...

00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:38,220
for the incident at the court yesterday.

391
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,600
I wouldn't dare to be mad at you.

392
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,859
It's fine that Wuyu recommend him.

393
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:46,619
But how can you recommend him as well?

394

What do you mean by that?

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,259
If Wuyou is victorious, he'll hold the military power.

What good will it do to you?

397

Luckily, my father is wise and banished Wuyou to the southern border.

398
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:02,420
Or else, there would be no place for me in this court anymore.

00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,059
Do you think that His Majesty will bring Prince Li along...

401
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,920
to fight in the war just because I recommended him?

402
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,959
Do you really think that Prince Li has disobeyed the order...

403
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:23,979
and by making His Majesty mad, they'll turn against each other from now on...

404
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:27,260
and your position as crown prince will be secured?

405
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,780
If you really think so, then you are too naive.

406
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,840
It's such a miracle that you are able to sit in this position...

407
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,780
as crown prince for so long.

408
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,100
What do you mean by that?

409
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,839
That day, in the court, the fight that His Majesty and Prince Li had...

410
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,599
was just a show they made in order to fool you.

411
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,580
Do you really believe it?

412
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,180
Just now, you asked me why was I laughing.

413
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,559
I'm laughing because you are already under the guillotine...

414
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,620
and you are in imminent danger.

415
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,480
But you are still drinking your celebratory wine here.

416
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,339
Do you really think that it's a good thing...

417
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:07,460
for me to go out for war while Prince Li is here?

418
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,600
Don't you know that... it'll be our death warrant?

419
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,339
What did you say?

420
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,520
Father left Wuyou behind to finish me off?

421
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,059
Impossible. Don't try to scare me.

422
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:21,780
If you don't believe me,

423
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,300
then don't blame me when your head is on the ground one day.

424
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,360
Please wait!

General Fu...

426
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,740
Their fight was too sudden that day.

427
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,100
Father didn't even punish Wuyou when he rejected...

428
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,100
the marriage in public back then.

429
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,559
This time, why are they in such a fit...

430
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,610
just because of some disagreements?

431
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:56,140
But what is the purpose of this show between my father and Wuyou?

432
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,620
If Father wants to kill me, he doesn't need to put in so much trouble.

433
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,320
He even entrusted me with the country.

434
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,840
That's the most vital step in their plan.

435
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,379
You are chosen as crown prince...

436
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,499
because Lady Yun is in debt with your mother.

437
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,400
But this kind of loving-kindness will burn out eventually.

438
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Prince Li used to be very tolerant of you.

439
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,020
Now, he treats you worse than he treats a stranger.

440
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,100
Same goes for His Majesty.

441
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,299
Ever since you failed in the war against Wei,

442
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,579
His Majesty has been wanting to strip you of your position.

443
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:30,499
I think you know this better than anyone.

444
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:34,979
Otherwise, you wouldn't have hired the Creed of Vengeance...

445
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:37,260
to assassinate Prince Li at all cost.

446
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,859
Continue.

447
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:42,979
He needs a reason to strip you of your position.

448
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:44,980
He can't do it without any reason.

449
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,559
All these years, you've done your duty well.

450
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,339
And you haven't done any major mistakes.

451
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:54,519
Even if you did, His Majesty has no solid proof about it.

452
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,900
If he wants to strip you of your position,

453
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,779
he has to find a concrete reason to do so.

454
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,820
What kind of reason?

455
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,779
His Majesty knows that we have ganged up with each other in secret.

456
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,700
That's why he put on this show...

457
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,459
to make sure that I have no choice but to join him in war.

458
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:17,699
His real purpose is to separate us and attack us one by one.

459
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:21,880
I have to join His Majesty for the war without my Armor Troops.

460
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,919
He falsely banished Prince Li...

461
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,379
so that he can go back to the southern border to send his troops here.

462
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:30,500
He asked you to take care of the nation with Prince Chen's help.

463
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,910
If you put it nicely, it's to help.

464
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:35,220
But he's actually here to spy on you.

465
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,479
If something is amiss, you'll be labeled as a rebel.

466
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:45,679
And by then, Prince Li will send his army into the city.

467
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,380
You won't even have the chance to explain.

468
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,179
- I...
- And you'll die in vain and unjustly.

469
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,459
Then I'll do nothing so that they won't have a reason to kill me.

470
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,699
It'll still be the same whether you do it or not.

471
00:30:56,699 --> 00:31:00,059
All of them have spent so much effort to set this trap.

472
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,060
They won't let you get away easily.

473
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,979
If I'm not wrong,

474
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:09,220
someone must be working for His Majesty in the Armor Troops.

475
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,120
They'll make trouble in your name.

476
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,600
When that time comes, you'll be dead.

477
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,240
And I won't fare any better than you.

478
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,650
Father is so ruthless.

479
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,620
General Fu.

480
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,539
You have to save me, General!

481
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,079
No. We are in the same boat.

482
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,539
Saving me means saving yourself, General.

483
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,019
What should we do?

484
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,100
No need to panic.

485
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,100
I'm here today to do exactly that.

486
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,620
This...

487
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,259
What do you mean by this?

488
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:50,019
Now, nobody else can save us.

489
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:52,859
We are the only ones who can save ourselves.

490
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:55,320
We are our own salvation.

491
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,480
Are you saying that... we should rebel for real?

492
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,939
Please think carefully, Crown Prince.

493
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:14,619
This is the only way... for both of us to survive this.

494
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,800
No.

495
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,459
You said it yourself. Father planned this out so meticulously.

496
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:30,139
We won't succeed.

497
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:32,859
We won't if it's just you alone.

498
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:35,139
But I already told you,

499
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:37,640
I'm doing this to save myself too.

500
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,820
How confident you are?

501
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,019
If it fails, it'll be a done deal for us.

502
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,819
We are done for anyway.

503
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,659
Since we will be dead anyway...

504
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:55,100
and we'll be labeled as rebels,

505
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,500
why not we take a risk to save our lives?

506
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,819
If we want to get the things we desire,

507
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,099
we have to pay for it.

508
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:07,040
What is your desire?

509
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,619
When you wear this dragon robe...

510
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,379
and sit on that almighty dragon chair,

511
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:14,020
you'll know what to do.

512
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,100
I just hope that when the time comes, you'll be kind to me.

513
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,260
All right.

514
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,619
Since you've proposed this,

515
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:32,220
I'm sure that you've already a plan in mind.

516
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,059
I believe in you.

517
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,720
As long as you can help me become the emperor,

518
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,239
I promise you, aside from the throne, I can give you...

519
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,720
whatever you desire.

520
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,640
I'll take my leave then.

521
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,380
Your Majesty.

522
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,340
This is such a handsome robe.

523
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,100
It's way better than any other robes that you have.

524
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,339
I can't wait to see your dashing appearance...

525
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:59,120
in this robe while you stand in front of the Xuande Hall...

526
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,760
to receive your support and love from the officials and the people.

527
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,600
Xiang.

528
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,720
Xiang.

529
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,640
I've waited so long for this day.

530
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,560
I've had enough of this crown prince title which is all name and no power.

531
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,220
Xiang,

532
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,120
how long have you known General Fu?

533
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,460
What kind of a person is he?

534
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,160
I haven't known him long.

535
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,180
He is...

536
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,720
a gentle... and modest gentleman.

537
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,140
Why did you ask me this suddenly?

538
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,019
Could it be that you are suspicious... about General Fu?

539
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,400
Suspicious?

540
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,420
How could I suspect General Fu?

541
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,520
General Fu is my most trusted ally now.

542
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,820
I'm counting on him... to make me into an emperor.

543
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,640
That's right.

544
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,080
It's good that you understand.

545
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,939
You are in a difficult situation now.

546
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,400
And you have no one to rely on.

547
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,620
As long as you have General Fu's help,

548
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,259
you'll get what you wish for.

549
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,299
When that time comes,

550
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:36,619
no one in this world will dare raise their voices against you anymore.

551
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:40,619
And no one... will dare disobey you again.

552
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,520
Xiang, you are right.

553
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,000
But what if I fail?

554
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Xiang, will you leave me if I fail?

555
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,959
You are destined to be an emperor. You were born for it.

556
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:00,339
It is your destiny.

557
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:02,559
- You will not lose.
- I mean what if?

558
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,220
There will be no what-ifs.

559
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,300
I believe in you...

560
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,960
and I believe in General Fu.

561
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,800
All right.

562
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,619
All right!

563
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,700
Xiang, if you say I won't lose, then I won't lose.

564
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,380
For you, I'll take this risk.

565
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,679
After I sit on the throne and sentenced Zongzheng Wuyou to death,

566
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,039
I'll confer you the title as Imperial Consort.

567
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,900
When that time comes,

568
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,000
you'll rule over the imperial harem.

569
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,859
Besides you, I want nobody else.

570
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,880
You have to keep your word then.

571
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,400
Don't worry. I won't go back on my words.

572
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,120
[Dezheng Door]

573
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,920
Arrival of His Majesty!

574
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,460
Greetings, Your Majesty.

575
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,740
Rise.

576
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,260
March forward!

577
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:38,319
Victory!

578
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,750
[Dezheng Door]

579
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,799
This is bad! Help!

580
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:22,660
Lady Rong Le has fallen ill again!

581
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,299
- What happened?
- Lady Rong Le is sick again.

582
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:29,059
She is already unconscious. I need to get her the medicine.

583
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:31,859
Last time, General Fu had brought her the medicine, right?

584
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,539
That was last time. Her illness is more serious now.

585
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,139
The one we used last time can't cure her now.

586
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:38,319
I'll go to the apothecary house to get it then.

587
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,579
This is not a normal medicine.

588
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:42,339
I need the Dragon Flower.

589
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:44,299
This flower is the rarest among the rare.

590
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:47,299
You can't find it in a normal apothecary house. Let me out.

591
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:50,039
Tell me what the flower looks like. I'll get it for you.

592
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,639
You can find the flower only on the moss that grows on the dragon stone.

593
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,099
Its color is different for every season of the year.

594
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,599
It's entirely up to your luck to be able to find it.

595
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,420
And you have to be careful when you pluck it.

596
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,979
You can't pluck the newly bloomed and you can't pluck the newly wilted.

597
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:04,179
You can only take the petals, not the nectar.

598
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:06,099
If there's any nectar on it,

599
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:09,339
it'll become poison and the person who takes it will die for sure.

600
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:12,479
- Do you have the skill to pluck this kind of flower?
- No.

601
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:15,439
Let me out now. I'll go to the eastern suburb to get the medicine for her now.

602
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:18,499
But General Fu has ordered us that no one can leave the manor.

603
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:21,259
You give us no choice.

604
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:23,460
Let me tell you.

605
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,059
If something happens to the princess,

606
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:28,880
you'll be responsible for it when the general gets back.

607
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,940
This way, please.

608
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,120
Both of you stay here. The rest, follow me.

609
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,460
Princess, they are gone.

610
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,420
I hope that she will be successful this time.
