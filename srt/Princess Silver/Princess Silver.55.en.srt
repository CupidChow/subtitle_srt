[Episode 55]

2
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Why are you back again?

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
Why are you here?

4
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,600
Rong Le, you should come with me.

5
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I am sure you should know by now...

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,000
that the poison inside of you is the Destined Poison.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
You should also know...

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,000
I am the only one who can remove the poison for you.

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,400
What are you going to do this time?

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,300
I told you.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,800
I am taking you with me to cure you of this poison.

12
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,400
Don't bother waiting for their rescue.

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,500
If I can reach this room,

14
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,200
I would have already gotten rid of those who would stop me.

15
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,200
If you wish for them to be safe

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,900
and you hope for your child to live,

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
you must come with me.

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
This is the only way.

19
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
I...

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,900
You have to trust me.

21
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,600
You don't want your child to be born with a damaged body...

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,000
or lose his mother.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,700
Rong Le, if you promise to come with me,

24
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,600
I will make sure both you and your child are safe.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,300
Trust me, will you?

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,700
What? Man Yao is gone?

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,300
Yes, when we went back,

28
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,000
Consort Rong Le was already gone.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
All the men I sent to keep watch on her...

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,300
were all drugged by someone.

31
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,200
After they woke up, Her Highness was nowhere to be found.

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
I have informed the Hidden Ones...

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to set up checkpoints around Qingzhou.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
All the routes are sealed off for investigation.

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I am afraid if she passed the border of Qingzhou,

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,300
it would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,200
If she were kidnapped, with her brilliant mind,

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,900
she would find a way to contact us.

39
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,700
Unless...

40
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,200
she left just to avoid seeing me again.

41
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,300
The world is endless,

42
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,400
we might never find any tracks of her again.

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Your Highness, she is still carrying sickness.

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,600
We can't let her leave.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
Even if she left the south,

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,000
you can always send letters to the neighboring nations.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Be it Chen or Western Qi, we will figure out a way.

48
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,600
I can go to the north for you.

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,100
We can ask for Prince Regent's help.

50
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,000
Very well, I am sending him a letter.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please, hand it over for me.

52

[Wuchou]

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Are you certain you will be leaving on your own?

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,400
We can always fight together.

55
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,700
Come with me to Zhongshan, we will move on to other places.

56
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,200
It's better than searching on your own.

57
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,800
Just like we did before, we can help each other.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,700
I knew it all along.

59
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,800
You have always been there to protect and look after me.

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,400
But this is different.

61
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,800
How is this any different?

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,700
You said you would forget about him and wipe him from your memories.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Are you afraid to see him again?

64
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,900
This has nothing to do with Fu Chou.

65
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,100
It has nothing to do with anyone.

66
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
After going through so much,

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,300
lost and found, and then lost yet again.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
These experiences made me strong.

69
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,800
I can fend for myself.

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,000
I have the strength to protect those I care about.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,200
If that is the case, why won't you come with me?

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,500
Because I know... since we were kids,

73
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,700
you have always been in love with me.

74
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,700
I have unknowingly got used to staying under your protection.

75
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,400
You were always there to shield me from danger.

76
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,000
But now, I need to leave the shelter you provided me.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
I hope you can live a life for your own sake.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,100
Stop making so many sacrifices for me.

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,700
If you knew it all along,

80
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,500
you should understand... that I did everything out of my own free will.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,600
You may pursue whatever you want.

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,200
As for what I wish for is to follow you all the way.

83
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,600
This time, we will split up.

84
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,000
We will meet when fate brings us together again.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will be waiting for you.

86
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,300
Sure.

[Spirit Table of the Qin Family]

88
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,500
- So long.
- So long.

89
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
The place you tried so hard to bring me to...

90
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,300
is this house?

91
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
Indeed.

92
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,300
Back then, you brought me to this place,

93
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,200
showed me the memories of the past, and told me about the life I had.

94
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
But I can't even tell...

95
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,200
which of those are lies.

[The Book of Mountains and Rivers]

97
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,000
Bringing me here was never your true intention.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,200
You seek "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Did you poison me just because...

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,500
you wanted to get your hands on the book?

101
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,300
You lied to me saying that I was your sister.

102
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,800
But your true motive was to take my father's work for yourself.

103
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,900
Calm down for now.

104
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,200
You don't want anger to hurt the child.

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
I am warning you.

106
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Don't you dare try to hurt my child!

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,000
We have come this far.

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,600
I don't expect you to cure me of anything.

109
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
If you have any intention to hurt my child,

110
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
I assure you,

111
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,200
you will never get any information about the book from me.

112
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,100
This child... is the second chance fate bestowed upon you.

113
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,200
If you redirect the poison onto him...

114
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,700
Not a chance!

115
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,100
I will never trade a child's life for mine.

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
I knew it.

117
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
Even if you went through so much pain,

118
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,500
your resolve would never waver.

119
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
- I'll get a doctor for you.
- Never mind.

120
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Let's have a look at the village.

121
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,700
I wonder if the road of this village...

122
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,800
still looks familiar to you.

123

Yes.

I have been cleaning the house to await your return!

130
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,500
This is great.

131
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:35,182
Madam, it's been years. You look even more gorgeous now.

132
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Are you going to stay here for good?

133
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,100
- Madam?
- Mrs. Yu, while we are here,

134
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,700
we will be staying for some time.

135
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,600
Good.

136
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,100
Here.

137
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,900
I can't take this. Please, I can't accept this.

138
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,200
I was only cleaning off some dust.

139
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
It wasn't any hard labor.

140
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,500
All the money you sent over the years are more than enough for me.

141
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,000
You just got back and it's already dusk.

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,600
Why don't you have dinner at my place?

143
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
I appreciate the offer.

144
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,900
But she... is getting heavier.

145
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,000
She needs more rest.

146
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,900
Madam, you are expecting a child?

147
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,800
Now that I think about it, you've been married for years.

148
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,300
Is this your first child?

149
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,200
Yes, this is the first.

150
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,200
Mrs. Yu.

151
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,900
- Please, no.
- You need to accept this.

152
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,500
- I still have a favor for you.
- Sure.

153
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,000
My wife here... has had a bit of a bad temper ever since she got pregnant.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,600
I am taking her out to get some fresh air.

155
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,400
My parents don't know about this.

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
If someone asks about us,

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,800
just tell them we are your distant relatives,

158
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,500
that we are here to ask for your help.

159
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,800
- I am sure you understand.
- I understand.

160
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,000
With wealth comes gossip.

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
You can count on me.

162
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,300
Not just the outsiders,

163
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,200
not even the officers will get anything from me.

164
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,500
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Yu.

165
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,800
Man'er.

166
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Try to be nice here, we will talk about it at home.

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,400
- Goodbye, Mrs. Yu.
- Sure, goodbye.

168
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,100
Come on, Man'er.

169
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,200
- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
Watch your step.

171
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,500
Isn't this Lord Qi from the back hill?

172
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,400
His wife is such a nuisance.

173
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,300
She should be grateful to have such a thoughtful husband.

174
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,400
She even ran away from home.

175
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
Who knows where she has been to all these years?

176
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Lord Qi always came here depressed.

177
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,500
Watch your step.

178
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,900
Why did you call me "Man'er"?

179
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,500
Have we been here before?

180
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,800
You need to remember what I said just now.

181
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,700
All you need to do is to play your role.

182
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,000
Remember, in this village,

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,300
"Man'er" is your name.

184
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,000
I will find a way to cure you.

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But in return, you must fulfill one wish for me.

186
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,400
The is the only wish in my entire life...

187
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,700
that is mine alone.

188
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,400
What is it?

189
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,100
We will stay here for some time,

190
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,400
a life not bothered by anyone.

191
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,300
A normal life.

192
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,500
How long will it take?

193
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Around five to six months.

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Once the child is safely born,

195
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,900
I will cure you of the poison.

196
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,600
You will be free to go.

197
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
No.

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
It takes too long.

199
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,100
I am afraid...

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't that much time to live.

201
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
My child,

202
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
I must hand him over to Wuyou myself.

203
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,800
I need to tell him... to love this child with all he has.

204
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
Are you afraid you can't live to see Wuyou one last time?

205
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,700
Don't worry about it. You will live.

206
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,900
I will give you back the time you lost.

207
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,200
But you need to be sure...

208
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,900
that Zongzheng Wuyou is the one love that you want.

209
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,200
I will do whatever I can to make your wish come true.

210
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Definitely.

211
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,300
Let's go.

212
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,800
You have my word I will stay.

213
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Why do you keep making all kinds of requests?

214
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,000
Why did you even bring me here?

215
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,000
How about some greengages?

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They were your favorite once.

217
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Why don't we pick some for ourselves?

218
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
I am not eating those.

219
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,200
Who says greengage is my favorite?

220
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,800
You gave me your word...

221
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,700
you would fulfill my requests for the next six months.

222
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Man'er, come down here!

223
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Be careful, your with child!

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,900
Man'er! Come down!

225
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,600
I promise you, I won't make you do anything you don't like.

226
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,200
Man'er!

227
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
We can brew greengage wine just like that?

228
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Correct.

229
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,200
This is how we used to brew greengage wine together.

230
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,200
It'll be just in time.

231
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,800
We will use this wine six months from now...

232
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,000
to mark our farewell.

233
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
Very well.

234
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Six months from now, we will finish this wine.

235
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,200
We will be even from that on.

236
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,100
I always thought I couldn't hold my bottle,

237
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,200
but after some drinks in Northern Lin,

238
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,700
I might actually have been a mindless drunkard before this.

239
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,000
As long as you like it,

240
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,600
I promise you, while we are here,

241
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,400
I will make your wishes come true.

242
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Remember what I told you.

243
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Live on.

244
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Live like every day is the last day you will spend in this world.

245
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,000
You have a long journey ahead of you.

246
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If there is anything you wish to do, make them happen.

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,900
Don't leave yourself with any regret.

248
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,000
If the two of us had a normal life,

249
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,200
perhaps this simple bliss in life...

250
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,800
could have easily been ours.

251
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,700
We are not the same.

252
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,600
I had my share of happiness.

253
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Even if my life ends now,

254
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I am content with it.

255
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,400
I won't have any regret.

256
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
His Majesty is severely ill.

257
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,400
He is unable to attend to our national affairs.

258
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,600
I must take on the responsibility to share his burden.

259
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,400
From now on,

260
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
I shall reign in his place.

261
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
All the affairs of Imperial Court...

262
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,300
shall be decided by me.

263
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,500
Your Majesty's wish is our command.

264
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Get up.

265
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,600
- Your Majesty.
- Speak.

266
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Keep searching.

267
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,700
There is no way an ill man like him...

268
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,400
and a woman carrying a child...

269
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,200
can hide from the whole world.

270
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,500
Yes.

271
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
This tree is beautiful.

272
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,300
When autumn arrives,

273
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,100
the whole yard will be full of its petals.

274
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,700
We will be here every autumn to watch this view, can we?

275
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,000
Are you curious why the teahouses here and in the palace...

276
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
were decorated with these wind chimes?

277
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,900
In the Qin family's mansion,

278
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,300
I saw these wind chimes before.

279
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,500
I like the sound they make.

280
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,900
Did I tell you that I like wind chimes?

281
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,000
So, are you the one that hung...

282
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,600
the wind chimes here and in the palace teahouse?

283
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,900
Why don't we place these wind chimes together?

284
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,404
Should I hang it here?

285
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,467
A little higher.

286
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:42,974
- Higher.
- Here?

287
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:45,442
A little to the left.

288
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:48,863
- Here?
- Higher.

289
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:50,833
A little higher.

290
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,132
Higher!

291
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,948
Brother Qi, that is not the way to do it.

292
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:08,396
♫ Third is passion. Fourth is desire ♫

293
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:13,980
♫ All beauty has been exhausted ♫

294
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,059
♫ I know that we can't go back anymore ♫

295
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,259
♫  I know that I have to leave you ♫

296
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:26,780
♫ Ignorance is bliss ♫

297
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:34,131
♫ The sound of the bamboo flute from my memory
reminds me of the love we had ♫

298
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:37,730
Man'er, get your meal.

299
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,340
Man'er?

300
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,501
Man'er?

301
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,679
♫ When the clouds and the rain hear about your life ♫

302
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,780
♫ Even they will stop and wait for you ♫

303
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:11,060
♫ I can see you turning your back towards me ♫

304
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:17,959
♫ I weep for the good times we had that were broken ♫

305
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,871
♫ I have so many memories of you but it'll never be enough ♫

306
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:31,862
♫ The pain is unbearable ♫

307
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,237
♫ Maybe this wasn't meant to happen ♫

308
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,304
What? Rong Le went missing?

309
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:59,673
Yes, she might have been kidnapped by Rong Qi.

310
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:02,900
Prince Li ordered his men to search all routes out of Qingzhou.

311
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,472
But we couldn't track them down.

312
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:08,741
I just arrested another man from the Creed.

313
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,779
After some interrogation,

314
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:13,186
I found out Lin Shen might have gone to Western Qi.

315
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:17,779
I suspect... this conspiracy could be connected to Western Qi as well.

316
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:21,199
Right. Didn't Prince Li send his men to search in Western Qi?

317
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:24,142
I received news from the Hidden Ones when I reached Zhongshan.

318
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:26,396
They found some traces.

319
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:29,602
But most point toward Northern Lin.

320
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:33,201
This is why Prince Li had to send me here and ask for your help.

321
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,876
Will Your Highness send some men to search the area...

322
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:39,609
and see if Rong Qi has sneaked Rong Le into Northern Lin?

323
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,988
Rong Qi is a mysterious person. He is unpredictable.

324
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:48,751
It's not entirely impossible for him to sneak into the land.

325
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,101
Right.

326
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:54,287
Pass this letter to Prince Li.

327
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,455
Tell him about the disappearance of my father.

328
00:25:56,455 --> 00:26:00,270
This letter contains all the clues I found so far.

329
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,851
Your Highness, if you reconciled with Prince Li,

330
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:06,817
why don't the two of you talk about this together?

331
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:10,817
Do you have other plans in mind?

332
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,461
You know me the best.

333
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,784
For so many years, I mistook a demon for my mother.

334
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:29,042
I committed countless sins.

335
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,605
I must find Fu Yuan myself and avenge my birth mother.

336
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:37,492
I have to find my father as well.

337
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,658
Take it as I am repenting.

338
00:26:40,658 --> 00:26:45,473
But if you head to Western Qi alone, you might run into dangers.

339
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:52,753
Bad news! Thirty thousand soldiers of Wei are approaching the border!

340
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:55,753
The officers are waiting for you to devise a retaliation plan with them.

341
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,110
Your Highness, according to the Hidden Ones, reports about Rong Qi...

342
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,441
sneaking into Northern Lin might be false news.

343
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:06,297
It's likely that he and Consort Rong Le are in Western Qi.

344
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:09,549
The Hidden Ones are searching for them in Western Qi.

345
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:12,307
I should go there personally this time.

346
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:14,701
I am afraid not.

347
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,500
We just received reports.

348
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,899
Thirty thousand soldiers of Wei are approaching our border.

349
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:23,777
With the current strength of our army, we can't hold off the invasion.

350
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:39,927
Perhaps Wei already knew the south and the north would soon be united as one.

351
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:44,585
They want to use this last chance to seize the north as the first step.

352
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,886
In that case,

353
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,623
order the Hidden Ones to keep searching for Rong Le.

354
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:56,562
I will lead our army to rendezvous with Wuchou.

355
00:27:56,562 --> 00:28:00,336
Your Highness, the peace treaty doesn't have a conclusion yet.

356
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:04,207
Even if you go, they might now agree with you.

357
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:07,100
From the aspect of duty, Northern Lin is a nation.

358
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,884
An invasion is upon us.

359
00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:11,599
We must save the people from war.

360
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,356
From the aspect of kinship, Wuchou is my twin brother who shares the same bloodline.

361
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:17,754
I must lend him my aid.

362
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:20,336
Muster the troops now. Follow me to the north.

363
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:21,876
Yes.

364
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,444
- It smells great.
- Indeed.

365
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,209
It has a nice scent.

366
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,967
This greengage wine tastes so familiar to me.

367
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,603
One last drink.

368
00:30:19,603 --> 00:30:21,131
Of course.

369
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:45,836
Man'er, we had our toast.

370
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:50,715
This is our... last goodbye.

371
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,379
When I went on this route to seek refuge in the south,

372
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:35,354
I made Man Yao and myself a promise.

373
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,589
I will bring order to this nation.

374
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:40,635
I will earn the people's trust.

375
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,019
Wei has surrendered.

376
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:45,864
The north and the south are united as one.

377
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,313
Your ambition is realized.

378
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:56,569
But Agent Wu just sent a message from Western Qi.

379
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:58,059
The Emperor of Qi is ill.

380
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:00,760
The Empress Dowager took his place at the throne.

381
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,153
Agent Wu tried everything he could, but he never saw Rong Qi.

382
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,032
I fear Western Qi is still scheming for the whereabouts...

383
00:32:10,032 --> 00:32:13,149
of my father, Rong Qi and Man Yao.

384
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:16,977
An old handmaiden told me once.

385
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:20,612
Our father used a poison named "Destined Poison" on Fu Yuan.

386
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:24,412
If we could find our father, we might get a cure for that poison.

387
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:27,774
Rong Le could be saved.

388
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:36,809
In this life I have, my only wish...

389
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:39,669
is for her to live well and safe.

390
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,220
Indeed. In all these years, we lost too much.

391
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,055
We lost our father... and our mother.

392
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,504
I made up my mind.

393
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,687
I will set out on a journey to search for our father.

394
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:59,695
And, of course, Fu Yuan as well.

395
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,140
Right.

396
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,802
I asked you here today...

397
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:09,579
because I have a favor for you.

398
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,354
What is it?

399
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,940
I have decided to withdraw myself from the Imperial Court.

400
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,935
This vast land... and its people...

401
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,764
will be your duty and responsibility from now on.

402
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,157
All right, join me for a walk.

403
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:41,739
Sure.

404
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,758
I understand now.

405
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:36,472
So, this is the secret of the book?

406
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,555
Brother Qi!

407
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,610
Why would I call him that?

408
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,685
Did the two of us... go through something together?

409
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,990
Your hand, how did it get hurt?

410
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,000
See? This statue is almost done.

411
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,706
Do you like it?

412
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,218
You carved this statue yourself?

413
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,645
It doesn't matter who made this.

414
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:01,420
I am glad you like it.

415
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,993
Brother...

416
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,399
Man'er? Man'er?

417
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,780
Man'er!

418
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,540
If the Hidden Ones haven't found anything,

419
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,166
we won't be able to know the exact location of Rong Le.

420
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:37,464
So... let's not alert the enemy for now.

421
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,457
Your Highness, I know where Consort Rong Le is.

422
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,064
Madam, push harder! You need to push harder!

423
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:00,790
Madam!

424
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,945
Madam, push harder!

425
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,864
Madam, you can't fall asleep!

426
00:38:09,864 --> 00:38:12,059
Madam, pull yourself together! Push harder!

427
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,320
- Push harder!
- Rong Le.

428
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,689
Man'er.

429
00:38:15,689 --> 00:38:17,836
Man'er, open your eyes!

430
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,103
Man'er, hang in there!

431
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:23,173
I feel so tired.

432
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:26,285
You need to keep your eyes open! You need to hold on!

433
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:28,739
Think about the child!

434
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,759
Think about how much you went through the past few months!

435
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:32,806
Are you...

436
00:38:32,806 --> 00:38:35,021
Are you going to give up now?

437
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,079
Are you going to give up on your child?

438
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,105
My child? My child?

439
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:43,210
Don't you want to see him?

440
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,792
I sent my men to inform him.

441
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,159
You need to hang in there if you wish to see him again.

442
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,088
Do you hear me?

443
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,525
Wuyou? Wuyou?

444
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:53,881
Yes.

445
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:56,099
Zongzheng Wuyou is on his way here.

446
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,935
I swear to you, I am not lying.

447
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,011
Madam, you need to push harder.

448
00:39:04,012 --> 00:39:05,300
If the child doesn't come out,

449
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,119
both you and the child will be in grave danger!

450
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,922
Man'er, hang in there.

451
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:11,181
Man'er, be strong!

452
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,297
Congratulations, it's a boy.

453
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:58,962
Man'er, did you hear that? It's a boy.

454
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:02,629
Bring him here, let me see him.

455
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,983
See?

456
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,854
He is adorable.

457
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:15,899
Does this boy have a name?

458
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,401
He doesn't have a name yet.

459
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:19,963
Let his father come up with the name.

460
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:22,520
Lord Qi, give him a name.

461
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,668
All right, Man'er.

462
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:30,899
My wife needs to rest.

463
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:33,766
Mrs. Yu, I leave this boy in your care.

464
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:36,179
Let me see him one more time.

465
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:37,689
All right, Man'er.

466
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:38,929
You need to rest.

467
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:41,259
Let Mrs. Yu take care of the boy for now.

468
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:42,860
You have plenty of time later.

469
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,751
You need to take care of yourself.

470
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:47,420
Lord Qi is very thoughtful.

471
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,992
Madam, you have such a nice husband.

472
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:52,398
You have my thanks, Mrs. Yu.

473
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,250
Rest well for now. Leave the rest to me.

474
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,935
But you said you informed Wuyou.

475
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:05,823
Why isn't he here yet?

476
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:08,149
Who are you? Why are you taking this child?

477
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:10,009
Who are you people?

478
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,838
Man'er, stay here.

479
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,588
Lie down, I'll go and take a look.

480
00:41:46,376 --> 00:41:48,702
Greetings, Mother.

481
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:31,140
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

482
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,580
♫ We have been through so much ♫

483
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,920
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

484
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,400
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

485
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:52,280
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

486
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,790
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

487
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:05,960
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

488
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,110
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

489
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:18,730
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

490
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:25,340
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

491
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,810
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

492
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:38,590
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:46,260
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

494
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:21,580
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
