00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
[Episode 41]

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,119
Lady Fu refuses to live in the palace for recovery.

3
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,780
She insists to stay in the Cold Palace.

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,479
Was it Senyan Palace?

5
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,119
Yes, I tried talking to her, but she refuses to leave.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,360
So I ordered my men to renovate Senyan Palace.

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,159
Right. Any reports from the southern border?

8
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,419
The southern border is carrying out a new policy.

9
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:57,199
It has shown results for the past year.

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,340
Qin Yong?

11
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,300
Back then, Qin Yong was able to carry out the people-based transformation...

12
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,100
because of Lady Yun's help.

13
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,819
It enabled Northern Lin to build up a strong army...

14
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,019
and enrich the people in a very short time after we recovered from war...

15
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:13,939
to become a force itself.

16
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,679
Too bad Qin Yong lacked judgment.

17
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,979
That's why his people-based transformation... had failed in the end.

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,359
Your Highness, this new policy... is carried out together by...

19
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:29,100
Prince Li and that consort of his.

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,520
Her?

21
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,270
Any other news?

22
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,860
We have a secret message from Qingzhou.

23
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,410
It is said that recently, there are some rumors in the city.

24
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:45,539
It's rumored that... there's a Silver-Haired Demon.

25
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,559
What Silver-Haired Demon?

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,700
They say that the consort is a Silver-Haired Demon.

27
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,559
Some say that this consort... used the be a general's wife in Northern Lin.

28
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:58,679
They said that she's a wanton... and had eloped with Prince Li to the southern border.

29
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,540
This rumor has spread like a wild fire in that city.

30
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,340
Pass down my order. Find the source of the rumor.

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,780
Yes, I understand.

32
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,860
- Follow me to Senyan Palace.
- Yes, Your Highness.

33
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,700
Mother!

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,180
Chou'er.

35
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,440
Greetings, Mother.

36
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,079
Chou'er, you're finally back.

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,819
Mother, I had been engaging in war for the past year.

38
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,680
Please don't blame me for not being able to take care of you by my side.

39
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,879
Look at you. You've been separated from me for so long...

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,039
that we've become estranged.

41
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,080
That's not true.

42
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,379
I'm gratified that you are putting...

43
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,439
the country before you.

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,260
- Why would I blame you?
- Yes, Mother.

45
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,079
Your Majesty, the food is ready.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,720
Come. Let's eat.

47
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,960
After you, Mother.

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,800
I remember that when I was young,

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,460
you... were always so distant and cold.

50
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,940
And you never ate with me.

51
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,680
Actually, I only understood later on...

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,680
that you were leaving me with all the good food...

53
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,400
while you sat aside to eat those leftovers in secret.

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,100
Unfortunately,

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,199
I still don't have a way... to hold a feast for you.

56
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,739
But don't worry, Mother.

57
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:59,300
I'll hold a coronation ceremony for you in a few days' time...

58
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,340
to welcome you back to the court.

59
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,380
It's all because of my mental illness.

60
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,679
Fortunately, I've recovered now.

61
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,539
I won't drag you down that much anymore.

62
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:13,580
What are you talking about?

63
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,659
We've gone through life and death to be together.

64
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:18,300
I'll fulfill my duty well as your son.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,320
Where have you been for the past year?

66
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,579
You never came back to Zhongshan.

67
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,580
Do you know how worried I am towards you?

68
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,500
I know.

69
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,979
For the past year, I had been traveling north.

70
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,739
I had reclaimed the lands that were taken away...

71
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:38,160
by Wei one year ago.

72
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,400
North?

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,660
Why don't you go south?

74
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,840
Do you mean the southern border?

75
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,800
As for the southern border,

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,019
it is guarded by Zongzheng Wuyou's highly organized army.

77
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,539
We can't underestimate their strength.

78
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,099
I had sent some special force troops to the southern border before.

79
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,540
But they were annihilated.

80
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,220
My thought is, before I can be sure of my enemy's strength,

81
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,079
I won't act recklessly. I need to observe them first.

82
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,260
If I were you,

83
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,679
I'd send forth a fleet to defeat them...

84
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,020
once and for all before they become fully-fledged.

85
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,260
But this is just an opinion of a woman.

86
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,699
You can just listen and forget about it.

87
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,699
You are worried about the country, too.

88
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,780
I understand.

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Serve the wine.

90
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,230
Mother.

91
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,019
Wench! I'm going to kill you.

92
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,519
- Mother.
- I'm going to kill you.

93
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,039
I'm going to burn you to death.

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,719
Look at your face scar. I'm going to burn you to death.

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,519
- Please spare my life!
- Mother.

96
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,039
- I'll burn you to death!
- Mother!

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,839
- Spare my life!
- I'll burn you to death.

98
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,260
- I'll burn you to death!
- Mother!

99
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,040
Don't just stand there! Take her away! Quick!

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,759
Quick.

101
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,759
It's all right now, Mother.

102
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,919
- Ask them to stop. Don't burn me.
- Mother.

103
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,340
- Don't burn me! Ask them to stop!
- It's all right now.

104
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,959
- It's all right now, Mother.
- Don't burn me.

105
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,860
- Don't hit me.
- I'm in control of this palace now.

106
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,759
Nobody will hurt you. Don't be scared.

107
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,799
Don't be scared. It's fine now.

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,060
- Don't hit me.
- It's fine now.

109
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,579
Today is such a wonderful day.

110
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,579
If it wasn't for the celebratory wine bestowed by His Highness upon us,

111
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,920
I would have been sober for more than half a year.

112
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,079
Brother, let's drink till we drop.

113
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,620
All right!

114
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,719
Did you see that?

115
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,199
Silver-Haired Demon!

116
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,599
You are drunk. You must have seen it wrong.

117
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,759
That's right. That is General Luo Qiao's tent.

118
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,719
He is a bold and powerful man.

119
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,420
No demon would dare get close to him.

120
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,599
Let's take a look anyway.

121
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,700
- Let's go then.
- Let's go.

122
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,840
This...

123
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,239
- General Luo Qiao!
- General Luo.

124
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,100
- General Luo!
- There, look!

125
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,519
Silver hair. It's the Silver-Haired Demon!

126
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,120
The Silver-Haired Demon has killed General Luo.

127
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,180
Your Highness, this is the overall situation of the incident.

128
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,699
The three soldiers who had discovered the body first hand... are now under supervision.

129
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:57,559
They just had a fleeting glimpse of a person with silver hair.

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,340
But it's possible that they saw wrongly because they were drunk.

131
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,199
Question them carefully. We can't miss out on any details.

132
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,499
But most importantly, we can't let this news spread and create further panic.

133
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,599
The Luo Army has always been very strict.

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,900
They had blocked the news from spreading at once.

135
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,319
But tonight is a special night.

136
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,699
Many of them were drunk in the celebratory feast.

137
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,520
We can't be sure that the news won't leak.

138
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,860
This is indeed a sticky situation.

139
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,879
The one who created the rumor...

140
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,459
seems to know us like the back of his hand.

141
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,239
He acts very cautiously...

142
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,660
and leaves no trail behind.

143
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,999
The scariest part is, he is quite the schemer.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,959
He knows that he can manipulate the people...

145
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,739
through rumors and mystery.

146
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,540
Your Highness!

147
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,599
- Please back me up, Your Highness!
- General, don't be rude.

148
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,019
General Luo Qiao is a close brother of yours.

149
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,959
That's why His Highness has been investigating it all night long.

150
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,799
But we can't just look at one side of the story.

151
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,599
Lady Rong Le was with His Highness for the whole night.

152
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,159
Please give us the order...

153
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,210
so that the Luo Army can depart immediately to the border.

154
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,439
What is your purpose for doing so?

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,999
I know clearly that...

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,799
the death of my brother was done by someone with an ulterior motive.

157
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,959
His aim is to use my brother's life to make us waver, to threaten you...

158
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,159
and to put the blame on Lady Rong Le.

159
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,919
If we continue to stay at the outskirts of Qingzhou,

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,399
this case will be out in the open tomorrow morning. Everybody will know.

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,119
This will affect the people's loyalty.

162
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,360
Although my brother's life is important,

163
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,479
we can't ruin the reputation of... Your Highness and Lady Rong Le.

164
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,440
You believe in Lady Rong Le?

165
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,100
Yes.

166
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,699
If she were in a killing rage with blood-lust,

167
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,459
there would be no survivors in this manor.

168
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:48,859
Moreover, when I met her that day,

169
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:52,059
although her hair is silver, she still looks like a normal person.

170
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,179
But she is willing to stay inside this manor...

171
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,279
because she doesn't want to startle the people.

172
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,180
Such a kind person like her wouldn't commit murder.

173
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,320
Please rise.

174
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,139
The man who planned this is unfathomable.

175
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,100
Whether you leave or not,

176
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,119
I'm sure that this will only get worse and worse.

177
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,300
So, the thing that you should do is not to run away with your soldiers.

178
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,759
You have to use your reputation...

179
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,860
to reassure your soldiers.

180
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,659
You've won victories after victories on the battlefield.

181
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,040
Are you going to lose to this kind of evil plot?

182
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,759
You believe in Lady Rong Le.

183
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,720
I hope that you can believe in me, too.

184
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,400
I won't let General Luo Qiao die in vain.

185
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,479
Yes, Your Highness!

186
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,199
Thank you for your teachings.

187
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,539
I'll go back to the military camp now to order them...

188
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,880
to stay on high alert and gather any evidence that I can.

189
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,540
Leng Yan.

190
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,999
The Serene Hill Inn that I had asked you to seal up,

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,439
unseal it immediately.

192
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,999
Restore everything to normal.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,919
Just like nothing had ever happened.

194
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,220
Are you trying to lure them out?

195
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,720
The murdering schemers are trying to create panic.

196
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,879
But if everything has gone back to normal,

197
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
they will be the ones panicking.

198
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,900
Now, we don't have any evidence.

199
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,740
But when the time comes,

200
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,500
they might show their flaws.

201
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,920
Yes, Your Highness.

202
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,279
Sir Sun.

203
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,379
Now, His Highness is very cautious towards us aristocratic clans.

204
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,519
Is it safe for us to meet each other in your manor?

205
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,719
No need to panic.

206
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,460
Come, sit down and have some tea.

207
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,020
If you are not guilty,

208
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,980
then you have nothing to be afraid of.

209
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,420
But, Sir Sun,

210
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,540
I think His Highness has found out that I embezzled the military funds.

211
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,100
Although Prince Chen didn't point me out in the court,

212
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,860
his warning was bright and clear.

213
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,020
Do we have a whistle-blower in the court?

214
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,860
I had already warned you not to be too greedy in the first place...

215
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,460
so that you won't end up like the Zheng family.

216
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,100
But have you ever listened to me?

217
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Luo Zhi is back in court now.

218
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,639
His Highness has increased his effort in suppressing us scholars with the poor.

219
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,199
It's possible that he'll punish the Cai family...

220
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,640
as an example to others.

221
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,079
I regret what I've done.

222
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,959
Given that we are both prominent clans in Qingzhou...

223
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,439
and we are old family friends,

224
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,380
please save me and my family.

225
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,120
You have exaggerated.

226
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,580
Here.

227
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,380
Sir Sun, save me.

228
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,800
Sir Cai, have you heard about a rumor lately among the people...

229
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,639
saying that a Silver-Haired Demon had...

230
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,000
brought calamity to the country and had seduced the prince?

231
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,200
Are you saying that...

232
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,399
I didn't say anything.

233
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,199
But if you are smart,

234
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,420
you should know what you have to do.

235
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,319
Please give this to Miss Ling Yue.

236
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,759
Miss Sun, why don't you give it to His Highness yourself?

237
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,700
If I give this to Sister Ling Yue,

238
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,180
she will think that it's for Lady Rong Le.

239
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,359
What nonsense are you talking about? It makes no difference whether I give it to...

240
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,720
His Highness or Lady Rong Le.

241
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,679
You just need to give it to Ling Yue.

242
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,140
I've overstepped. Please forgive me, Miss Sun.

243
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Yali.

244
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,120
You know how to use some tricks now.

245
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,480
- You may leave now.
- Yes, Miss Sun.

246
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,780
You are in a good mood today, Father.

247
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,439
Ever since I came to Qingzhou,

248
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,260
it has been a long time since I last saw your smile.

249
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,919
Looks like you've thought things through.

250
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,480
I'm extremely glad.

251
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,460
You've always asked me to get close to His Highness.

252
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,280
Only now have I understood your purpose.

253
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,439
You have always said that... His Highness is the chosen one.

254
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:22,079
I have to marry him and become his consort...

255
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,100
so that I can be a future empress.

256
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,900
Only then can we consolidate the foundation of the Sun family...

257
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,380
and secure my happiness for the rest of my life.

258
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,620
Since you've understood this theory,

259
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,839
I'll be straightforward with you.

260
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,479
You need to know that although His Highness looks like he's close to me,

261
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,980
he has been guarding himself against me.

262
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,940
Now, more than ever, you need to get close to His Highness.

263
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,820
If this marriage alliance is successful,

264
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,380
the foundation of the Sun family will be secured.

265
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,140
You are His Highness's teacher.

266
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,740
Now, you are the provincial governor of Qingzhou with the most power.

267
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,300
I just don't understand.

268
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,419
If you just remain within bounds,

269
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,920
nothing can shake the foundation of the Sun family, right?

270
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,240
So what if I'm His Highness's teacher?

271
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,820
So what if I'm the provincial governor?

272
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,119
From the surface, it looks like the Sun family is prospering.

273
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,960
But we are actually hollow underneath.

274
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
The more integrated the transformation is,

275
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,940
the more loss the Sun family will suffer.

276
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,620
I have the most power in the court...

277
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,060
but it's just an empty title.

278
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,999
In order to carry out this transformation,

279
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,540
His Highness has arrogated all authority to himself.

280
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,919
It's like being close to a tiger.

281
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,340
I've been losing sleep because of this anxiety.

282
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,940
But, Father, Rong Le and His Highness love each other.

283
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,500
Nobody can take His Highness away from Rong Le.

284
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,640
Same goes for me.

285
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,420
How will I be able... to become his consort?

286
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,660
Where there's a will, there's a way.

287
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,959
As long as you treat His Highness wholeheartedly, he might waver.

288
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,660
Moreover, you can still form a marriage without feelings.

289
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,860
You should have learned your lesson...

290
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,380
from the humiliation you received in Zhongshan.

291
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,679
Feelings are just a tool to control the weak.

292
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,100
They are worthless.

293
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,759
Are they... really worthless?

294
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,239
Yali, the Sun family will either...

295
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,220
become His Highness's family and share the world with him...

296
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,260
or we will be his enemy.

297
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,959
We can only fight to our last breath...

298
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,560
against such a capable man like him.

299
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,660
Is this the only way?

300
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,559
Among the two choices,

301
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,239
you know which one will be better...

302
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,960
for the Sun family, for you, and for me.

303
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,140
Even if worse comes to worst,

304
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,620
if the marriage alliance is successful,

305
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,900
he will let go of the Sun family for your sake.

306
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,380
Yali, everything that I'm doing now...

307
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,020
is for your sake.

308
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,240
Think about it.

309
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,860
Your Highness, something bad has happened.

310
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,519
The bard that we had caught... has suddenly died in jail without any reasons.

311
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,540
I'm afraid that we have rats working in the prison.

312
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,279
Now, the person behind the scene is getting more and more daring.

313
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,020
Looks like he knows that we don't have any concrete evidence.

314
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,140
How dare he do this right under our noses.

315
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,699
Your Highness, this is all nonsense.

316
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:31,140
In order to force you to divorce Lady Rong Le,

317
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,820
they are quick to believe that she's the murdering demon.

318
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,239
Did Cai Yan He think that I wouldn't know his motives...

319
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,940
if he didn't do it himself but by instigating...

320
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,119
his former disciples from the Cai family to complain to me?

321
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,199
Your Highness, I've found out that...

322
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,439
Serene Hill Inn has been here in Qingzhou for more than one hundred years.

323
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,199
It is a famous inn.

324
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,740
Although people of all sorts gather in this place,

325
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,660
nobody has dared cause trouble in this place.

326
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,799
Word is that this place is under government protection.

327
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,540
According to rumor, the mysterious owner of this inn...

328
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,660
is very close to some high-rank officials in the court.

329
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,740
Could it be Cai Yanhe?

330
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,759
The Cai family has prospered on the southern border for one hundred years and more,

331
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,620
but Cai Yanhe is not a person...

332
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,460
who can carry out such a perilous plan.

333
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,039
Ever since the transformation was carried out,

334
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,199
because of the land distribution of the fiscal policy,

335
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,660
the scholars on the southern border are threatened.

336
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
And the one with the most losses...

337
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,340
will be desperate enough to take this risk.

338
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,980
- Are you saying that Sun...
- Let me go in!

339
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,220
What is it, Yali?

340
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,100
It's dinner time.

341
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,479
If you don't have anything important, please allow me to excuse myself.

342
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,399
Miss Sun, this is His Highness's habit.

343
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,599
During this time of the day, His Highness will be off-limits.

344
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,460
If you have anything urgent, you can tell me first.

345
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,279
Your Highness, please forgive me for my rudeness.

346
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,119
But after thinking it through,

347
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,860
you are the only one I can think of who can save me.

348
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,540
What do you mean?

349
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,479
When you were banished to Qingzhou because of...

350
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,279
the Yun's Mausoleum incident back then,

351
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,420
does the promise you made to me at that time...

352
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,280
still hold true?

353
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,519
Princess, look.

354
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,639
You've cooked these personally for His Highness.

355
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,199
So, of course, you should personally invite him for dinner...

356
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
in order for it to be more formal.

357
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,140
It has already become a habit for us to have dinner together every day.

358
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,500
Why do you want me to personally invite him?

359
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,759
What do you have in your mind?

360
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,359
Is he not going to come if I didn't invite him?

361
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,279
I'm saying that because you look so anxious and impatient.

362
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,839
That's because you tricked me...

363
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,879
saying that I'd treated him shabbily by preparing...

364
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,980
only simple food for him every day.

365
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,639
Although I'm still not very good at it this time,

366
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,040
I still want him to have a taste.

367
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,719
Yes. Only His Highness...

368
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,440
is able to stomach the food that you make.

369
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,359
A good night with good wine... served with good food.

370
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,919
Everything is ready.

371
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,359
Now, you'll only have to invite His Highness here for dinner.

372
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,220
Go and invite His Highness.

373
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,480
When you were banished to the southern border,

374
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,180
I was not willing to be married to the Zheng family.

375
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,799
So, you had given me this silver bracelet.

376
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,839
And we had covered up for each other.

377
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,100
Do you still remember it?

378
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,020
Of course I do.

379
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,679
But I too remember that the Zheng family is here no more.

380
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,640
And I had already settled the issue for you.

381
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,500
I didn't break the promise between us.

382
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,860
If there's nothing else, I'll have to leave.

383
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,900
Now that I think of it,

384
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,180
when I was under your protection back then,

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
it was the most peaceful...

386
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,200
and happiest moment in my life.

387
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,700
I had been thinking lately.

388
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,100
If I can continue to stay by your side,

389
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,000
maybe I won't need to go through so many hardships.

390
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,800
Yali, you shouldn't say this.

391
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,700
Your Highness, I know that this is wrong.

392
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,400
I have been tossing and turning thinking about it lately.

393
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm not sure if I should confess to you.

394
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
But I heard that...

395
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,800
Lady Rong Le is thinking about marrying me off to General Luo Zhi.

396
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,200
And recently, my father...

397
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,400
has been forcing me to make a choice for my marriage.

398
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,100
After giving it some thought,

399
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,600
I think that although I feel bad for Rong Le,

400
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,200
I have to fight for myself.

401
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,400
Princess, this...

402
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
Say no more.

403
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Yali,

404
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,800
you should be very clear that...

405
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,200
besides Man Yao,

406
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I love no other.

407
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Of course, I know that...

408
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Rong Le is the only one in your heart.

409
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,100
And I had seen with my own eyes that...

410
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,200
you had sacrificed yourself for Lady Rong Le.

411
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,000
I had fallen for the wrong person once.

412
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,300
So, I know better than anyone that you are the only one...

413
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,600
in this world who has real sentiments.

414
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,800
You just need to give me some love and warmth.

415
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,200
I just need a little bit of them...

416
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,800
and I'll live with no regrets forever.

417
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,000
Ever since you saved me in the palace regardless of your life,

418
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,500
I've already fallen in love with you.

419
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,100
Yali, have some respect for yourself.

420
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,140
The smell in this room...

421
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,300
is from the calming incense that I had made myself.

422
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,580
I wonder... if you've ever dreamed of me.

423
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,780
Princess, don't be sad.

424
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,520
Maybe this is just a misunderstanding.

425
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,940
I don't blame Wuyou...

426
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,680
and I trust him.

427
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,940
I just never thought that...

428
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,500
Yali... would be in love with him.

429
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,400
Princess Rong Le.

430
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,639
His Highness brought Miss Sun back to the southern border...

431
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,879
because she looked so desolate.

432
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,100
It's only normal that...

433
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,020
Miss Sun feels grateful for His Highness.

434
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,279
Yali is dainty with a harsh life.

435
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,920
She has such a dominant father...

436
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,900
and her feelings were once used by Fu Chou.

437
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,780
So, I've always had a tender affection for her.

438
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,800
And I hope that... she can find her true love.

439
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,600
And I don't want her to be involved in family fights.

440
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
Before this,

441
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,039
I mentioned Luo Zhi's marriage proposal to her.

442
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,920
I didn't force her as well since she's not willing to.

443
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,820
But I never thought that...

444
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,420
Princess, what are you going to do then?

445
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,000
There's nothing that I can do.

446
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,240
I just know that...

447
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,760
I believe in me and Wuyou's feelings.

448
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,460
I'm tired. I want to rest.

449
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,180
Then... what about the surprise that you prepared for His Highness?

450
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,960
Take them away.

451
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,139
I'll... let Wuyou take care of it himself.

452
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,980
Greetings, Your Highness.

453
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,180
Man Yao has eaten her dinner?

454
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,740
Why didn't she wait for me?

455
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,780
Princess is asleep already.

456
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,639
Did she suffer a relapse?

457
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,119
Your Highness, she heard about the Silver-Haired rumor today.

458
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,599
She's not happy about it and she's exhausted.

459
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,399
So, she has had an early night.

460
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,599
The Silver-Haired rumor?

461
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,980
She's not someone who would be affected by rumors.

462
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,420
Take good care of her.

463
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,960
Yes, Your Highness.

464
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,500
Please help me, Your Majesty.

465
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,460
Now, who else can I save?

466
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,180
Your Majesty, Prince Regent is back.

467
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,500
He has always shown you respect.

468
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,500
If you beg him, he might be able to spare Lan'er's life.

469
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,380
Lan'er?

470
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,140
Which Lan'er?

471
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,020
She is my younger sister.

472
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,879
She has served you before.

473
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,599
Recently, she has been transferred to Senyan Palace to serve Lady Fu.

474
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,599
But I haven't been able to find her for the past few days.

475
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,319
After some efforts, I found out that...

476
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,060
when Prince Regent came back that day,

477
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,380
Lan'er had accidentally splashed some tea on Lady Fu.

478
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,820
So, Lady Fu had kicked and hit her.

479
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,500
And after that, she went missing.

480
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,940
If I want to save her,

481
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,340
I'm afraid that you are the only one who can do that.

482
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,020
I heard that...

483
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,640
Prince Regent is going to enthrone Lady Fu as empress dowager.

484
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,740
What?

485
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,700
- Empress dowager?
- Yes.

486
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,039
You said he's going to enthrone her as empress dowager?

487
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,420
Yes. Prince Regent said that she has recovered.

488
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,280
She has recovered?

489
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,239
Then, has she regained... all of her memories in the past?

490
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,640
She is going to be empress dowager now.

491
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,900
I'm the empress.

492
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,460
I've taken her place.

493
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,980
She won't let go of me.

494
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,359
Your Majesty, no matter what, you are the previous empress.

495
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,479
Fu Yuan is just a woman who has just recovered from sanity.

496
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,239
She won't be a threat to you.

497
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,639
And there's Prince Regent.

498
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,460
He has always been respectful towards you, right?

499
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,219
People like you... know nothing.

500
00:30:57,219 --> 00:31:01,339
- Your Majesty.
- Do you know... what kind of a person Fu Yuan is?

501
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,439
She came back from hell.

502
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,900
She is just like the demon itself!

503
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,159
- Your Majesty.
- She's here to take our lives.

504
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,720
- What's wrong with you, Your Majesty?
- She's here to take our lives!

505
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,440
- Your Majesty!
- Get out.

506
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,120
Get out! Get out now!

507
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,500
Please save me.

508
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,500
All these years,

509
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,560
I've been putting my pride in my pocket.

510
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,240
I've never fought for anything.

511
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,220
It's all because of self-preservation.

512
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,540
I've dedicated my whole life to this palace.

513
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,000
I've dedicated myself to His Majesty.

514
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,939
But now, His Majesty is dead.

515
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:01,980
Crown Prince is dead.

516
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,000
Wuyou has left.

517
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,079
The people who I can rely on in the past are gone.

518
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,320
I can't rely on them anymore.

519
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,020
Now,

520
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,239
Fu Yuan is back.

521
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,280
When she comes back,

522
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,280
she won't let go of me.

523
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,020
She'll make me wish that I were dead.

524
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,380
Why?

525
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,580
Just like Sister Yun,

526
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,460
we've never wanted to hurt anybody!

527
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,279
I'm a devoted believer,

528
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,319
a loyal servant to Buddha.

529
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,839
Why are you treating me like this?

530
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,780
Why did you put me in such a sorry state?

531
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,160
Why?

532
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,130
This is so unfair!

533
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,900
Why would the late empress pass away suddenly?

534
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,200
There are rumors from the harem saying that...

535
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
she didn't die from illness.

536
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,100
They say that she hanged herself.

537
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,400
The maidservants found out about it when they brought her dinner.

538
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,600
Impossible.

539
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,400
The late empress is from a clan of scholars.

540
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,500
She has always been smart, cautious, and has taken care of herself well.

541
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,600
- That's right.
- Even Prince Regent... has treated her with courtesy.

542
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,000
Why would she commit suicide?

543
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
That's right.

544
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,300
Arrival of His Highness!

545
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

546
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,500
Please rise.

547
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

548
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,200
All of you here are the pillars of the country.

549
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,600
I've summoned you here today because of one thing.

550
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,200
I want to enthrone Empress Fu as empress dowager.

551
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,800
I want to give her back the Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal...

552
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,500
and bring her back to the ancestral temple.

553
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,900
As for the details,

554
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,000
I can only decide after I've discussed it with all of you.

555
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,200
- This...
- This...

556
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,000
From the way you look,

557
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,400
is there any objection?

558
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,600
Your Highness, the late empress just passed away yesterday.

559
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,800
If we are so quick to enthrone the empress dowager,

560
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,600
- I'm afraid that it's unacceptable.
- Why is it unacceptable?

561
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,300
She has just passed away and the truth behind her death is still uncertain.

562
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,200
The late empress had fallen ill...

563
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,400
because she missed the late emperor until the illness had taken her away.

564
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,600
Now, the late empress is together with the late emperor.

565
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
What truth do we need to be certain about?

566
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,400
Please be rest assured. I'll take care of...

567
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,200
the funeral of the late empress.

568
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,400
No need to worry about it.

569
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Your Highness, if I may be so bold.

570
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,000
Fu Yuan's identity is vague at best.

571
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Enthroning empress dowager will affect the country.

572
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,540
Please reconsider.

573
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,600
Insolent.

574
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,500
Fu Yuan is my birth mother.

575
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,400
She was the previous empress of the last sovereign.

576
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,100
How can her identity be vague?

577
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,800
What objections do you have?

578
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Your Highness, Empress Fu passed away more than 10 years ago.

579
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,600
We can't be sure of this woman's background.

580
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,800
And without proof, how can she be the model for all women?

581
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,400
And how can she make the people submit to her?

582
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,200
Yang Wei.

583
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,100
You've served the late emperor for many years.

584
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,400
Are you really unable to recognise Empress Fu Yuan?

585
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,300
His Highness, I had served the late emperor.

586
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,000
Of course, I know about Empress Fu.

587
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,300
And I know very well whether or not she's qualified...

588
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,800
to be the model for all women.

589
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,600
So, no matter she is Empress Fu or not,

590
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,000
I won't allow her to be empress dowager.

591
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Yang Wei.

592
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,800
How dare you talk back to your superior.

593
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,600
I think you have had enough of being the minister of the Ministry of Rites.

594
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,500
Even if... I'm not the minister of this Ministry of Rites,

595
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,600
I'll never recognize Fu Yuan as empress dowager.

596
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Yang Wei!

597
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,400
You are a senior official who had served for more than 10 years.

598
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Among all the others here, you should have known better!

599
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
That day, in this very place,

600
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,800
you had doubted my identity.

601
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,000
Now, you want to do the same?

602
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,800
You've defeated our enemy and brought peace to the country.

603
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,400
They are great merits.

604
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,500
But if you enthroned her as empress dowager,

605
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm afraid that from now on, the court will be in chaos...

606
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,500
and it'll be a disaster for the country and the people.

607
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,800
The merits that you've achieved before this...

608
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
will be gone in a split second.

609
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,000
My mother is a weak lady.

610
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,800
How can she bring chaos to the court?

611
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,200
Southern and Northern regions are all the same!

612
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Why do you have to condemn such a weak lady?

613
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,500
You are just making excuses and are accusing her of endangering the nation.

614
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,800
Her honor is not something that others can look down on easily.

615
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
Guards!

616
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,400
This...

617
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,800
My fellow officials.

618
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,000
Now, do any of you still have objections?

619
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,500
Your Highness.

620
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,700
The coronation for empress dowager is under the Ministry of Rite's duty.

621
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,300
Other officials in this court have nothing to do with it.

622
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,600
If you insist on your decision...

623
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,000
to enthrone Fu Yuan as empress dowager,

624
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,100
I'm willing to be punished for being disrespectful.

625
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,800
I'll retire and go back to my hometown.

626
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,100
From now on, please look for others to take my place.

627
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,800
- Sir Yang.
- Sir Yang.

628
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,700
We'll discuss the coronation of...

629
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,600
empress dowager again next time.

630
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Your Highness, according to custom,

631
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,700
late empress should be buried together with the late emperor.

632
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,300
But she has not been given the title of empress dowager yet.

633
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,200
What kind of funeral should we give her?

634
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,000
How would I know about these overelaborated formalities?

635
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,200
By the way, remember...

636
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,800
not to let anyone see the looks of the late empress.

637
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
I understand.

638
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,100
How could a person who was living well...

639
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,700
commit suicide just like that?

640
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
By the way, don't tell Mother about this.

641
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,700
It'll only make her worry.

642
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,000
Lately, she has recovered from her illness even more.

643
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,300
Arrival of Her Majesty!

644
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Greetings, Mother.

645
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,300
Chou'er.

646
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,700
You have to take care of yourself.

647
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,200
Health is most important.

648
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,600
Thank you for your care. I'll remember it.

649
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,800
Mother, have a seat.

650
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,200
Why do you have so many reports today?

651
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,000
Yang Wei has left his post.

652
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,400
After he left his post,

653
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,000
some of the vice ministers from the Ministry of Rites...

654
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
have quit their job as well.

655
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,200
It's normal to have more work when you have fewer people.

656
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,800
It's not a big deal.

657
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,200
- Chou.
- Mother.

658
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,800
I won't blame Sir Yang for what he did.

659
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,400
He's just being more cautious because this concerns...

660
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
the benefit of the nation.

661
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,200
If you want to hire him to work for the court again,

662
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,100
I won't mind it as well.

663
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,200
I know Yang Wei quite well.

664
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,600
With his temper by nature, since he has left,

665
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,900
he won't be coming back anymore.

666
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,400
Mother.

667
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,200
I've been delaying your coronation again and again.

668
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,300
Do you really not mind it?

669
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,300
You've said it many times.

670
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,200
I know. You have no choice but to do it...

671
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,500
because of the current situation.

672
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,200
Thank you for your understanding, Mother.

673
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,400
Somebody lacks judgment.

674
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,400
If they want to leave, let them go then.

675
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
No need to rack your brains for it.

676
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,100
Mother, you don't understand.

677
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,600
All the officials in this court... have stayed behind...

678
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,600
not because they are willing to serve me wholeheartedly.

679
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,200
They did it for the benefit of Northern Lin only.

680
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,800
After this coronation incident,

681
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,400
I can see it even clearer now.

682
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,500
Although I've been ruling Northern Lin for more than a year,

683
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:57,000
these officials still haven't submitted themselves completely to me.

684
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I have my Armour Army to force them.

685
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,900
But... it's not enough to suppress the arrogance in them.

686
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,000
That is because you are not ruthless enough.

687
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Chou'er, as the ruler of the country,

688
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,100
you are too soft-hearted.

689
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,800
Mother.

690
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,900
Making them submit by force... is the worst plan.

691
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,460
Although I can't say that I'll be a sage,

692
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,200
I don't want to be a tyrant as well.

693
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,800
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

694
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,140
♫ We have been through so much ♫

695
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,600
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

696
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,000
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

697
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,000
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

698
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,400
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

699
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:26,400
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

700
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,800
♫ I cried when you leave and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

701
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:39,200
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

702
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:46,000
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

703
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,600
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

704
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:59,200
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

705
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,000
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

706
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:41,600
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
