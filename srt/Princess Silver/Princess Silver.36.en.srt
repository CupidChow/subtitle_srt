00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:32,675
[Episode 36]

2
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,600
Where is Wuyou?

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
I want to see him.

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,400
If you want him to survive,

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,300
you need to stay alive.

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,000
If you die...

7
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
I am not trying to threaten you.

8
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,200
He being alive...

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,800
could only serve one purpose.

10
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,100
If you take good care of yourself,

11
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,600
you will see him eventually.

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Leave.

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Rong Le, I know you hate me.

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,170
You won't believe or listen to what I have to say.

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,600
The damage is done.

16
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,300
I won't deny my responsibility.

17
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,400
This is all my fault.

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,700
I failed to protect you.

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,200
A traitor swapped her with you and I didn't notice.

20
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,800
I didn't recognize you at once.

21
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,600
I won't ask you to forgive me.

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,400
I just want you to know...

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,600
that I will find the man that hurt us.

24
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,200
I will make him pay dearly.

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
Rest well.

26
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,000
Your Highness!

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
Ling Yue.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Your Highness.

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Ling Yue, you should get some rest.

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Your Highness, Prince Li wants you to have this.

31
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,800
What is the situation outside?

32
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Prince Chen and his soldiers have retreated to the south.

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
The crown prince has been deposed.

34
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
General Fu uses the Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal to control the court.

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
All the officers are under his command.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Any news from the Hidden Ones?

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
Prince Li is severely wounded.

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
He was captured by the general.

39
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
But I doubt General Fu will do anything reckless.

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Besides, he came prepared.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,700
All of Prince Li's troops fell into General Fu's hand.

42
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,200
Fu Chou had everything planned.

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,100
It was flawless.

44
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,000
Xiang Ying, with your knowledge about him,

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
where would he keep Wuyou?

46
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I have been asking around for the past few days.

47
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,700
Everything is normal at the manor.

48
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,300
But the royal palace is heavily guarded.

49
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,100
Guards are watching the Cold Palace.

50
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
No one is allowed to pass.

51
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,400
I think he could be there.

52
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Do you know which Cold Palace Fu Yuan was imprisoned in?

53
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
It was Senyan Palace. Empress Fu burned herself to death.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,300
Half of the palace perished with her.

55
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,000
It's still abandoned until today.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Xiao Sha.

57
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,500
Your Highness.

58
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Keep watch on Fu Chou's whereabouts.

59
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,400
Inform me at once if he enters the palace.

60
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,300
You need to be cautious, do not let him see you.

61
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,800
Yes.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,900
For now, I must recover my strength.

63
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,300
Xiang Ying, find me a good sword.

64
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,900
From now on, I must start training my swordplay.

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,200
- But your illness...
- I am fine.

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,600
I know my own limits.

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
I must get stronger.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
I can't let the others use me... or disrespect me.

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Yes!

70
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
[Senyan Palace]

71
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,280
[Senyan Palace]

72
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Open the door.

73
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,000
You are even more cunning than I thought.

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,400
I never understood why my father...

75
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,200
would kill the consort he loved the most.

76
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Now that I saw what happened to Man Yao,

77
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
I finally know the truth.

78
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Fu Yuan must have...

79
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,400
laced the Shilixiang wine sent by my teacher with poison.

80
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,300
And now, you are using the same poison.

81
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,200
You used Man Yao against me.

82
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,100
I am in your hands now.

83
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,400
Kill me if you want.

84
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,200
Why do you bother with torturing me?

85
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
This drug will keep the poison at bay and keep you alive.

86
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
We have a score to settle,

87
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,400
I won't let you die so easily.

88
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,200
Zongzheng Wuyou.

89
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
After so many years,

90
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,000
I have always longed for the day...

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
I could finally lock you up in here and step on you.

92
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,400
I will watch as you bow down to me.

93
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,200
I am going to return the pain and suffering...

94
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
my mother and I had back to you.

95
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,500
Who are you?

96
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,300
You should have known who I was by now.

97
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,200
One who could hate you so much...

98
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,000
to lock you up in here...

99
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,800
and pierce your wound with steel,

100
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,900
who else could that be?

101
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Impossible.

102
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
You are the son of Fu Yuan.

103
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,400
How could you still be alive?

104
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,200
I wanted to be dead.

105
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Yes, I am alive.

106
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,600
Not only that, I am also going to take back what is rightfully mine!

107
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,000
Fu Chou!

108
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
What did you do to my father?

109
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,000
Did you kill him?

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
You killed your own father!

111
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,600
He has no right to be my father! He has no right!

112
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
Well,

113
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,600
I realized the world was never fair to me.

114
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Why was I the one who was hunted down?

115
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,600
Here is something you never knew.

116
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
While we were still mere children,

117
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,200
my so-called father hunted me to have me killed.

118
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Back then,

119
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,500
I lost my name and my home.

120
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,000
I lived in the wild without any shelter.

121
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
What about you?

122
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
When you were a child,

123
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,500
in this magnificent palace,

124
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,900
you enjoyed so much love from your father.

125
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,500
You lived a life without worries.

126
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,600
And there is Rong Le.

127
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,500
You used her for your bidding and you hurt her,

128
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,800
but she is... still madly in love with you and misses you all the time.

129
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,300
Fu Chou.

130
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,400
You really are the son of Fu Yuan.

131
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,700
You are just as shameless as she is.

132
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,700
Fu Chou.

133
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,600
What did you do to Man Yao?

134
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,800
You are just a prisoner.

135
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Why would you care for the others?

136
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,800
Fu Yuan is dead because she brought it onto herself.

137
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Because of her own grudge,

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,800
the Qin family was executed.

139
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,100
She should be punished.

140
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,800
But you,

141
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,400
you spent your life in vengeance and hate.

142
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
You have no honor at all!

143
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,600
What if you really become the ruler?

144
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,300
It won't last long for you.

145
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,200
You will die a lonely old man.

146
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,300
Who says I will die a lonely old man?

147
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,600
The supreme and all-mighty throne will soon be mine.

148
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
As for Rong Le,

149
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,500
she will become my empress.

150
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,400
As for you,

151
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,300
for the rest of your life,

152
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,800
this chain will be your only friend.

153
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,000
You don't understand her at all.

154
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Do you honestly think she will stay by your side after this?

155
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,600
Empress?

156
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,400
She has never cared about titles.

157
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,900
She would rather die than be your empress.

158
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,500
You want to grow old with her?

159
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,600
That is just your wishful fantasy.

160
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,900
She loved me and yet she was so cruel to me in the end.

161
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
To make it worse,

162
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,400
she never had any love for you.

163
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,100
You are right about this.

164
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,400
She does have love for you.

165
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,900
But for that very reason,

166
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,900
she will behave and be with me.

167
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,200
We must act with caution. Do not alert the enemy.

168
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Fu Chou is wary of us.

169
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,800
There must be guards hidden in this area.

170
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,600
If he finds out we know where Wuyou is,

171
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
he will hide Wuyou somewhere else.

172
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,600
It will be even harder to track him down.

173
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,800
Yes.

174
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,200
I know it hurts a lot.

175
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,300
Because of the woman you love,

176
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,800
you lost everything.

177
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,600
You even handed over your life to your enemy.

178
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Don't you regret this?

179
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Saving the one I love is my duty.

180
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
If I were to be like you...

181
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
and ignore my own feelings to achieve my goal,

182
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
that would truly be great regret.

183
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Fu Chou,

184
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,300
is it because you have no other way to vent your anger...

185
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,200
so you came here to torture me?

186
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
You have a point.

187
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,000
Your Highness, a fire has broken out.

188
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,900
For your own safety, please leave at once.

189
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,400
The Hidden Ones sure act with haste.

190
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Who would have thought?

191
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,000
They are loyal to you till the end.

192
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
Wuyou!

193
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Man Yao.

194
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Wuyou.

195
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
Your hair...

196
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:51,679
Man Yao, these are small wounds.

197
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,600
I am a warrior. I'll be fine.

198
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,300
See?

199
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,600
Man Yao, listen to me.

200
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
This is not your fault.

201
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,400
This place is full of danger. You must go, now.

202
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Send more men to put out the fire.

203
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Don't let the fire spread to Senyan Palace.

204
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Send more men to watch this place.

205
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,200
If you see anyone suspicious, kill on sight.

206
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,300
Yes!

207
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
Leave.

208
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
More guards will be here. Leave before it's too late.

209
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
I...

210
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
I will find the Hidden Ones.

211
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,900
I won't let you stay here and get tortured.

212
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,000
Take care of yourself.

213
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,500
Do not be controlled because of me. Do you understand?

214
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,700
Wait for me.

215
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,600
Open the door.

216
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,400
[General's Mansion]

217
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,200
Your Highness.

218
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
This is a good sword.

219
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,700
I am glad you like it.

220
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,400
It was worth it to search for it.

221
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
You have my thanks.

222
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
You can go now.

223
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes.

224
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,100
Xiao Sha.

225
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,200
Have you found Ke'er?

226
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
Don't worry.

227
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,000
She has been in Prince Li's manor to search for a cure.

228
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
She is safe for now.

229
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,500
Prince Li's manor is being guarded by Fu Chou's men.

230
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,600
She is in danger when she is alone there.

231
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Get ready.

232
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
We are heading to the manor.

233
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Yes.

234
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Here comes the tea.

235
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
You said the mutiny was to fight for Princess Rong Le.

236
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,600
Is it true?

237
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
Of course, it's true.

238
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
With Prince Li's reputation,

239
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
why would he launch a mutiny?

240
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,700
The love for a woman is the cause of all fighting.

241
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,200
It's better if women don't look too pretty.

242
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,800
Otherwise, they would bring chaos to this world.

243
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,500
Xiao Sha.

244
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,200
Forget it.

245
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Why would the general...

246
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,600
No, I mean our future emperor...

247
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
actually announce to the world...

248
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,800
to make her the empress.

249
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
- What about the image of the land?
- You are right.

250
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,400
You are gossiping about the royal family in broad daylight

251
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,800
and spreading lies.

252
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,600
You should have known to mind your words!

253
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,400
- Leave.
- Let's go.

254
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
Help!

255
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,200
Help my child, help him!

256
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,600
Help my child!

257
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Please, help my child!

258
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,200
- Madam!
- Please help my son!

259
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
Please, save my son!

260
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,800
He is innocent! Please, I beg of you!

261
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,200
- Madam!
- Save me!

262
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Madam!

263
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,700
- Help my child! Please!
- Stop right there!

264
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,100
Please, save my son!

265
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,000
My son is innocent!

266
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
- Please, help my son!
- Your Highness.

267
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,100
Please, help my child.

268
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,800
- Don't let them kill him.
- Madam.

269
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,400
Can you please save this lady?

270
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,200
- He is innocent.
- We all take pity on her.

271
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Her husband left her when she was young.

272
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
She lost her child, too.

273
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,000
Her face is scarred.

274
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I beg of you.

275
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
Xiao Sha.

276
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
- Save him.
- Your Highness?

277
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,800
Save my son, please!

278
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,930
Thank you.

279
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,000
Thank you, Madam.

280
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
You are welcome.

281
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,200
I am in a hurry.

282
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
I don't want anyone to get in my way.

283
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Help my child.

284
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
Don't let them kill him.

285
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Don't let them kill him.

286
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,500
Don't let them kill him.

287
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,600
Thank you, Madam.

288
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,200
Let's go.

289
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,200
Order from His Highness. Prince Li is a traitor,

290
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
so his manor has been sealed off.

291
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,500
Without His Highness' permission,

292
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,000
no one can enter.

293
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
Open your eyes.

294
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
This is the carriage of the general's mansion.

295
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,300
How dare you block our way.

296
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,300
Stand aside or get killed.

297
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,000
You don't want to have bloodshed here.

298
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Atractylodes is bitter and warm, it tonifies the spleen.

299
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
Great Burnet is cold in nature.

300
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,500
It cools down the body heat.

301
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,400
Stemmacantha has great coldness, a source of iron and cleansing.

302
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
- It helps muscle growth.
- Ke'er.

303
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,500
Brother!

304
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,200
Princess, what happened to your hair?

305
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,700
Did the poison cause a relapse?

306
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,300
Don't worry, it's not that.

307
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,100
So why is it then? You were fine when I left.

308
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,000
What exactly happened to you?

309
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,300
Ke'er, much has happened recently.

310
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,500
It's hard to put it in a simple way.

311
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,000
I will explain to you later.

312
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,300
Ke'er, I am here to visit you...

313
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,800
because I want to know if you are well.

314
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,000
I am glad to see you are okay.

315
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,300
More guards have come here.

316
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,200
They all look sinister to me.

317
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,900
But I am too lazy to go out. So they don't bother me at all.

318
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,600
You cannot stay here.

319
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,200
Your brother and I are here to take you with us.

320
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,300
No, it's not easy to get a place so quiet.

321
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,600
I need to research on the remedy my master left...

322
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,100
and find a cure to cleanse the poison in you.

323
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,200
- But...
- Princess.

324
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
This is the antidote I made.

325
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,500
It can ease your conditions.

326
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,400
Let me read your pulse.

327
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Ke'er, I feel absent-minded lately.

328
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
I can't sleep well either.

329
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,400
Can you give me some medicine to help with my sleep?

330
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
I understand.

331
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I shall go now.

332
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,900
Miss Xiao is dear to me.

333
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,600
If any of you tries to disrespect her...

334
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
to let her get hurt...

335
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,700
- Agent Wu.
- ...I will show no mercy.

336
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes.

337
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
Is that all?

338
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,000
I told everything that I know.

339
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,600
With Rong Le's temper,

340
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,200
she won't surrender so easily.

341
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,600
Try to recall the details.

342
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,000
Was there any suspicious contact between them?

343
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,600
I watched closely as she made every move.

344
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,500
There was nothing suspicious.

345
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Good.

346
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,200
Right... Any progress on the Imperial Seal?

347
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,800
I sent my men everywhere we could search.

348
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
We haven't found anything for now.

349
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,400
The capital is not a giant haystack.

350
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,000
It's not like the seal would grow a pair of wings and fly away.

351
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes, I will keep searching.

352
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,100
What about Lady Rong Le's wound?

353
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,000
According to the servants that tend to her,

354
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,200
compared to days ago, her wound has become even worse.

355
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,200
What? Didn't the physician dress the wound?

356
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
General, Lady Rong Le trains her swordplay every night.

357
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,000
Her wound has become worse.

358
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,100
The physician advised her.

359
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,400
But she wouldn't listen.

360
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
Also, I have found the mad woman that has been pestering her.

361
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I brought her in for interrogation.

362
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
None of her words make sense.

363
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,500
She kept talking about her son.

364
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
- She said her son is...
- I don't want to know about some mad lady.

365
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,200
If it happens again, deal with her yourself.

366
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,400
General, there is a letter from the South.

367
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,400
If you still remember our agreement,

368
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,200
please take care of my daughter for me.

369
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,400
If not, this is the end of our alliance.

370
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
When are you taking me to him?

371
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,700
My mind will not be at ease unless I see him.

372
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,800
Your affection means nothing to me.

373
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,700
Fu Chou, if you want me to stay in this manor,

374
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,100
don't you dare try to torture him.

375
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,500
Rong Le.

376
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,800
Do you mean if I treat him nice,

377
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,100
you will stay by my side forever?

378
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
As long as you are with me,

379
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,800
and Zongzheng Wuyou leaves this nation,

380
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,600
you have my word I will release him.

381
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,800
All the grudges we had will be wiped clean.

382
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,100
Are you certain you can do that?

383
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,400
You would even have me under house arrest.

384
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
Why would you let him go?

385
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
You are not under house arrest.

386
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,400
I am afraid... you might face more dangers when you go out there.

387
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,600
Fine.

388
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,400
You have my word.

389
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
From now on,

390
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,500
you may go wherever you want.

391
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,700
I will send out the order.

392
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,800
But you must promise me one thing.

393
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,200
Take more guards with you when you go out.

394
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
Safety first.

395
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,000
Now that you have the throne,

396
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
why can't you show him some leniency?

397
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,800
It's not that I don't want to.

398
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,200
It's because he and I can never see eye to eye.

399
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,700
Think about this. If he were the one that won today,

400
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,830
do you think he would let me go?

401
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,400
With his capable mind,

402
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,400
he will rise up again sooner or later.

403
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,800
He must leave Northern Lin.

404
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,600
When the day comes,

405
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
the nation will be threatened and there will be pandemonium.

406
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,300
The world will never know peace again.

407
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,000
Forget it.

408
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,200
Just leave.

409
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,000
I don't want another word from you.

410
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,920
[Eastern Guest House]

411
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,600
You will die for betraying our master.

412
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,400
Hen Xiang, you snuck out while the Creed were retreating.

413
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,200
Apologize to our master now!

414
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,600
Not a chance.

415
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,400
I would rather choose death now that I have escaped.

416
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
I will not return to being a pawn again!

417
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
You are persistent.

418
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
You were special since you were a child.

419
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,500
Even Young Master holds high regard for you.

420
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,000
But you have betrayed him.

421
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
There is no one to save your skin this time.

422
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,400
You are heavily wounded. You are no match for us.

423
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,600
Surrender!

424
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Perhaps I can plead for you.

425
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,300
Enough of your chatter. Bring it on!

426
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,600
Your wound is bad.

427
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,000
Let me dress it for you.

428
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,800
I am taking you to a clinic. Come with me!

429
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,500
Don't bother.

430
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,800
I can walk on my own.

431
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,800
Do you seriously still have hope for General Fu?

432
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,800
Because you were set up that day,

433
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,200
Lady Rong Le has suffered great humiliation.

434
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,400
Her hair has gone white.

435
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,800
With the general's love for her,

436
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,400
he will surely regret and hate you to the bone.

437
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,400
What does it matter?

438
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Both you and General Fu lost your fathers.

439
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,400
Both of you were raised under harsh conditions.

440
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
When you relied on one another,

441
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,600
it was normal if he thought you were better than anyone.

442
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,400
But once you walked out from the hardships,

443
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,200
seeing you would remind him of his miserable past.

444
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,300
He may have trusted you,

445
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,800
but he will never love you.

446
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,200
If you still insist on going to him,

447
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,300
he will surely kill you.

448
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,400
Hen Xiang, don't rush to your own death.

449
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,400
You deserve a better life.

450
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,000
The Creed is retreating.

451
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,600
They have no time to go after you.

452
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,800
Wherever you want to go,

453
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,000
whatever you plan to do,

454
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I will gladly help you.

455
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,000
After so many years,

456
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,800
you are the only person that truly cares for me.

457
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,500
But for that same reason,

458
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,500
I cannot let you be involved.

459
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Do you still have feelings for General Fu?

460
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,000
Feelings or not, it doesn't matter.

461
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,200
I had my revenge.

462
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,000
He got what's rightfully his.

463
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,200
My goals are completed.

464
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,800
I have no other desires.

465
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,000
Is this why you want to get killed?

466
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,700
Only a scoundrel would live to survive, how could you...

467
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,000
Don't worry.

468
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,600
It wasn't easy to crawl out of that hellhole.

469
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
I won't end my life so easily.

470
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,300
I am just tired.

471
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,000
I am tired of living a life full of fighting.

472
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,100
You...

473
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
What will you do next?

474
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,400
When my parents were alive,

475
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,500
they wanted me and my sister to have a normal life.

476
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,800
Now that my sister is no longer with us,

477
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,400
I want to fulfill this wish for her.

478
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,500
My hands are stained with too much blood.

479
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,000
Even I am disgusted.

480
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Don't come any closer.

481
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,400
Not even death scares you.

482
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
But you are afraid of me?

483
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,200
Do you really think...

484
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,800
I am more terrifying than death?

485
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,200
If you could be so cruel to your own wife,

486
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,000
you will surely do the same to me.

487
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,600
Rather than being locked up in here...

488
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,800
or being used as a hostage against my father,

489
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,500
I should just put an end to this.

490
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,600
You can use me as your pawn or make me a prisoner,

491
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
but you cannot stop me from seeking my death!

492
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Don't you hate me,

493
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,400
and want to have your revenge and kill me?

494
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,100
Hating you and having revenge won't make a difference.

495
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,000
Even if I kill you,

496
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
the righteous and humble gentlemen in my heart,

497
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,400
the general that fights despite all of his wounds,

498
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,100
the hero that protects the people from our enemy...

499
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,200
will never come back to me.

500
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,000
A hero?

501
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,200
Do you know how your so-called hero...

502
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
was made into the man he is today?

503
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,200
I was abandoned by my father.

504
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,500
He even sent assassins to kill me.

505
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,800
I was raised in hell.

506
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,000
On the battlefield, I risked my life to slay the enemy.

507
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
I have been through life and death countless times.

508
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
I carry all sorts of wounds,

509
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,600
there are scars everywhere.

510
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Do you know any of these?

511
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,000
All you saw was the glory of a general.

512
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
You never saw the pain behind that glory.

513
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Sun Yali, don't make it hard for yourself.

514
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,000
You were never truly in love with me from the start.

515
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,800
What you love was your own fantasy.

516
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,600
No, that is not true!

517
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,200
You were a different person.

518
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,600
This is what I've always been!

519
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,000
The life I was given...

520
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,400
is full of plotting and scheming,

521
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,800
treachery and evils.

522
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,600
I was never a big hero.

523
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
That is not what I wanted.

524
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,800
No one can force me to be a hero!

525
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,800
Sun Yali.

526
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,500
Every time you see me with admiration,

527
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,600
I give it some thought.

528
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,200
A delicate lady of a noble that had a perfect life...

529
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,400
will feel like she is above everyone...

530
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,700
but has no idea...

531
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,100
how ignorant and shallow she is.

532
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,000
I finally understand why Princess Rong Le...

533
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,800
never loved you.

534
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Yes, I had no idea what you went through.

535
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,700
But you never told me about your past.

536
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,600
I loved how brave and bold you were on the battlefield.

537
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,200
I liked how humble you were to people.

538
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,000
That was the side of you that you showed me!

539
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Was it my fault to love you...

540
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,800
for what you showed me?

541
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,200
You so heartlessly stepped on my love for you.

542
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,400
Do you really feel joy in it?

543
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,600
I don't need your love.

544
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,200
My love is for Rong Le alone.

545
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,200
But that very person...

546
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,600
will never truly be in love with you.

547
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,600
You want to taunt me into killing you.

548
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,400
I will never fall for that.

549
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,800
If you had seen hell, you would have known...

550
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,400
how fortunate you are to even be alive.

551
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,900
Sun Yali.

552
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,800
You said I stepped on your love.

553
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,400
You on the other hand...

554
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,000
are wasting away your own life.

555
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You are your father's only daughter.

556
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
If you die,

557
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,400
he will lose the will to live.

558
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,500
Please, don't hurt my father.

559
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,200
Maybe you are right.

560
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,600
I was never truly in love with you.

561
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,200
But ever since I met you,

562
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,800
every action that I tried so hard to accomplish...

563
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,000
was to get one step closer to you.

564
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,800
What happened to me today...

565
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,800
was because of my own foolishness.

566
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,900
I don't wish to hate you.

567
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,400
I have but one piece of advice for you.

568
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,500
Maybe your feelings for Rong Le...

569
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,000
are just the same as mine for you.

570
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,800
This is not true love.

571
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,200
You just want to best Prince Li.

572
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,000
Let it go.

573
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,600
Going astray on this path...

574
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,100
will make you suffer the same consequences as mine.

575
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
You are not me.

576
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,200
Don't draw your own conclusion.

577
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,710
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

578
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:16,200
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

579
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:24,800
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

580
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,200
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

581
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,300
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

582
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:42,800
♫ You are keeping me out with your care
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

583
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,400
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

584
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,800
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

585
00:43:51,800 --> 00:44:01,000
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

586
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

587
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,200
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

588
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:18,800
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

589
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

590
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,600
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

591
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:38,800
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

592
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,600
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

593
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,000
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

594
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:00,000
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
