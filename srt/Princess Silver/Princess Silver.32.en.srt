[Episode 32]

2
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,799
Who was it?

3
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,580
- Your Majesty?
- Summon the physician!

4
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,500
Yes, Prince Fanyang.

5
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,160
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,999
Your Majesty.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What is going on? What happened?

8
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,940
Who was the assassin?

9
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,259
Imperial physician, please check on His Majesty's condition.

10
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,680
Roger that.

11
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,320
Your Majesty.

12
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,360
Your Majesty.

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,760
Your Majesty.

14
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,140
Your Majesty.

15
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,199
- What happened?
- Prince Fanyang.

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,179
His Majesty is already weak, to begin with, for he has worked hard every year.

17
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:31,959
It's not suitable for His Majesty to go into war, we already had a harsh journey.

18
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,279
His Majesty is plagued with dizziness and stiffness.

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,939
Moreover, His Majesty was attacked and His Majesty has lost too much blood. That's why...

20
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,999
You are really a useless physician.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,759
- You...
- Guards. Off with his head.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,959
- Yes, General.
- Spare my life, General.

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,759
Spare my life, General!

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,759
- Spare my life, General!
- Your Majesty.

25
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,559
Who was so bold to attack him?

26
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,639
How dare he barge into the army base to assassinate the emperor.

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,360
Are all the soldiers outside useless?

28
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,080
Tell me! Who's the perpetrator?

29
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,799
- His Majesty addressed him as Wuyou.
- Nonsense!

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,340
It's impossible that Prince Li would come here to assassinate the emperor.

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,359
Where is the assassin?

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,080
General Fu,

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,359
that assassin was too strong.

34
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm not his opponent at all.

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,679
But when I was fighting with him,

36
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,299
I accidentally took off his black mask and saw his real face.

37
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,600
Who is the assassin?

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,360
Prince Li, Zongzheng Wuyou.

39
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,759
- Prince Li. How is that possible?
- That's right. It's impossible.

40
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,260
- That's right.
- Impossible.

41
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,540
I can't believe it.

42
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,399
I think it's because at the court last time,

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,100
His Majesty had sent him back to the southern border;
he has no hope for the throne.

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,599
So, he killed His Majesty in a fit of rage.

45
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,399
Maybe he's already bringing in troops from the Southern region to seize the throne now.

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,479
General Fu, we need to go back to the city immediately to stop him.

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,600
Such nonsense!

48
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,119
His Majesty doted on Prince Li and trusted him.

49
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,439
And Prince Li values filial piety and righteousness.

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,560
He won't commit patricide to seize the throne.

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,780
Just now, you said that you arenot the assassin's opponent...

52
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,959
and yet you are able to take off his mask.

53
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,839
All of the soldiers you brought along were dead.

54
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,919
But you don't even have any major wounds.

55
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,239
You contradict yourself and it's not convincing at all.

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,940
Tell me. Who are you working for?

57
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,320
How dare you accuse Prince Li!

58
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,020
I know that Prince Fanyang thinks highly of Prince Li.

59
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,820
But I never thought that...

60
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,639
you would be so bold to gang up with Prince Li to assassinate His Majesty.

61
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,919
Stop spitting lies, General Fu.

62
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,120
How dare you accuse me?

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,839
This army base has tight security.

64
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,900
Before this, nothing has ever gone wrong.

65
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,060
But as soon as you reach the army base,

66
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,039
an assassin came in to assassinate His Majesty. Why?

67
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,420
Is it... a coincidence?

68
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,679
You ganged up with Western Qi and wanted to turn against us.

69
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,839
His Majesty brought you along to give you a chance.

70
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,679
But not only do you not repent your sins,

71
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,799
you arranged for this assassination and blamed it on Prince Li.

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,839
You've lost your mind.

73
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,020
Guards, arrest Fu Chou!

74
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,020
Fu Chou, are you really going to revolt?

75
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,180
I have the Tiger Emblem. I want to see who the one i...

76
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,380
trying to revolt today.

77
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,559
This is His Majesty's Tiger Emblem. Why do you have it?

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,959
That's right. General Li and I had a meeting with His Majesty today.

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,519
His Majesty had purposely sent you away.

80
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,679
His Majesty lost his trust in you completely.

81
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,199
Why would His Majesty give the Tiger Emblem to you?

82
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,799
Before departing for this war, His Majesty has felt that...

83
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,279
somebody would take this chance to rebel.

84
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
So, His Majesty had entrusted me with this Tiger Emblem.

85
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,939
I never thought that... General Wei and General Li...

86
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:22,000
are the same as Prince Fanyang.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,240
All of you are working with Zongzheng Wuyou.

88
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,679
His Majesty has given his order. If there's any accident,

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,860
- those who rebel... will be punished to death.
- You!

90
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,460
This is the law of the nation.

91
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,680
A general follows his emperor.

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,039
The Tiger Emblem commands the army.

93
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,399
Those who disobey will be treated as traitors... against the nation.

94
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,920
We will obey you, General!

95
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,199
You...

96
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,439
Everybody knows that Zongzheng Wuyou has assassinated His Majesty.

97
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
General Wei, General Li, and Prince Fan Yang.

98
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,260
The three of you have ganged up with Zongzheng Wuyou in secret.

99
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,039
I think I should...

100
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,359
chop off your heads as a warning for others...

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,479
to set the law straight.

102
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,039
Wait! Don't believe the nonsense uttered by this fake gentleman.

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,519
He is the real traitor here.

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,879
Such a foul man you are. How dare you accuse me!

105
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,559
I'll fight you to death.

106
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,740
Arrest them.

107
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,740
Kill them!

108
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,679
You are not Fu Chou.

109
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,539
Fu Chou has braved the battlefield with his soldiers for so long.

110
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,679
Even if he's no longer loyal, he wouldn't sacrifice his soldiers like this.

111
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,360
Who are you?

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,679
Look at you.

113
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,760
You still wanted to make an excuse even though you are going to die soon.

114
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,039
How about this?

115
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,559
Three of them ganged up with a traitor...

116
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,300
to assassinate His Majesty. That is unforgivable.

117
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,959
You'll be rewarded with 200 taels for one head,

118
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,999
three-rank increase for two heads...

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,839
and for three heads,

120
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,719
you'll have an audience with Crown Prince...

121
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,040
to be given the title as first-rank general.

122
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,880
- Looks like we will die here today.
- We'll fight to our last breath then.

123
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,559
Bring him back to me.

124
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,720
- Yes, General! Come with me!
- Yes, Sir!

125
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,520
Listen to my command.

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,940
Prepare the troops to send His Majesty back to the capital...

127
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,219
and to stop Zongzheng Wuyou from seizing the throne.

128
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:30,920
Roger that!

129
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,880
[General's Manor]

130
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,559
General, we have a letter from the army base.

131
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,199
The mutiny is successful.

132
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,039
What about the casualties?

133
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,839
It wasn't mentioned in the letter but the letter did say that...

134
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,020
His Majesty is gone.

135
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,080
What did you say?

136
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,820
- He is dead?
- Please stay calm.

137
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,539
Master said that it's because Lady Rong Le barged into the army base suddenly...

138
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:22,399
and exposed the truth in public that you were still in the General's Manor.

139
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,520
So, he had to act ahead of time.

140
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,100
That's why we are left with this result.

141
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,119
Where is Rong Le now?

142
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,220
We can't locate her after she left the army base.

143
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,519
Send someone to look for her now.

144
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,039
Search every crook and cranny from the army base to the southern border.

145
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,599
Find Zongzheng Wuyou and Rong Le. Don't let them meet.

146
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,140
Inform me once you have the news.

147
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,960
Pass on my order. Ask them to start now.

148
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,340
- Yes, General.
- Wait.

149
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Don't let Rong Le get hurt.

150
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,220
I understand. Don't worry.

151
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Captain Xiang,

152
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,500
did you realize that Crown Prince is acting really weird recently?

153
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,600
When Father was still in the palace,

154
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
at least he reined himself in.

155
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,600
Now that father has gone to war, he's acting like an unbridled horse.

156
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Isn't he afraid that Father will punish him when he comes back?

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
It is indeed strange.

158
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,400
But now, Crown Prince is not the only one who is acting strange.

159
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,800
Someone is being restless among the royal guards as well,

160
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
trying to stir up troubles.

161
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,900
Who is so bold to provoke you, Captain Xiang?

162
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,800
The vice-captain of the royal guard,

163
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Zhao Yisheng.

164
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,500
Zhao Yisheng? What does he want?

165
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,600
I think he has been the vice-captain for too long.

166
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,500
He wants to exchange his position with me.

167
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,800
To try something new.

168
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,900
Impossible. My father trusts only you.

169
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,400
As long as my father is here,

170
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,600
nobody can take your place as the captain.

171
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
All right. I'll go back first.

172
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,300
Keep a close eye on Crown Prince.

173
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,600
Don't worry, Prince Chen.

174
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,600
Who dares block my way?

175
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Who are you?

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
Why did you tie me up?

177
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,100
Do you know who I am?

178
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,600
The captain of the Royal Guard, Xiang Cheng.

179
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Of course, I know who you are.

180
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,300
But you might not know who I am.

181
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
Fu Chou?

182
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
When did you come back to the city?

183
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Maybe you should ask me,

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,200
why am I still here in the city?

185
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,400
I saw you with my own eyes.

186
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,900
Is that a fake Fu Chou?

187
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,900
- Then His Majesty...
- His Majesty is not here anymore.

188
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,800
How dare you murder the emperor!

189
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,000
Fu Chou, how daring you are!

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
I'm going to kill you for His Majesty!

191
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
You've killed me once for him already.

192
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
What do you mean?

193
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Sixteen years ago, when I was still a child,

194
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,600
you had chased after my life with your men for five years.

195
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800
From the city to the suburb...

196
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,000
and from the mountains to the rivers.

197
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,700
In those five years,

198
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,400
I had never once had a full stomach or a good sleep.

199
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,200
Do you still remember... it?

200
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I killed you... and you fell into the river.

201
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,900
I had played hide-and-seek with you for five years.

202
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,400
I know you very well.

203
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
If you knew that I was still alive,

204
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,400
you wouldn't stop hunting me down.

205
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,000
I was tricked by you.

206
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
Xiang Cheng.

207
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,100
Don't you think you should be...

208
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,400
thankful to me?

209
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Because everybody thought that I was dead.

210
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,100
That's why you are able to sit in this position as captain of the Royal Guards today.

211
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,600
Hunting down a kid...

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,000
is the most disgraceful thing...

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
that I had ever done in my life.

214
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,900
But His Majesty has his own reasoning.

215
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,300
As his servants, I have no right to question his decision.

216
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,800
I can only follow his order.

217
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,600
I can't disobey him.

218
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,200
Your loyalty... is so touching.

219
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
It's my mistake...

220
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,800
for not completing my mission back then.

221
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,000
Now that I'm in your hands,

222
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,800
I have no one to blame but myself.

223
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Just do whatever... you want with me.

224
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,200
You are a real man.

225
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,100
- Guards.
- Yes, Young Master.

226
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
Give him... a fast ending.

227
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Yes, Young Master.

228
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,900
I heard that after His Majesty left, Crown Prince is having fun every night...

229
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,600
and he treats the national affairs casually.

230
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,500
He doesn't have the poise of a crown prince.

231
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,900
As his wife, you should advise him.

232
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,200
Ask him to rein himself in.

233
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Looks like you are very disappointed in me.

234
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,500
Greetings, Mother.

235
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,000
It's already bad enough that you act so wildly in your own palace.

236
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How can you be so rude to your mother?

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,200
Your mother is lecturing you for your own good.

238
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Shut up!

239
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,600
You slapped your consort without any reason.

240
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,300
Are you doing it as a show for me?

241
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,900
You are just a crown prince right now...

242
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,600
and you've already treated me with such disrespect.

243
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
If you become... the emperor in the future,

244
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,400
are you going to kick me out from the palace?

245
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
You've exaggerated.

246
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,400
I've always been filial to you.

247
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,100
I've respected you.

248
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,800
But all these years,

249
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,000
because Father dotes on Wuyou,

250
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,300
everything Wuyou does is correct...

251
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,700
and everything I do is just a nuisance to you.

252
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,300
Do you think that Wuyou will be the successor to the throne?

253
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,800
That's too unfortunate.

254
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,100
The one who's sitting in the crown prince's position now is me.

255
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,200
And I'll be the successor for the throne.

256
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Mother,

257
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,600
looks like I'll have to disappoint you.

258
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,700
You...

259
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,000
I still have work to do.

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Farewell.

261
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,600
The Creed of Vengeance is very capable, right?

262
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
What time is it now?

263
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Why do you have no news about Fu Chou yet?

264
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,800
Do not be anxious.

265
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,600
No news means that the time is not right yet.

266
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,100
The time is not right.

267
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,800
The time is not right.

268
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
When will the time be right?

269
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,200
This Fu Chou.

270
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
Why isn't he taking any actions?

271
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,400
What is his plan? Why didn't he tell me anything?

272
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,200
He's the same as the rest of them.

273
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,800
They never take me seriously.

274
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,200
When I sit on the throne,

275
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,300
I'll make him...

276
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,100
Fu...

277
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
General Fu.

278
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
Why are you here?

279
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,200
I thought that you had departed together with my father.

280
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Of course, I have my own reason to be here.

281
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,800
Just now, what did you say about making me pay...

282
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,700
after you sit on the throne?

283
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,700
I'm talking about those... who had never taken me seriously.

284
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,000
Of course, I'll punish them accordingly.

285
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,500
General Fu.

286
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,800
You are different.

287
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,300
You are my most trusted man.

288
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,300
If you can tell me about your plan,

289
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,800
when I become the emperor,

290
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,600
I'll be thankful for your help.

291
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,599
I didn't tell you about the plan...

292
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
because the time is not right.

293
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,300
General Fu.

294
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,900
General Fu.

295
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,400
Is it the right time now?

296
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,200
Today, I'm here to tell you something.

297
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,900
Zongzheng Wuyou... bears a grudge from being banished away from the capital.

298
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,400
He infiltrated the army base to assassinate His Majesty.

299
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
What?

300
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,600
His Majesty was heavily wounded.

301
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,000
So, he's now on his way back to the capital.

302
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You said that Zongzheng Wuyou assassinated His Majesty?

303
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Impossible.

304
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
General Fu.

305
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,500
General Fu, this is your plan. Right?

306
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,600
Is my father... really dead?

307
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,600
You didn't tell me that you'd kill my father.

308
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,900
I think you know better than anyone that...

309
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,200
there can only be one leader.

310
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
From the day you'd decided to revolt,

311
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,300
this is what you should have expected.

312
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,500
Your Highness, are you so naive to think that...

313
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,200
you'd have a chance to take the throne if His Majesty were still alive?

314
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,900
I think the army will send this news to the court very soon.

315
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,300
Suppress this news. Don't let our enemies know about it.

316
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,000
All right.

317
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,100
As for the captain of Royal Guards, Xiang Cheng,

318
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,400
I've already taken care of him for you.

319
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,700
What?

320
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,800
You can appoint vice-captain, Zhao Yisheng as the new captain.

321
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,800
When that time comes, the Royal Guard will be ours.

322
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
As for Prince Chen, no need to worry about him.

323
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,600
The court will run itself.

324
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,000
No.

325
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,100
There are more suitable candidates for this position as captain.

326
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,500
- I want Zhao Yisheng. Your Highness.
- You!

327
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,800
- Just do as I say.
- You!

328
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,500
Stop right there!

329
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,000
Fu Chou.

330
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,900
Have you forgotten about who your master is?

331
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,200
I am your master.

332
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,800
This is the Eastern Palace.

333
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,500
You come and go as you please.

334
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,700
You didn't tell me your plan.

335
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,600
And now, you even order me around?

336
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Guards! Arrest this man!

337
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,800
Greetings, Young Master.

338
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,000
What?

339
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,300
You are the young master of the Creed of Vengeance?

340
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,200
I see.

341
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,000
So, you've been lying to me all along.

342
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,200
I'll kill you.

343
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
Fu Chou.

344
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,400
You'd planned all of this since the beginning, right?

345
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,900
You tricked me to gain my trust.

346
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,800
You asked others to instigate me so that I'd fall into your trap...

347
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
so that you could use me! Am I right?

348
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,400
If you have no intention to fight Wuyou, you wouldn't have fallen into my trap.

349
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,900
If you had no intention to rebel,

350
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,700
you wouldn't be like this today.

351
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,000
You made your own choice.

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,600
Nobody forced you to do it.

353
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,300
You wanted to kill me because you know that His Majesty is dead.

354
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,700
Now, you can control the Royal Guard.

355
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,300
And it's perfectly justifiable for you to take the throne.

356
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,600
You have troops that can help you to fight off Wuyou now.

357
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
You don't need me anymore.

358
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,200
But I want to make things clear to you.

359
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,900
The Royal Guard without Xiang Cheng is like a headless chicken.

360
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,200
They won't be able to win against the army of the southern border.

361
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,500
They can't even win against The Hidden Ones.

362
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,300
So, Your Highness,

363
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,100
you are still far away from success.

364
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,800
If you want to get rid of me as soon as I'm out of use,

365
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
I think it's still too early for that.

366
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,000
Without me,

367
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,200
death will be upon you.

368
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,000
Think carefully.

369
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,100
Let go of him.

370
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Will he kill me?

371
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Xiang, will he kill me?

372
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,700
I don't know if he'll kill you or not.

373
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
But I know that...

374
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,100
if you think about killing him again,

375
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,800
I'll kill you first.

376
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,200
You...

377
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,300
You are...

378
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,600
That's right.

379
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I am a part of the Creed of Vengeance, too.

380
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,200
I came here to help you under Young Master's order.

381
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
As long as you are obedient,

382
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,000
that almighty title will still be yours.

383
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,300
But if you don't,

384
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm afraid that I'll have to think of a way to make you listen.

385
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,900
You are a smart person.

386
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,200
You won't make things hard for yourself, right?

387
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Xiang.

388
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,400
We are husband and wife, right? There is love between us.

389
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,600
The Creed of Vengeance has a kind of medicine...

390
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
called Love Potion.

391
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,800
Those who take it will dream about romantic scenes.

392
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,700
So, the love that you mean is just your imagination.

393
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,700
Although I'm an assassin,

394
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,000
I won't give myself to others easily.

395
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you know that... every time you touch me,

396
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,000
I have the urge to chop off each and every one of your fingers.

397
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
You are a perverted, useless, and immoral man.

398
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,700
If it wasn't because of our young master, do you think...

399
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,400
you have the right to fight Zongzheng Wuyou for the title?

400
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,100
Not only are you ungrateful, you thought about eliminating him.

401
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,200
You have overreached yourself.

402
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
You should be thankful that...

403
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
we have the same goal now.

404
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,000
Rather than being arrested by Wuyou and punished for treason,

405
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,400
how about you cooperate with us nicely?

406
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's defeat Zongzheng Wuyou together.

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,100
That's the only way for you to sit on the throne without worries.

408
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,000
Only then can you stand at the top to order others around.

409
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,200
- Don't think about leaving this place to get help.
- No...

410
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,600
This palace... is occupied by many of our men from the Creed of Vengeance.

411
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Take care.

412
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,400
General!

413
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,600
We have news about Lady Rong Le.

414
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,200
She's at Qingtong's frontier pass.

415
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,400
- Ready my horse for me.
- Yes, General.

416
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,600
Why did you hunt me down?

417
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,600
Don't come near me.

418
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,600
You are not Fu Chou.

419
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
Fu Chou is not as cynical as you are.

420
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,600
Who are you?

421
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,400
Why did you dress up as Fu Chou to harm His Majesty?

422
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,800
Looks like you understand him quite well.

423
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,300
Unfortunately, he's not here.

424
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,000
He can't hear what you said.

425
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,100
Since you know that I've harmed His Majesty,

426
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,100
it means that you were in the tent back then.

427
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,700
If that's the case,

428
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,900
I won't let you escape.

429
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,100
I told you many times. Don't hurt her.

430
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,400
She already knows about our secret.

431
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,700
That is my business. Not yours.

432
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,600
Don't forget about your promise and your mission.

433
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,700
You are getting more and more controlling.

434
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,600
And you are getting more and more reckless.

435
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
I asked you to keep the troops under your thumb.

436
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,000
But you've caused a massive killing.

437
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,800
I haven't even... punished you for that.

438
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,100
So, the reason you are angry...

439
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,000
is because Zongzheng Yunhe is dead.

440
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,400
Don't tell me that you still treat him as your father.

441
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,200
But even until the moment he died,

442
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,600
he never admitted that you were his son.

443
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,000
He thought that... he had to kill you for the benefit of the country. He didn't regret it.

444
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,600
Let me repeat myself again.

445
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,800
I've already told you to spare his life.

446
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I still have use for him.

447
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,500
But you disobeyed my orders.

448
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,100
At first, I didn't plan to kill him so early.

449
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,400
But because you didn't keep Rong Le in line,

450
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
she had ruined my plan.

451
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,600
I don't have a choice.

452
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,000
But this is good too.

453
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,600
Now, he can ask for your mother's forgiveness in the underworld.

454
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,400
Don't use Rong Le as an excuse.

455
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,800
Don't think that I'm blind.

456
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,600
You've always wanted to kill him.

457
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,000
That's why you'd forgotten that I was the one to decide if he lived or died.

458
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,200
Even if I wanted to kill him,

459
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,000
I should have been the one to do it.

460
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
As for when he was going to ask forgiveness from my mother,

461
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
it would have been entirely up to me.

462
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,600
Although you established the Creed of Vengeance,

463
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,400
all the troops in this country are under my control.

464
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,800
Let me warn you.

465
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,600
If you go head to head against me again,

466
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,400
I'll have to take you out.

467
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,199
Your Highness, about the food issue after they'd gone into war,

468
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:46,600
after days of discussion between the Ministry of Revenue and Prince Chen,

469
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,300
they have attached a proposal together with the report.

470
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,700
Have you read about it?

471
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
Your Highness. Your Highness.

472
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,700
The Minister of Revenue is asking you about the report on the food issue.

473
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,300
Report.

474
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,600
What report?

475
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,200
Did the Crown Prince drink too much again?

476
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,400
You didn't even remember the latest report from yesterday.

477
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm very busy lately.

478
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,500
I didn't get to read it in time.

479
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,900
We'll discuss it again after I've read it.

480
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,700
Dismiss.

481
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,600
I don't feel well today.

482
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Report to me again tomorrow if there's anything.

483
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,300
Dismiss.

484
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
Emergency report!

485
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,300
Crown Prince, emergency report from the army base.

486
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,000
Make it quick.

487
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:57,890
[The emperor of Northern Lin is dead... Prince Li colluded...]

488
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,400
Crown Prince, what happened?

489
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,200
Prince Li ganged up with the generals in the army base to assassinate Father.

490
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Father is gone.

491
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
- What?
- What nonsense is that?

492
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,500
This...

493
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,000
Who faked this report from the army base?

494
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,700
- It's such nonsense.
- Whether it's fake or not,

495
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
Sir Yang will be able to tell it.

496
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,400
Sir Yang, take a look.

497
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,100
Your Highness, this is the real seal.

498
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,000
But there might be a misunderstanding about...

499
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Prince Li assassinating His Majesty.

500
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,600
Prince Li has always been a person like that.

501
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,400
All these years, he had always set himself against Father.

502
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,100
He never listened to Father...

503
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,400
and he disobeyed him every chance he had.

504
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,200
This time, he even disobeyed his decree in court.

505
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
He was banished to the southern border.

506
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,000
He is dissatisfied with it.

507
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
That's why he sent someone to assassinate father!

508
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,900
Such an abominable man!

509
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,200
Wuyou is not a person like that.

510
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,200
It must be you.

511
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,800
You've ganged up with Fu Chou in secret.

512
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,400
You took advantage when Father was not here to fake evidence...

513
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,900
in order to frame Wuyou to get rid of your competitor.

514
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,700
What are you doing?

515
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,400
There are more than one who saw Prince Li assassinating Father.

516
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,200
You want to destroy the evidence, right?

517
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
Go ahead, tear it!

518
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,700
I don't believe it.

519
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,200
Father is so brilliant. How could he fall under Fu Chou's trap?

520
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,600
Father must be well and alive still.

521
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,400
When he comes back to the capital,

522
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,000
I want to see how are you going... to keep your status as Crown Prince.

523
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,280
What did you say?

524
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600
- Say it again!
- So what if I say it again?

525
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Calm down.

526
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,000
Calm down, Crown Prince.

527
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,500
This news about His Majesty's death is too sudden for Prince Chen.

528
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,000
He is too upset.

529
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That's why he has uttered those words.

530
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,600
Your Highness, we are desolate,

531
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,500
petrified, and uncertain with His Majesty's death.

532
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,300
I think Crown Prince...

533
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,800
must have felt it more than we do.

534
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,400
If you are unsure about Prince Li's assassination,

535
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,200
no need to fight with Crown Prince.

536
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,600
You can just send someone to the army base to find out the truth.

537
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,100
No. We can't leave the war against Wei unfinished.

538
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,000
We have to keep this to ourselves.

539
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,200
- Wuyu!
- Your Highness, this...

540
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Prince Chen.

541
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,800
- Where is Captain Xiang?
- Captain Xiang?

542
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,400
Caption Xiang didn't come into the palace today.

543
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,000
Prince Chen!

544
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,600
[Xiang Residence]

545
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,500
Captain Xiang!

546
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Captain Xiang! Captain Xiang!

547
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,200
Captain Xiang!

548
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,800
- Prince Chen.
- Is Captain Xiang home?

549
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
Captain Xiang hasn't been back since yesterday night.

550
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,600
Our lady has sent someone to look for him, but no sign of him yet.

551
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,500
This is real bad.

552
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,100
Guards! Guards!

553
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,100
You, inform Wuyou that something really bad has happened in the capital.

554
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,400
- You, ready my horse for me.
- Yes, Prince Chen!

555
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,800
Prince Chen, what happened?

556
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
No time to say. Pack your things and leave at once.

557
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I'm going to leave the capital to investigate what happened in the army base.

558
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,500
I don't think you'll be able to go out.

559
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,200
When I came back just now, I saw that every city door is heavily guarded.

560
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,400
Now, they can only come in but nobody can go out.

561
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,200
What?

562
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,700
- Brother, you are back.
- Ke'er, good girl.

563
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,400
- Did you get the princess's medicine?
- I...

564
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,300
What are you doing?

565
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,800
Crown Prince's order. Prince Li's assassination case is still in progress.

566
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,200
So, everybody in his manor can't go out without permission.

567
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
Those who disobey will be decapitated on the spot.

568
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,400
Prince Chen, I'll have to trouble you to stay here for the moment.

569
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
Zhao Yisheng.

570
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,800
You are so bold.

571
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,100
Before he left, Father ordered me to help Crown Prince.

572
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,000
And I have total command over the Royal Guard.

573
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,800
As vice-captain of the Royal Guard,

574
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,600
not only do you disobey me, you even cage me in.

575
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,200
I wouldn't dare.

576
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,800
But I can't go against Crown Prince's order.

577
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,000
Although the Royal Guard is under your command,

578
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,200
captain of the Royal Guard, Xiang Cheng...

579
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,400
was found dead outside of the city yesterday night.

580
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,800
Somebody saw that...

581
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,200
he was last seen with you, Prince Chen.

582
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,900
Crown Prince has no choice but to keep you here.

583
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,200
He is protecting you.

584
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,700
Such nonsense!

585
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,600
If something had really happened to Captain Xiang,

586
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,000
you are the one behind it.

587
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
First, you faked a military report to frame Wuyou.

588
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,400
Now, you want to accuse me?

589
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm going to get out from here today.

590
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,700
Those who stand in my way...

591
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,100
will be killed without mercy!

592
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,400
Your Highness, don't be reckless.

593
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,100
You can't solve anything even if you kill them.

594
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,600
I've heard a little something about the military report.

595
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,800
I don't believe that Prince Li would assassinate His Majesty as well.

596
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,600
But the whole capital is under Crown Prince's control now.

597
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,000
Even if we break free from Prince Li's manor, we can't leave the capital.

598
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,600
What should we do then?

599
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,800
Are we going to resign ourselves?

600
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,900
They say that the troops are on their way back.

601
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,800
I believe that Prince Li will hear about it soon and come back at once.

602
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,400
Rather than going head to head with Crown Prince,

603
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,000
how about you control yourself so that you can be of use to Prince Li.

604
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,600
Then both of you can work together from the inside out.

605
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,100
Listen to my brother.

606
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,800
There are so many people here.

607
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,900
You can't win and I can't save you.

608
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
I don't care if you want to stop others.

609
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,600
But after my medicine is done, someone has to send it to her.

610
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,000
Who do you mean?

611
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,100
Of course, it's Princess Rong Le from the General's Manor.

612
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,800
Princess Rong Le is ill.

613
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,100
Miss Xiao was hired to create new medicine for her in a quiet place.

614
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,000
They are about done. If we can't send it out,

615
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
can you bear the responsibility for it if her treatment is affected?

616
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,000
Since it's medicine for General Fu's wife,

617
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,900
of course I won't stop you.

618
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,700
When they are here to take the medicine, I'll let you go.

619
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,500
No need to be so mad, Prince Chen.

620
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm just doing it for show.

621
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,800
As long as you don't send a message to Prince Li,

622
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,600
I won't disturb the people in this manor.

623
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm just going to post my men on the outside.

624
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,200
You can do as you please in the manor.

625
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,000
When Prince Li is here, we'll leave immediately.

626
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,800
Get lost!

627
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,700
Guard all the exits! Retreat!

628
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,500
He said that he's doing Crown Prince's bidding.

629
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,000
But he's just following Fu Chou's order.

630
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,400
I didn't get to see His Majesty when I went back to Western Qi.

631
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,200
I didn't get the medicine either.

632
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,500
On my way back, I heard that Princess Rong Le had gone missing.

633
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,000
So, I searched for her...

634
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and I found out that someone brought her back to the General's Manor.

635
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,400
I'm very worried about her condition right now.

636
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,200
I need to go to the General's Manor.

637
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,000
What's wrong with Man Yao?

638
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,700
It's a long story.

639
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,000
Prince Chen, I'll entrust my sister and Ling Yue's safety to you.

640
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,800
Don't worry. As long as I'm here, nobody will dare touch them.

641
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,300
But Man Yao is ill.

642
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,600
Don't tell her about what happened today in case she worries about it.

643
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,200
I know. Farewell.

644
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,240
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

645
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,600
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

646
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:52,200
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

647
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,600
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

648
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,800
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:10,200
♫ You are keeping me out with your care
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

650
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,800
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

651
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,400
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

652
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:28,400
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

653
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,400
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

654
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,600
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

655
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:46,400
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

656
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:52,400
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

657
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,000
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

658
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:06,000
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

659
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

660
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,200
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

661
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:27,400
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
