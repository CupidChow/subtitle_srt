00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,965
[Episode 33]

2
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,140
You are still going to launch a mutiny?

3
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,479
What's done is done.

4
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,161
Yet, I am still asking this foolish question.

5
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,785
How silly can I be?

6
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:31,559
I don't even know if your resolve is real...

7
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,360
or simply a lie.

8
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,645
Truth or lie,

9
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:39,356
you never cared.

10
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:41,690
All you will ever do when you start to suspect me...

11
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:44,131
is to tell Zongzheng Wuyou about everything.

12
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:48,499
Or you would risk your own life and report to the main camp.

13
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:53,992
Do you really think... everything I do is wrong?

14
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:57,489
Have you ever thought about... why I made those decisions?

15
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,226
I know it all.

16
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,815
You are the son of Empress Fu Yuan.

17
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:09,281
A man disguised as you and had conversations with His Majesty.

18
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,330
I know that too.

19
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:21,949
Did you hear that the so-called emperor that is my father...

20
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:24,327
has never seen me as his son?

21
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:27,985
Whether you believe it or not, he is still your father.

22
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:30,819
This is a fact that can never be changed.

23
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,252
Fu Chou, stop your plan.

24
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:37,623
Do not let your hands be stained with the blood of your kin.

25
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,579
Kin?

26
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,872
What about your brother Rong Qi?

27
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:47,881
Do you see him as your kin?

28
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,009
He used you...

29
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,933
and that brought you great pain.

30
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,937
The so-called emperor that is my father...

31
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:57,739
hunted me down for five whole years.

32
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,872
The warmth of a family was turned into a cold blade that slaughters.

33
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,900
You want me to stop?

34
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,017
Do you even know how desperate I was back then?

35
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,183
I simply feel like...

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,440
there is no need to have the innocent killed.

37
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,566
You asked me if I see my brother as a family.

38
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,015
Yes.

39
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,661
He used me for his bidding and hurt the people I love.

40
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,944
But I cannot use others' lives to have my revenge.

41
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:34,361
It would make me the same villain as he.

42
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,480
The soldiers should be the nation's strongest defense.

43
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,518
But your revenge will make the river flow with blood.

44
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,639
How can you be at peace with that?

45
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,012
And in the end,

46
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:49,919
you will be killing your own father and brothers.

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,630
Even if you won,

48
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:54,640
what can you possibly get from that empty and cold throne?

49
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,714
Whatever I get in the end...

50
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,574
is still better than having nothing at all.

51
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:01,707
He is not my brother.

52
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,543
The emperor is not my father!

53
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,953
I had nothing to begin with.

54
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,676
What could possibly be worse for me?

55
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,449
Your Majesty. Wuyou.

56
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,706
Wuyou, come down here. You can't be so rude.

57
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,366
- Mother.
- Wuyou, come.

58
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:25,816
Look at yourself, you are sweating so hard.

59
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,719
- Your Majesty.
- Father.

60
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,900
Wuyou is such a nice kid. Isn't that right?

61
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,271
Wuyou, go on and play with your mother.

62
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:49,872
Okay.

63
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,582
You should have some rest.

64
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,281
Who is it?

65
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,621
Xiao Sha?

66
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,440
Father!

67
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,620
Father!

68
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,210
[Emperor Sejong Gwangmu of the Zongzheng Clan]

69
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,800
Father!

70
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,239
I have failed you!

71
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,340
I have failed you! Father!

72
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,607
If I were at your side,

73
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:54,935
you wouldn't have been killed by those scoundrels, Father!

74
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,620
[Emperor Sejong Gwangmu of the Zongzheng Clan]

75
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,031
Crown Prince.

76
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,991
May you mourn in peace.

77
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,060
Crown Prince, please mourn in peace.

78
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,350
Here.

79
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,256
His Majesty has passed away.

80
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:54,228
This is the loss of our nation.

81
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,079
But the campaign must go on as planned.

82
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,292
Now, we must deal with traitors and enemies.

83
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:05,402
I suggest... we leave the coffin at the side hall and keep it a secret.

84
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,119
Relocate a few troops to create a distraction at the border.

85
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,482
After the rebels are dealt with,

86
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,140
we will hold a state funeral for His Majesty.

87
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,330
Sure.

88
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,068
We'll proceed with your plan.

89
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,250
Father!

90
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,100
Leng Yan, with our marching speed,

91
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,826
when will we arrive in Zhongshan?

92
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:07,968
Your Highness, there are three days of journey ahead.

93
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,853
Take him down!

94
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,419
I was ordered by Princess Rong Le to send this to Prince Li.

95
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,100
It seems like the whole of Zhongshan is now under Fu Chou's control.

96
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,100
Even the Royal Army is doing his bidding.

97
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,400
With Fu Chou's mind,

98
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,800
he won't let someone else take command.

99
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,500
If my guess is right,

100
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,000
Fu Chou never followed my father on the campaign.

101
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
He has been hiding in the capital...

102
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,300
deploying his soldiers.

103
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,200
The campaign was led by His Majesty.

104
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,700
How did he pull this off?

105
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
When Zhao Yun was attacked at the inn,

106
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,200
he ordered someone to disguise as Man Yao.

107
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,500
He is using the same trick again.

108
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
He had an imposter go on the march in his place.

109
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
His Majesty would never expect Fu Chou...

110
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
to use such a lowly and cunning means.

111
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,800
Your Highness, if General Fu is so treacherous,

112
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,200
and this man is his personal bodyguard,

113
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,100
we cannot trust him even with the Inked-Jade Fan.

114
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,500
- This might be his plan all along.
- You...

115
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,500
If you don't trust me,

116
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,200
give me back the tactical map.

117
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Man Yao would give up her own life...

118
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,400
before this plan...

119
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,000
and the Inked-Jade Fan were taken by someone else.

120
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
I believe in her.

121
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,400
So, I trust you.

122
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,800
Send out the order.

123
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,000
We will travel day and night to Zhongshan.

124
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
Leng Yan, you will lead a troop of elites...

125
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,000
and go to our main force.

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Make sure His Majesty is safe.

127
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,700
- Also...
- I understand.

128
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,900
Your Highness can count on me.

129
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,500
Can you still walk?

130
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
I am fine.

131
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,700
I hope all will go well for Lady Rong Le.

132
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,300
Man Yao, have you met with my father?

133
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,800
As of now, are you safe?

134
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,200
- Your Highness.
- At ease.

135
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you, Prince Li.

136
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,800
If Man Yao is willing to give you the fan,

137
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,400
it means she places her trust in you.

138
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Lady Rong Le saved my life.

139
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,600
My life... is hers to command.

140
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,800
Fu Chou knows you betrayed him.

141
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,200
That's why he hunted you down.

142
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,700
He only knows I betrayed the Creed.

143
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,600
But he doesn't know about the letter I sent you.

144
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
The Creed is tracking Lady Rong Le.

145
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,400
It was an accident that they found me.

146
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
So, Fu Chou knew it all along...

147
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
that Man Yao found out about his plan.

148
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,000
If Man Yao is still at the main camp,

149
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,200
and if she didn't get to inform my father...

150
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,700
and was found by Fu Chou's men,

151
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,800
it will not...

152
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

153
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,000
Did something happen at the main camp?

154
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
Your Highness.

155
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
I investigated and ask around the camp.

156
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,600
His Majesty was assassinated in the main camp.

157
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
His Majesty passed away.

158
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,200
My condolences, Your Highness.

159
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,400
Our condolences, Your Highness.

160
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
Who was the killer?

161
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,800
After Fu Chou transported the body back to the capital,

162
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,200
he framed Your Highness in front of the officers,

163
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,600
claiming that you were planning to seize the throne,

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,000
which is why you went to the camp and killed His Majesty.

165
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Fu Chou.

166
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,000
The Imperial Court is under his control.

167
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Crown Prince has ordered us not to say a word about His Majesty.

168
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Once you enter the city, they have an order to kill you on sight.

169
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,700
Prince Chen is under house arrest, too.

170
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,000
Your Highness, you must turn the tide at the capital

171
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,300
and take down the villains.

172
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Take down the villains!

173
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,000
Your Highness, I found this...

174
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,400
at the location where the main camp was.

175
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,800
It looks like His Majesty's handwriting.

176
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,600
Yun, I am advancing with the army.

177
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,000
I can feel that ambition is beyond my reach.

178
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
I can't fall asleep.

179
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,400
Sometimes, I wish to forget all of it and join you.

180
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,100
But Wuyou is still young.

181
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,000
I wish to hold on for him for a couple of years.

182
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
As you know, once a man sits on the throne,

183
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,800
he will lose all that was once dear to him.

184
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,800
When the time comes, choices will be a luxury.

185
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,300
Yun, while I was on the march with the army,

186
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,600
I kept thinking about the time when Wuyou was a kid.

187
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,400
Back then, he wanted to learn how to ride a horse.

188
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,500
But I was so afraid he would fall from it.

189
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,800
So, I let him ride on my back.

190
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,400
Back in the days, I let him ride on me.

191
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,500
But I am too old now.

192
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,900
I even have to pass the duty onto his shoulder.

193
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Father.

194
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,600
You promised me you would bring peace to the world for me.

195
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,600
Why are you leaving me behind?

196
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,300
Father,

197
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,000
have you met my mother?

198
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,800
I know she never blamed you.

199
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,000
Honestly, I understand how hard it was for you.

200
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,300
But I never got the chance to tell you myself.

201
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,200
Father,

202
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,800
I will shoulder the duty for this nation in your place.

203
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,000
I won't let Fu Chou get away with his treachery.

204
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,600
I will bring justice to you.

205
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,000
You shall not die in vain.

206
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,500
[Dear Wuyou]

207
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,200
Wuyou,

208
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,600
Zhongshan will be in a mess soon.

209
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
In order to keep the innocents safe,

210
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,000
you must return here at once.

211
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,600
But I fear for your return.

212
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
I don't want you to get hurt...

213
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,800
and I wish to keep you away from the fighting.

214
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,300
What else can I do for you now?

215
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,400
Princess Rong Le, Ke'er gave you two pieces of advice before she left.

216
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,200
You must not catch a cold or burden yourself with thoughts.

217
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,100
And now you are facing the breeze and bothered by worries.

218
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,000
You are doing everything that goes against her advice.

219
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,500
You are just as disobedient as Ke'er when she was younger.

220
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,200
You never talked much before.

221
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,000
When did you learn to nag like Ling Yue?

222
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,700
Princess, the medicine is ready.

223
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,600
Have it while it's warm.

224
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,400
- You may go now.
- Yes.

225
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,200
I have some important tasks for you.

226
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,500
Yes, Princess.

227
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,400
After you leave to get the medicine for me,

228
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
do not come back again.

229
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,800
Your Highness, I fear that General Fu might try to harm you.

230
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,500
I should stay here and keep you safe.

231
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,400
The whole manor is being watched.

232
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Even the Tranquil Garden is being monitored.

233
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,700
Once Fu Chou makes a move, you are no match for him.

234
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,600
You might even lose your life.

235
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,300
- But under no circumstances...
- This is important.

236
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,600
There are more pressing matters than protecting me.

237
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,600
If Wuyou received the news,

238
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
he will be on his way back.

239
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,700
As soon as he enters the city,

240
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,800
you must give him this letter yourself.

241
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,600
Fear not, I will keep watch at the city gate.

242
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,680
There is another task. I want you to stay alive.

243
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,727
Look after Ling Yue for me.

244
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:41,427
For the rest of your life, never leave her again.

245
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:46,926
Princess Rong Le, both Ling Yue and I will follow you to our last breath.

246
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,860
While she is with me, she is constantly in fear.

247
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,940
She never had any easy time for herself.

248
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,291
She thought while she was here with me that this would be her home.

249
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:09,108
But now, this is nothing but a prison.

250
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:16,939
I am glad she escaped. I hope she never sets foot into this house again.

251
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,739
Soon, I will die. I might be dead at any moment.

252
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,924
It's my fault for not finding His Majesty and getting you the antidote.

253
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:35,636
But I believe in the next three months, Ke'er will find a cure for you.

254
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:39,804
I keep feeling dizzy as of late.

255
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:43,190
I know the poison is invading my body.

256
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,087
As of now, having three months seems like a luxury.

257
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:55,454
Do not make it hard for Ke'er. This is my destiny.

258
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:09,821
That was a lie.

259
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:15,220
You want to leave this place. That's why you lied to me. Isn't it?

260
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,730
- You should go.
- You can either tell me the truth...

261
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,430
or none of you will leave this house.

262
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:28,433
It's true.

263
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:33,152
I was poisoned. I am dying.

264
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,105
You are in my house! Who would dare to poison you?

265
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:47,943
If my guess is right, the emperor you mentioned was her brother.

266
00:24:47,943 --> 00:24:50,450
Only he would dare to hurt Rong Le.

267
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,540
You take the medicine from him every month.

268
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,290
You must have the antidote.

269
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,734
Tell me. Where is the antidote? You must have the antidote.

270
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:10,940
Fu Chou, stop.

271
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,700
You can fool Rong Le, but not me. You are the spy planted by the Emperor of Qi.

272
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,500
He won't let Rong Le die so easily. He is in another land, so you must have the antidote.

273
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:24,830
You can either hand it over or I will slice you into pieces!

274
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
Rong Le!

275
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:45,248
Don't kill him!

276
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,210
Princess, don't beg him because of me.

277
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:55,089
Hand over the antidote and I will spare your life.

278
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,440
I don't have it even if you were to kill me.

279
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,860
Xiao Sha was working for my brother because he had no other choice.

280
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,460
He lost my brother's trust. He doesn't have the antidote.

281
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,359
He wouldn't have fought back unless you struck him first.

282
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,388
Please, let him go.

283
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:12,874
General Fu!

284
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,564
Seize this man!

285
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,759
Let him go.

286
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,479
Lay down your weapons.

287
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,460
Leave now. I can take care of myself.

288
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,690
- But...
- Leave!

289
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,542
General, you are hurt. The wound needs to be treated.

290
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,259
I am fine.

291
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:03,959
You are dismissed.

292
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,796
General.

293
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,895
Yes.

294
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,570
Dismissed.

295
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:25,545
I assure you. Whatever reason your brother has to poison you,

296
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:29,260
I will get to him and get you the antidote.

297
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:33,010
There would have been a chance if we had gotten it earlier,

298
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,030
- but it's too late now.
- I don't believe it.

299
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,861
If I can't get the cure from the E=emperor, I will go to Prince Li.

300
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:46,531
I'll bring Ke'er back here to brew a cure for you.

301
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,840
If that doesn't work either, I will send out all the soldiers I have...

302
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,183
to search for a healer.

303
00:27:59,107 --> 00:28:02,800
Ke'er only told the truth about my condition to me alone.

304
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,940
The poison is invading my organs.

305
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,001
The best option I have is to extend my life with other medicines.

306
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:12,323
Completely removing the poison is impossible.

307
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:16,160
Finding a cure is pointless for me.

308
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,526
Which is why I didn't tell you.

309
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:22,479
I don't want you to waste time on false hope.

310
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,977
I...

311
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:30,116
I will never let you die.

312
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:33,638
You told me...

313
00:28:33,638 --> 00:28:38,776
you will never forgive me for using you and lying to you.

314
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:40,899
You hate me for locking you up in here. So live on.

315
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,320
So live on. Stay well and live this life.

316
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,340
You can have revenge on me.

317
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:51,211
I can spend my whole life for you.

318
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:57,342
The time I have left is getting short by the second.

319
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,456
I don't have time for grudges.

320
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:11,638
We became husband and wife.

321
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:16,838
Whether it was for a year or just months, our fate intertwined in the past lifetime.

322
00:29:17,564 --> 00:29:21,616
But ever since the incident at Lake Qingliang,

323
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:24,496
all I have for you is hate.

324
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,900
But now that my life is running out,

325
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,989
I have one last piece of advice for you.

326
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,854
- Will you...
- I will.

327
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,384
Whatever you ask of me today,

328
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,672
I will agree.

329
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:44,396
Do you mean it?

330
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:48,880
Will you give up on your hate for me and put an end to your revenge?

331
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,282
Yes.

332
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,780
As long as you agree to my term,

333
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,980
I will give up all I have for you.

334
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,523
What is it?

335
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:04,725
Leave this place with me.

336
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,725
Let me have your love.

337
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,925
Let me take care of you for the rest of your life.

338
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,970
I hope you will give me the answer after you thought it through.

339
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,833
Days of summer, nights of winter.

340
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:02,810
Years from now, I will become a breeze and follow you to the next life.

341
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,089
Ash to ash.

342
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:09,378
Together, we will leave this world.

343
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:32,787
Rong Le.

344
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,521
You agreed?

345
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:39,056
I can agree to anything.

346
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,908
I regret it.

347
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,540
I really do regret it.

348
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,786
If we can turn back time...

349
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:58,129
If we can turn back time, when I first saw you,

350
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:03,040
I would have left all grudges behind and left with you.

351
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,438
We can live in hiding. Perhaps we can live in the woods.

352
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:11,204
We can be a normal couple.

353
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:17,296
A bridge over that little brook. A land of serenity.

354
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,029
Every morning,

355
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:31,440
when I see the sunlight shine on your face,

356
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,106
I can't bear to wake you up.

357
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:36,412
I will stare at you quietly.

358
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:39,708
And then, you wake up.

359
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:46,338
I don't have to do anything. I will just watch you.

360
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,960
In a time of peace and free from worries, I am willing to spend my life with you.

361
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:02,170
Perhaps we would be fighting over trivial matters such as our meals.

362
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,559
Rong Le, will you believe me?

363
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,633
If I weren't a general, I would be a great farmer.

364
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:19,020
If you weren't a princess, aside from making dumplings,

365
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,753
what other food can you make?

366
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:25,279
But speaking of which,

367
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:30,241
I love the dumplings you make.

368
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,890
At every sunset,

369
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,140
we will be holding hands.

370
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:41,300
Under the glow of starlight, we have each other.

371
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,857
Time may pass, but we never left each other.

372
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,512
Seasons after seasons, year after year.

373
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,132
After all those years, I will have a face full of wrinkles...

374
00:33:57,132 --> 00:33:59,700
and you will have long grey hair.

375
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,162
We would tell our tales to the children.

376
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:07,479
Those little brats will think of our life as something plain and boring.

377
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:11,578
But the simple life and peace we have...

378
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,585
came with a great cost.

379
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:21,534
In my heart, this life is more precious than anything.

380
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,500
As I spent my youth,

381
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,100
we would grow old together.

382
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,600
When we become old,

383
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,900
I will no longer be able to see your face...

384
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,300
and you can't listen to how I say "I love you."

385
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,600
But I think the best form of love

386
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
is to be together till the end of time.

387
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,300
Rong Le.

388
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
You have nothing to fear.

389
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,600
I can't be with you in this life.

390
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,400
But I have decided...

391
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
to accompany you to the afterlife.

392
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,800
Time is running out for both of us.

393
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,400
But I assure you,

394
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,600
in our next life, I will find you.

395
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,200
By that time, you will have lost all the memories of this lifetime.

396
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,000
The two of us can start over again.

397
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,200
I will wait for you.

398
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,700
Even if you can't find me,

399
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,800
I'll be right there waiting for you.

400
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,600
♫ How do we keep living this life? ♫

401
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,200
♫ Finally, I've learned how to trust ♫

402
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,400
♫ But I've underestimated love and hate ♫

403
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,000
♫ We've thrown away fate that we'd received by chance ♫

404
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,800
♫ I have to admit to my mistakes ♫

405
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,600
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

406
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,000
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

407
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,200
♫ I asked for too much, I hesitated for too long ♫

408
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,600
♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

409
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,000
♫ You are behind me ♫

410
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,200
♫ Mocking the promise that I made for you ♫

411
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,600
♫ I must give all I have ♫

412
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,000
♫ To accept the lies of affection ♫

413
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,400
♫ It never ends, love will fade ♫

414
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,600
♫ The blossoms fall, and I wait in silence ♫

415
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,000
♫ I cling to the past despite the pains ♫

416
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,300
♫ I won't let our love be a regret ♫

417
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,800
♫ Living without sorrow, dying without any hate ♫

418
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,000
♫ This is the leniency that you've shown to me ♫

419
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,400
♫ We are not holding hands, but you are holding my heart ♫

420
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,000
♫ Although this might not be forever ♫

421
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,400
♫ I've locked you in my heart and I've locked you in my dreams ♫

422
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:42,000
♫ Blaming myself for falling in love with you ♫

423
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,400
General Fu.

424
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,800
Speak.

425
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,200
- General, Lady Rong Le is...
- I know about Lady Rong Le.

426
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,400
There is no need for a report.

427
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,000
- Very well, I shall let her...
- It's all right.

428
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,600
Dismissed.

429
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,700
Yes.

430
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,000
Rong Le, will you really leave with me?

431
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,800
I do hold a place in your heart.

432
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,600
Chou.

433
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,000
What did you call me?

434
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,800
Please.

435
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,700
General.

436
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,200
I have made my decision. I will...

437
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,000
I am sorry for interrupting.

438
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,400
Rong Le!

439
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,000
Rong Le!

440
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
Rong Le!

441
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,500
- My answer is...
- I hope you can just hear me out.

442
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,000
What you saw in there is not the truth.

443
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
I was drunk last night. I thought she was you.

444
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
No explanation needed.

445
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,800
You did nothing wrong.

446
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,000
It was me that failed as a wife.

447
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,600
- I really mistook her for you!
- I don't want to lie to you.

448
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,400
Which is why I am telling you my decision.

449
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,200
I can surrender my life,

450
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,900
I can follow you to anywhere you go.

451
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,600
But my heart... belongs to Wuyou.

452
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,400
You are lying.

453
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,800
You misunderstood me because of this.

454
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,400
- That is why you turned me down.
- I didn't misunderstand you.

455
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,800
It was you that misunderstood.

456
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,000
My answer is the same all along.

457
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,300
I was such a fool.

458
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,900
I should have known.

459
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,200
You would never care about me.

460
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,400
You never care about what I do, unless...

461
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,200
my action will bring Zongzheng Wuyou harm.

462
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,600
You only agreed with me,

463
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,500
reconsidered my offer, and came to this yard...

464
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,800
all because of him!

465
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I so naively thought

466
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,700
everything you did was for me.

467
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,000
Do you even remember...

468
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,600
the only time when you have addressed me as your husband?

469
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,600
That day, Zongzheng Wuyou took you by force.

470
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,200
To keep your illness a secret from him,

471
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,000
you used me to turn him down.

472
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,100
You rushed in front of me.

473
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,600
With me as your husband, you shielded me.

474
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,600
After all that you did, I know well enough that...

475
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,600
your only motive is to keep him from having...

476
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,300
the slightest pain in his heart.

477
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,000
Tell me.

478
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,100
How could I not hate him?

479
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,400
If you must hate,

480
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,900
then hate this fate we have.

481
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,500
We can be husband and wife,

482
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,400
but we can never be lovers.

483
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,200
This is not about anyone.

484
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,300
Even without Wuyou,

485
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,000
the outcome will still be the same.

486
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,600
Then I must fight for my fate!

487
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,400
The person who will be with you to the end...

488
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,900
and die by your side...

489
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,100
is none other than me.

490
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,100
For this lifetime, this is where my fate with you ends.

491
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,490
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

492
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:24,000
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

493
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,600
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

494
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,200
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

495
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,400
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

496
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:50,600
♫ You are keeping me out with your care
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

497
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,200
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

498
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,800
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

499
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:08,800
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

500
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,800
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

501
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,000
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

502
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,800
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

503
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,000
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

504
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,500
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

505
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:46,600
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

506
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,600
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

507
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,500
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

508
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:08,600
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
