[Episode 51]

2
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,000
Gunpowder.

3
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,960
- Chase after him.
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,680
[Qingtian Chamber]

5
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,405
Princess, this is the hangover soup sent here by Prince Zhenbei's consort.

6
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,961
Here.

7
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,160
Drink it.

8
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,620
Ling Yue, the incense burner's smell over there is making me ill. Take it away.

9
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,100
Princess. Princess, are you all right?

10
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,277
Ling Yue, why do I feel like...

11
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:07,007
I'm a little bit unwell?

12
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,785
Are you all right, Princess?

13
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:10,545
Princess.

14
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:19,116
Princess. Princess!

15
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,660
Leave her to me.

16
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,989
You don't have to worry about what will happen next.

17
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,210
I have an order from my master.

18
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,248
I have to send her to Qingtian Chamber.

19
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,151
Your master is cooperating with our prince.

20
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:53,360
We had agreed to follow our prince's orders.

21
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,140
You don't trust our prince?

22
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,120
How could I ever doubt Prince Zhenbei?

23
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,778
But this is my master's order.

24
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:01,738
I can't disobey him.

25
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,960
Help her up then.

26
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,739
Your master asked for one result only.

27
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,139
As for how to get that result,

28
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,577
our prince is the one who will make that call.

29
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,203
Xiao Sha, I was so scared.

30
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,980
I thought I was going to die.

31
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,765
Luckily you are in Prince Zhenbei's manor.

32
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,780
You know everything already?

33
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,440
You didn't even drink the hangover soup.

34
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,160
No.

35
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,980
You aren't even drunk.

36
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,340
You just pretended to be drunk.

37
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,840
Qianyi had given me the same kind of wine before.

38
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,580
I know that I won't get drunk no matter how much I drink it.

39
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,080
When did you start to guard against me?

40
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,464
You approached Sun Yali,

41
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:07,419
provoked her,

42
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,136
and intensified the conflict between us.

43
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,879
You secretly let an outside man to come into my manor.

44
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,899
You killed Chun Ni...

45
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:18,580
so that the man could disguise as her to come into my room.

46
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,898
And then you accused me of having a lover.

47
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:24,287
You hid fake evidence under my bed...

48
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:27,268
and pretended to defend me in the great hall.

49
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:32,148
But actually, you put the blame for Sun Yali's death on me in public.

50
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,469
Let go!

51
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,732
You thought that...

52
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:49,773
you had done these things flawlessly.

53
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,466
You thought that I suspected nothing.

54
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:55,057
Earlier on,

55
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:58,560
in order to cover for yourself, you framed Lian Xin.

56
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,760
And you repeatedly advised Princess Rong Le to submit to Fu Chou.

57
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,700
Unfortunately, we didn't get to see through your façade earlier.

58
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,200
Who is the master that you were talking about just now?

59
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,182
What plan does he have by ganging up with Ning Qianyi?

60
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,403
Tell me.

61
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:29,357
Because of her,

62
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,632
you lied to me.

63
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,000
And now, you want to kill me.

64
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,520
I already gave you a chance.

65
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,180
I told you that... we are in debt with Princess Rong Le

66
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,318
and none of us should betray her.

67
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:49,613
I've never been loyal to her. So, how can there be a betrayal?

68
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:54,939
Xiao Sha, actually, we are the same.

69
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,579
We were sent to her side by others to spy on her.

70
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,929
Why do we need to be loyal to her?

71
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:04,010
I'm different from you.

72
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,900
Back then, she was forced to marry Fu Chou in order to protect you.

73
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,659
She still tried to find a way out for you even when her life was in danger.

74
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,515
Even if you don't treat her as your mistress,

75
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:20,651
you should be grateful for the kindness that she had shown you.

76
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,413
Since young, the person who had trained me told me that...

77
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:27,072
love is the best weapon.

78
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:29,259
Do you think she is any different from me?

79
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,579
But Zongzheng Wuyou and Fu Chou had her fooled all around.

80
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,240
So, she has lost her own weapon.

81
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,251
You don't have feelings.

82
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:43,858
You don't know the value of a relationship between two people.

83
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,724
When the time comes, use this to knock her out...

84
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:56,363
and bring her to Qingtian Chamber.

85
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,420
After this is done, can you let Xiao Sha off?

86
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,173
Are you trying to bargain with me?

87
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,280
Don't forget about your other identity,

88
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,620
Qing Hu.

89
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,140
What evil plot does the one behind you and Ning Qianyi have?

90
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,826
What are you trying to do by bringing me to Qingtian Chamber?

91
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,318
I won't tell you. Don't waste your energy.

92
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:43,189
You think that I won't kill you?

93
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,760
Xiao Sha, I know that it would kill you to have to kill me, right?

94
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,219
You said that you liked me.

95
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,820
You wanted me to become your wife.

96
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,009
Let's knock her out... and bring her to Qingtian Chamber.

97
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,130
Help me complete my mission.

98
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,140
And then I'll marry you.

99
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,420
That way, we can live happily every day...

100
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,640
and we don't need to serve under anybody anymore.

101
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
All right?

102
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,600
All right?

103
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,420
You put this at the entrance of the kitchen, right? Thank you.

104
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm giving it back to you now.

105
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,930
Your Highness, Princess Rong Le is gone.

106
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,009
- What happened?
- I waited outside,

107
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,819
but Princess Rong Le wasn't brought to me after a long while.

108
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,220
I sent someone to check on it...

109
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,139
and found out that Princess Rong Le's maidservant, Ling Yue...

110
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,099
and the person we sent were murdered.

111
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,649
But Princess Rong Le is nowhere to be found.

112
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,638
Who brought her away?

113
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,711
Is it Zongzheng Wuyou or is it Fu Chou?

114
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,140
Could it be...

115
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,419
Send someone to check on Zongzheng Wuyou and Fu Chou.

116
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,060
I'll pay Rong Qi a visit.

117
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,540
Yes, Your Highness.

118
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,700
Prince Zhenbei, please stop.

119
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,120
Prince Zhenbei, please stop.

120
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,780
Prince Zhenbei, please stop.

121
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,272
Where is the Emperor of Qi?

122
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:57,541
He is asleep already.

123
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,076
He is already asleep although it's so early?

124
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:03,400
But never mind. I've brought along my royal physician to read his pulse.

125
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,020
We just need to be quiet.

126
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,029
No, Prince Zhenbei, I don't think this is appropriate.

127
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,407
His Majesty is already asleep.

128
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:14,968
Little Xun, let him in.

129
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,819
I'm terribly sorry, Emperor of Qi. I've disturbed your sleep.

130
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:26,459
I heard that you were ill. I was very anxious about it.

131
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,619
If I didn't bring along my royal physician to treat you tonight,

132
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:33,508
I think I wouldn't be able to fall asleep tonight.

133
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,987
Prince Zhenbei, His Majesty's old illness attacks again.

134
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,820
He can't be exposed to wind.

135
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,824
How could that be?

136
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,524
You look so pale.

137
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:01,699
I can see that it's not a common illness.

138
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,234
Royal physician, come and read his pulse now.

139
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,830
Make sure that he is all right.

140
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,511
Yes, Your Highness.

141
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:10,959
Prince Zhenbei, thank you for your kindness.

142
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,819
This illness has been with me since young.

143
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:18,191
It's not anything serious. I just need to rest.

144
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:23,379
Although you say so, I can't stop worrying about it until your pulse is read.

145
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:29,079
If that's the case, I'll have to trouble you then.

146
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,283
Don't worry, Your Majesty. He is our best physician in Chen.

147
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:46,221
There is no illness that he can't treat.

148
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,409
How is it? His Majesty is fine, right?

149
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,379
I have read pulses for more than 10 years.

150
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,175
But I've never read such a complicated pulse before.

151
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,219
Forgive me for my incompetence.

152
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,548
I don't dare to simply give him any medicine.

153
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,230
You may leave now.

154
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,680
Yes, Your Highness.

155
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,089
Even the royal physician says that there's no need for medicine.

156
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,299
Looks like it's really not that serious.

157
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,957
If that's the case, I'll take my leave now.

158
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,880
Sorry for troubling you.

159
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,440
I won't be sending you off then.

160
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,290
Get me some tea.

161
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,430
- How is it?
- From his pulse, he might die soon.

162
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,836
This is the effect of medicinal overdose.

163
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:45,697
I'm afraid that he won't be living for long.

164

Princess Rong Le was impossibly drunk and had gone to Qingtian Chamber.

You've put Rong Le into a death trap again and again.

Aren't you afraid that you'll cross my baseline?

You know that... I'm just following orders.

186

You've already used Fu Chou to take away the throne.

this grudge... will never end.

When Zongzheng Wuyou and his brother are dead,

194
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,556
I'll announce Ning Qianyi's crimes... to the public.

195

Then, there'll only be a child emperor in Chen. He won't be a problem.

You've been smarter than others since young. Unlike Fu Chou.

Until now, he still doesn't know who his real biological mother is.

Tell me. If he knew that Lady Yun was his real mother...

Back then, you and Fu Yuan bribed the midwife...

you used a dead baby... to replace one of her children.

You made him into a weapon for your revenge.

You used him to usurp the throne.

was raised and tortured in the Cold Harem...

Back then, my mother... was too exhausted after giving birth.

277
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:55,259
Before she was unconscious, she saw with her own eyes that...

278
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:59,438
her twins... had dragon-shaped birthmarks on each of their forearms.

279
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:03,819
When she woke up, she realized that the dead baby beside her had no birthmark.

280
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:07,979
She believed in herself that... her other son was still alive.

281
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,493
So, Father had sent people to search the country for a child with...

282
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,419
a dragon-shaped birthmark but to no avail.

283
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,968
He strongly believed that Fu Yuan did it.

284
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:30,379
Thus, he locked her in Senyan Palace... to grill her for answers.

this birthmark from me?

290
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:59,177

Can you really believe that the hatred you lived on all your life is fake?

293
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:17,828
Think about... that five years where you had run for your life.

No need to look at me like that.

323
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,880
I don't have that kind of relationship that you think with His Highness.

324
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,146
Then what kind of relationship do you have?

325
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,335
Why can you go in and out from his study room as you please?

326
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:23,281
And what is the purpose of this secret room?

327
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,901
You ask me so many questions at once.

328
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:29,539
How am I going to answer you?

329
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:32,500
Then first, tell me why you are here in Chen.

330
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,873
I have always been a citizen of Chen.

331
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,540
During the civil strife in Chen back then,

332
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,436
my father was not willing to bow down to those in power.

333
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:43,379
So, he was killed.

334
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,412
And my mother escaped with me.

335
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:50,224
We ran into a war... and in order to protect me,

336
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:52,610
she was stabbed to death.

337
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:54,540
And then?

338
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,842
And then, I met His Highness.

339
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:59,142
He saved me.

340
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:02,301
And he sent me to Northern Lin for a mission.

341
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:04,140
What mission?

342
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,720
Have you heard about "The Book of Mountains and Rivers"?

343
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:13,261
His Highness asked me to kidnap Rong Le...

344
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,946
and force Prince Li to give me the book.

345
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,360
Impossible.

346
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,653
If I tell you that... not only did he ask me to kidnap Rong Le,

347
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:27,536
he even ganged up with the Creed of Vengeance to kill Rong Le...

348
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:30,649
in order to cause a fall out between Fu Chou and Prince Li,

349
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,604
will you believe me?

350
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:36,480
The one you saw in the study room is the leader of the Creed of Vengeance.

351
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,310
That day, I was in the secret room.

352
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,928
And I heard every word in their conversation.

353
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:44,059
They have an alliance letter between them and it's in the secret room.

354
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:46,259
But I couldn't find it when I went in just now.

355
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:49,664
They are going to act tonight.

356
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,527
Qianyi is not a person like that.

357
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:59,966
It's impossible that he would hurt Brother Wuyou and Princess Rong Le.

358
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,342
I don't want to believe it either.

359
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:05,790
But he has changed. Do you know?

360
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,179
Before I came here, he had already sent his Elite Guard...

361
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:10,880
to surround the whole of Qianlin Garden.

362
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:13,939
If you want to save your Brother Wuyou,

363
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:16,280
there's only one way to do it.

364
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,609
Find the alliance letter.

365
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,480
Rong Le.

366
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,560
I wonder how it is in Qianlin Garden now.

367
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,820
Look, Chen Yu.

368
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,880
What a show.

369
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,143
I had already seen Prince Li and Prince Regent in battle before...

370
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,020
and they had blown my mind.

371
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,164
I never thought that all of you here would beso impressive as well.

372
00:39:18,164 --> 00:39:20,945
But now, all of you should be exhausted already.

373
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:23,586
So, a word of advice. Please just surrender to me.

374
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:26,678
Don't trouble me further.

375
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:30,319
Finally, you've shown your true colors.

376
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:32,739
I've never tried to hide anything from you.

377
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,702
You are the one who ignored my advice...

378
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:37,521
and fought at the side garden in the royal mansion of Chen.

379
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,660
You even destroyed my Qingtian Chamber.

380
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,518
If I don't take you down, how am I going to explain to the others?

381
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:45,840
No need to give such highfalutin excuses here.

382
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,679
You ... plotted all of these with Lin Shen.

383
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,539
Lin Shen asked Ling Yue to lure me to Chen.

384
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,373
Then, he disguised as the Seven Asuras to chase after me.

385
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:58,420
You brought me to Chen in the pretence of saving me...

386
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,780
in order to rope in Wuyou and Fu Chou.

387
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,500
You pretended to be a mediator... but actually,

388
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,938
you want them to turn against each other.

389
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:09,140
You let me and Fu Chou watch while Man Yao was bombed to pieces.

390
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,060
You made us think that the other party had done that...

391
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,820
so that you could achieve your goal by making us destroy each other.

392
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,164
Too bad you don't know that I already had my guard up against Ling Yue.

393
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:21,835
I didn't drink the hangover soup that she gave me.

394
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:25,059
After that, I heard her conversation with your subordinate.

395
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,139
I was taken away secretly by my brother.

396
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:30,771
Then, I found out that they were twins and I came to stop them.

397
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:32,659
Now that you've been exposed,

398
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,580
you want to kill every one of us.

399
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,920
Looks like I've guessed correctly.

400
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,719
Tonight, Rong Le... was indeed in Emperor of Qi's chamber.

401
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:44,940
Even I had been thrown into your plot.

402
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,169
I'm sure that this was a delightful surprise for you.

403
00:40:49,704 --> 00:40:51,484
If we can't break this,

404
00:40:51,484 --> 00:40:54,589
I'm afraid it'll be difficult for me to get out from here alive.

405
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:58,500
Rong Le, I needed to let them believe that you were the one bombed to pieces.

406
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,599
That's why I had spent all night to send a person who dressed like you... to go into Qianlin Garden.

407
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:05,184
I had put in so much effort for you.

408
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:07,782
Because I had already treated you like a friend.

409
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,722
You are lying.

410
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,139
You didn't kill Rong Le...

411
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,772
because I lied to you saying that she was the descendant of the Qin family...

412
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:21,016
and the only one who knows about the secret of the book.

413
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:22,520
Luo Yan.

414
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,540
How dare you trick me.

415
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:33,009
Yun'er.

416
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,840
Yun'er.

417
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,158
Are you all right?

418
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,780
Didn't I warn you...

419
00:41:49,652 --> 00:41:52,107
not to tell her?

420
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,733
I found out about it myself. Don't blame her.

421
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,966
Zhao Yun, come here first.

422
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:08,096
Do you know? Brother Wuyou and Princess Rong Le are the ones I care for the most.

423
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:12,660
If you still care about me, care about our child,

424
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,300
you will let go of them.

425
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,520
Zhao Yun, you are willing to sacrifice your life...

426
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,611
for two outsiders?

427
00:42:20,611 --> 00:42:23,100
You are going to risk our child as well?

428
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,913
They are not outsiders.

429
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:29,174
They are my closest family.

430
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:32,872
Without them, I would have died.

431
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:34,666
Same goes to you.

432
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,365
They had saved your life once.

433
00:42:38,365 --> 00:42:40,241
Zhao Yun.

434
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:41,940
Prince Li.

435
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,140
Zhao Yun is your sister.

436
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,998
Don't think of using her life to threaten me.

437
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,223
Zhao Yun, leave now. It's dangerous here.

438
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:53,003
I'm not going to budge.

439
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,860
Qianyi, don't set yourself against Brother Wuyou and Princess Rong Le anymore.

440
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,114
Give them back the book and return the power to our emperor.

441
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:07,392
Let's live a quiet life together,

442
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,979
all right?

443
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,020
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

444
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,450
♫ We have been through so much ♫

445
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,990

448

449
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:05,100
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

450
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:11,000
