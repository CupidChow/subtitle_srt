00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:32,808
[Episode 35]

2
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:35,754
You arbitrarily expanded the army under your control.

3
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:37,505
By placing your army here today,

4
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:40,651
your intention to usurp power and revolt is as clear as day.

5
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,940
How could you face those soldiers who have followed you so loyally...

6
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,820
and the people of Northern Lin who have trusted and respected you?

7
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,269
General Fu, where's your conscience?

8
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:52,469
Where's my conscience?

9
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,700
Today, I'm not afraid to say that...

10
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,020
I have a clear conscience towards every person in Northern Lin.

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,100
I would like to ask you instead.

12
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,284
When I'm fighting on the battlefield,

13
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:09,555
what contributions have you given them?

14
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:12,412
Now, you claim that you've put down the rebellion...

15
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,843
at the southern border as a prince.

16
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,620
Do you think that by doing so,

17
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,085
you can shadow the world with your merits...

18
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,934
and you can plead on the people's behalf?

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,579
I don't care at all... about your opinion of me.

20
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,500
Since you've no regrets about the crime that you've committed,

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,060
I've brought along my army to the palace.

22
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,775
I'm going to get rid of a traitor like you with ill intention...

23
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,700
for those innocent people and soldiers who were sacrificed...

24
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,282
at the southern border rebellion and for my father who had died in vain.

25
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:49,977
Looks like you are going to take the position...

26
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:52,017
as crown prince by force.

27
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:54,251
But I am different from you.

28
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:58,981
After all these years, I'm already sick of all the slaughter.

29
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:04,422
Of course, I believe that you are not willing to sacrifice your soldiers from the southern border either.

30
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,168
- Guard.
- Yes, General.

31
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,999
- Bring my wife here.
- Yes, General.

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,017
Man Yao.

33
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,088
From the way you look,

34
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:02,720
are you going to take away my wife again today?

35
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:04,495
How about you take a guess.

36
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:08,012
Do you think I'll let you succeed today?

37
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:10,025
If you really treat her as your wife,

38
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:12,088
you wouldn't drag her into such a dangerous situation.

39
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:13,860
It's not up to you or me to decide.

40
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,820
It's entirely up to her.

41
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,314
Are you willing to marry me?

42
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,109
I'm willing.

43
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:43,143
The daughter of Central Secretary, Sun Yali... is virtuous and pure.

44
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:46,599
She is very affectionate towards me... and cares for me.

45
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,099
So, I've decided that after today, I'm going to take her as a wife.

46
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:53,048
And I vow that... she'll be my only wife in this life.

47
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,539
I won't have another ever again.

48
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,736
You won't divorce Man Yao so easily.

49
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,333
Where is she?

50
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,868
Prince Li, since you care about the woman that I've thrown away,

51
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:13,060
I'll give this woman to you.

52
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,521
Let's see if you are willing to accept this gift.

53
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,360
What did you do to her?

54
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,821
She is poisoned by... Scorpion Toxin.

55
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,906
Those who are poisoned...

56
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:51,874
will suffer as if their whole bodies were being burned by wildfire.

57
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:54,630
It will call upon her deepest hatred.

58
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,359
Her mind will freeze as if it is encased in ice.

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,020
As soon as it freezes,

60
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,606
the mind will be swallowed by hatred.

61
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,458
She will lose all conscience.

62
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,790
I suggest that you hold yourself back first.

63
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,780
Since I've already made my promise, I won't go back on my words.

64
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,822
If you act recklessly again,

65
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:09,253
the only thing you will get is a dead body.

66
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,432
Retreat.

67
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,980
So, you kept her by your side...

68
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,160
just to use her to threaten me today.

69
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,090
Not only are you not worthy to be the General of Defense,

70
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,580
you are not worthy to be called a man as well.

71
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,999
You don't dare to fight me face-to-face.

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,116
Instead, you torture an innocent lady.

73
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,420
Today, it is not me or Man Yao who loses our faces in public.

74
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,810
It's you.

75
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,573
You are a despicable and cunning low life.

76
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,800
You still don't understand.

77
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,259
Do you know who the oneis that caused all of this?

78
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,031
When I married Rong Le, I've never thought of using her to threaten you.

79
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,700
It turned out like this today... because of you.

80
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,743
You kidnapped her on our wedding day.

81
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,780
And you admitted in public...

82
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,399
that you had an amorous past with Rong Le.

83
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,919
Then, you took her away...

84
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,729
and locked her in the Yun Mausoleum for three days and three nights.

85
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:37,620
Later on, you repeatedly barged into my manor to take her away by force.

86
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,780
Prince Li, when you took all of those unscrupulous actions,

87
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,080
you should have known that as her husband,

88
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,052
this is how I was going to treat her for your actions.

89
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:51,100
The endless sufferings that I had...

90
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,697
and the pain that Rong Le is in today...

91
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:57,077
are caused single-handedly by you, Zongzheng Wuyou.

92
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,300
Now, she is poisoned with Scorpion Toxin.

93
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,925
She has only one hour left.

94
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:08,273
If she doesn't consume the cure in an hour's time,

95
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:12,687
then you'll have to watch while she dies in pain.

96
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,340
As long as you promise...

97
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,840
not to harm the innocent lives of the southern border soldiers behind me...

98
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,586
and are willing to give me the cure,

99
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:35,367
I can...

100
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,140
give you my life.

101
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,760
Wuyou.

102
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,460
You can't do that.

103
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,220
I don't want to take their lives and I don't want yours either.

104
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,900
What I want...

105
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,907
What I want is for you...

106
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,120
to kneel and surrender to me.

107
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,220
Wuyou, you can't surrender.

108
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,480
- Man Yao, no!
- Wuyou!

109
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,220
You can't be Rong Le.

110
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,158
You are not Rong Le.

111
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:26,954
Hen Xiang, are you trying to ruin my plan again. Right?

112
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,588
Looks like you are really going to betray me.

113
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,439
If that's the case,

114
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,997
I won't show mercy to you either.

115
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,597
Hen Xiang, listen to me carefully.

116
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:44,318
If you act recklessly again,

117
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:47,700
I will make you feel like death is a better option.

118
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,877
General Fu, no matter what mistakes she did,

119
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:02,203
she was still your wife once.

120
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:04,679
Now, she has endured such sufferings.

121
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,959
Any wrongs she did should have already been forgiven.

122
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,139
Princess Rong Le once treated me as her friend.

123
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,599
I'm in debt with Prince Li as well.

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,418
If you really have me in your heart,

125
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,416
you'll let go of them for me.

126
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,159
You once told me that...

127
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,815
you'll stand by my side forever.

128
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,520
But you plead for them today.

129
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,159
If I let go of them today, do you think that...

130
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,920
they'll let go of me in the future?

131
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:40,217
Sun Yali, do you wish to see me...

132
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,703
falling into the abyss as well?

133
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:53,177
Guards. Bring her away.

134
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:54,817
Yes, General.

135
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,005
Zongzheng Wuyou, let me remind you again.

136
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,059
One hour's time is almost up.

137
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,728
Are you going to surrender or not?

138
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,500
Wuyou.

139
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,240
Wuyu.

140
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,359
Remember what I told you today.

141
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,039
No matter what happens, don't disobey me.

142
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Promise me.

143
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,639
If things go wrong today,

144
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,680
the lives of the soldiers and the people will be your priority.

145
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,721
Keep your strength.

146
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,741
Wuyou, I promise you.

147
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Yes, Wuyou.

148
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,899
Today, we are here tosettle our old scores.

149
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,110
I'll bear it alone.

150
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:00,519
Wuyu has neither grievance nor rancor against you.

151
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,220
I believe that you won't make things difficult for him.

152
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,379
What I want is for you...

153
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,008
to kneel and surrender to me.

154
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,280
- Leng Yan.
- Yes, Your Highness.

155
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,119
Bring Prince Chen away.

156
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,300
Yes!

157
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,150
Your Highness Prince Chen.

158
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,220
Wuyou, I'll take my leave now.

159
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,696
No!

160
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,639
Don't, Wuyou!

161
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,999
I'd rather die!

162
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,423
Man Yao, please forgive me for my wayward way once more.

163
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,100
I... surrender.

164
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,168
This is the only bottle of cure that can save Rong Le.

165
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:49,759
Zongzheng Wuyou, you've always been arrogant and proud.

166
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,111
You've never respected anybody else.

167
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:55,797
But today, you have to kneel and scrape below me.

168
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:59,746
I want you to remember that you were defeated by me.

169
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,540
And you'll always be defeated by me.

170
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,826
Man Yao.

171
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,889
It's all right now. It's all right now.

172
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,467
Man Yao, it's me.

173
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,608
I am Wuyou.

Report!

176
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,959
General Fu, after Prince Chen left,

177
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,559
the army from the southern border has retreated to the South in the midst of the chaos.

178
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,357
And they are protected by warriors of martial arts. We can't stop them.

179
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,399
General, Lady Rong Le is gone.

180
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,240
We've searched the whole manor.

181
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,279
And we've searched Prince Chen's and Prince Li's Manor as well.

182
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
But we saw no sign of her.

As an imperial physician, you still can't determine her illness after so long.

249
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:29,812
What do I need you for?

250
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:32,836
General Fu, Lady Rong Le has contacted a very poisonous toxin.

251
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:35,404
Although it has been neutralized, her body is heavily damaged.

252
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:36,810
This is inevitable.

253
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,352
Get along with it then! Quick!

254
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:20,625
What should I do?

255
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:25,390
It wasn't supposed to be you. I'd asked Hen Xiang...

256
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,594
I've asked Hen Xiang to take your place.

257
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,134
Why did it become the real you?

258
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,380
What should I do?

259
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:43,308
Atone for my sin.

260
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:52,522
The only thing I can do for the rest of my life is to atone for my sin.

261
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:54,686
I need to atone for my sin.

262
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,139
General Fu, we still have important things to do.

263
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:06,085
General Fu.

264
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:08,090
Important things.

265
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,341
Important things.

266
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:18,849
Chang Jian. Chang Jian.

267
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,993
Chang Jian! What are the important things?

268
00:27:21,993 --> 00:27:24,880
Tell me! What are the important things?

269
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:29,039
Chang Jian, I'd replaced Rong Le with Hen Xiang.

270
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,713
Why did it become the real Rong Le? Why?

271
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,534
Why?

272
00:27:57,936 --> 00:27:59,496
Quick!

273
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,619
- Quick!
- Your Highness, General Fu is outside.

274
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,004
Good.

275
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:08,812
Good. General Fu didn't disappoint me after all.

276
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,833
Call him in!

277
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:16,481
Come in, General of Defense, Fu Chou.

278
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:28,063
General Fu!

279
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:34,373
General Fu. General Fu.

280
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:38,200
General Fu, you are indeed the pillar of Northern Lin,

281
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,654
the right-hand man that I rely on.

282
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:43,715
Don't worry. I'll have a feast for the army.

283
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:45,722
And I'll reward them accordingly.

284
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:47,503
Come here.

285
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,599
General Fu.

286
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,099
Pass on my order.

287
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,359
Add ten thousand soldiers to guard the inside and outside of the palace.

288
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,726
Nobody can go out without my decree.

289
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:59,387
Besides, get me ten thousands archers...

290
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:01,504
to surround the whole of Zhongshan city.

291
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:05,010
If there are any suspicious or unidentifiable people, kill them.

292
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,440
- Yes, General!
- Good. Get on with it then!

293
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,770
Great! General Fu.

294
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,639
You are indeed a brilliant strategist.

295
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:16,510
You've turned danger into safety, my great general.

296
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,251
Chang Jian!

297
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,140
General Fu.

298
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,454
Crown Prince... is traitorous, fatuous, and incompetent.

299
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:35,462
He sells titles and ranks in secret...

300
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:37,519
and causes disorder in the court.

301
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,177
This is... the evidence of your crime.

302
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,804
The late emperor had asked you to hold the fort.

303
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:54,078
But you indulged in having fun and slacked off with court affairs.

304
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:57,019
That's why it turned out like this today.

305
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,268
The crimes that you have committed are endless.

306
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:01,151
You should be punished to death.

307
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,496
Guards.

308
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,759
Yes, General.

309
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,216
Lock the crown prince up in the Eastern Palace and wait for further orders.

310
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:08,757
Roger that.

311
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,760
Nonsense!

312
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:18,342
What nonsense! Nonsense!

313
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:21,981
Fu Chou! How dare you!

314
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:24,959
A low life! A traitor!

315
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:27,179
You've pushed me into a trap that you've laid out!

316
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,680
Release me!

317
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,233
I am the crown prince. This is my country!

318
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,708
Wait!

319
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:39,819
Your action is quite inappropriate here, General Fu.

320
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:42,361
Even if the crown prince has made a lot of mistakes,

321
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:44,798
we are still his subjects.

322
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:46,319
This...

323
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:53,095
You asked me about what rights I had.

324
00:30:55,285 --> 00:31:00,084
I have the rights because I am the son of the late empress, Fu Yuan.

325
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,540
- Son of Fu Yuan?
- Is that so?

326
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,819
Is that so?

327
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:08,639
According to the rule of the ancestors,

328
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:12,100
the eldest son of the empress will be the true Crown Prince.

329
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,863
If my mother wasn't banished from the palace because of some traitors,

330
00:31:15,863 --> 00:31:19,120
you wouldn't be the crown prince of today.

331
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,561
You...

332
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:22,316
Nonsense!

333
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,162
There is no proof.

334
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:27,970
Fu Chou, how dare you pretend to be the son of the royalty.

335
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,111
How bold of you!

336
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:32,333
You are just a traitor.

337
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:36,636
You...You are just a traitor!

338
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:40,409
- Release me!
- Since all officials are here today,

339
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,144
I'll make things clear.

340
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:45,300
I'm the son of the late empress, Fu Yuan.

341
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,730
The Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal will prove that.

342
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,485
When the late emperor enthroned the empress,

343
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:57,252
he told the world that the eldest son of my mother will be given the title of Crown Prince...

344
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:59,384
and become the successor to the throne.

345
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,264
And it's a promise not to be changed.

346
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:03,670
Fake.

347
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,077
Fake! Those are fake!

348
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:09,951
Fake.

349
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,219
After verifying them,

350
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:40,404
the Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal are real.

351
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:43,079
- But...
- But?

352
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,736
But what?

353
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:48,177
If Sir Yang can't speak it out, let me do it then.

354
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,414
Everybody knows that Empress Fu and her son had passed away.

355
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:55,381
His Majesty had told us himself. All of us here are witnesses to that.

356
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:58,764
General Fu, you have the Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal.

357
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:02,763
But they can't prove that you are of royal blood.

358
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:05,479
That's right. You are a fake.

359
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:07,599
Fu Chou, how bold you are.

360
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,499
How dare you pretend to be the son of royalty!

361
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:12,087
Guards, arrest him!

362
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:14,648
Arrest him!

363
00:33:14,648 --> 00:33:19,436
From time immemorial, a traitor will never work alone.

364
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:24,112
He will have accomplices from the inside and outside of the palace and the court.

365
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:26,187
Sir Lin.

366
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:28,460
If I remember correctly,

367
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,983
when my mother was still alive,

368
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:33,400
she was protective towards you and she doted on you.

369
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,552
You are a second-rank official.

370
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:38,119
When my mother was accused wrongly,

371
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,601
you didn't step up to defend her.

372
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,907
I don't blame you for that.

373
00:33:41,907 --> 00:33:45,963
Because I understand that as subjects, we need to play safe.

374
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:49,136
But now, I've endured so much hardship...

375
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:51,759
to return to my rightful family with the Golden Scroll and Phoenix Seal.

376
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,952
And here you are, trying so hard to stop me.

377
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:57,399
Did Zongzheng Wuyou promise you anything in return?

378
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:00,125
Or do you think that Zongzheng Wuyou...

379
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:03,144
will return to this court?

380
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:07,461
- Don't sling mud at me.
- Guards. Bring Sir Lin out for interrogation.

381
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:10,730
Let's see how many traitors there are still.

382
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,993
Fu Chou, you are just using this chance to get revenge.

383
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:17,579
Your mother has only herself to blame... for her death.

384
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,746
So, you've known from the start that I'm the son of Fu Yuan.

385
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,765
- But you pretended to doubt me.
- You...

386
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:26,625
I never thought that you'd really have an ulterior motive. Bring him away.

387
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:29,948
Let go of me! Let go of me!

388
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:33,510
Fu Chou, how daring of you.

389
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,445
You are a traitor.

390
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:42,092
What are you doing? You...

391
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:51,187
My fellow officials, do any of you... have other objections?

392
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,980
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Stand up.

393
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,262
Get up now!

394
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:02,039
He is a traitor!

395
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,981
You are a low-life. A traitor!

396
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:08,214
Fu Chou. Fu Chou!

397
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,085
Why did it become the real Rong Le?

398
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,740
What do you mean?

399
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,606
According to our initial plan,

400
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:58,176
it was supposed to be Princess Rong Le.

401
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:00,959
I've already asked Hen Xiang to replace her.

402
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:05,599
Why would the real Rong Le be the one at the square?

403
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,701
Did you put a spoke in my wheel?

404
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:10,674
Did you?

405
00:36:10,674 --> 00:36:13,695
In order to protect Princess Rong Le,

406
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:16,619
how could you ask Hen Xiang to take her place?

407
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,805
I heard that the plan this time had gone very smoothly.

408
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:22,099
I thought you'd already thought it through.

409
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:26,120
I thought that you'd given up on love for the greater good.

410
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:31,640
You said that you love her.

411
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,680
But you didn't realize that she was the one at the square.

412
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,810
Zongzheng Wuyou was able to identify her.

413
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,899
That's why he surrendered willingly.

414
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:46,440
You know it clearly yourself.

415
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,599
If she were not the real Princess Rong Le,

416
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,000
you wouldn't have been able to fool Zongzheng Wuyou so easily.

417
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,260
All of you, get up!

418
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:15,182
Congratulate our young master that he has gotten his revenge...

419
00:37:15,182 --> 00:37:17,811
and has completed a great cause!

420
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:21,533
Congratulations for completing a great cause, Young Master!

421

00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,868
Why is the princess still unconscious?

439
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,989
She has been unconscious for so long.

She will be fine, right?

00:39:19,749 --> 00:39:23,154

- I'm going to kill him.

Are you crazy?

445
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,980
Ever since General Fu and princess came back to the manor,

446
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,187
General Fu has sentenced all the guards in Tranquil Garden to death.

447
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:35,268
Even Chang Jian is being punished.

448
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:36,744
General Fu stood guard beside...

the princess without rest,without drinking and without eating.

450

As the princess's bodyguard,

I've failed my duty for not being able to protect her well.

Now... Now, she has already become like this.

00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,837
Am I not going to avenge her because I care for my own life?

456
00:39:56,837 --> 00:40:01,058
Xiao Sha, I feel the same as you.

457
00:40:01,058 --> 00:40:04,011
I'm very upset that she is hurt.

Get a good rest and let your body recover, all right?

Don't touch me.

I hate your face that faked innocence so much.

472
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:43,010
You pretended to care about me,

473
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,691
but you were actually plotting about how to use me.

474
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:49,189
- I didn't do it.
- You didn't do what?

475
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:54,747
You didn't use me to threaten Wuyou?

476
00:41:54,747 --> 00:41:58,286
You didn't personally feed me the toxin by force?

477
00:41:58,286 --> 00:42:01,262
Or you didn't send someone to bring me into the palace...

478
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:03,675
so that I can be humiliated in public?

00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:05,662
I didn't know that she was you.

00:42:14,757 --> 00:42:17,924
And I don't want to talk to you.

483
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:20,129
You make me feel that...

484
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:23,198
I'm a disaster to others as long as I'm still alive.

485
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,909
Rong Le, let's not think about other things for now, all right?

486
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:31,750
Where is Wuyou?

487
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,161
I want to see him.

488
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,730
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

489
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:19,150
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

490
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:26,790
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

491
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:32,350
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

492
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,260
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

493
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:45,690
♫ You are keeping me out with your care
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

494
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,180
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

495
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,900
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

496
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:03,960
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

497
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,960
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

498
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,200
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

499
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:21,370
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

500
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:28,050
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

501
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:32,660
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

502
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:41,730
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

503
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,660
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

504
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,900
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

505
00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:03,900
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
