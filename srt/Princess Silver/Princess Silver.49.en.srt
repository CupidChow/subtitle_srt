[Episode 49]

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
Any progress on the item I ordered you to search for?

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
This is why I came here.

4
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,400
This is half of the tome that I found on Mount Lone Frost.

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,800
The information you want is in this tome.

6
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,800
Twenty years ago,

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,400
someone asked the Lone Frost Sage for this tome but was turned down.

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,500
In the middle of the argument, the tome was torn into two.

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,200
The first half was taken.

10
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,000
The other half was hidden by the Sage inside the Cave of Zephyr.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,200
Not even Xiao Ke, the Sage's student has seen this tome.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Don't bother searching for the other half.

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,400
I know where it is.

14
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,700
Back to your work.

15
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,400
Yes.

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,800
Rong Le, wait for me.

17
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,800
Because of the cursed Lady Yun,

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,000
he sent me to the Emperor of Qi to be violated!

19
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
West?

20
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,900
Is this the word west?

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,600
[Senyan Palace]

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,500
Ever since you came back,

23
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
you hate anything that gives reflection.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,800
But why... are you in the mood to look into a mirror now?

25
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,300
We all have to face our scar eventually.

26
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,200
Keep running away from it...

27
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,000
will not solve anything at all.

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,400
- You're dismissed.
- Yes.

29
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,600
Ever since you came back from the south,

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,400
you barely visited me in this palace.

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
Even when I invited you to a dinner,

32
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,600
you turned it down by saying you are busy.

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
That day,

34
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,000
you mentioned the Emperor of Western Qi.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,400
I bet that was Rong Qi's father, Rong Yi.

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
Mother, do you know him well?

37
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Chou'er,

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,200
you look a little under the wind today.

39
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,100
Did our men in the south bear any news?

40
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,700
Your update on the situation in the south seems to be ahead of everyone.

41
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,000
As for the question just now,

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,500
- did you and Emperor of Qi...
- I am tired.

43
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
You should go.

44
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
I remember when I was little,

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,000
I hated this very palace.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,800
The owner of this place never acknowledged me as his son.

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
In this place,

48
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
I never felt a moment of warmth from anyone.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,200
Not even the warmth of foods.

50
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,400
But after I left,

51
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
I wanted to come back here.

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
After all, I am the elder son of the emperor.

53
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,800
All of these are rightfully mine.

54
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,200
I sacrificed a lot because of this.

55
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,600
I finally become its owner.

56
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,400
But then it crossed my mind.

57
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Is this place...

58
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,400
rightfully mine in the end?

If you had chosen me... the first time we met;

72
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,200
If I never used you for my plans;

73
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,500
If...

74
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,000
I never fed you that poison with my own hands;

75
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,000
If I recognized you at once,

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,200
perhaps we would still be together.

77
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
But the reality is...

78
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
there is no such thing as "if."

79
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,300
Your Highness.

80
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,200
- What is it?
- I received reports.

81
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,100
Consort Rong Le was ambushed by the Seven Asuras at the border.

82
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,200
She was rescued by Prince Zhenbei's man.

83
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
What?

84
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Because of Rong Le,

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,200
he once gave up on his pride and his very life.

86
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
And now he sent killers after her?

87
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,300
What does he want?

88
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,800
Maybe he loves her too much.

89
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,800
He can't allow any flaw in their love.

90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
He can't tolerate betrayal.

91
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,200
When the scandal took place,

92
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
he lost all his senses of judgment.

93
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,000
I heard... it was because the ashes of Lady Yun were lost,

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,900
Prince Li and Consort Rong Le grew apart and barely met again.

95
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,200
Their love was not as impregnable as before.

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,600
That is why he believed his wife was keeping a lover.

97
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
He sent the Seven Asuras to hunt her down.

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,400
It seems like he is really trying to end her life for good.

99
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,600
Is he trying to avenge Lady Yun?

100
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,200
For the sake of the army's morale, he gave up on Rong Le.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,700
Where is Rong Le right now?

102
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,400
She is in Chen, the Emperor of Qi is heading there as we speak.

103
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Get everything ready, I am heading to Chen.

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Your Highness, if Empress Fu finds out...

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,500
If she finds out, tell her I am going there to purchase cavalry horses...

106
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,200
for our elite troops.

107
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,800
- That is all you need to tell her.
- Yes.

108
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,200
Zongzheng Wuyou, if you followed the same mistake I made,

109
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
I will never let Rong Le return to your side again.

110
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
You ordered me to go into hiding for so long.

111
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,900
And now you summoned me here.

112
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,200
What if Fu Chou finds out?

113
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,600
He is now on his way to Chen.

114
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
He is still worried for Rong Le.

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
His worries are just what we wanted.

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He completed so many missions just for the sake of my revenge.

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,100
But when he realized I was alive,

118
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
his guilt for Rong Le became even deeper.

119
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,800
When the Creed was destroyed,

120
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,400
I knew you would be mad at me.

121
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
But I had no other choice.

122
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
You helped me in using Rong Le for my bidding,

123
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,900
forced Zongzheng Wuyou into surrendering,

124
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,000
some sacrifices are necessary to calm Fu Chou's anger.

125
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I understand.

126
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
I wasn't mad at you.

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,400
After all these years, no matter what happened,

128
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,000
as long as you would do something for me,

129
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,800
even when you allowed me to make you a cup of tea...

130
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,400
or you simply spared me a smile,

131
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I would risk my life for you.

132
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,300
I would stay by your side just to protect you...

133
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,600
and chose to became a eunuch.

134
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,800
Your kindness for me...

135
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
will not be forgotten.

136
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,900
I asked you here...

137
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,700
because I need a favor from you.

138
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,000
You can't live without me.

139
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
Have a seat.

140
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,100
For over a year,

141
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,400
I demanded Fu Chou to invade the south,

142
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
but he refused.

143
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,500
He even went there alone for his own death.

144
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,200
How disappointing.

145
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Since he won't listen to me,

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,300
you shall go to Chen in my place.

147
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,000
Find a way to help him.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,200
If his stubbornness persists,

149
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,800
my vengeance...

150
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,100
I understand.

151
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,300
In order to protect Rong Le, Zongzheng Wuyou...

152
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,200
even turned his hair white just like Rong Le.

153
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I thought he would continue to defend her.

154
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,400
But his actions...

155
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,600
are simply out of my expectations.

156
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Losing his mother's ashes...

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,400
took a toll on his mind.

158
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,500
It doesn't matter.

159
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
We...

160
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,200
still have another plan in place.

161
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,000
I assure you, this time

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,600
I will make the plan a reality for you.

[Prince Zhenbei Residence]

164
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,400
Why is it taking them so long?

165
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,200
Did they run into trouble on their way here?

166
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,000
Li Wu just sent us a letter.

167

Rong Le is now wounded.

168
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,500
They went to a clinic to treat the wound.

169
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,000
So, the carriage couldn't move too fast.

170
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Yun'er, don't worry too much.

171
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Rong Le is now inside the border of Chen.

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
They have Li Wu as their escort.

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There is nothing to worry about.

174
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Watch your steps.

175
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,200
- Zhao Yun.
- Princess Rong Le.

176
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,000
I am fine. Don't worry about me.

177
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,600
Yun'er, Rong Le is still injured.

178
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,200
They traveled a long journey. Let's talk inside.

179
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,790
[Prince Zhenbei Residence]

180
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Rong Le, after parting with you a year ago,

181
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,000
Zhao Yun and I have missed you a lot.

182
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,800
I remember the time when we were in Northern Lin with Prince Li...

183
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,900
and having tea together.

184
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,400
Stop mentioning the things that spoil her mood.

185
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Fine, let's move on to another topic.

186
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Rong Le, we were worried when we heard what happened to you.

187
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,300
I sent Li Wu to escort you.

188
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,200
But I never expected an ambush from assassins.

189
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,600
I heard they are the Seven Asuras from the Hidden Ones.

190
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,100
Is it true?

191
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,900
The Seven Asuras?

192
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Aren't those Brother Wuyou's men?

193
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,000
- What happened?
- Princess Zhao Yun.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You should have seen Prince Li.

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's like he has become an entirely different person.

196
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
Princess Rong Le is being framed.

197
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
Not only did he not trust her,

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,200
he even sent the assassins to hunt us down.

199
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
He is trying to kill Princess Rong Le!

200
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,900
No way! That is not the Brother Wuyou I know.

201
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,500
There must be some kind of reasons behind this.

202
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,300
- I must write him a letter.
- Zhao Yun.

203
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,700
This is not the first fallout I have had with him.

204
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,400
What's done is done.

205
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,500
There is nothing I can say.

206
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,200
Please, stop mentioning his name?

207
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,000
I just want to be in peace and get well.

208
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
She is right.

209
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,200
Your recovery comes first.

210
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Yun'er, whatever happens,

211
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
the two of us will be on Princess Rong Le's side.

212
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,400
Isn't that right?

213
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,400
Rong Le, you can stay here without any worries.

214
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Take it as you are keeping Yun'er company.

215
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,500
- He is right, Princess Rong Le.
- Yun'er.

216
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,800
How many times have I told you?

217
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Do not press your belly.

218
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,100
Yun'er, you are expecting a child?

219
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,100
It's only been over a month.

220
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,000
Congratulations.

221
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I was worried for you at first.

222
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
But after seeing you,

223
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,800
I can tell you are having a happy life.

224
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,800
Your Highness, a special guest asked for Princess Rong Le.

225
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,020
[Prince Zhenbei Residence]

226
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,000
Welcome, I am sorry for the lack of a proper welcome.

227
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I apologize for that.

228
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,300
Not at all, Prince Zhenbei.

229
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,000
I didn't send any letter to inform you of my visit.

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This may be all too sudden. I hope you are not offended.

231
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Not at all, I have heard about how sharp and dashing you are.

232
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,300
The rumors are true after all.

233
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,600
Come on in.

234
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,200
Please.

235
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,400
[Prince Zhenbei Residence]

236
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
Your Highness, we are here.

237
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Please.

238
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
Your Majesty.

239
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,600
Your Highness, there is another special guest.

240
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Rong Qi?

241
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,400
What are you doing here?

242
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,900
It's been over a year since we last met.

243
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,600
You became the Prince Regent of Northern Lin.

244
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,000
Yet, you lost your manners as well.

245
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
For someone like yourself,

246
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,400
I don't need any manners.

247
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,500
Today must be a special day.

248
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,200
Even General Fu is paying us a visit.

249
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,700
Wait! I should address you as Prince Regent.

250
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,600
Your Majesty. Prince Regent. Let's continue inside the house.

251
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
If you may.

252
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Did you come here to harm Rong Le again?

253
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,800
I have no idea what you are talking about.

254
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Rong Le is the sister I love the most.

255
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,400
I have always been kind to her,

256
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,800
why would I harm her?

257
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,500
As for you...

258
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,400
I married her to you so you could treat her well.

259
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,000
But in the end, you almost had her killed.

260
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,900
I understand why the two of you came here.

261
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,100
You are both here for Princess Rong Le. Right?

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
I heard she is here.

263
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
I have urgent matters to discuss with her.

264
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,100
Please, lead me to her.

265
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,700
You will try to hurt her.

266
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,600
Prince Zhenbei.

267
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
If you wish to keep Rong Le safe,

268
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,800
allow me to see her first.

269
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,600
Please, stop arguing.

270
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,000
To be honest with you,

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,400
Rong Le is indeed in my house.

272
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,000
However...

273
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,700
Is she wounded?

274
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,000
She is, but it was no serious injury.

275
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,300
When she came to my house and met Zhao Yun,

276
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
they cuddled together and started crying.

277
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,200
They have more tears than words for each other.

278
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,400
Even mentioning the name of Prince Li...

279
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
is too much for her to handle.

280
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,800
I know the two of you want to see her very badly.

281
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,400
But she doesn't want any guests for now.

282
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,200
If I insist on taking you to her,

283
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,800
she will definitely leave at once.

284
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,600
If something happens to her,

285
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,700
none of us can help her.

286
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,600
How about this?

287
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,000
I can send the two of you to the royal villa of our palace.

288
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I will let Zhao Yun talk to her.

289
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
When she is in a better mood,

290
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,700
I will make the arrangement for you to meet with her.

291
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,800
How does that sound?

292
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,300
Prince Zhenbei, you and your wife have my thanks.

293
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,900
Sure. How about... I send you to the Qianlin Garden?

294
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,600
If you may?

295
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,700
I am surprised the Emperor of Qi and General Fu are here.

296
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,400
Princess Rong Le, I assure you,

297
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
if you don't want to see them,

298
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,600
I won't let them bother you.

299
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
Zhao Yun, you don't need to see me off to my room.

300
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,200
You are expecting a child, you need to rest.

301
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,800
It's all right. I want to keep you company.

302
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
For the past year, other than Qianyi,

303
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,900
I have no one to talk to heart-to-heart.

304
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
I wish I could return to the good old days.

305
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,000
I had you, Brother Wuyou and...

306
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,100
Princess Rong Le,

307
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
how has Wuyu been doing all this time?

308
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He is fine, don't worry about him.

309
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
I am glad to hear that.

310
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,000
When we bid each other goodbye,

311
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I thought I would never fall in love with another man.

312
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,200
I was depressed when I first came to Chen.

313
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
I felt like my life was meaningless.

314
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
But Qianyi tried the best he could to cheer me up every day.

315
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,300
When I fell ill, he hired the best doctor to treat me.

316
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,200
When I couldn't get used to the food here,

317
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,800
he hired a great chef from Northern Lin for me.

318
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
As long as I gave him a smile,

319
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
it would make him overjoyed for days.

320
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,800
I had never felt so much love in my entire life.

321
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,800
My feelings actually matter so much to someone.

322
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
It looks like he does love you a lot.

323
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,900
He must have spent a lot of time with you.

324
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,000
Before this, as soon as he got home,

325
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
he would keep me company.

326
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But for some reason,

327
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,800
he seems to be getting busier lately.

328
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,400
He rushed to his study for work as soon as he got home.

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
I don't know.

332
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
Aside from me and the female servants,

333
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
there hasn't been any other woman in here.

334
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,000
Let's take a look.

335
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,200
Princess, no.

336
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,800
That is Qianyi's study.

337
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,400
No one can step inside without his permission.

338
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,600
Not even you?

339
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
That is the only place I haven't been to in the whole manor.

340
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,600
Do you know that woman?

341
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,800
I feel like she looked familiar.

[Qianlin Court]

343
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Prince Regent, how may I help you?

344
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,200
Prince Regent.

345
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,800
How dare you get in my way.

346
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
No, I wouldn't dare.

347
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,100
Little Xun, leave us be.

348
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,700
Yes.

349
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,600
Tell me why you really came here.

350
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,500
The last time we met, your temper wasn't as bad.

351
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,800
This is the famous bitter tea of Chen.

352
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,000
Have some tea.

353
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,600
Enough about last time!

354
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Do you take me as a fool?

355
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,400
It was you who sneaked into my house...

356
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,800
and swapped Hen Xiang with Rong Le.

357
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,600
You made her suffer.

358
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,800
You are her brother, how could you do this to her?

359
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Rather than asking me,

360
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
you should be asking yourself.

361
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
You had your chances to save her from dangers.

362
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,400
But you did nothing at all.

363
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,900
Yes. That was my fault.

364
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,600
But you are the cause of all pain.

365
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,200
You made me lose Rong Le.

366
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Do you even know what the true meaning of loss is?

367
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,600
She never loved you and she was never yours.

368
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
How is this your loss?

369
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,400
I know, you can't wait to end my life.

370
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,400
I wish I could do the same to you.

371
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,300
However, I take pity on you.

372
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,200
Even until now,

373
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,200
you have no idea who the true enemy is.

374
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,600
You have my sympathy for this.

375
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,700
Do not taunt me with this.

376
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,000
I know. All you wanted was to use me...

377
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,500
so I could kill Zongzheng Wuyou for you.

378
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,000
I have stated my stand clearly.

379
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This time, I will not work with you.

380
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
Even if I have to kill him,

381
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,000
I would rather make it a duel.

382
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,400
Do not think you have seen through everything...

383
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,900
and understand what I have in mind.

384
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,400
You are the only person who is still blinded by lies.

If I were you,

387
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,200
I would return to Northern Lin at once... and do nothing.

388

Otherwise...

389

you will realize soon enough...

390
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,100
just how foolish your entire life has been.

Greetings, Emperor of Western Qi and Prince Regent of Northern Lin.

394

Prince Zhenbei ordered me to send this message.

395
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,000
Five days from now, he will hold a feast at Qingtian Chamber...

396
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400

397

His Highness and Princess Rong Le will attend that feast.

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200

- Yes.

See the Prince Regent off for me.

What are you doing in here?

406
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Her Highness has run into a lot of danger, so I am worried.

407
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
We are in the house of Prince Zhenbei,

408
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,300
do you really think someone would try to hurt her?

409
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,400
Fine.

410
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,500
Both of you must be tired from the long journey.

411

Get some rest.

412

You don't need to keep watch here.

But, Your Highness, you haven't taken the medicine yet.

414
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I will prepare it for you at once.

415
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,600
You can take a nap if you are tired.

416
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,800

Your Highness, Miss Luo Yan is back.

- Very well, you are dismissed.
- Yes.

421
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
What did you promise me back in the School of Wisdom?

422
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You would never put yourself at risk again.

423

You won't let me be worried again.

424

I know you are mad because I hurt myself again.

the people and the army will lose their trust in you.

So you forced me into playing along with your plan?

Wuyou, if you plan to invade the north,

you need to earn the trust of the army.

Because of the lies about the Silver-Haired Demon,

Your mother was even...

450

What happened to my mother was not your fault.

For the past few days, I have been thinking.

452

I let my mother down.

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,600
But if I were given another chance,

454
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,000
my decision would still be the same.

455
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,000
I cannot abandon you for something...

I want to avenge my parents by defeating Fu Chou and Fu Yuan.

But I cannot sacrifice you...

You are planning a conspiracy in my nation.

You are even asking me to join your cause.

469
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,100
What makes you think... I would agree to work with you?

470

They are good friends of mine.

471
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,400
What you are asking of me... is to make me...

472
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,300
a loathsome traitor.

473
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Your so-called gratitude...

474
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
is just insignificant kindness.

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000

My ambition and vision?

478

My goal is not something a nameless man like you would know.

479
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,200
Besides, the master you serve was the princess of the previous lords.

480
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,600
Why should I have any trust in her?

481
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,800
Because of this.

This is the letter to offer an alliance from my master.

not only can you expand your territory,

493
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,000
you can even seize the throne for yourself.

497
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,400
Never mind, I am going in there myself.

498
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Your Highness, Prince Zhenbei has a guest.

499
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
This might not be convenient.

500
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Not convenient?

501
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,600
Not convenient for him or the guest he has?

502
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,800
- But...
- Stand aside.

503
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,400
I must go in there. I need to see...

504
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,200
what kind of guest he has in the middle of the night.

505
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
- Your Highness.
- Zhao Yun?

506
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,500
What happened? What's the matter?

507
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,200
I just had a dream.

508
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,500
You were marrying another woman.

509
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,800
You don't love me anymore.

510
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,300
It was just a dream.

511
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,400
I thought it was about something serious.

512
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,000
It's all right now.

513
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
This is serious.

514
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,200
I came all the way from Northern Lin to Chen alone.

515
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,400
I don't have kin or a friend.

516
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,200
You are all I have.

517
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,100
If you don't love me,

518
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,600
I will have nothing.

519
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,000
Qianyi, be honest with me.

520
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You never let me come into your study.

521
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Is it because you are hiding another woman in there?

522
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,800
So, you are here to see if I am keeping a woman in here?

523
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,600
Since it worries you so much,

524
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,400
let me show you what's actually inside.

525
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,900
Come on.

526
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,300
Take it slowly.

527
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Greetings, Your Highness.

528
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,200
You really do have a guest.

529
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,600
Why? Do you really think I would lie to you?

530
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,200
Silly girl.

531
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,300
When did you learn to be jealous?

532
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:07,500
Well, that does make me feel happy.

533
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,400
This means... you care a lot more about me now.

534
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
I am going back to bed.

535
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,600
Keep an eye on her, don't let her fall.

536
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,200
So this is why you are hesitating.

537
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,200
You are just the same as Zongzheng Wuyou.

538
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Your love for a woman...

539
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
is holding you back.

540
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
This is the last warning.

541
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Do not try to harm her.

542
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,600
I am not the same as Wuyou and his brother.

543
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,400
If someone hurts the woman I love,

544
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,700
I'll launch a full frontal assault...

545
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
and make him pay.

546
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,400
Prince Zhenbei, you worry too much.

547
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,400
As for your letter, I will be keeping it for now.

548
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,200
You will get my reply in three days.

549
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
Li Wu.

550
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,200
See our guest off.

551
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,700
- Please.
- I believe... the decision you make...

552
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
will be wise and sound.

553
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,000
Luo Yan, you are here.

554
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,800
Your Highness.

555
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,500
It's just the two of us here. Formality is not needed.

556
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,800
I heard about your return.

557
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,000
But I didn't expect you to be here.

558
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,800
Let's talk outside.

559
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,400
I am sure you overheard the conversation I have with Lin Shen.

560
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,000
Yes, I heard it all.

561
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,300
There is a matter that confused me.

562
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,800
You haven't made the decision,

563
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,200
but you accept their letter for an alliance.

564
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,000
Your Highness, do you really plan to join hands with them?

If you haven't made up your mind,

567
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,200
allow me to speak my thought on this.

568
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,000
Do not work with them.

569
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
They are trying to harm your friends.

570
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Especially Princess Rong Le.

571
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,900
She once saved you with her life.

572
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,000
Luo Yan,

573
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,400
did you spend too much time traveling... and forgot your goal?

574
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
I never forgot my goal.

575
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,600
When civil war broke out in Chen, war ravaged the land.

576
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,600
As a young man, you rushed to the battlefield and saved countless people.

577
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,200
Your Highness was like a savior to me, one with a grand ambition.

578
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,700
You once asked me if I had any wishes.

579
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,000
I told you my parents died in the war,

580
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
so I wished for war to never happen again.

581
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,400
You said you had the same wish.

582
