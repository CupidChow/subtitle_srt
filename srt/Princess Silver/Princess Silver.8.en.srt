00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,680
[Episode 8]

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,580
Sir, Li Zhiyuan's manor has been emptied.

3
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,620
These are all the people left in there.

4
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,460
Where is Li Zhiyuan?

5
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Please, show some mercy, we don't know anything!

6
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,800
Bring them in for interrogation.

7
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,640
Your Highness, Minister Wu found some clues.

8
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,919
When Minister Qin was ambushed, all of his secretariat students were killed.

9
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,820
Yet, Li Zhiyuan gained the trust and recognition of Yu Shihai.

10
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,300
He took a position in the Ministery of Personnel.

11
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,319
We can see he is a coward. He won't end his own life.

12
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,480
- You may go now.
- Yes.

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,699
Your Highness, there are so much luggage here. Are we moving out?

14
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:44,259
Since you will be staying, I shall make some adjustments to the manor.

15
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,940
I don't deserve this.

16
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,460
What do you need of me?

17
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,200
Your Highness.

18
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,380
Your Highness, a letter came in from a guest outside.

19
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,039
This is rare. Let him in.

20
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,580
Yes.

21
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,620
I am here to tell Your Highness I am leaving.

22
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,640
You still insist on leaving?

23
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,480
At your service, Your Highness.

24
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,240
Sir, why are you here?

25
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,020
You know him?

26
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,820
Yes.

27
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,300
It's you. Of course, I remember you.

28
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,159
That night, I was passing through Vernicia Alley.

29
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,480
I didn't see her coming toward me. I almost bumped into her.

30
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,840
Vernicia Alley? But we met at Front Yard Street that night.

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,120
Is that what happened?

32
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,820
Indeed.

33
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,979
The night is full of danger. Why would you be in the alley?

34
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,940
Soon after you saved me from the prison,

35
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,430
I felt frustrated from the humiliation I suffered in there.

36
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,540
I couldn't fall asleep and took a stroll on the street.

37
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,220
Is this some sort of interrogation?

38
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,260
I was just being curious.

39
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,170
General Fu just returned from a victorious battle.

40
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,830
But you seem to know each other well.

41
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,660
General Fu?

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,559
Your Highness, I have only met this lady here for mere moments.

43
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:28,700
I didn't even get a chance to know her name.

44
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,079
You really don't know his name? He pacified the skirmishes at the south.

45
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,199
He is the famous Fu Chou. General Fu.

46
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,059
Please, Your Highness. Your Highness' praise is too much for me.

47
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:44,070
Lady, here is something you don't know.

48
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,620
The army I was leading was surrounded.

49
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,819
If it wasn't for His Highness' wise strategy, I might have been a corpse by now.

50
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,780
The credit of winning the battle would be impossible.

51
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,920
Prince Li, I am grateful for the help.

52
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,200
I shall remember the kindness till my last breath.

53
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,379
General Fu, you are being too humble.

54
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,439
I believe even without my help, you and your warriors could still win...

55
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,140
and secure a victory.

56
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,380
I should thank you for the advice while we were at court that day.

57
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,160
His Majesty gave me permission to investigate the corruption.

58
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,659
I felt sorry for it. I had no other choice that day.

59
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,560
I thought about it after I left.

60
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,639
I shouldn't have put you under the pressure of solving the case in a week.

61
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,860
Which is why I searched the files.

62
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,119
I found some leads for you. I hope this can be of help to you.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,500
I know. With your brilliant mind, the case will be solved in seven days.

64
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,300
But as a token to repay your kindness of saving me,

65
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,420
I have a lead of the case.

66
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,140
This is for you.

67
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,260
[Lin Village, Li Zhiyuan]

68
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,300
Where did you get this piece of information?

69
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,060
I have my ways. I am not at liberty to say.

70
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,900
I hope Your Highness won't pry.

71
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,359
I didn't know who you were back then. I apologize if I offended you.

72
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:32,119
It is fate that let us meet each other.

73
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,700
There is no need for an apology, Miss Man Yao.

74
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,740
General Fu, I need a favor from you.

75
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
What may that be?

76
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,639
I am the mistress of Moon Embrace Teahouse. But I ran into some trouble lately.

77
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,740
His Highness invited me to stay in this manor for the time being.

78
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,820
His Highness is worried for my safety and I can't leave.

79
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,579
Now that you are here, can you be so kind as to give me a ride?

80
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:58,630
His house is at the north of the capital. The teahouse is at the west.

81
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,590
How is that in his way?

82
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,860
I will be dropped off in the center and be on my way.

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,939
I have long heard about how famous the tea at Moon Embrace is.

84
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:16,719
How about this? Do I have the honor to have some tea at your premises?

85
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,779
That would be great. You have my thanks.

86
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,060
Your Highness, goodbye.

87
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,060
I shall be on my way now.

88
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,580
You are really leaving?

89
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,040
I have been here for days. I should leave.

90
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,600
If you insist, I shall respect that decision.

91
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,159
I have other work to see to. You may continue with your catching up.

92
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,840
Leng Yan, ready the horses.

93
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,020
Miss, this way.

94
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,759
You have my thanks for helping me out just now.

95
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,439
You are most welcome.

96
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,619
But normally speaking, I should be thanking you.

97
00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:14,500
Since you already know who I am,

98
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,479
you know well enough that I shouldn't have been in the city that night.

99
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,780
The army returned victoriously, the people cheer for you.

100
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,479
You were back in the city ahead of your schedule.

101
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,119
I know you have your own reasons.

102
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,019
You saved my life. It's only decent of me to keep that secret for you.

103
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,479
My Lady, you have a sharp wit and generous heart. I am impressed.

104
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,440
General Fu, we have arrived at the teahouse.

105
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,920
Thank you, General. Goodbye.

106
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,759
Mistress, you are finally back. We were all worried for you.

107
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,560
You need not worry. I am fine.

108
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,419
This is General Fu. He is the one that saved me after I left that night.

109
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,640
Thank you, General Fu. How about a cup of tea inside?

110
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,760
I have work to be done. I shall pay a visit some other day.

111
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,100
So long.

112
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,119
Your Highness, I have been waiting for a long time. What is your next plan?

113
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,519
Long Yue, I have a lead on "The Book of Mountain and River."

114
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,919
This is great.

115
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,359
Stay put in the teahouse. Run a background check on that General Fu.

116
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:50,420
Remember, be cautious. Keep me posted.

117
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,620
Yes.

118
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,919
Xiao Sha, gather your best men. We are going after Zongzheng Wuyou.

119
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,480
Yes.

120
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,760
An officer of the third rank.

121
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,410
Living in hiding without a name...

122
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,399
in this wild and miserable life.

123
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,139
Sir Li, did you do something against your conscience, or did you take something you shouldn't have?

124
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,020
Or did you offend someone with power?

125
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,160
I abandoned my rank and live in seclusion.

126
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,910
Why are you still coming after me?

127
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:39,040
Only a dead man can keep secrets.

128
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,000
Cover me.

129
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
Leng Yan!

130
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,199
Be quick with it.

131
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:19,540
It's all because of a mistake I made.

132
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,620
I brought this down on myself.

133
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,319
I have no intention to kill you.

134
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,079
Answer my question and you will live.

135
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,799
What do you want to know?

136
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,640
Where is "The Book of Mountain and River"?

137
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,199
I am sure you know what "The Book of Mountain and River" is.

138
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,199
The book is lost.

139
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,399
I may be one of the writers of the book,

140
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,799
but I have never seen the completed version of it.

141
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,200
As for its whereabouts, I have no clue at all.

142
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,119
Then you are of no use to me!

143
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,760
Wait!

144
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,679
I remember now.

145
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,159
The book might be inside the secret chamber of the Qin Manor.

146
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,359
I was told my teacher built a secret chamber in his manor.

147
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,919
If His Majesty didn't find this book when the manor was sealed,

148
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,060
the book must have been hidden inside the chamber.

149
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,780
A chamber?

150
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,460
Turn around.

151
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,100
Who are you?

152
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,319
Your Highness!

153
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,960
Your Highness! Wake up!

154
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,199
You saved me once, now I am saving yours.

155
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,840
We are even now.

156
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,000
Your Highness!

157
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,159
Your Highness! Master, we need to go!

158
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,540
- Run!
- Your Highness!

159
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,520
Your Highness!

160
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,080
Help!

161
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,619
- Princess!
- Princess!

162
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:28,980
Your Highness, you are finally back. Are you all right?

163
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,319
Are you all right?

164
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,959
I was so worried.

165
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,800
I am fine. Fate is in my favor, there is no need to be worried.

166
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,380
- Princess, let me get you some tea.
- I'll get hot water for your bath.

167
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,879
Knowing that you are safe and sound,

168
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,959
my worries are relieved.

169
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,260
I found a lead on the mystical book.

170
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,320
I will get it soon.

171
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,180
As for Zongzheng Wuyou,

172
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,200
I noticed... he is not the same as the rumors say.

173
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,119
He may be arrogant, but he is righteous.

174
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,319
He may be cold, but he is kind in a way.

175
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,020
You need to bear this in mind.

176
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,940
If choice needs to be made one day,

177
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,700
we must not make him our enemy.

178
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,860
Take care, Brother.

179
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,360
From: Your sister, Rong Le.

180
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,360
Xiao Sha.

181
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,959
Princess.

182
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,119
I got some leads on the book from Li Zhiyuan.

183
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,799
Send this to Long Yue. Order her to send this letter to my brother in Western Qi.

184
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes.

185
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,140
Your Highness. Taking "The Book of Mountain and River" means a fight with Prince Li.

186
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,999
We must not let our guard down.

187
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,679
Humans are unpredictable..

188
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
You should not put so much trust in him.

189
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,980
Your Highness.

190
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,960
The doctor said it was a poison arrow.

191
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,599
You need to rest for a couple of days.

192
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,540
What about Li Zhiyuan?

193
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,880
He is dead. I brought his body back.

194
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,360
We searched every corner of his hideout. We found nothing.

195
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,039
I didn't see this coming.

196
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,480
I never thought Yu Wenjie had a trick up in his sleeves.

197
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,060
Maybe this is not the doing of the Yu family.

198
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,959
Indeed, I found other traces.

199
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,280
Someone sucked the poison out in time for you.

200
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,360
Otherwise, it could have been much worse.

201
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,119
Have you seen that person?

202
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,420
You were alone when I arrived.

203
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,519
Those people might be after something else.

204
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,500
They might be after the book.

205
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,119
Your Highness, I carried out the mission.

206
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,239
Li Zhiyuan is dead, there is no one left to threaten you.

207
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,420
It's all thanks to Sir Yu's keen insight.

208
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,919
He used the assassins from the Creed of Vengeance for a pincer attack.

209
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,879
Otherwise, the outcome could have been different for us.

210
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,200
I was merely under your protection. I dare not take the credit.

211
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,600
But the Creed really is reliable. They could come in handy.

212
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,359
We need to use them for our bidding.

213
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,079
What a shame.

214
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,759
We still failed to get rid of that Zongzheng Wuyou.

215
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,940
Zongzheng Wuyou?

216
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,900
You actually admire him that much?

217
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,700
Sire, reports from Captain Xiao.

218
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,319
Yes.

219
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,959
Princess Rong Le was framed and jailed.

220
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
Prince Li got her out.

221
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,020
She was then brought to live in Prince Li's manor.

222
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,439
Rumor says the two of them are very close.

223
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,160
Enough.

224
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,740
What about the matter I ordered you to investigate?

225
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,060
We couldn't find the physician.

226
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:07,299
But we did find out that a secret apprentice of his still lives.

227
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,420
Empress Dowager, His Majesty is resting.

228
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,119
He must not be bothered.

229
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,919
How bold of him.

230
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,340
Empress Dowager!

231
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,340
Mother.

232
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,300
Why did you send this servant to stop me from entering?

233
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,039
If he is too much for you to handle,

234
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,660
I will gladly teach him a lesson or two for you.

235
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,359
Please, don't be mad at him.

236
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,319
It's me. I had a relapse lately. I need to rest.

237
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,359
I told Little Xun to stay guard outside.

238
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,040
He was just following my order.

239
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,400
And you won't let me see you?

240
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,880
You are trying to go against me at every corner nowadays.

241
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,880
All for the life of a mere servant.

242
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,839
Servant or not,

243
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
we are all equal in the face of death.

244
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,640
No matter how noble you are, if it's our fate,

245
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,740
none of us can escape from death.

246
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,280
No one can stop it.

247
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,079
- Let him go.
- Yes.

248
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,180
Thanks, Your Majesty.

249
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,700
All those letters you got from Northern Lin,

250
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,879
I have read each...

251
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,120
and every one of them.

252
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,680
Mother, why must you force my hand?

253
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,380
Your Majesty, I hope you remember what's most important.

254
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,000
It's the order I gave you.

255
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,479
We are running out of time.

256
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,560
You should see to it yourself.

257
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,600
Ling Yue, what's wrong?

258
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,800
You look absent-minded ever since I got back.

259
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,660
- Xiao Sha said...
- It's nothing.

260
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,879
You were gone for days.

261
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,479
I couldn't sleep well.

262
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,559
I am back now. You can finally have some sleep.

263
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,640
Of course. You are back and I can finally sleep better.

264
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,939
Your Highness, while you were at Prince Li's manor, did he mistreat you?

265
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:54,650
♫ The fragrance of loneliness, the past is dense, pouring down in my heart ♫

266
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:01,210
♫ The rain is emptying out, a willing tumultuous surge, pouring out into old dreams ♫

267
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,460
♫ Select a pot and ask the autumn wind— ♫

268
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,599
Princess? Princess?

269
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,340
Princess, you are blushing.

270
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,120
No, I am not.

271
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,039
That jerk is so arrogant.

272
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,919
He is cunning and paranoid.

273
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,180
I can't seem to understand him at all.

274
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,399
He said he has no interest in women.

275
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,820
But he carried me and hugged me.

276
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,159
Prince Li may be impressive, but he is no match for you.

277
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,640
Isn't that right?

278
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,839
Where is Lian Xin?

279
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,560
I don't know.

280
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,940
Maybe she is in the kitchen preparing your medicine.

281
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,420
It's not time to take the medicine yet.

282
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,320
What is she preparing?

283
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
Brother Xiao?

284
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,399
Your Highness, I intercepted this.

285
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,079
I interrogated the man Lian Xin was in contact with.

286
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,900
Lian Xin.

287
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,640
I see you as my dearest friend.

288
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,719
Be honest with me and tell me what's inside.

289
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,319
I will forgive you.

290
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,200
It's... That is my love letter to him.

291
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,399
It's too indecent for Your Highness' eyes.

292
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,740
Lian Xin, let Her Highness have a look.

293
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,759
You can prove to us you are not a spy.

294
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,919
Her Highness is a reasonable person. She will forgive you.

295
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,340
Your Highness, having an affair with an outsider means a death sentence.

296
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,580
I don't want to die.

297
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,700
Your Highness.

298
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,280
How is this happening?

299
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,239
Your Highness, I didn't do it!

300
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,719
I didn't do it!

301
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,300
Ling Yue, what do I do now? Help me!

302
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,379
Lian Xin, how could you?

303
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:50,320
You are spying for someone?

304
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,000
I saw you as my own sister. I am so disappointed in you!

305
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,279
Your Highness, I didn't do it!

306
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,319
I am not spying for anyone!

307
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,519
Please believe me! I am not sending anything!

308
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,220
Your Highness!

309
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,919
Your Highness, this is all my fault.

310
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,799
I shouldn't have helped her avoid the guards...

311
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,839
so she could meet with her lover.

312
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,519
Her Highness found out the lock had been tempered with.

313
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,719
She swapped out the letter with a fake.

314
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,519
Otherwise, you would have taken those secrets.

315
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,519
I didn't do it! I know nothing about the lock!

316
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,420
Please, spare me! I deserve justice!

317
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,500
What is this then?

318
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,100
Your Highness, he is a doctor.

319
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,999
He said that I knew no skill.

320
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,920
- I just wanted to learn.
- Nonsense!

321
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,219
Your Highness, I questioned the man she was meeting.

322
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:49,439
He claimed to be a merchant. He is no doctor.

323
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,039
As I told you, Princess Zhao Yun passed out in here.

324
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,920
Her acupuncture points were blocked.

325
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,999
I didn't do it! Your Highness, I didn't do it!

326
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,399
Lian Xin, come over here.

327
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,140
Place your hand in the water.

328
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,399
How is this happening? Your Highness!

329
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,540
I didn't do it!

330
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,519
I never touched this chest! I never touched it! Your Highness!

331
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,540
Did I say it will turn your hand blue?

332
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,439
No, but I am...

333
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,479
Your Highness, I swear I am loyal to you!

334
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,119
I swear, I was just meeting my lover!

335
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,639
I am not spying for anyone!

336
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,999
Please, believe me! Your Highness!

337
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,959
Ling Yue, explain to Her Highness.

338
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,079
You know all about me.

339
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,399
By the law of Qi, spying for the enemy...

340
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,300
means death.

341
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,380
Your Highness, I don't want to die!

342
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,320
Your Highness must be not be swayed.

343
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,839
Please, show mercy.

344
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,599
Lian Xin was just blinded by love for that man.

345
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,239
Seeing how she has always been serving you so loyally,

346
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,799
please, spare her life.

347
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,039
I beg of you!

348
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,360
Her Highness, I don't want to die!

349
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,319
Lian Xin, tell me.

350
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,039
Do you love that man?

351
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,300
Yes, I will do anything for him.

352
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,160
Very well.

353
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,959
In that case,

354
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,320
I shall not make it hard for you.

355
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,319
You are on your own now.

356
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,519
I will tell the officers to terminate your deed.

357
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,840
Leave. Go to the man you love.

358
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,020
Xiao Sha.

359
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,039
Send them out of Northern Lin.

360
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,840
Your Highness!

361
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,579
Your Highness! Your Highness!

362
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,760
Your Highness!

363
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,640
[Princess Manor]

364
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,959
Ling Yue.

365
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,359
Lian Xin.

366
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,839
I understand. You know the princess' position in this palace.

367
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,500
She has her own reason to be more cautious.

368
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,279
Take this as a blessing in disguise.

369
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,600
You can marry a good man.

370
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,800
It's better than a life of serving others.

371
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,300
I understand.

372
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,450
Farewell, Your Highness.

373
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,040
[Princess Manor]

374
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,420
I examined the body.

375
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,320
There is no clue to be found.

376
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,120
This is a receipt from the pawn shop.

377
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,660
If this is any ordinary receipt,

378
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,900
Li Zhiyuan wouldn't have hidden it so well.

379
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,280
Every pawn shop has its own logo.

380
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,839
Find out where this receipt came from.

381
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,720
Yes.

382
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,040
- Take this away.
- Yes.

383
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,680
Your Highness.

384
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,759
Minister of Personnel sent an invitation.

385
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,679
Three days from now is his 50th birthday.

386
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,000
He invites you to his feast.

387
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,180
- You may go now.
- Yes.

388
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,380
Three days from now?

389
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,660
It seems like getting rid of Li Zhiyuan...

390
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,180
makes them think I can't solve the case.

391
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,860
They are sending a warning.

392
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,240
Your Highness, this came from the emperor.

393
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,479
I checked General Fu's background.

394
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,559
He spends most of his time leading the troops.

395
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,639
He got promoted for his feats.

396
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,559
He never sided with any officials.

397
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,239
He is a generous and kind person.

398
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,440
He has quite a good reputation and is respected by many.

399
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,159
For the time being,

400
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,140
there is nothing unusual about him.

401
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,799
A man that wins everyone's heart?

402
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,580
A man without a flaw?

403
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,680
That is even more terrifying.

404
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,080
You are right. I will investigate further.

405
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,839
I learned about the book.

406
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,260
It might be inside the old Qin manor.

407
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,479
I remember you said that after the Qin family was executed,

408
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,559
the manor was granted to Minister Yu by the Imperial Court.

409
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Yes, the manor went through renovation into the Fort Yu we know.

410
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,399
However, it went through renovations and the Yu family lived there for so long.

411
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,639
Did no one realize there was a secret chamber?

412
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,839
Qin Yong is a genius,

413
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,380
the chamber he designed won't be found so easily.

414
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,700
But Fort Yu is heavily guarded.

415
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,120
The most pressing matter is to find a way to sneak in.

416
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,700
- Who is it?
- It's me, Chen Yu.

417
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,040
Come in.

418
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,479
Mistress, a man from the Ministry of Personnel sent an invitation.

419
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:58,980
Minister Yu's 50th birthday is closing in.

420
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,360
He invites me to perform at his feast.

421
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,660
But he just framed us and got us into jail.

422
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,740
We made him our enemy.

423
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,680
Chen Yu, not everyone can enter Minister Yu's fort.

424
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,900
We should thank him for this offer.

425
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,440
Whatever he is planning,

426
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,159
he may have his schemes, but I have my wits.

427
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,639
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

428
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,639
- Thank you.
- May you live long and well!

429
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,860
Welcome!

430
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,439
- Congratulations, Sir Yu.
- Thank you.

431
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,279
Thank you for coming.

432
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,239
- Thank you.
- The Royal Decree arrives!

433
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,480
Rewards from His Majesty.

434
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,479
"Minister Yu achieved great deeds,

435
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,399
contributed much for the nation. A thousand taels of gold...

436
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,319
and horse cart with scarlet paint."

437
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,919
Period.

438
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,800
- We are grateful, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

439
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,919
This way, Sir.

440
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,640
This way, Sir.

441
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,399
Rewards from the crown prince.

442
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,759
Rewards from the crown prince.

443
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,159
A pair of jade Kirins.

444
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,859
Five hundred taels of gold.

445
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,799
His Highness wishes Sir Yu a long and prosperous life.

446
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,519
We are grateful for Your Highness.

447
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,400
This way, Sir.

448
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,419
Rewards from Prince Li.

449
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:33,819
A precious sword from Prince Li.

450
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:35,259
A collection of valuable scrolls.

451
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,299
May Sir Yu live a long life.

452
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:38,859
Well and healthy.

453
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:40,719
We are grateful, Prince Li.

454
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,940
- This way, please.
- Please.

455
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,900
- This way, please.
- Please.

456
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
Make yourselves at home.

457
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,639
Kinship for brothers?

458
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,099
Li Zhiyuan just died.

459
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:01,520
Prince Li has no choice but to bow down to us.

460
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,239
What's wrong?

461
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,999
Miss, I am having a stomachache.

462
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,279
Can you show me to the washroom?

463
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,820
Well...

464
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,459
Please, take me there.

465
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:23,120
I don't want the show to be delayed.

466
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,080
Come with me.

467
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,700
Keep your eyes open.

468
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,699
Where did the lady go?

469
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:55,999
The other guests must have taken her away.

470
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,299
We are in Minister Yu's house.

471
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:58,839
No one would dare to sneak in.

472
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,059
You are right.

473
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:02,039
Stay here and wait for that lady.

474
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,799
The feast will start soon.

475
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,599
The show must not be delayed.

476
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,960
Yes.

477
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,279
The feast will be starting soon.

478
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,040
Where could she be?

479
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,100
If this isn't Miss Man Yao.

480
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,060
Why did you lock yourself up?

481
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,579
I wonder if Miss Man Yao... is searching for something in this house?

482
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,560
I am looking for a way out.

483
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,300
We have known each other for some time now.

484
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,760
Why are you avoiding me?

485
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,039
I found out about the secret in this place.

486
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,420
Of course, I would avoid you.

487
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,799
You hid a vault inside your house.

488
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,220
You plundered so much wealth.

489
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,219
Is the Yu family planning a mutiny?

490
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:41,860
You...

491
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,180
Miss Man Yao, you have sharp wit.

492
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,200
I have seen that myself.

493
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,940
If you get out eventually,

494
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,120
you can tell anyone about this secret.

495
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,300
But the contraption is sophisticated.

496
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,819
It won't be easy to escape.

497
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:08,500
Whatever Prince Li is capable of,

498
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,820
he has no choice but to see you die in here.

499
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,879
Master, Prince Li, and the crown prince are here.

500
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,640
The feast will start soon.

501
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,199
Rest well in behind those bars.

502
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,740
I will catch up with you later.

503
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,440
- Keep an eye on her.
- Yes.

504
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,119
May Sir Yu live long and prosper.

505
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,019
I heard Lady Chen Yu's skills with lute are the best in the capital.

506
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:16,019
But sadly, she offended Wuyou.

507
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:18,639
The dance with her music can no longer be seen.

508
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,919
What a shame.

509
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,779
A graceful melody with an elegant dance.

510
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:25,499
Together, they are breathtaking.

511
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,540
Separated, they are still brilliant.

512
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,199
General Fu is a wise man, I admire your wisdom.

513
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,039
But I think...

514
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,219
if two matters can be combined, it benefits all.

515
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:40,340
Otherwise, it will be disruption.

516
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,619
Indeed.

517
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:46,580
Today is my birthday celebration.

518
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,299
May I ask the gentlemen to be so kind...

519
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:52,580
and to let me ease the tension in the air?

520
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,279
Very well.

521
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,079
General Fu is a man of war.

522
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,119
Military matters come first for him.

523
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,420
But something needs to be let go.

524
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
It will be better for everyone.

525
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,280
I want to know if it is better for anyone.

526
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,580
Is it better for corruption

527
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,739
to get rid of rivals?

528
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:25,560
Or to plunder the people?

529
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:34,360
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

530
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:40,070
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

531
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,800
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

532
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,820
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

533
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:00,730
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

534
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:06,140
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

535
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:13,670
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

536
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:19,390
♫ I will still try with my utmost to make a home for us ♫

537
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:30,640
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

538
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,190
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

539
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:43,510
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

540
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:50,850
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

541
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:07,290
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

542
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:13,940
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

543
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:20,170
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

544
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:27,300
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

545
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:38,360
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
