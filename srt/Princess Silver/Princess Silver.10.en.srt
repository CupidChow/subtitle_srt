00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,200
[Episode 10]

2
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,100
You have been stuck in this manor for too long.

3
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,200
You even refused to go out with Prince Li.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm sorry that I had made you worry.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
But you are not well.

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,600
I wish to accompany you in the house.

7
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,800
I didn't mean to blame you.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
If you want to be filial to me,

9
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,900
go to Chengxi for me tomorrow.

10
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,000
What is it that you need that is so urgent?

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I heard that the Rare Item Chamber in Moon Embrace Teahouse in Chengxi...

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
specializes in selling one-of-a-kind treasures.

13
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,900
His Highness is a regular customer there as well.

14
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,000
I want to decorate the house in order to welcome him.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,800
I heard they just brought in some new high-quality treasures and jade ware.

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,600
But the servants don't know how to choose.

17
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,800
I understand.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,200
Tomorrow, I'll go there personally to pick them out.

19
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
Great.

20
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,200
But from their shapes, I think they were both female.

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,400
I'm different from you.

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,700
I have my own mission.

23
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,300
Why did they have a Western Qi tool in this manor?

24
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't you think that this is a very familiar scene?

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Wuyou, what are you thinking?

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
You have a faraway look.

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Are thinking about Man Yao?

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,300
Wuyu, you have monitored Man Yao before this, right?

29
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,600
I did it because I was too clueless back then.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
I thought that you'd be distracted from serious work because of a girl.

31
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,000
I never thought that you were actually a very calculative and lethal man.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
No only did you manage to defeat Yu Shihai,

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,300
you managed to heroically save a beauty too.

34
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,600
You are really good.

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Did you find anything when you monitored her?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
No, I found nothing.

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,200
Nothing aside from running into her repeatedly outside of the teahouse... and the House of Fragrance.

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
You were the one who said that there was something wrong with her.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,800
That's why I sent someone to keep an eye on the teahouse.

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
But in the end, I found nothing.

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Man Yao knows some martial arts skills.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Female from Western Qi.

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,200
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- General Fu.

44
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,400
You are loyal and are of valuable service to the emperor and the nation.

45
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,100
There's no need for these conventional courtesies.

46
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

47
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,100
General Fu, I've always admired you.

48
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,000
But you had rejected all of my previous invitations...

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,900
with the reason being you are still recovering from your wounds.

50
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,000
I wouldn't dare to reject your invitation.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's why I came here right after I recovered.

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
Great. After you.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
After you, Your Highness.

54
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,500
Go away.

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
You have great foresight and you are both brilliant and courageous.

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,300
You are the pillar of Northern Lin.

57
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,100
But lately, you haven't been to the court, claiming to be sick.

58
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,000
May I know the reason?

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,900
The Southern fringe is stable now.

60
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,800
His Majesty is now making preparations for the war against Wei.

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm just a general who leads the soldiers.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,500
I'm not very familiar with other affairs in the court.

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,100
So, I think it's better for me to recuperate...

64
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,000
and prepare myself for war.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,700
I am a grounded person and yet...

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,000
I get to meet with the capable general.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Looks like you have really given me the honor to meet you.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,500
- The honor is mine.
- General Fu.

69
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,800
If I make any other mistakes in the court from now on,

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,600
please be so kind to snap me out of it.

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,700
You are too kind, Your Highness.

72
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,800
It's my duty and my honor...

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,700
to be in service for His Majesty and Your Highness.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Cheers, General Fu.

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Cheers, Your Highness.

76
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,100
Thank you.

77
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
This tea is indeed very fragrant.

78
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,600
And this is a very exquisite tea set.

79
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I personally picked out this tea set.

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
This is the crème de la crème of tea sets.

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,700
Listening to you talking about tea and steeping tea...

82
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,000
makes me feel like drinking tea is a refined activity.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
You are too kind, General Fu.

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,600
You didn't come here today just to drink tea. Am I right?

85
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,100
Are you suggesting that I'm the kind of person...

86
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,900
who knows only how to fight and won't come here specifically for a cup of good tea?

87
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,600
I won't dare to do that.

88
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,700
You lead the army to protect the nation.

89
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,800
You abide by the laws and you are an intellect.

90
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,300
You are well-applauded as the scholar-genera in all of Northern Lin.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You are too kind.

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,500
Farewell.

93
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,200
Miss Sun, the goods in Rare Item Chamber are indeed delicate and unique.

94
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Everything here is exquisite.

95
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,100
I'm too dazzled by all of these.

96
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,200
Miss Sun, which one do you like?

97
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,000
Miss Sun.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,700
Miss Sun, please have a look.

99
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,500
This is a pair of newly-made icy jadeite jade cups.

100
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,400
They're made from the same block of jade that came from the Western region.

101
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,800
The jade cups have the same veins and they are totally the same.

102
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
There is only a pair of these in this Rare Item Chamber.

103
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,700
Just like a man and woman in this world.

104
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,100
When fate comes, they'll each meet their other halves.

105
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,700
Please let my master fulfill her desire...

106
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,300
to have this pair of jade cups.

107
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,600
You shall own these cups since it's the fate for you to find them.

108
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,800
Please go to the tearoom downstairs and wait for a while.

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,300
Ping.

110
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,100
Send these jade cups to Miss Sun's manor.

111
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,700
All right.

112
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,300
Miss, the tea leaves that you requested.

113
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,700
Thank you.

114
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,000
Miss Sun, we can leave now.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,300
All right.

116
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,500
Greetings, Prince Li.

117
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,200
Greetings, Prince Li.

118
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
My servant doesn't know the rules. I'm sorry for that.

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
It's fine.

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,900
I'll take my leave then.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Your Highness.

122
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
Unfortunately, our master is with a customer today.

123
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,900
Please wait while I inform her.

124
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,500
Who is it that is so important?

125
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,400
He is the General of Defence.

126
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,200
No need to inform her then.

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm the one who invited General Fu to come here for tea.

128
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
But my master didn't mention it.

129
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,500
Miss Sun, meeting by chance is a rare thing.

130
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,600
How about we go inside to have a cup of tea together?

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Sure.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
After you.

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,500
My Lady, Prince Li is here.

134
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,300
Tell him that I'm not in.

135
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,800
What is it? You want to hide from me again?

136
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,600
Greetings, Prince Li.

137
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
General Fu.

138
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,800
Why are you here?

139
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,200
I happened to pass by this place. So, I came in to have a cup of tea.

140
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,500
Nothing else.

141
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,800
If you need to talk to Miss Man Yao,

142
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,500
I'll take my leave now.

143
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,400
Slow down. I'm not here for anything important.

144
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,100
Meeting by chance is a rare thing.

145
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,700
How about you sit down and we can all have a cup of tea?

146
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,100
By the way, this is Miss Ya Li, the only daughter of Sir Sun,

147
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,400
the Central Secretary of Northern Lin.

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,000
After you, Miss Sun.

149
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,600
Cheers, Your Highness.

150
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,500
No need to be so polite, General Fu.

151
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,200
General Fu, the emperor and crown prince think highly of you.

152
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,000
You are the pillar of Northern Lin.

153
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,500
Since you have something to discuss with the general,

154
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
it'll be inconvenient for me to stay here. I shall take my leave then.

155
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,200
Man Yao, if you are not here,

156
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
who is going to serve us the tea?

157
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,599
No need to be so uptight. I don't have anything important to say.

158
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:05,100
I just feel like having a chat with the general suddenly.

159
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Drink up.

160
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,200
Coward.

161
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
Princess Rong Le will not eat you. Are you going to go in or not?

162
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
- Sir.
- Now I know.

163
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,800
This is the reason Wuyou let me out.

164
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,500
Good for him. He went to meet his lover.

165
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,600
And he set me up with this old, ugly, and fierce princess.

166
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
Look. He even asked that blockhead to keep an eye on me.

167
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,600
What are you looking at? And you! Why did you follow me along?

168
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Every day, you either pester Wuyou or are following me around.

169
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm following you around?

170
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm just afraid that you'll bully Princess Rong Le.

171
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
You like Wuyou, right?

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,900
If you like Wuyou, go to the owner of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

173
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,400
No use to come to this princess.

174
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,000
You... are such a dummy.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,900
I follow you because I'm afraid that you'll...

176
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,400
Stop right there!

177
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,500
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you going to go inside?

178
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,300
Go inside and ask Miss Ling Yue to get ready. The sooner the better.

179
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, sir.

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
Prince Chen, Princess Zhao Yun. Please go in now.

181
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
Captain Xiao of Princess Manor has personally come to welcome us.

182
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
Welcome.

183
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,300
Today, the tea that you prepared... is different from the usual.

184
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Even I have never tasted this kind of tea before.

185
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,800
General Fu, you are really well-respected.

186
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,300
I don't know anything about tea.

187
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,800
I just feel that although this tea is bitter,

188
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,000
the aftertaste of it is sweet in the mouth.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,400
To be able to give out such a comment...

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,000
shows that you are just being modest about your knowledge in tea.

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,200
I'm different from the privileged and the wealthy.

192
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm just a person from the lowest social strata.

193
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,200
I lead a vagabond life for a living.

194
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,400
So, drinking is just a way of survival.

195
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,500
I really don't know how to savor tea.

196
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Your life is just like this tea. There's sweetness after sweat.

197
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,900
That's why you can taste the flavor of this tea.

198
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Unlike somebody who has already tasted all the tea in this teahouse...

199
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,600
but never been able to taste the flavors.

200
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
It's just a thoughtless comment.

201
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,000
Of course, I'm in no way comparable to His Highness's knowledge in tea.

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,200
I just only understand the meaning of drinking tea after your explanation just now.

203
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
The tea that you chose is in accordance with the life of the drinker.

204
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Miss Man Yao, it's really admirable that your teahouse is so successful...

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,600
although you are the only one managing it.

206
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,800
But this time, what I have tasted...

207
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,600
is different from what you have tasted.

208
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,500
How about we listen to Miss Sun's thought on this?

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm not that smart.

210
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
I don't know how to distinguish the flavors of tea.

211
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,400
For me, all the tea in this world...

212
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,200
is bitter and astringent.

213
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
I don't know why...

214
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,400
but the tea today has a sour bite to it.

215
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,900
But it's all right.

216
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,400
It suits my feelings and my appetite today.

217
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,400
We have the same taste, Your Highness.

218
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
That's why we are always in perfect unison...

219
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
when we are on the battlefield.

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,700
In battle, you have great foresight and you are very decisive.

221
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,700
You can win easily even without me.

222
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,300
As for court, I hope that you have a clear look on things,

223
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,400
can distinguish right from wrong, and can go side by side with me.

224
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,300
As for other things,

225
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,700
if you have taken a fancy to the things that I like,

226
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,800
I would suggest you be careful with your actions.

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
Thank you for your advice.

228
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,600
But I think that the matter with the heart...

229
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
is all about fate and destiny.

230
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,800
It's not up to us.

231
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Miss Sun, be careful.

232
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,700
I'm fine. I'm too clumsy.

233
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,400
Please pardon me, Your Highness and General Fu.

234
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,300
I don't feel well suddenly.

235
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,700
I think I'll take my leave now.

236
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,800
- You are not going to check on her?
- No need.

237
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Just now, General Fu said that he's going back already, right?

238
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,400
Please be a gentleman and escort Miss Sun home.

239
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll take my leave now.

240
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
You should stay away from him.

241
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,300
You don't have any right to question the people I call friends.

242
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,900
Fu Chou is a complicated man.

243
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,500
For me, I think that you are more complicated than he is.

244
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Man Yao, are you saying this to provoke me on purpose?

245
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,700
Your Highness, I'll be leaving now.

246
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,900
Are you angry at me because of Fu Chou?

247
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,900
I won't dare to do that.

248
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,600
After you.

249
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,200
Miss Sun, the carriage is ready.

250
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,600
- You can go out first.
- Yes, Miss Sun.

251
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Do you have something to say, Miss Sun?

252
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,700
We have met once in the southern fringe.

253
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,000
How have you been, General Fu?

254
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,800
Miss Sun, you are...

255
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,700
Two years ago, I ran into a battle when I was in my hometown alone.

256
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,800
I want to thank you for saving me back then.

257
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,200
Madam.

258
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
I see.

259
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I was just merely helping out.

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm ashamed that I had forgotten about it while you never did.

261
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,400
After you saved me, you left immediately.

262
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
So, I never had the chance to thank you.

263
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,600
I feel very uneasy about it.

264
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,800
This is nothing. You don't have to take it to heart.

265
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,000
Miss Sun, let me escort you.

266
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,000
After you.

267
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,300
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

268
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,900
Well, this will do.

269
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,400
Safe journey, Miss Sun.

270
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,200
Princess Rong Le, long time no see.

271
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,400
Where are Ling Yue and Lian Xin?

272
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,000
Lian Xin has gone back to Western Qi to get married.

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,400
Our princess is worried that Ling Yue will be upset. So, she gave her a few days to rest.

274
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,300
Princess Rong Le, Wu Yu is the one who wanted to meet you today.

275
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,800
He insisted to come here to meet you.

276
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm here to pay a visit.

277
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,200
Why does this tea taste so bad?

278
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,300
Is it that bad?

279
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,100
Let me have a taste.

280
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
It's indeed bad.

281
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,300
This is incomparable to the tea in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

282
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,200
Princess Rong Le, let me bring you to the teahouse to taste their tea.

283
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,400
I heard that the Rare Item Chamber has some brand new dresses again.

284
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
And they are all imported.

285
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
We can't find those in the palace.

286
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,600
Let go and taste the tea there.

287
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,200
Our princess still has the flu. It's better for her to stay home.

288
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
Please go back, Princess Zhao Yun and Prince Chen.

289
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Princess Rong Le, you are still have the flu?

290
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,700
Our princess is not feeling well. Please go back, Princess Zhao Yun.

291
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,500
Princess Rong Le hasn't even rejected me.

292
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,800
How dare you reject me in her stead?

293
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Sir Xiao, this is the very first time I have invited Princess Rong Le.

294
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,600
Moreover, it's more reason for her to drink tea if she has flu.

295
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
Tea can relieve and detoxify the body.

296
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Maybe she'll get better after drinking tea.

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Don't you think so, Princess Rong Le?

298
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,800
Princess Zhao Yun is right.

299
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I don't really feel well today.

300
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Princess Zhao Yun. Prince Chen.

301
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
How about we go there...

302
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Princess Rong Le, today, we keep inviting you sincerely.

303
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,700
But you keep on rejecting us.

304
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,000
Is this how Western Qi treats your guest?

305
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,700
Princess Rong Le is not like this.

306
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,600
Princess Rong Le, let's go.

307
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,427
I have lost.

308
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,200
It's already so late. Aren't you going to go back yet?

309
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,800
It's not every day that I can play chess with you.

310
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,000
Can we play one more round?

311
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,300
All right.

312
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,200
Wuyou! Look who I've brought along.

313
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,700
Such a coincidence.

314
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,800
I've brought Princess Rong Le with me today.

315
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,700
Both of you can use this chance to have a chat.

316
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Greetings, Princess Rong Le. I am Man Yao.

317
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,100
Miss Man Yao, please rise.

318
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,000
Wuyou, come and have a talk with Princess Rong Le.

319
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Prince Chen, are you going to marry me?

320
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
I...

321
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,200
If you want to take off my mask today,

322
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,700
it means that you are going to marry me and be my husband.

323
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,700
I... I forgot.

324
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,400
Wuyu, this is a custom of Western Qi.

325
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,700
Only the groom can take off the mask.

326
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,150
You are too rude. Apologize to Princess Rong Le now.

327
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Quick.

328
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,500
I'm sorry, Princess Rong Le.

329
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,900
Wuyu, you are too rude.

330
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,500
Princess Rong Le, my brother has indeed offended you today.

331
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,800
Let me apologize to you in his stead.

332
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,200
Please forgive him.

333
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
That day, you purposely made things difficult for me in the great hall.

334
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,500
Now, Prince Chen is trying to take off my mask.

335
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,200
But he is not willing to marry me.

336
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,900
Are both of you trying to embarrass me on purpose?

337
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,600
I can't be sure that you didn't put anything into the tea...

338
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,200
that will make me embarrass myself.

339
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,100
Princess Rong Le, please don't mind them.

340
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,400
This is just a little game that we like to play.

341
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,100
Since Prince Li is inviting Princess Rong Le to drink tea,

342
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,700
it won't do for the rest of us to continue staying here.

343
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,900
If Prince Li and Princess Rong Le need anything, you can just call me anytime.

344
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,600
Wuyou, Princess Rong Le is still here.

345
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,800
Prince Li and Prince Chen, Princess Rong Le is still sick.

346
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,400
I'll have to bring her back first. Farewell.

347
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,300
Princess Rong Le.

348
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,600
Usually, Brother Wuyou is not like this.

349
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,200
Wuyou, how can you do that?

350
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
What's so good about Man Yao? Compared to Princess Rong Le...

351
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm going to visit the House of Fragrance.

352
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Wait for me.

353
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
It's better for you to go back now.

354
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,000
Do you really hate it that much to be with me?

355
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm doing this for your own good.

356
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,400
If you're really doing it for my own good, stop avoiding me already. All right?

357
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,200
Forget it.

358
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,300
It's already late anyway.

359
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,400
I'll see you next time.

360
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
I was so scared.

361
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,400
You did very well just now.

362
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
- Really?
- Really.

363
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,600
I never thought that you'd be so smart.

364
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,900
You have portrayed the princess well with your talk and your expression.

365
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,800
- Even I...
- No, Sir Xiao. It's nothing.

366
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,200
I just managed to learn how to be a little bit like her...

367
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,500
because I have served her for some time now.

368
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,800
But we still need to be careful from now onwards.

369
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Even now, my heart is still beating wildly.

370
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
It'll be all right.

371
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,300
Looks like I've guessed wrongly.

372
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,600
Looks like love can really make someone become dumb.

373
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Even the wise Wuyou has become its victim.

374
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
How is it possible that Princess Rong Le and Miss Man Yao...

375
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
are the same person?

376
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,300
They are totally different.

377
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,600
Princess Rong Le is a spoiled and wilful girl. And she's ugly.

378
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,100
Not only is Miss Man Yao pleasant-looking, but she is also very sophisticated.

379
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,000
They are totally different.

380
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Moreover, Princess Rong Le is so aloft and she is a pampered girl.

381
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,000
How can she be the master of a teahouse?

382
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Are you happy now? Your cleverness has overreached itself.

383
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Now, you have offended both parties.

384
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,600
It's been so long since I last saw you. I miss you like crazy.

385
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm going to visit Northern Lin and I'm going to travel fast.

386
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,800
I'll be meeting you in ten days' time.

387
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,400
Long Yue, I'm not dreaming. Right?

388
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,500
My brother is coming to Northern Lin to meet me.

389
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,600
I just received this message from the kite.

390
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,500
It's definitely true.

391
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,200
Long Yue, take a look at me. Have I changed in any way?

392
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,100
- Did I become thinner? I didn't... rest well lately.
- Enough.

393
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,400
You are still the same. And you are still beautiful.

394
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,600
Every time he writes to me, he's always so worried.

395
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,100
He feels that I didn't eat well, didn't take good care of myself, and didn't take my medicine.

396
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,000
Prince Li often comes here to look for you.

397
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,200
You have to be careful. Don't spill the beans.

398
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I understand.

399
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,230
A messenger from Western Qi has sent us a letter of credence.

400
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,500
The Emperor of Qi is coming here personally to sign the treaty with me.

401
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,600
After that, we'll have no worries for the upcoming war against Wei.

402
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,000
I'll entrust you to facilitate this meeting.

403
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,300
But we are still undecided about the marriage alliance.

404
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,400
I'm afraid that it'll affect the alliance between us.

405
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,600
We are almost done with the preparations for the war against Wei.

406
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,500
This alliance is a must.

407
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,200
I will not let anything affect this alliance.

408
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,500
What is your plan then?

409
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,200
Western Qi has chosen Wuyou for this marriage alliance.

410
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,400
So, of course, we need to give Wuyou a push first.

411
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,600
Brother, please advise Wuyou not to be so headstrong.

412
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,100
But with his personality...

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,200
If he refuses to do it no matter what,

414
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,900
we'll think of another way then.

415
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,200
I heard that Princess of Western Qi is interested in Prince Chen.

416
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,300
Since young, Wuyou has cared more about...

417
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,400
Wuyu than he cares for himself.

418
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,200
All right, I understand.

419
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
General Fu.

420
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,500
I had searched far and wide for this.

421
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,600
I hope that it will be to your liking.

422
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,600
Great sword.

423
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,300
Crown Prince must have heard about your meeting with Prince Li.

424
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
He's getting antsy.

425
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
- You may go out now.
- Yes.

426
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,800
When will the Emperor of Qi reach Zhongshan?

427
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,900
He'll reach here within three days.

428
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,500
You may go out now.

429
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,900
Yes.

430
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,800
Emperor of Qi is reaching soon. What is your plan?

431
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
You know what my intention is.

432
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I will not accept this marriage.

433
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,400
Back then, His Majesty had his own difficulties too with your mother.

434
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,800
If he didn't marry Fu Yuan,

435
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,600
Northern Lin today would not be like this.

436
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,200
You don't have to talk about the past with me.

437
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,000
You are not here today just to pass on a decree telling me to accept the marriage alliance, right?

438
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,200
Your father has exhausted himself for this alliance.

439
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,700
He's not as healthy as before anymore.

440
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,400
If you are really unwilling,

441
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,200
let Wuyu marry her instead.

442
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:53,799
I don't want.

443
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,100
Father is being too partial.

444
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Same with you too, Uncle.

445
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,400
I knew that you were eavesdropping on us.

446
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Uncle.

447
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
No matter it's me or Wuyu, we won't accept this marriage.

448
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Officially, this alliance is fake. We just want to strengthen our forces.

449
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,800
Because of some dignity, we want to put the people in a dire situation.

450
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,200
And personally, we have feelings and everyone has their own aspirations.

451
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,800
I don't want to be like His Majesty who can make a bargain with marriage.

452
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't want to be unfaithful like him.

453
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
You are right, Wuyou.

454
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,400
Wuyou, have you fallen in love with someone?

455
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,600
I...

456
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,000
I have things to do. I have to leave.

457
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,800
Both of you can continue.

458
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Looks like I've guessed correctly.

459
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,000
Actually, His Majesty has already made a plan for you.

460
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,400
If anything untoward happens in the war against Wei,

461
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,800
he'll let all of you go back to the three states in the Southern fringe.

462
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,700
After the treaty with Western Qi,

463
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,100
the Central Secretary, Sir Sun Jizhou will be sent back to the Southern region.

464
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,100
The prominent family of Sun has been taking roots in the three states for a long time.

465
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,800
He can best assist you to settle down in the Southern region if needed.

466
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,800
How is His Majesty?

467
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,400
If His Majesty knew that you were asking about him,

468
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,700
of course, he'd be so full of glee that all of his illness would be gone.

469
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,600
The arrival of the Emperor of Qi!

470
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
- Greetings, Princess Rong Le.
- Greetings, Princess Zhao Yun.

471
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Princess Rong Le, you have a sore throat.

472
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,400
So, I have brought along some sore throat medicine for you.

473
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,200
Thank you, Princess Zhao Yun. Have a seat.

474
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,800
Princess Rong Le, you are so capable. You are even good at wood-carving.

475
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,600
I just learned it.

476
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,400
This looks easy, but it's actually quite difficult to carve.

477
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,200
It's slippery if your hands are wet. I've already ruined many of them.

478
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Princess Rong Le, I have never seen you so happy before.

479
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,600
Are you very close with your brother?

480
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,100
That's right. We don't have any other siblings.

481
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,000
So, it's just me and him on our own.

482
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,600
My brother told me that when I was young,

483
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,400
he made me a box of wood sculptures to play with.

484
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
I'm so envious of you.

485
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,400
Unlike me who has no other siblings.

486
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,300
You have Wuyou and Wuyu, right?

487
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,200
Actually, I'm quite scared of Wuyou.

488
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,400
And that Wuyu likes to bully me all the time.

489
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Princess Rong Le, if only you could be my real sister.

490
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,000
If you marry Wuyou, you'll be my real sister-in-law.

491
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,800
Princess Rong Le, did I say something wrong?

492
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
Actually, Wuyou is very kind.

493
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,900
He always sends someone to take care of me and protect me.

494
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,600
But he never says it out loud.

495
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Princess Rong Le, don't ever fall in love with Wuyu.

496
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,400
He is just a heartbreaker.

497
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,600
Why do I feel like compared to Wuuou,

498
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,600
you are more worried about that dummy?

499
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,400
That's not true. I'm just worried that he'll bully you.

500
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,600
Princess Rong Le, can you teach me how to carve?

501
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,900
Be careful, Princess Zhao Yun. Don't cut your hand.

502
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,000
Princess Zhao Yun, if you like it,

503
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
just ask someone to send it to your manor.

504
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
Don't be like Princess Rong Le. She has so many cuts on her hands.

505
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,600
Ling Yue.

506
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,000
No. I want to personally make one to be given as a gift too.

507
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Even if I'm not good at it, at least I have put my heart into it.

508
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Just like Princess Rong Le's regards for her brother.

509
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,600
I have to do it myself.

510
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,700
I'll be fine.

511
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,800
Princess Rong Le, His Majesty is going to come to the manor soon.

512
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,600
It's better if we keep Princess Zhao Yun away for a while.

513
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,000
She has a close relationship with Prince Li.

514
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,800
I'm worried that there will be troubles.

515
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,360
But I feel pity for Princess Zhao Yun because she is always alone.

516
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,000
She is still young. It'll be fine for her even if she makes some mistakes.

517
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
I have always treated her like a younger sister.

518
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,400
I can't bear to see her sad.

519
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
What is it, Princess Zhao Yun?

520
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,600
It's nothing.

521
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,600
Princess Rong Le, is this really your brother?

522
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,300
Why do I feel that it looks like Wuyou?

523
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,600
Long live the Emperor!

524
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,000
Rise.

525
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

526
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,200
Have a seat, Emperor of Qi.

527
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,400
Thank you, Emperor of Northern Lin.

528
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,600
You came here despite the long distance.

529
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm really touched by your sincerity.

530
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,000
From now on, we'll work in unity...

531
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,200
to defend against our enemies.

532
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,800
You are very courageous and full of compassion.

533
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,700
We'll work well together.

534
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,500
Although you are young,

535
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,800
I feel that we can get along very well.

536
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,900
I built this nation with blood and sweat.

537
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,100
According to our custom, when we have visits from honored guests,

538
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,600
we'll welcome them with a hunting party.

539
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,000
What do you think about that?

540
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,600
My warriors are brave and are good shooters as well.

541
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,700
How about we let our warriors compete against each other?

542
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,400
Excellent.

543
00:39:52,772 --> 00:39:56,199
Those with the most hunt will be rewarded handsomely.

544
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,800
The same goes for me.

545
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,200
Long live the Emperor!

546
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,500
Princess Rong Le. Princess Rong Le.

547
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,300
His Majesty has to go to the palace for a feast before he can come here.

548
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,100
I know. Ling Yue, look at me. Do I look well?

549
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,600
Yes. Everything looks good. You look very well

550
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
and your dress is beautiful, too.

551
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,300
Is the room for my brother ready yet?

552
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,800
Don't worry, Princess Rong Le. I have already cleaned it up.

553
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,400
As soon as I heard that His Majesty was permitted to stay in this manor,

554
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,300
I have been cleaning it up for him.

555
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,200
Princess Rong Le. His Majesty is here.

556
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,700
- Brother!
- Rong Le.

557
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,000
I missed you.

558
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
Quick. Let me take a look at you.

559
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Look at you. You have become thinner.

560
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,600
But at least, you look well.

561
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
Did you take your medicine on time?

562
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,700
Yes, Ling Yue will make sure that I take it every day.

563
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,200
How are you feeling, Brother?

564
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,000
Why do I feel that you don't look so well?

565
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,100
This is an exhausting journey.

566
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,600
How can I possibly look well?

567
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,100
You shouldn't have come here in person.

568
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,500
This is a long and arduous journey.

569
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,200
The world is in chaos now.

570
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,000
And you are not feeling well either.

571
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm here in one piece, right?

572
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Moreover, this alliance is very important to Western Qi.

573
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,800
Besides, I wanted to come here to see you.

574
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,500
I'm worried that they'll bully you here.

575
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,800
With you here, who dares bully me?

576
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
By the way, I'm just one step away from The Book of Mountains and Rivers.

577
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
That's great.

578
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,300
Compared to the book,

579
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,800
your safety is more important to me.

580
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,400
Believe me. Give me some time.

581
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
I promise to let you do as you please,

582
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
to do anything you want...

583
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,200
and to marry whoever you want.

584
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,100
I know you are worried about me.

585
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,000
But you have to believe in me, too.

586
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,700
I'll definitely keep my promises to you.

587
