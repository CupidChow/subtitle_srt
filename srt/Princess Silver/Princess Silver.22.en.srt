[Episode 22]

2
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,169
Our marriage has always been a lie.

3
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:41,265
You know that you'll use me more than once.

4
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,919
So, why do you keep on lying to yourself...

5
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,080
and why do you want to make things difficult for me?

6
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,605
Please go out.

7
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:58,384
I want to be by myself for a while.

8
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:24,600
Rong Le! Rong Le.

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,542
Don't scare me, Rong Le!

10
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:43,311
Sir. Sir?

11
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:48,987
What's wrong with my wife? When can she wake up?

12
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:53,721
General Fu, your wife's illness is very rare.

13
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:58,242
Although her pulse is weak, it's not so weak that she'll lose consciousness.

14
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:01,420
I think the reason she fainted is a psychological factor.

15
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,700
This kind of illness can only be treated on the mental plane.

16
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,309
I can only give her some medicine for nourishment...

17
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,627
and help her to recuperate.

18
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:13,125
As for whether or not she can wake up,

19
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,973
it'll be up to fate to decide.

20
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:23,543
Thank you, Sir.

21
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,164
- See him out.
- Yes, General Fu.

22
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,040

31
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:17,896
When Brother Wuyou rushed there to save Princess Rong Le today,

32
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:22,936
I'd never seen him so anxious and agitated before.

33
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:27,090
I think Brother Wuyou still cares about Princess Rong Le.

34
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,370
It's impossible for him to fall in love with Miss Sun in Qingzhou.

35
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:33,433
Brother Wuyou won't shilly-shally like that.

36
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:37,966
Wuyou's mind is not something that we can comprehend.

37
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:41,134
I think there must be some misunderstanding between them.

38
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:43,420
When I went fishing with Princess Rong Le today,

39
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,135
she was so shaken when she heard that Brother Wuyou was coming back.

40
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:50,385
She still cares about Brother Wuyou for sure.

41
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:53,604
They love each other, but they cannot be together.

42
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:56,105
It's so unfortunate.

43
00:04:57,873 --> 00:05:00,453
It's hard to find love that reciprocates this world.

44
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:04,030
They love each other but they cannot be together.

45
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,055
It would have been better off if they had remained as strangers since the beginning.

46
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,212
So, we can't make the same mistake as them.

47
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:16,471
We have to be together forever until we are old and gray.

General Fu has never left your side for these three days.

Are you all right?

112
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:11,413
Ling Yue told me that you had a fight with General Fu.

113
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:16,048
At first, I thought that the General's manor would be my home for the rest of my life.

114
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,607
Now, it looks like I'm too naive.

115
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,328
This world is so big and yet I belong in nowhere.

116

I don't know where my home is.

Don't say that, Miss.

118
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,110
You have a home for sure.

119
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:32,292
But you've just forgotten about where it is.

120

That's right.

121
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,559
I dreamed about Yu's Fort before this.

122
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,134
That place has become clearer and clearer to me.

123
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:41,083
Have you ever thought of going into that fort again?

124
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:43,738

There's nothing wrong with her.

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,079
But she went to Moon Embrace Teahouse this morning with Miss Chen Yu...

Yes, General Fu.

I thought that you were never coming back.

144
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,761
I thought that I'd never see you again in this lifetime.

145
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:29,059
I won't leave this place.

Does that mean that...

147
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,761
you'll forgive me?

148
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:37,789
I'll keep my promise.

149
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,381
In another half a year's time, everything will come to an end.

150
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:50,855
Is it going to be just a cold and frigid agreement between us?

151
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:55,378
I hope that you won't forget about the promise that you made.

152
00:17:57,838 --> 00:17:59,598
I remember.

153
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:03,700
I'll respect your wish and I won't force you.

I'll part ways with you and set you free. And I won't...

And I won't go back on my words.

I'm tired. I want to rest.

I'll go with you tomorrow.

162
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,094
Since I've already made a promise to you, for the next half of a year,

163
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,971
I'll abide by my duties as the general's wife.

164
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,978
Who is she?

165
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:41,519
- Greetings, Prince Zhenbei.
- Greetings, Prince Zhenbei.

166
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:42,739
No need to be so polite.

167
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,040
The things that I dislike the most are those pompous, grandiose titles.

168
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,039
Those "Your Highnesses," "Princesses" or "Princes."

169
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,845
Not only are they meaningless, they are so tiring.

170
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:56,195
They are just titles given to me by others.

171
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,479
I chose to have a gathering at Moon Embrace Teahouse today...

172
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,566
because this place is refreshing and elegant.

173
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,948
If we talk about titles here,

174
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:06,899
it'll be disappointing.

175
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:08,829
You are right.

176
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,983
The essence of drinking tea is all about equality.

177
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:17,439
Because of a cup of tea, we put those wealth, ranks, statuses, and superiorities behind us.

178
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:20,439
We'll discard all of that and treat each other as equal.

179
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,239
Good. Then we'll treat each other...

180
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,272
as equal today and call each other by names, how about that?

181
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:27,746
You can just address me as Qianyi.

182
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:31,460
So, everything that is hard in this world is just an easy feat for you.

183
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,920
If everything is easy for me, then everything is happy for you.

184
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:41,052
As for Fu Chou, it sounds like the word revenge.

185
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:43,479
That's not good. We'll call you General Fu instead.

186
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,879
Let's not talk about revenge all the time.

187
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,720
That's too ferocious.

188
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,224
Come, have a seat.

189
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,919
- After you.
- After you.

190
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,561
Thank you.

191
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:25,742
Rong Le, you don't like this tea?

192
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:29,559
This is the Phoenix Narcissus tea that I brought from Chen.

193
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,537
And I cooked it myself.

194
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:34,554
Is there anything wrong with it?

195
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,115
Don't misunderstand, Qianyi.

196
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,837
This is a high-quality tea.

197
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,919
But tea is a type of high-quality tree.

198
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,999
It took sustenance from the mountains and rivers.

199
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,479
So they need to be steeped with natural mineral water.

200
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,554
But for this narcissus tea, you need to steep it with dew water...

201
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:50,060
in order to bring out the essence of the tea.

202
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,049
Looks like you are quite knowledgeable in the art of tea.

203
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,919
Unfortunately, I didn't bring any dew water with me today.

204
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,450
Looks like I've wasted a good-quality tea.

205
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,340
No need to be so regretful.

206
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:06,741
Since you are here in the teahouse, you will have your dew water.

207
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:09,509
I'm sure that the owner here won't mind about it.

208
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:11,509
Owner?

209
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:15,070
Are you saying that you know the owner of this teahouse?

210
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,669
Not only do I know her,

211
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,049
even you know her too.

212
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,540
So, the guest that I've invited is actually...

213
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,896
the owner of this teahouse that we are in.

214
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,712
Rong Le, you are so full of surprises.

215
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,380
That day in Qingliang Lake,

216
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,902
I thought that you were just a daughter of an official.

217
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:37,199
I never thought that you'd turn out to be the elder princess of Western Qi.

218
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,759
After that, when I saw that you were saved by Prince Li,

219
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,928
I thought that you were Prince Li's wife.

220
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,551
But I never thought that your husband was actually General Fu.

221
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,401
Since you are the owner of this teahouse,

222
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,780
I'm sure that you've spent a lot of happy moments here.

223
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,623
I'm sure that this teahouse contains your love story, right?

224
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,261
General Fu, from your expression,

225
00:23:04,261 --> 00:23:07,410
you must be thinking about some sweet memories from the past.

226
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,059
I never thought that a warrior like you...

227
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:13,607
would feel shy when it comes to love.

228
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:16,699
I'll get the dew water.

229
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,320
Thank you.

230
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,928
Please excuse me for a moment.

231
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:23,511
Rong Le.

232
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,800
You haven't recovered fully yet.

233
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,330
Tell me where the dew water is. I'll get it.

234
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,039
There's a very specific way to cook dew water.

235
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,354
It's better if I cook it myself. I'll bring it over when it's done.

236
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:53,395
Your Highness, I didn't protect you well enough...

237
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:55,728
when you were at Qingliang Lake that day.

238
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,949
I've failed my duty.

239
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:00,789
Not only will I not blame you for it,

240
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:04,022
I wish to thank you for it.

241
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:07,838
Thank me for it? Why?

242
00:24:07,838 --> 00:24:10,938
If it wasn't for you and your troops that came late,

243
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:15,919
I wouldn't have the chance to get to know about my two saviors.

244
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,360
You mentioned about two saviors.

245
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,860
Besides Rong Le, the other one is...

246
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,960
The other one is Prince Li.

247
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,579
That day, not only had Prince Li saved Rong Le,

248
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:31,667
he even sent someone to protect me and to send me back to my inn.

249
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:34,158
If it wasn't for these two saviors,

250
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:37,776
I would have lost my life.

251
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,159
That's why I've prepared a banquet in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

252
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,822
I want to thank my two saviors properly.

253
00:24:45,822 --> 00:24:49,886
One has to repay others' help no matter how small it is.

254
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:52,939
Although you and your troops were late that day,

255
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:55,815
you had helped me take care of the aftermath of the incident.

256
00:24:55,815 --> 00:24:59,901
I should thank you as well.

257
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:04,049
So, are you saying that Prince Li will be here today as well?

258
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,627
Yes.

259
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:08,520
I think he will be here soon.

260
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,571
General Fu, why do you look so pale all of a sudden?

261
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,458
Rong Le hasn't recovered fully yet.

262
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,187
I'm worried that it'll be hard for her to move around. Let me check on her.

263
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,139
Yes, you should keep a close eye on her.

264
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:27,099
You have such an exotic lady as your wife.

265
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,093
You should treasure her well.

266
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:33,198
You are very right. Please excuse me.

267
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,577
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

268
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:42,115
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

269
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:50,706
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

270
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:55,207
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

271
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:59,239
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

272
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,949
♫ You are keeping me out with your care ♫

273
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:08,434
♫ Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

274
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,421
Rong Le.

275
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:18,285
Are you all right?

276
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,775
Is your hand all right?

277
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:24,615
Your hand is so red.

278
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,813
Don't worry, my hand is fine.

279
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,079
Prince Li. Finally, you are here.

280
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:44,563
Greetings, Prince Li.

281
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,980
Why are all of you standing here?

282
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,100
Did something happen?

283
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,459
Your Highness, my wife's hands were scalded by the teapot just now.

284
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:59,190
So I need to bring her back to my manor now.

285
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:02,824
It's unfortunate that we won't be able to drink tea together today.

286
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:04,706
I'll have to take a rain check.

287
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,399
I have to take an early leave from your banquet today.

288
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,660
It's very rude of me.

289
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,219
If you don't mind, please come to my manor next time.

290
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,852
I'll treat you cordially.

291
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:24,928
Rong Le. Am I right?

292
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:26,644
Yes.

293
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,260
Your Highness, farewell.

294
00:27:37,674 --> 00:27:41,638
Prince Li, farewell.

295
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:50,563
Let's go.

296
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,547
Looks like this pot of good tea was prepared specifically for me and you.

297
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:08,875
Would you give me the honor to drink some tea with you?

298
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:11,932
Of course, I wouldn't leave without having tea first.

299
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:14,478
- After you.
- After you.

300
00:28:29,063 --> 00:28:33,159
General Fu, in order to thank Princess Rong Le for her tea today,

301
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,102
Prince Zhenbei has specifically asked me to give this to you.

302
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:38,282
Prince Zhenbei is too kind.

303
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,569
General Fu, please pardon me.

304
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,955
Prince Zhenbei has asked me to hand this gift to Princess Rong Le herself.

305
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
Prince Zhenbei has picked out this gift himself.

306
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,865
He hopes that you'll like it.

307
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,836
Send my thanks to Prince Zhenbei.

308
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:04,625
Prince Zhenbei might look bold and free-spirited but he's actually a shrewd person.

309
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:08,120
He's not someone you can call a friend just after meeting him by chance.

310
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,110
From now on, it's better for you to be careful when you are with him.

311
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:16,580
You worry too much.

312
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,790
I hope you are right.

313
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:24,207
No matter what kind of a person he is or what purpose he has,

314
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:28,743
he had said something today that had struck deep within me.

315
00:29:28,743 --> 00:29:30,730
What is it?

316
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:34,979
He said that I've seen so many battles and deaths...

317
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:38,584
and yet I am visibly moved by love.

318
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:46,381
Actually, I used to think that I could face death with equanimity.

319
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:48,674
But I never thought that there would be a person...

320
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:53,135
in this world who can put me in an awkward predicament...

321
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:54,927
and take away my composure.

322
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:07,989
The water that is used in this tea is the dew water from Rong Le's possession.

323
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,110
She had cooked it herself.

324
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,595
It's unfortunate that I didn't get to let her steep my tea for me.

325
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:17,134
What do you think about this tea, Prince Li?

326
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,803
A cup of tea that is steeped in the same water...

327
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:25,325
and with the same tea leaves will taste different...

328
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,023
for different kinds of people.

329
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:30,968
Of course. What you taste from the tea...

330
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:34,168
will depend on what you feel when you drink it.

331
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:38,109
So, what are you feeling right now?

332
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,577
My heart is indeed trapped by someone.

333
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:48,866
I think that person must be Princess Rong Le.

334
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:51,957
If it's indeed Rong Le,

335
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:55,868
why would I sit here and drink tea with you now?

336
00:30:55,869 --> 00:31:00,266
Then, are you saying that I'm that someone?

337
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:04,500
I've always hated those insincere...

338
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,583
guesses and probings in the court.

339
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:12,639
That day in Qingliang Lake, you were willing to entrust your life to Rong Le...

340
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,545
of who you'd just met.

341
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:15,915
So, I'm willing to believe that...

342
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:19,549
you are not a pretentious and hypocritical person.

343
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:23,981
Thus, I'm willing to be straightforward with you today.

344
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:27,272
I have a question for you today.

345
00:31:27,273 --> 00:31:30,756
I've heard that you are an unruly and unbridled person.

346
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:33,879
Now that I've talked to you, it is indeed true.

347
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,718
I am the kind of person who can be more pretentious...

348
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,599
if I meet a hypocrite.

349
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,491
When I meet an honest and frank person like you,

350
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:44,116
I can be very forthright, too.

351
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:49,699
Prince Li, please don't hesitate to ask me any questions that you want.

352
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,677
It's just a simple question.

353
00:31:51,678 --> 00:31:55,487
You came all the way from Chen to Zhongshan...

354
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:58,439
to form a marriage alliance with Northern Lin.

355
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,436
What's your purpose for doing so?

356
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:03,555
Are you going to sit back...

357
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:08,483
and reap the benefits while letting us do all the dirty work?

358
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:11,543
Before this, I heard that you'd put down the rebellion in...

359
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:14,005
the southern border with just a snap of your fingers.

360
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:18,279
So, you know better than me that all is fair in war.

361
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:20,679
Since you want to go into war against Wei,

362
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,999
I'm sure that you've already...

363
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,920
thought of the strategies to strengthen your defense.

364
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,622
All right. That's all I have to ask.

365
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:34,104
If you have any questions for me, you can go ahead and ask me, too.

366
00:32:34,104 --> 00:32:36,869
I've invited you here today because...

367
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,479
first, I want to thank you for saving my life at Qingliang Lake that day.

368
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:46,049
And second, I did have something that I wished to ask you.

369
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:48,780
Please go ahead.

370
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,594
Actually, compared to the war that was triggered by setting up new territory,

371
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,416
I'm more interested in the benevolence policy used by Northern Lin.

372
00:32:56,417 --> 00:33:01,650
I heard that before this, Lady Yun and Sir Qin Yong,

373
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,439
and all the measures regarding this transformation...

374
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,359
are recorded in a book named "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

375
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,298
Have you ever seen this book before?

376
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:17,550
This book is the fruit of my mother and my teacher's lifelong efforts.

377
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,083
It is their legacy.

378
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:25,259
This book is meant to bring peace to the country so that the people can live a serene life.

379
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:27,815
But they never thought that during that same year,

380
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:31,101
that book would cause such irreparable disaster.

381
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:34,242
And so many were dragged into it.

382
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:38,436
Even I had once paid a hefty price...

383
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:40,958
in order to get that book.

384
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,834
So, the real reason you are here is to get your hands on that book.

385
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:51,039
Then you have to forgive me for keeping it a secret from you.

386
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,280
You've misunderstood.

387
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,319
It's true that I want to get that book to help my people.

388
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,639
But I don't plan to possess it and I don't plan to take it by force.

389
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,877
Then I hope that you'll never forget what you've said today.

390
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,164
Remember your original intention for your people.

391
00:34:10,326 --> 00:34:13,859
But I still have another question for you.

392
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,702
Are you going to ask about me and Rong Le's past?

393
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:24,262
I can see that you love each other very much.

394
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,599
You are such a forthright person.

395
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,399
Why do you choose to be bound by the rules of etiquette?

396
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,559
If I get to meet my one true love,

397
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,760
I'll smash through all shackles to give her a life of happiness.

398
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,484
Maybe it's just like you've said.

399
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:45,751
You want to initiate the People-Based Transformation.

400
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:49,684
But you don't plan to possess that book. Both are the same.

401
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:53,654
I love her but it doesn't mean that I have to possess her.

402
00:34:54,945 --> 00:35:00,071
All right. I hope that you won't regret it for the rest of your life.

403
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:05,188
By the way, that day in Qingliang Lake, Princess Zhao Yun had gotten hurt because of me, too.

404
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,960
How is she doing?

405
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,818
She is fine. Thank you for asking.

406
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:17,213
Great. I'll make sure to visit her next time to thank her personally.

407
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:18,631
Cheers.

408
00:35:33,654 --> 00:35:36,639
Your Highness, the cut on your hand is very deep.

409
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,768
Although I've already changed your dressing twice,

410
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,942
make sure that it stays dry.

411
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:44,509
Thank you, sir.

412
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,274
Wuyou, you never got hurt even when you went into war in Qingzhou.

413
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:50,803
But you've gotten yourself hurt when you saw her in Zhongshan.

414
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:53,618
Why do both of you cross paths so often?

415
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,295
I heard that Prince Zhenbei had invited you for tea...

416
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,685
in Moon Embrace Teahouse together with Fu Chou and Man...

417
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:04,914
Have a drink, Wuyou.

418
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,420
What do you think about Prince Zhenbei?

419
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:13,361
I really admire him because he is very forthcoming.

420
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:15,169
But he is a very enigmatic man.

421
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,490
We have to guard against him.

422
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,224
I want to get in touch more often with him.

423
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:24,030
By the way, have you told father about you and Zhao Yun's marriage?

424
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,206
I've been wanting to tell him since I came back from Qingzhou.

425
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:28,199
One time, I almost told him.

426
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,994
But then, you appeared.

427
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:34,000
As soon as he saw you, he didn't have time for me anymore.

428
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:38,189
If you procrastinate too long, it'll never happen. Don't delay it anymore.

429
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:41,842
Your Highness, Miss Sun is here.

430
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:43,522
Bring her in.

431
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,700
Greetings, Prince Li. Greetings, Prince Chen.

432
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,340
Sister Yali, you came right on time.

433
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,399
Wuyou has just talked about playing chess and here you are.

434
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,020
Both of you have quite the same mind.

435
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,503
You are joking around again.

436
00:36:59,504 --> 00:37:02,548
I heard that Prince Li has hurt his hand.

437
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:04,788
So, I've brought him some ointment.

438
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,906
It's just a small wound. Nothing serious.

439
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:09,329
Thank you for taking the trouble.

440
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,079
Wuyou, continue with your chat.

441
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,460
Woodenhead, let's go.

442
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,916
- This is...
- Yali.

443
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,500
Don't bother with the formalities.

444
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,904
You've never visited me at night.

445
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:28,074
You must be here today because you have something to tell me.

446
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:29,691
Please go ahead and do so.

447
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:32,925
Looks like I can never hide anything from you.

448
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:36,825
I'm here today because I need your help.

449
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:39,999
The empress has invited royal families and nobles...

450
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,760
for a flower-viewing in her backyard tomorrow.

451
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:45,959
I would like to invite you along.

452
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,150
Since you like flowers,

453
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,178
let's go together then.

454
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:58,777
For tomorrow's banquet, I'll leave you to be in charge of everything.

455
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:03,079
Your Majesty, I won't let you down.

456
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,330
Although this banquet is just a banquet to let Prince Zhenbei choose his bride,

457
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,864
a lot is at stake in this banquet.

458
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:13,900
Nothing can go wrong.

459
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:20,013
Do you have any ideas on who will be Prince Zhenbei's choice?

460
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:23,239
I... hear that the daughter of Sir Sun,

461
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:26,999
Sun Yali, always comes here to visit you.

462
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,320
You drink tea together and both of you clicked well together.

463
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,741
Sun Yali is the most gifted lady in Zhongshan.

464
00:38:33,742 --> 00:38:36,913
She is proficient in anything from playing music to drawing.

465
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:40,634
What do you think about Sun Yali?

466
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:44,859
Yali... is indeed a gentle and refined lady.

467
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:46,839
And she is intelligent and well-reasoned.

468
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,938
I'll hate to part with her...

469
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:54,197
if she has to be married to Chen.

470
00:38:54,197 --> 00:38:58,385
I think she's more suitable for Prince Li.

471
00:38:58,385 --> 00:39:00,289
I heard from Wuyu that...

472
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,006
Wuyou and Sun Yali had gotten along quite well in Qingzhou.

473
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:08,079
She has exchanged gifts as love promises with Wuyou.

474
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,214
I think both of them are inseparable right now.

475
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:17,659
Wuyou was already hurt once because of Princess Rong Le.

476
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,518
I couldn't bear for him to be hurt again...

477
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:24,728
If Yali has to be married to Chen...

478
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,904
Your Highness, please consider it carefully.

479
00:39:54,336 --> 00:39:55,809
He gave her wine?

480
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,159
Prince Zhenbei is really bad at giving gift to others.

481
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,920
Doesn't he know that Princess dislikes wine?

482
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:07,948
It's so fragrant.

483
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,649
Princess, this wine has a sweet smell to it.

484
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,750
Do you want to have a taste?

485
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,804
"I hope that this can absolve your worries."

486
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,620
Your Highness,

487
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,079
I don't want to bring any trouble to you.

488
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,987
How about I stay for a few days in this General's Manor?

489
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:55,759
Xiang, what if I miss you when you are here?

490
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:06,125
Greetings, General Fu.

491
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,604
Greetings, Crown Prince.

492
00:41:09,605 --> 00:41:11,445
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

493
00:41:12,356 --> 00:41:16,423
I'm sorry for making you wait for me.

494
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,863
Xiang, sit down.

495
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:22,924
General Fu, your servant told me that you'd come back since just now.

496
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:25,159
What took you so long?

497
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,321
Is there anything more important than discussing the government affairs with me?

498
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,559
I'm sorry for being too inconsiderate.

499
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,120
It's just that my wife had accidentally...

500
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,386
scalded her hand when we were at the teahouse.

501
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:38,184
I've brought in a physician to treat her.

502
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:40,279
But I'm very worried about her.

503
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,369
That's why I was late to this meeting.

504
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,470
Please forgive me.

505
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,947
Your wife was hurt.

506
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:50,039
- Yes.
- I can understand that.

507
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,859
I am a person who shows tender care to women as well.

508
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:59,949
I'm very envious that you and Lady Xiang are so loving together.

509
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:03,119
Enough, General Fu. Don't stand there. Take a seat.

510
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,839
I've specially brought us some good wine today.

511
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,660
Let's drink while we talk. Have a seat.

512
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,389
Thank you, Crown Prince.

513
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:13,461
Serve some wine for the general.

514
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,926
General Fu.

515
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,940
General Fu!

516
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,759
Looks like you are still worried about your wife's wound.

517
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:38,114
I've embarrassed myself in front of you.

518
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:39,735
Cheers.

519
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:50,086
What's wrong with you?

520
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:01,232
Looks like Lady Xiang is really up for some wine today.

521
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,530
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

522
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,340
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

523
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:53,610
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

524
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:58,110
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

525
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:02,050
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

526
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:10,380
♫ You are keeping me out with your care ♫

527
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,140
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

528
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,750
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

529
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:29,890
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

530
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,770
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

531
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,940
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

532
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:47,760
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

533
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,810
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

534
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:58,410
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

535
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:07,610
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

536
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:12,520
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

537
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,780
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

538
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:29,900
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
