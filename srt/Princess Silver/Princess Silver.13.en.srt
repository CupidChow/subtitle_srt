[Episode 13]

2
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:36,905
He is the first I trusted...

3
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:39,389
after I woke up and lost my memories.

4
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:44,278
I never thought he would abandon me, deceive me, and set me up.

5
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,376
I am still struggling.

6
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:49,850
Should I hate him... or should I trust him?

7
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,799
Your Highness, perhaps your brother has his own reason to do so.

8
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,926
I dug up some information after that.

9
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:00,110
Five years ago, when I first reached Northern Lin,

10
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:03,117
I once used the kite to send letters to General Fu.

11
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,332
During that time, General Fu was just a sergeant.

12
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,260
At first, I was curious too.

13
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,820
Why did we need to use the kite to send a letter to a sergeant?

14
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,236
That's right. I heard it with my own ears today about...

15
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:21,457
Fu Chou becoming the General of Defense in a few years' time.

16
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:26,718
All of these... are related to my brother and Western Qi for sure.

17
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:31,319
Behind these complex interests and disputes, lies the unfathomable heart of His Majesty.

18
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,255
It's not something that I can guess.

19
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:39,950
Long Yue, people like you who are in the kite...

20
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,125
left your hometown and buried your names.

21
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:45,249
And all of you sacrificed almost everything.

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,839
Have you ever wondered... whether or not it was worth it?

23
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:55,905
I lost my parents since young and I was brought up by the kite.

24
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:59,344
Loyalty to His Majesty and Western Qi has become our belief.

25
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,242
So, I have never thought of this question.

26
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,805
When I was walking on the street just now,

27
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:13,357
I kept on thinking that if did something wrong.

28
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:18,512
I'm prepared to sacrifice everything for Western Qi by coming here.

29
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:21,166
I don't mind sacrificing love.

30
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:26,507
But when I think about marrying a complete stranger,

31
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,793
I still can't accept it.

32
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,195
Princess Rong Le, if you can't accept all of these,

33
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:42,054
then you should follow your heart.

34
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:45,056
If you are willing to trust Prince Li,

35
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:49,112
then you should forget about your impeding identities...

36
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:53,086
to flee to a faraway place and keep living together forever.

37
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:02,948
But I don't know what it is that he wants.

38
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,247
My Lady.

39
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,613
Prince Li is here.

40
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,192
All right, you may go out now.

41
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,733
All right.

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,153

43
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,210
[The Book of Mountains and Rivers]

44
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,209
I recall that... we had a deal last night.

45
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,103
I said that I'd be coming to the teahouse to meet you today.

46
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,817
Although it's already late,

47
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,289
I will not break the promise that I made to you.

48
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,049
[The Manor of Prince Li]

49
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:11,541
I'm fine now. No need to worry about me.

50
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,477
Can you tell me what had happened?

51
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,667
If you don't wish to say it, then don't.

52
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:27,635
Wuyou, have you ever been tricked and set up...

53
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:31,139
by a person that you trust?

54
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,861
In this world, who else will be able to trick me...

55
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:37,465
and set me up besides you?

56
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,417
I did hide something from you.

57
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,220
But I had no choice but to do that.

58
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,980
And I didn't do it to trick you or to cause harm.

59
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,662
That's the reason you are able to stand here and talk to me.

60
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:51,958
Man Yao, I don't know what had happened to you.

61
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,101
But I had never seen you so crestfallen before.

62
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:57,206
You once told me that...

63
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:02,896
the things that are important to me today...

64
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:05,440
might one day become a thorn in my heart.

65
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:14,046
I lost my faith.

66
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:19,631
I don't know how to continue my life from this point onwards.

67
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,401
Do you trust me?

68
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:29,107
When my mother passed away,

69
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,100
I once thought that... there would be no more light in this world.

70
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:37,251
But I met you.

71
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:42,086
Man Yao, any sufferings, no matter how great, will pass.

72
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,640
If your faith betrayed you,

73
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:47,201
you don't have to worry about it at all.

74
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,539
Because it means that it's not worthy to be your faith.

75
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,877
If you have nothing to believe in,

76
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:54,511
then believe in me.

77
00:07:56,292 --> 00:08:00,189
My future will be your future.

78
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,069
Our future?

79
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,252
When I first saw you in the Moon Embrace Teahouse,

80
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:10,985
you were calm and collected when you faced that assassination.

81
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:12,766
From then on, you were already in my mind.

82
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:16,135
When I met you the second time, you were willing to cut off...

83
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,959
your arm in order to save Chen Yu.

84
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,500
I have never seen another girl...

85
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,024
with so much passion and courage as you.

86
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:25,466
After that, during my mother's death anniversary,

87
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:29,426
I went to Moon Embrace Teahouse without any recollection of it.

88
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,702
Now that I think of it, I think it's fate.

89
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:35,614
From the moment I hugged you...

90
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,340
in order to move away from the assassin,

91
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,503
in my heart, I knew that...

92
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,993
you were destined to be... different from how I see others.

93
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,275
- Wuyou.
- When my mother and teacher passed away after one another,

94
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:55,992
I really thought that... there was no more hope in my life.

95
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:58,252
But you came to me.

96
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:01,212
You are the one who had awakened my fighting spirit.

97
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:05,352
You made me remember my aspiration and my duty.

98
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:13,361
Unfortunately, war is now a constant in this world.

99
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,439
Because of it, many people...

100
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,129
have lost their home and the lands are barren.

101
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,485
So, I have to change this world for a better one.

102
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:30,146
I really hope that one day,

103
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,123
there will be no more war.

104
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,444
And the people can live in peace.

105
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,670
It would be so nice.

106
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:41,149
In order to achieve that, my teacher used to work his heart out...

107
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:43,759
to initiate the
people-based transformation.

108
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,560
But too bad.

109
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,479
That day, I heard you talking about it...

110
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,839
with His Majesty in the palace. Right?

111
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,478
As long as you can find the book, you can reinitiate the people-based transformation.

112
00:09:55,478 --> 00:10:00,669
Not only can this transformation benefit the people and the nation,

113
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,858
it can change the whole world.

114
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:08,095
My father promised that... as long as I can find the book,

115
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:10,700
he'll give me freedom to choose who I marry.

116
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,102
After you marry me, we'll carry out the transformation together.

117
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:17,199
When the world is in a safer place...

118
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,757
and the people are living in peace,

119
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:23,982
I promise you that... I'll travel the world with you.

120
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,173
And we can enjoy all the beautiful scenery.

121
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,777
How about that?

122
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:30,910
Will that day really come?

123
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,365
Yes.

124
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:41,909
At first, I thought that my future would be shrouded in darkness.

125
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:47,559
Now that you tell me all of these, I feel that I can see the light again.

126
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:52,800
Wuyou, can I... really trust you?

127
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:56,809
Trust me.

128
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,479
I trust you.

129
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,586
Marry me.

130
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,083
I'll start to prepare for our wedding tomorrow.

Your Highness, you didn't sleep for the whole night?

167
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,287
You should rest.

Go to the city and prepare the best things for me.

00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:51,882
I'm going to get married.

171
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:55,028
So, naturally, I'll need to have a grand wedding.

172
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,739
- Your Highness, this...
- No, before the wedding, I want you to take care of all the other

marriage customs and protocols as well.

174

If this is about other things, I'm willing to do it at any cost.

175
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:08,900
But you have never been a fan of over-elaborated formalities.

176
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,199
I don't care. You have three days.

Yes, Your Highness.

Are you really going to leave just like Miss Man Yao?

I'll take good care of this teahouse and wait for your return.

I heard that you have been looking for this score for quite a while.

Before this, she kept on telling me that...

you are a noble and unsullied person. You should forget about the past.

she is the one who understands me the most.

193

The princess is already gone. You won't be able to find her.

When I met Leng Yan just now, I heard that you were getting married.

209
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,889
This is the first time Leng Yan asked for my help so humbly.

210
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,679
Did the sun just set on the east?

211

I never thought that a delicate lady like her...

220
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,079
would be so sentimental.

221
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,000
She entrusted me with everything just like that.

223

Wuyou, you found the book.

224
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:42,602
Didn't Old Man Xin say that he couldn't find it?

225
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,865
Don't tell me that Man Yao gave it to you.

226
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,782
She really gave it to you?

227
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,851
How did she get her hands on it?

228
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,439
During the lantern festival, I heard that someone sneaked into Qin Yong's manor.

229
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:04,519
And that person fought with Leng Yan.

230

Is that her?

231
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:08,795
That's not right.

232
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:12,215
That day, you went to the lantern festival together with her.

233
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:15,820
Did you already know that the place would be empty on that day?

234
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,580
You wanted to test Man Yao to see if she knew the hiding spot of the book.

235
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,400
You did it on purpose.

236
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,201
No wonder.

237
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,960
Wuyou, no wonder you were so out of yourself that day.

238
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,919
You even allowed me to go to the House of Fragrance.

239
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,919
And even that Leng Yan went to party with the guards.

240
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,885
You were giving her a chance to sneak into the manor.

241
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:38,406
Wuyou, you did that on purpose too, right?

242
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:42,686
Just like I said, Wuyou.

243
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:46,139
The path to a woman's secret is through her heart.

244
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,140
I just never thought that you'd be able to make her...

245
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,919
fall in love with you so fast and willingly give the book to you.

246
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,340
But you had caused me to feel so guilty about this for so long.

247
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,200
So, everything was under your control.

248
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,599
Wuyu, I'm not...

249
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,859
Wuyou, with this book, nobody can tie you down anymore, right? Not even Father.

250
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,034
It doesn't matter if Man Yao is a spy from Western Qi.

251
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:08,483
She has contributed to this nation. What do you plan to do with her?

252
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,818
Don't tell me that you have truly fallen in love with her.

253
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:15,279
- Of course, I...
- Of course, it's not true.

254
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,000
Nothing is true.

255

Man Yao.

256
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,800
You used the rain as a reason to hold me in the manor for a few days.

257
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,300
And you shared the information about the book with me.

258
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,600
Was that part of your plan?

259
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
You took me to the library in the manor to enjoy the scenery...

260
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,700
so that I could find the secret room. Was that part of your plan, too?

261
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,000
Man Yao.

262
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,200
If you deny it,

263
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
why did you admit that it was your plan...

264
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,200
to lure me into your eagle's surveillance area with news about...

265
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,800
assassinating the Emperor of Qi when we were in the hunting ground?

266
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,100
Yes.

267
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,600
Those are all my plans.

268
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,100
I had never considered...

269
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,100
"The Book of Mountains and Rivers" to be more important than you.

270
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,300

You don't have to pretend anymore.

274
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,000
All of you had used all kinds of dirty tricks...

275
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,600
to get this book from me.

276
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,700
Since you have already gotten it, why bother lying to me now?

277
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,700
I never cared about that book.

278
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,400
I only care about you.

You are just like them.

281
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,600
On the surface, you say that you care for me.

282
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,100
But you are actually setting me up and using me to get what you want.

♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

317
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,100
Where have you been today?

318
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,900
I was so worried about you.

319
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,600
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up... ♫

320
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,000
♫ for you who have turned grey ♫

321
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,600
Did the princess pass anything to you?

322
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,400
No.

323
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,200
The princess has been gone for a full whole day.

324
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,800
When will she be back?

325
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,700
Sir, we received a decree...

326
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,700
saying that the princess will be marrying a general.

327
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,800
Is that true?

328
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,800
Sir Xiao.

329
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,000
Why are you locking me up?

330
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,200
Open the door! Why did you lock me in?

331
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,700
Sir Xiao.

332
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,200
Come...

333
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,300
Sir, we have already switched out the guards who are...

334
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,400
in the outer perimeter of Princess Manor just like you asked.

335
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,200
Now, this manor is under the control of His Majesty's guards.

336
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Arrest everybody in this manor.

337
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,200
And you'll be fully responsible for this manor from now on.

338
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,800
If anything about the princess is leaked out,

339
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,600
you'll be held responsible for it.

340
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
Yes!

341
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,000
This...

342
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,900
Wu...

343
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Your Highness, the Moon Embrace Teahouse was closed to all today.

344
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,600
I have already searched all possible places that Man Yao might be in.

345
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,400
But I couldn't even find a trace of her.

346
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,200
- What about Western Qi?
- Everything seems to be normal.

347
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,000
They are still preparing for the princess's wedding.

348
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I think they still don't know that Miss Man Yao has given you the book.

349
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,200
If they know, there'll be more danger for her.

350
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Ask Minister Wu to help you.

351
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,400
We have to make sure that she is safe.

352
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,700
Yes.

353
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,400
Wuyou.

354
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,200
Wuyou, I didn't mean to let the cat out of the bag.

355
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,400
But do you really not mind that...

356
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,200
she had used this fake book to test you out?

357
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,861
[The Manor of the General]

358
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,900
Brother.

359
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,900
I want to go home.

360
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,800
I want to go home.

361
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,200
I...

362
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,800
You are awake.

363
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Take your medicine.

364
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Where is my brother?

365
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
He is not here.

366
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,200
Where are you going?

367
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,700
Where can you go?

368
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,400
You know very well that...

369
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
you have no room to retreat anymore.

370
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,500
You came out from Prince Li's manor like a living dead.

371
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
He is looking all over the place for you now.

372
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Looks like... something really bad has happened between the both of you.

373
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,800
The teahouse is already sealed up and the people inside have all been arrested.

374
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,600
What did you do to Long Yue and the others?

375
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,500
If I let you out now,

376
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,800
your brother and Prince Li won't let go of them for sure.

377
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,600
You don't wish to cause harm to Long Yue and the others, right?

378
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,100
If you dare touch my people,

379
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,000
I'll guarantee that you'll get nothing.

380
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,200
You might have forgotten.

381
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
But there is no such thing as "your people."

382
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,300
Take this medicine.

383
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,600
Your best option is to stay here.

384
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,500
Any news?

385
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,400
General Fu is here to see you.

386
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,800
I don't want to see him.

387
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,700
General Fu said that he's just following orders to go to...

388
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,800
each princes' manor to send out his wedding invitation.

389
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Let him in.

390
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,800
Greetings, Prince Li.

391
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Prince Li, I'll be getting married in two days' time.

392
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,600
I hope that you'll be able to grace us with your presence.

393
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,300
Congratulations.

394
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,500
Recently, you have helped the court by offering yourself for the wedding.

395
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,900
Now, you've become the favorite of both emperors.

396
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,000
You are a talented man. And now, you have the most ideal spouse.

397
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,900
You look radiant today.

398
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,000
I bet you are ecstatic that...

399
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,400
you've gotten everything you want.

400
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,700
I have to thank you for that.

401
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,400
If it wasn't for you who was so set on rejecting that marriage,

402
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,600
I wouldn't have gotten what I wanted so quickly.

403
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,300
Sometimes, your dream...

404
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
might not come true if it's too big.

405
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,500
Thank you for your warning, Your Highness.

406
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,700
By the way, this Man Yin Chamber was prepared for Miss Man Yao, right?

407
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,600
I hope that I'll be able to attend your wedding soon.

408
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,200
And I hope that Miss Man Yao and you...

409
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
can get married in the near future.

410
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,100
Thank you for your blessing.

411
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,400
I still need to go to the other manors to send out my invitation.

412
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,800
I'll take my leave now.

413
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,100
Leng Yan. You have a lead?

414
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,700
There are only a few words from the message sent by Minister Wu.

415
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,000
Tell me.

416
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,800
Miss Man Yao is in the general's manor.

417
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,300
If that's the case,

418
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,700
why did Fu Chou come here just now?

419
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,700
Move aside.

420
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,400
Without the general's permission, you can't step out from the room.

421
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
Please go back in.

422
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,600
Stop it.

423
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
General Fu.

424
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,100
Xiang Ying, leave us.

425
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,600
All right.

426
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,000
You are still set on leaving?

427
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,300
I won't let you control me.

428
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,600
I won't be your puppet.

429
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,100
Go ahead then.

430
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,500
General Fu, Prince Li is here.

431
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,900
And he has the manor circled with his guards.

432
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,600
Now, you have two choices.

433
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,600
First, you can go to him. I won't stop you.

434
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Second, do as I say...

435
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,400
and I'll send him away for you.

436
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't want to see him.

437
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,900
Prepare a bath and a change of clothes for this lady.

438
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,300
Yes.

439
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,900
I'm sorry that I didn't get to welcome you sooner.

440
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,000
Please don't blame me for that.

441
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,700
No need to be so polite.

442
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,800
I've come uninvited because of my wife.

443
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
I heard that she's here in your manor.

444
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,600
So, I've come to bring her back.

445
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,800
Are you going to get married already?

446
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,300
Who is the lucky one?

447
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,600
But you said that your wife is in my manor.

448
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,300
I'm afraid that you are wrong about that.

449
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,300
If that's the case, when I manage to locate her,

450
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,700
you'll know who she is.

451
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,300
Guards, search the place.

452
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,800
- Search the place!
- Stop!

453
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,600
Insolent!

454
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,200
Wuyou.

455
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,200
General Fu has invited me to his manor to have a feast.

456
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,000
I never thought that you'd come here to make a scene.

457
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,500
According to the law, without an order from the Supreme Court,

458
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,900
no one can barge into the private manor of officers with ranking six and above.

459
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,200
What do you think you are doing?

460
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
According to the law,

461
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,000
an officer cannot have an illicit meeting with the wife of a royal.

462
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,500
Why can't I search the place?

463
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,300
Wife of a royal?

464
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
When did you get a wife?

465
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Looks like you have no respect for me anymore.

466
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,100
Even if our father is here today,

467
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,600
I won't let anyone stop me.

468
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,200
You...

469
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,000
As the sayings go, meeting by chance is a rare thing.

470
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,400
How about this?

471
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
I've already prepared a feast in my manor.

472
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,400
How about both of you enjoying the feast first...

473
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,500
and after that, if you still want to search my manor,

474
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,300
you can search it after the feast is over.

475
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,000
What if I insist to search the place?

476
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,100
Then you'll be humiliating my country.

477
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,600
A bully.

478
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,800
First, you rejected the marriage in the great hall.

479
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,100
You had humiliated Western Qi.

480
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,400
Now, as you wish,

481
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,000
I had chosen General Fu Chou instead.

482
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,600
In two days' time, I'll be marrying into this General's Manor.

483
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,100
But you are making up excuses to search this place.

484
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,000
You have continued to show no respect to us.

485
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,800
Do you really think that...

486
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,600
Western Qi is afraid of you?

487
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Looks like you've gotten more and more piercing with your words.

488
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
This marriage is too rushed.

489
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,400
I can only lightly decorate the Tranquil Garden...

490
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,200
according to Western Qi's style for the wedding.

491
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,300
I'm not sure if it's to the princess's liking.

492
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,200
So, I had invited her over to take a look at it.

493
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,100
I never thought that she'd really come.

494
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,400
You are so meticulous and caring for me.

495
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,300
Compared to those conventional courtesies,

496
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm more touched by your actions.

497
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,600
In this world, there are some who are short-sighted,

498
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,900
shallow, and rude.

499
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,600
But I'm very lucky...

500
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,500
to be able to meet a person who is as generous as you...

501
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,000
and one who is of the same mind.

502
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,700
You had made such a scene at the great hall...

503
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,600
just to wait for the arrival of General Fu, right?

504
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,200
Thank you for your compliment.

505
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,400
How about this?

506
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,600
Let me show both of you around the manor.

507
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,200
You can use that chance to look for your wife too, Prince Li.

508
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
Let's go.

509
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
After you, Princess Rong Le.

510
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,300
Miss, this is the dress and head accessory...

511
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
that the general had prepared for you.

512
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,700
Let us put them on for you.

513
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:18,200
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

514
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,800
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

515
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,600
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

516
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:37,600
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

517
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,400
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

518
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,200
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

519
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,400
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

520
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,800
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

521
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,400
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

522
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,000
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

523
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,400
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

524
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,900
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

525
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:51,000
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

526
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,800
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

527
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,000
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

528
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,200
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

529
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:21,900
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
