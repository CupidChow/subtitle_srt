[Episode 3]

2
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,900
Have you seen this before?

3
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,070
Try to recall the details. This belonged to the deceased.

4
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,330
It was found here.

5
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:43,139
But the content is missing.

6
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,380
I really have no idea.

7
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,560
Let's go.

8
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,880
Your Highness, are you all right?

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,000
Xiao Sha, this is Long Yue.

10
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,160
Come with me.

11
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,279
There is a secret passage to the alley.

12
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,220
It's safer for Your Highness to use this exit.

13
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,420
Sir Zhao dropped this pouch just now.

14
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,099
If the authorities come for an investigation, be cautious.

15
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,680
Yes, I will handle this matter with caution.

16
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,099
You should know by now this is no simple matter.

17
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,880
I understand now why Sir Zhao insisted on meeting you.

18
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,619
The evidence he was holding...

19
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,419
would only be useful when it is in your hands, Brother.

20
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:12,840
Only you can go up against the force behind the case.

21
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,460
But sadly, Sir Zhao was killed.

22
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,140
We need to find more information on that lady.

23
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,959
Wait, Brother. I thought you were not interested in women.

24
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,400
I noticed just now you had your eyes on her.

25
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,860
What's wrong? Are you having feelings for her?

26
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,080
This is very unusual.

27
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,210
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

28
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,039
Everyone is waiting in the dining hall.

29
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,220
Your Highness, please present yourself in the hall.

30
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,700
What are you doing?

31
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,779
I apologize for making such a fuss for you.

32
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,099
But I don't have much of an appetite. Go without me.

33
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,140
Enjoy yourself with The foods heartily.

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,100
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,359
Your Highness, I was keeping watch outside the room.

36
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,679
I never saw you coming in. How did you get in here?

37
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,139
I was so scared just now.

38
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,740
I have Xiao Sha with me, I have my ways.

39
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,960
My mother passed away when I was four years old.

40
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,059
But Lady Yun took pity on me.

41
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:45,000
She brought me to the palace and raised me there.

42
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,379
I still remember the days I was haunted by nightmares.

43
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:50,299
I couldn't fall asleep.

44
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:54,240
It was Lady Yun that kept me company all the time.

45
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,540
She played me the song of a vessel flute until I fell asleep.

46
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,479
For me, Lady Yun is like a mother to me.

47
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,419
Brother, I know the very sight of me is a nuisance for you.

48
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,799
You felt like I took Lady Yun from you.

49
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,580
You kept ignoring me.

50
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,160
But when someone picked on me,

51
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,779
the first person that stood up for me... was none other but you.

52
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,699
Just because you are bringing up memories... doesn't mean I will help with this investigation.

53
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,660
Brother, the culprit is no normal killer.

54
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,939
Their identities and background, the authorities have no records on them.

55
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,280
Are we going to let Sir Zhao die in vain?

56
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,019
Brother, for the sake of Lady Yun,

57
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,200
we can just...

58
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,999
Did I say something wrong again?

59
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:08,319
You have been following me for years. You should know well not to overstep.

60
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,779
These are not the matter we should be discussing.

61
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,540
I...

62
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,420
I apologize, Brother.

63
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,420
Owl,

64
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,450
you could have been soaring in the endless sky.

65
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,660
Why did you choose to come back to this palace?

66
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,790
Your Highness.

67
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,319
This is the evidence of rank-selling from...

68
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,340
the Crown Prince and Minister of Personnel.

69
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,540
Xiao Sha.

70
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,659
- Your Highness.
- Do you know... what kind of a person the Crown Prince is?

71
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,879
I heard he is ambitious, cruel, and petty.

72
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,179
He is not easy to befriend.

73
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,659
We need to be cautious with people like him.

74
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,220
Yes.

75
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,399
Right.

76
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,659
I am sure you knew me well before I lost my memories.

77
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,119
His Majesty brought you out to the hut sometimes.

78
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,579
I was always there.

79
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,350
When did you first meet me?

80
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,639
I think it was after His Majesty's coronation. I picked you up from the Cold Harem.

81
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,779
Was that the first time His Majesty met me?

82
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,099
I don't think so.

83
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,220
So where did he first meet me?

84
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,240
Well...I am not sure either.

85
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,499
I may be His Majesty's personal bodyguard,

86
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,660
but I can't be around him all the time.

87
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,120
You may go now.

88
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,159
Your Highness, there is an invitation from the palace.

89
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,819
The empress will hold a ball three days from now.

90
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,939
Your Highness is invited.

91
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,779
There is also a list of guests that will be attending.

92
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,100
Please, have a look.

93
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,579
Very well.

94
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,419
Please reply to Her Majesty for me. I will be at the ball on time.

95
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:01,280
Yes, I shall go now.

96
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,770
Your Highness.

97
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,300
[Attendance List]

98
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,799
Your Highness, Prince Li's name is on the list.

99
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,299
Her Majesty is aiming to matchmake you and Prince Li?

100
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,720
But why are so many other strangers invited as well?

101
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,600
Xiao Sha, do you know the names on this list?

102
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,340
These are princes that are yet to be married.

103
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,259
Matchmaking me with Prince Li?

104
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,860
It might as well be a blind date for me and the princes.

105
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,459
Your Highness, maybe His Majesty thinks Prince Li refuses to marry?

106
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,500
Is that why they are holding this blind date?

107
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,919
Wait! What do they take us for? It's not like anyone can marry a princess.

108
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,759
Your Highness, this ball is being held by the empress.

109
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,859
I cannot enter the inner palace.

110
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,620
Please, watch your back.

111
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,619
If Prince Li is not around, I doubt the others would dare to disrespect me.

112
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,599
Why wouldn't Prince Li be there?

113
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:16,199
His name is on the list, but he might not attend the ball.

114
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,659
Princess!

115
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,219
- Stop following me, okay?
- Princess!

116
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:50,139
You wouldn't go to the lake with me.

117
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,859
You are not interested in flower viewing either.

118
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,079
Princess, do you think I don't deserve you?

119
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,579
I simply don't want to be with you. Can you please stop bothering me?

120
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,100
Princess!

121
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,340
Princess! Stop!

122
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,980
Who is that?

123
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,779
Your Highness.

124
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,539
The elder son of Prince Qing He and Princess Zhao Yun.

125
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,859
You should know, Princess Zhao Yun grew up without parents.

126
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:20,339
She has no siblings either. So she is living with her uncle for the time being.

127
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,939
You have nothing to be so arrogant about.

128
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,519
You are just an orphan that lives under other's care.

129
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,950
You should be grateful I am even laying my eyes on you.

130
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,440
I am warning you, let go of me!

131
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,870
I am letting you go. Try me!

132
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,279
I will tell Brother Wuyou and let him finish you!

133
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,819
You are bringing up Prince Li now?

134
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,239
But he never attends to events like this.

135
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,300
You are not going to see him.

136
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,999
How dare you push me!

137
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,600
Stop right there!

138
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,480
Sister, save me!

139
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,259
Your Highness, this is Princess Rong Le from Qi.

140
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,860
Scram!

141
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,479
I was wondering who was here. It's the hideous Princess of Qi.

142
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,840
No wonder she is so nosy.

143
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,370
I heard Prince Li abandoned you.

144
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,630
So you want one of us to marry you instead.

145
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,739
Fat chance.

146
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,600
Listen! Even though I am not going to marry anyone,

147
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,680
I would never marry someone that was dumped and hideous.

148
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,959
I thought only Prince Li behaved in this manner.

149
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,979
I never thought the elder son of Prince Qing He was this bold as well.

150
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:29,779
I can say whatever I want! I am taking off that mask to show your hideous look!

151
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,180
Nicely done, Princess Rong Le! He deserved this!

152
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,660
Brother Wuyou, you are here.

153
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,000
Prince Li?

154
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
What did you say just now?

155
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,340
Nothing, I said nothing.

156
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,199
I said... if Prince Li doesn't like this woman,

157
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,500
I would never marry her.

158
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,379
- If this is the woman my brother likes, you would marry her?
- No!

159
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,359
No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was...

160
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:33,099
I won't marry her whetherPrince Li likes her or not.

161
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,899
You might as well be a eunuch then.

162
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,900
No!

163
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,519
Get lost.

164
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,320
- Guards, take him away.
- Yes.

165
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,479
I am here by the order of the empress.

166
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:47,959
- Get up!
- You can't take me by force!

167
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,979
- You can't do this to me!
- Prince Qing He had a son at an old age.

168
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,959
- He spoils his son a lot.
- Let go of me!

169
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,359
He lets him do anything. He is even bold enough to cause trouble here.

170
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,079
He should have known his place here.

171
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,979
I am glad Brother Wuyou was here.

172
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:02,480
Otherwise, Princess Rong Le would have been caught up in this.

173
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,479
Speaking of you... You know he is a scoundrel, why did you mess with him?

174
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,279
I didn't mess with him.

175
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,319
He kept bothering me.

176
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,279
If I were to have martial art skills like Princess Rong Le,

177
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,260
I would have beaten him to a pulp.

178
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,140
Princess of Qi actually knows martial arts.

179
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,579
There are two things Prince Li never does.

180
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,159
He never drinks. He never touches a woman.

181
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,700
Who says a princess cannot learn martial arts?

182
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,139
If Your Highness wishes to know more about me,

183
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,720
you will learn that I know more than just martial arts.

184
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,599
Your Highness is willing to attend the ball.

185
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:42,540
It means you do have some interest in me.

186
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,999
Why don't you come to the ball with me?

187
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:50,280
The empress arrives!

188
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,859
- All hail the Her Majesty.
- At ease, all of you.

189
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,360
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Mother.

190
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,539
I have heard rumors about how talented the princess is.

191
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,280
It seems to be true from what I saw.

192
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,519
Please, I don't deserve the praise.

193
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,499
Prince Li is here. Come to the ball before you leave.

194
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:24,519
Coincidently, Ya Li is here with us today.

195
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,339
I am the daughter of the Central Secretary, Ya Li. Greetings, Princess of Qi,

196
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,980
Prince Li, Prince Chen, and Princess Zhao Yun.

197
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,899
I have matters I must see to.

198
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,780
So long.

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,659
It's almost time for the death anniversary of Lady Yun.

200
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,960
My brother needs to retrieve some belongings of hers.

201
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,199
He does it every year.

202
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,620
A filial son indeed.

203
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,179
Since Prince Li is not coming with us,

204
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,280
Wuyu, you shall go in his place.

205
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,180
Come, have a toast.

206
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,199
Princess, you came a long way.

207
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,139
His Majesty was concerned the welcome was not decent enough.

208
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,059
I was ordered to hold this feast for you.

209
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,939
All the guests are about your age.

210
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,459
I hope you won't feel awkward here.

211
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,440
Thank you to His Majesty and Your Majesty.

212
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,159
Your have never been to our nation before.

213
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,900
How is your life at the manor?

214
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,540
His Majesty arranged a modest manor for me.

215
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,219
- However...
- What is wrong?

216
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:11,579
Are the servants not attentive enough?

217
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,179
If so, I can arrange to get the other servants for you.

218
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,539
I need to ensure you are having a good time here.

219
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,979
Your Majesty misunderstood.

220
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,219
The servants are taking good care of me.

221
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,480
Perhaps they are taking care of me all too well.

222
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,019
I wish to see the view of the capital.

223
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,780
But that seems impossible.

224
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,059
Why? Is someone stopping you from leaving the palace?

225
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,739
That is not the case.

226
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,579
Every time I try to leave, all the guards come along.

227
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,739
It's too high-profile, I feel concerned about this.

228
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,080
Which is why I can't go out.

229
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,740
They simply wish to ensure your safety.

230
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,779
But I already have a personal bodyguard.

231
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,580
He was sent by my brother before I came here.

232
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,819
I see.

233
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,899
Well, I shall send the order.

234
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,719
From now on, you may leave the palace as you please.

235
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:10,340
All the guards need not follow you.

236
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,360
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

237
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,280
Princess, enjoy yourself.

238
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,260
Make yourself at home. Enjoy the food.

239
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:23,720
To your health.

240
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,679
Prince Chen, all you care about is the food.

241
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,360
What about the princess?

242
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,400
But I am not Wuyou.

243
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,939
I wouldn't expect anything from Prince Li.

244
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,659
But if Prince Chen is here, I do have some expectations.

245
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,660
What do you expect from me?

246
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,119
I heard rumors about... how subtle and dapper you are.

247
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,019
You know how to care for a lady.

248
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,159
If I could have your attention and care,

249
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,040
my life in Northern Lin might be more interesting.

250
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,499
Indeed!

251
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,659
Prince Chen knows what's best for a lady.

252
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,139
Should you ever need any help on any matter,

253
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,460
you can always ask for his help.

254
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,140
Your Majesty, this is just...

255
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,439
Princess Rong Le,

256
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,960
Wuyu is simply unreliable.

257
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,839
Brother Wuyou is a good man. Do not fall for the rumors.

258
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,180
Princess, I wonder what hobby you have?

259
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,919
Your Majesty.

260
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,099
I don't really have any interest in particular.

261
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,839
However, I do love tea.

262
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,730
I wonder what Prince Chen does in his free time?

263
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,680
Well,

264
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,479
I love to visit the public houses. (Brothels)

265
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:10,479
What are the odds? I went to some places in my homeland.

266
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,639
But I have never been to a public house.

267
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:17,119
I wonder if Prince Chen has the time... to show me around the public house?

268
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,539
Are you even a woman?

269
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:25,879
You actually want to see a public house?

270
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,719
My intention is not about the public house.

271
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:32,739
I just want a chance to know you better.

272
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:37,540
I wish to find out what kind of lady do you like.

273
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,519
Mother, pardon me but I am feeling unwell.

274
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,860
I must be on my way now.

275
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,620
Little brat.

276
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,199
Princess, make yourself at home.

277
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,400
Same goes for everyone.

278
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,740
Your Highness.

279
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,120
Perhaps His Majesty is going to let Prince Li marry the princess.

280
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,430
I thought we had another six months.

281
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,370
Even if that is my father's plan,

282
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,620
there is nothing my father can do if she refuses to get married.

283
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,599
Your Highness must know, Her Majesty held a feast recently.

284
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,099
The princess showed her liking to Prince Chen.

285
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,219
Prince Chen and Li are inseparable.

286
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,979
If Prince Chen marries her, it would be just like Prince Li married her.

287
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,560
Your Highness, we cannot let our guard down.

288
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,510
She is but a mere princess.

289
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,670
There is no way she is a threat to me.

290
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,699
Besides, judging from Wuyu's temper,

291
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,880
if he really does marry that roguish princess,

292
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,580
that could be a great show to enjoy.

293
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:22,799
Your Highness, do you know Prince Li is investigating the case of rank-selling?

294
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,559
I thought no one knew? How did he find out?

295
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,460
A snitch told Prince Li.

296
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,020
But rest assured, I came prepared.

297
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,939
The snitch is no longer with us.

298
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,739
But we can see just how ambitious Prince Li is.

299
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,299
We can't afford to get sloppy.

300
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,099
Wuyou is always carefree and a man of seclusion.

301
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,660
He tricked me into trusting him.

302
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,899
But he is actually plotting against me.

303
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,500
Calm down, Your Highness.

304
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,019
What we must do now is to stop Prince Li from expanding his influence.

305
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:02,819
The order for the marriage is yet to arrive. It's not too late for us.

306
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,579
You mean...

307
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,720
Your Highness is already married.

308
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,619
Marrying the princess is not possible.

309
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,940
Unless, we make her...

310
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,739
married to one of us.

311
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,240
My father won't agree with this.

312
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,300
Unless...

313
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,419
Not only is Princess Rong Le hideous, but her behavior is also even more surprising.

314
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,820
She asked to visit the public house with me while Her Majesty was there.

315
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,479
Wuyou, why would a lady even act like she did?

316
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:40,299
Isn't that great?

317
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,019
You don't need to visit the public house on your own.

318
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,179
You can bring your wife along.

319
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,019
A couple sharing the same interest.

320
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,940
That could be a great tale for us.

321
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,840
Wuyou, stop making fun of me.

322
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,420
Don't you think something is fishy?

323
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,920
She was into you just moments ago,

324
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,880
and now she got her eyes on me instead?

325
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,080
Something is not right about this.

A conspiracy, something is at miss.

327
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,840
If you know she is planning something, why bother worrying?

328
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,080
I am being cautious.

329
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,979
I may not be as good-looking as you,

330
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,240
but at least I am subtle and dapper, chivalrous, and a gentleman.

331

Did she really fall for me?

Brother?

333
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,740
Brother!

Even Yali is of age to get a husband now.

336
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,859
So, your father is Wuyou's teacher.

337
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,059
You were a childhood friend of Wuyou. You are meant for each other.

338
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,260
What a shame.

339
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,460
Your Majesty, I don't deserve Prince Li.

340
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,619
It's the emperor's decision. The princess is in our land.

341

They may not be married yet, but the marriage agreement still stands.

Yali, what is your plan now?

343
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,779
I am still too young.

344
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,740
I just want to spend more time with my father.

345
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,020
I don't wish to plan for a marriage yet.

You may not be in a hurry, but I am concerned.

347
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,099
Your mother was like a sister to me.

348
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,859
If you ever find someone you love, you must let me know.

349
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,930
I will be your witness.

Yes, thank you, Your Majesty.

351
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,259
You have always been an obedient child.

352
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,199
Perhaps too obedient. You might run into trouble someday.

I am leaving.

Do you need the guards with you?

357
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,940
No.

358
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,939
I am sure you all know about Her Majesty's order.

359
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,139
From now on, I don't need the guards to follow me.

360
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:08,979
I have Xiao Sha to protect me.

361
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,450
Yes.

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,459
Is there anything else?

363
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,280
I must come along to ensure your safety.

364
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,659
Sending guards may be too high-profile.

365
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,619
If it's just me, it won't draw as much attention.

366
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,659
I grew up in Zhongshan.

If there is anything great on the street, I know all about them.

Why? Are you still upset about what happened back there?

373
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,819
You'll see, Wuyou and I will teach that son of Prince Qing He a lesson.

How dare he bully you.

No, I know.

376
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,579
As long as you and Brother Wuyou are here, no one would dare bully me.

Besides, I have Princess Rong Le to back me up now.

The princess? Don't be so naive, okay?

379

Haven't you heard? Not only is she ugly, but she also has a foul temper too!

Of course not!

She is so kind, she can't be ugly.

When I first met her, I felt like she is very friendly.

384
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:41,739
But I don't get it. Why would Wuyou refuse to marry her?

385

What could you possibly understand?

386
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,859
Wuyou was too protective of you.

387
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,600
It made you naive and simple-minded.

388

I have never seen one.

Why would you need me for a business deal?

As the sun rose, the child was born.

If I can find out about this, so can the others.

Don't you fear for your own safety?

I am not telling you this to threaten you.

As for your compensation, name any price you want.

Man above all, all but one.

It's the crown prince?

I don't think you can help me.

Are you serious about this?

479

is skilled in instruments and dance, elegant and gorgeous.

481

She may not have a noble status,

482
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,820
but she is more innocent than most noble women.

483

I apologize for the long wait.

484
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,700
I am sorry for my tardiness.

485
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,579
As a token of apology, I shall present you a dance.

486
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,980
Would you like that?

487
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,000
The rest of you can leave now.

488
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,339
Chen Yu, I have never seen you dance before.

00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,760
I get to witness it thanks to my brother here.

490
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,660
While you are dancing, approach the man with the green outfit.

491
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,299
You might get hurt, but not killed.

492
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,340
Leave the rest to me.

493
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,220
Help!

494
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,299
Help!

495
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,880
Help! Madam, help me!

496
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,740
Leng Yan, stop!

497
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,739
Who dare hurt my precious baby?

498
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,460
Tell me who did this. I will settle this for you.

499
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,840
How are you going to settle this?

500
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,139
Wuyou, just show some mercy.

501
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,260
She might not have meant it.

502
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,019
Did my girl do something to offend you?

503
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,540
Chen Yu is the best we have here.

504
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:54,140
The hands she used to play the chords with are priceless!

505
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,300
What if her priceless hands are exactly what I want?

506
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,539
What did she do to you?

507
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,580
Why would you want to cut her hands off?

508
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,819
I accidentally touched Prince Li's shoulder.

509
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,840
Prince Li? Kneel!

510
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,640
You doomed me this time!

511
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,699
Please, show some mercy.

512
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,200
The House of Fragrance is a big family,

513
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,139
we rely on her hands for livelihood.

514
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:24,980
Chen Yu, how did you find out who we are?

515
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,939
I can tell you are no commoner, you look chivalrous.

516
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,240
I know what I see.

517
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,139
Your Highness refused to let us know, I wouldn't dare to speculate your identity.

518
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,960
But His Highness called you Wuyou.

519
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,059
I am certain you are Prince Li.

520
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,979
It was a careless mistake of mine.

521
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,960
I hope Prince Chen can save my life.

522
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,259
- Leng Yan.
- Yes!

523
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,440
I want her out of my sight.

524
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,810
- Brother!
- Stop!

525
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,540
I think I have met you somewhere.

526
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,980
Can we speak in private?

527
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,060
Teahouse owner?

528
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,359
Madam Qiu, the princess is resting. Please, do not bother her.

529
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,679
Captain Xiao. I am here... to send the medicine.

530
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,379
Madam Qiu, the princess is not feeling well.

531
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,080
If someone bothers her and she seeks to blame me...

532
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,859
I will keep this soup warm.

533
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,360
She can have it when she is awake.

534
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,859
She wanted to go out this morning.

535
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,899
But she hasn't stepped outside the room.

536
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,840
She is not making a sound either.

537
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,780
She is gone. Madam Qiu is gone.

538
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,619
It's getting late. Why isn't Her Highness back yet?

539
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,980
You are right.

540
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,620
Did something happen to her?

541
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,739
Should we send Brother Xiao to check on her?

542
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,659
No, Master Xiao is her bodyguard, he can't leave his post.

543
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,840
Madam Qiu is keeping watch on us outside.

544
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,919
If he leaves now, they will find out the princess has sneaked out.

545
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,540
The people here will take it wrong.

546
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,259
What do we do now?

547
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,399
I just told everyone in the manor.

548
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:33,600
The princess is not feeling well and she needs to rest.

549
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,280
Yes, fortune favors her. I am sure she will be fine.

550
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,779
Right, Lian Xin.

551
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,179
Her Highness has had headaches ever since she got amnesia.

552
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,879
She had a headache around this time last month.

553
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:48,219
It's almost time. Hurry up and prepare the medicine for Her Highness.

554
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,359
Keep an eye on it. Remember, do not let anyone else touch the medicine.

555
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:55,560
- Is that clear?
- Okay, I should get going.

556
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,819
I will be guarding outside.

557
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,819
Leng Yue, keep acting like the princess.

558
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,640
Remember not to move around or talk to anyone.

559
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,900
You have keen sight.

560
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,000
I am Man Yao, the young owner of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

561
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,820
I didn't recognize you that day.

562
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,300
I didn't know you were royalty.

563
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:24,599
If I did anything to offend you, I apologize and hope you can look past it.

564
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,159
After you left, I found something in the teahouse.

565
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,040
Let me see it.

566
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,299
I don't know what it is.

567
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,399
May I ask, is this enough to save Chen Yu's life?

568
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,859
Wuyou, this really is a letter from Sir Zhao.

569
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,700
But why is this in your possession?

570
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,299
When you left that day,

571
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,420
I thought the room needed to be cleansed of bad luck,

572
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,699
so I ordered some men to renovate the private room.

573
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,140
I found this in the wall.

574
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,980
I thought the deceased might have left it there.

575
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,440
Besides, this might be rather important to Your Highness.

576
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,299
Why didn't you tell us sooner if you knew this?

577
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,440
I was about to hand it to the authorities.

578
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,019
You want to trade this thing for the girl's life?

579
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,059
I wish to pay for her deed.

580
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,579
I was planning on appointing her as a musician in my teahouse.

581
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,699
I want my teahouse to be known by the world.

582
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,099
Miss Chen Yu has beautiful music and looks.

583
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,540
There is no better option other than her.

584
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,320
But this letter means nothing to me.

585
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,820
It's not worth a person's life.

586
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,300
Brother.

587
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,080
But for me, Miss Chen Yu is worth more than any treasure.

588
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,660
Fine.

589
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,040
You may trade your hand...

590
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,180
for her life.

591
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:06,690
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

592
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:12,360
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫
