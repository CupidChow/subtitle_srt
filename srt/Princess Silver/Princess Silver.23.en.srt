00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,800
[Episode 23]

2
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,360
Xiang, what's wrong?

3
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,440
Lady Xiang seems to be in the mood for wine.

4
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,860
Stop drinking.

5
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,819
I just remembered.

6
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,199
I visited you many times, but I never met your wife.

7
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,980
I shall meet her right now.

8
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,280
With such good wine, we must share it together.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,739
Xiang, you are so thoughtful. Take your time.

10
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,239
I have something important to discuss with General Fu.

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,780
Go on.

12
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,780
Watch out.

13
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,780
Much appreciated, Lady Xiang.

14
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,320
However, my wife doesn't drink.

15
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,040
Let me take you to her.

16
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,699
General Fu.

17
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,980
Xiang, go to her on your own.

18
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,299
General Fu, you slay the enemies without hesitation.

19
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,060
But you are so indecisive when it comes to women.

20
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,659
You can learn more about women from me.

21
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,699
They are just like clothing.

22
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,060
They keep you warm in the winter,

23
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,099
on other occasions, they can be shown off.

24
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,099
But the clothing...

25
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,879
must be disposed of when the time calls for it.

26
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,999
It's just clothing. There is no need to hesitate.

27
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,560
Your Highness? Your Highness?

28
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Your Highness, are you all right? You are drunk.

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,910
Let me put this away for you.

30
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,070
If General Fu sees this, you will have a fight again.

31
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,730
So be it then!

32
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,379
I am not afraid.

33
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,000
A fight is not against the rules. I have nothing to fear.

34
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,420
Relax.

35
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,180
I will obey the rules and stay inside the manor.

36
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,500
He can lock me up,

37
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,100
but he can never have my heart.

38
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't even know if my heart is mine!

39
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,820
You don't even own your heart?

40
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,800
How dare you still live in here.

41
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,080
Get out of here!

42
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,779
Lady Xiang! Lady Xiang, she is drunk.

43
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,739
- Can you come here another time?
- Stand aside!

44
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,959
Even a servant like you is giving me orders.

45
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,059
I am not.

46
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:40,459
Don't you have the slightest respect for me?

47
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,119
No, that is not what I meant.

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
Lady Xiang?

49
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,159
Your Highness, should I get General Fu?

50
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,020
No!

51
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,240
You are his wife.

52
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,420
His heart is all yours.

53
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,760
How could you be thinking about another man?

54
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,540
He couldn't even let you get hurt.

55
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,760
He will lose his mind if he sees this wooden doll!

56
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,640
I can't let you break his heart.

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,279
I can't let him see this doll!

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,239
- Give it to me!
- No!

59
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,880
Hand it over!

60
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
You have no right to hurt him!

61
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,760
I can't love him.

62
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,459
I can't marry him.

63
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,020
I can't even meet him.

64
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,600
All I can do is to keep him inside my heart.

65
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,479
You are married to General Fu.

66
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,279
Your heart should be his alone.

67
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,919
You are married to the crown prince.

68
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,879
But I had no choice.

69
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,959
The choice wasn't mine to make!

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,700
The same goes for me.

71
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,640
It wasn't me that chose him. It was you.

72
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,980
You disguised as me and chose to marry him.

73
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,919
If you love him so much, why don't you stay by his side?

74
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,719
Why don't you live in this manor with him?

75
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:24,300
Don't you think I wanted that?

76
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,560
I have loved him since I was a child.

77
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,120
I wanted to marry him... so I could spend my life with him.

78
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,319
I gave up myself for him willingly... and married the crown prince.

79
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,700
What about you?

80
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,599
You took him away from me so easily.

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,460
You took his heart.

82
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,519
You robbed me of the dream to live here!

83
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,800
Do you really think this is a cozy house?

84
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,220
It's nothing but another prison.

85
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,920
I can barely breathe in here.

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,780
I feel like I am being watched all the time.

87
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,360
What have I done to deserve this?

88
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,240
You thought he is mine.

89
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,839
But he sees me as his pawn, not his wife.

90
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,039
Every time I questioned him, he put on that candid look for me.

91
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,399
He looked at me with pity.

92
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,920
He made me feel like it's my fault for not forgiving him.

93
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,000
We are just the same.

94
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,860
We never got to make our own choice.

95
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,840
The Eastern Palace... is also another cage.

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,360
I can't meet the people I miss.

97
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,120
But I have to be with the man I hate every day.

98
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,780
I don't even have someone I can talk to heart-to-heart.

99
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,220
I don't know who I am.

100
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,040
I don't know where my home is.

101
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,580
I don't know my family.

102
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,320
Right.

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,720
Where is my home?

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Where is my family?

105
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,499
Your Highness.

106
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:00,899
This is the important matter you spoke of?

107
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,579
How is it, General Fu?

108
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,660
I worked my fingers to the bone for this.

109
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,639
I met with all the nobles' daughters that are close to me.

110
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,199
I hand-picked a dozen of them.

111
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,820
I even got a painter to draw their portrait.

112
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,660
General Fu.

113
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,359
You have a keen insight for choosing women.

114
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,460
Lady Rong Le is indeed gorgeous.

115
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,519
So, I am putting you in charge of choosing the lady.

116
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,779
But the lady I choose might not be to Prince Zhenbei's liking.

117
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,619
You should let him do the picking or you can do it yourself.

118
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:36,680
Me? No way.

119
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
I know how to cherish a fair lady.

120
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,639
Let's say I chose this lady here.

121
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,199
I couldn't bear to let her be married to Chen.

122
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,359
General Fu,

123
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,959
you should make the decision on this.

124
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,160
You are loyal to your lover. Your heart won't waver even if you chose.

125
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,379
- But...
- Enough of this chatter.

126
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,220
The risk is imminent for us.

127
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,859
Zongzheng Wuyou actually came back in one piece.

128
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,019
Not only did he come back with victory,

129
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,359
he even saved Prince Zhenbei a couple of days ago.

130
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,639
If he gets ahead of us...

131
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,359
and recommends someone on his side to the prince,

132
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,899
the forces of Chen will be on his side.

133
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:17,340
We will be sitting ducks.

134
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,039
Your concerns are true.

135
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,119
General, I heard story that at Lake Qingliang,

136
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:26,640
Prince Zhenbei was not the only one he saved.

137
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,420
He came to your wife's rescue in front of everyone.

138
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,760
He is declaring an open challenge to you.

139
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,759
There is a feast in the palace tomorrow.

140
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,520
On the outside, everyone was invited to view the flowers.

141
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,740
But it was actually meant to pick a bride for Prince Zhenbei.

142
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,860
Your Highness, you mean...

143
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,640
you already have your lady there ready?

144
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,559
Not only did I arrange a lady for Prince Zhenbei,

145
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,999
I also prepared a great show for Wuyou.

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,819
I will make him fall hard.

147
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:04,079
A comeback will be impossible.

148
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,819
What is this great show you mentioned?

149
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:09,200
You will find out tomorrow.

150
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,539
Right, General Fu.

151
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,239
I am leaving Hen Xiang here at your house for the night.

152
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,920
- What?
- Just one night.

153
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,339
My wife's family is here.

154
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,619
Her family may have fallen from grace,

155
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:25,640
but her mother is like a demon! She is terrifying.

156
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,739
If she finds out about Hen Xiang,

157
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:30,200
she will charge straight to His Majesty.

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,060
Just a few days ago, she snitched on me to my mother.

159
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,179
We are in a tough spot.

160
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,460
Zongzheng Wuyou has been trying to get leverage on me.

161
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,080
I can't be involved in trouble.

162
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,060
This is all too sudden. I didn't talk to my wife about this.

163
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,519
Didn't you always say your wife has a generous heart?

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,900
I am sure she will agree.

165
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,559
Besides, it's just one night.

166
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,999
General!

167
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,299
- What's wrong?
- General!

168
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,959
Bad news, Lady Xiang and Lady Rong Le got into a fight!

169
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,779
What? Let's go!

170
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,920
They are fighting? Wait for me!

171
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,000
Rong Le?

172
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,240
Rong Le?

173
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,600
But...

174
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,959
But they were fighting just now.

175
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,879
General, what did I tell you?

176
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,300
I told you your wife will agree with this.

177
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,520
Look at how close they are now.

178
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,780
They might even become best friends in the future.

179
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,160
From now on, I can hide Hen Xiang in your house at any time.

180
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,620
Let's go.

181
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,560
The empress arrives!

182
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,599
Greetings, Your Majesty.

183
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,620
Make yourself at home at this gathering.

184
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,700
At ease.

185
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

186
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,599
I invited all of you here...

187
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,279
to have some joyous moments at the Imperial Garden...

188
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,680
and a special arrangement.

189
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,460
I ordered my men to hide a treasure in the garden.

190
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,620
Princess Rong Le, there is a treasure.

191
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,060
Anything that catches Her Majesty's eyes must be precious.

192
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,740
Prince Zhenbei brought it here all the way from Chen.

193
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,480
It's priceless and delicate. It's one of a kind.

194
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,839
As for what it is and where it is hidden,

195
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,060
you must find it yourself.

196
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,340
Anyone who finds the treasure...

197
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,140
can own the treasure granted by Prince Zhenbei himself.

198
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,519
Very well. I shall wait for your good news.

199
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,060
I took enough of your time.

200
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,880
Make yourselves at home.

201
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,619
Princess Rong Le, can you help me with the treasure hunt?

202
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:25,300
I really want that treasure.

203
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,459
It depends on fate's plan for you. You cannot force it.

204
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:32,259
Besides, what if you find the treasure... but you don't like it?

205
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,700
Princess, you misunderstood.

206
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,199
I am not getting that treasure for myself.

207
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,480
I have everything I need.

208
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,860
I am giving it to someone else.

209
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,260
It this a present for Wuyu?

210
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,940
It's not that I wanted that treasure for him,

211
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,820
but it really does suit him well.

212
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,780
How? Do you know what the treasure is?

213
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,139
It's just my guess. I am almost certain of it.

214
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,940
The most precious item in Chen is the Ferghana horse.

215
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,460
But the horse can't be hidden in the garden.

216
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,420
It would either be a horse bit or a horse whip.

217
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,300
Wuyu loves to ride horses.

218
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,839
The very first time I met him... was when he bumped into me on a horse.

219
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,599
This means a lot for me and Wuyu.

220
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,340
Don't you think it's the best present for him?

221
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,520
It is indeed meant for you and Wuyu.

222
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,580
Our little Zhao Yun has grown up.

223
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,540
You have become so thoughtful and sensible.

224
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,159
You even learned to make your loved one happy.

225
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,459
Princess Rong Le, you are making fun of me just like that brat Wuyu.

226
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,980
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

227
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,220
Princess Zhao Yun.

228
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,320
Miss Sun, are you here for the treasure hunt, too?

229
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,359
Wuyu told me that you were getting along very well with Wuyou in Qingzhou.

230
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:59,660
If you want to give this treasure to Wuyou,

231
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,460
you might as well stop wasting your time.

232
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,679
Prince Li was treating me very well.

233
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,300
I am not one of those nobles that was invited here.

234
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,980
It was Prince Li that brought me here.

235
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,920
Miss Sun, do you need my help with something?

236
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,360
Yes.

237
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,639
Zhao Yun, I had a little too much wine last night. I am feeling under the weather.

238
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,159
You can go on without me. I'll be waiting.

239
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,919
Princess Rong Le, you drank last night?

240
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,239
Do you need to go home for some rest?

241
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,479
I am fine. I am just feeling a little dizzy.

242
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,320
A little break will do. Go on.

243
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,799
Princess Rong Le.

244
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,479
If you see Wuyu later on,

245
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,940
do not tell him I am hunting this treasure for him.

246
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,519
Fine, you can go now.

247
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,919
Get it before someone else does.

248
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,220
So long.

249
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,279
I heard that because General Fu...

250
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,479
spends most of his work on the battlefield, he never drinks...

251
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,060
as he wants to focus on work.

252
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,159
I thought he always upheld his gravity...

253
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,839
and was a man of discipline.

254
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,580
Who would have thought he actually drinks and writes poetry with you?

255
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,860
I envy your life.

256
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,260
Miss Yali, is there something you wish to talk to me about?

257
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,479
I heard from the empress a few days ago.

258
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,799
You have quite some knowledge regarding teas.

259
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
I was hoping you can give me some lessons.

260
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,819
I like drinking tea, but I am no expert.

261
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:44,139
You can come to my house if you want. We can have tea together.

262
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,680
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

263
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,839
My Lady, the empress asked for you.

264
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,820
Please come with me.

265
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
Miss Sun, you must excuse me.

266
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,900
Isn't this the handmaiden that serves Her Majesty?

267
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,520
What did she say to the crown prince?

268
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,940
[Exquisite Hall]

269
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,419
Greetings, Lady Rong Le. Her Majesty will be here soon.

270
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,860
I am terribly sorry.

271
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,980
I will bring you some clean clothes right away.

272
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,780
Please, head to the inner room to get changed.

273
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,280
I must go now.

274
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,359
Brother, you are very smart.

275
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,639
What present should I get for Zhao Yun?

276
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,660
You are marrying her, not me.

277
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,879
Besides, she doesn't care about the present.

278
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,060
Brother, here is something you don't understand.

279
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,359
A woman's heart is like the needle in a haystack.

280
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,199
She will tell you the value doesn't matter,

281
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,039
she only cares about your love.

282
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,319
But in reality, get her a branch and see what happens.

283
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,839
She will definitely turn you down.

284
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,199
Even if she accepts it, she will still hold a grudge.

285
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,359
You'll see.

286
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,340
Brother, what present should I get for Zhao Yun?

287
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,520
Maybe I can carve a wooden doll for her, too.

288
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,720
Where is my doll?

289
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,060
That is mine, give it back!

290
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,800
Yours?

291
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,399
I don't see your name on it.

292
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,759
Why would that be necessary? This is clearly me!

293
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,519
Open your eyes and look closely.

294
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,919
I am sorry.

295
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,760
I don't see any resemblance of you in this doll.

296
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,400
You!

297
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,479
My brother is amazing as always. He got the doll back for me.

298
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,780
Prince Zhenbei, this is indeed my brother's belonging.

299
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,500
I could tell right away it was Prince Chen.

300
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,260
But I haven't had a fight in a while.

301
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,479
Now that I met him, I merely wanted to test my skills against his.

302
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,060
Prince Li, Her Majesty asked for you.

303
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,740
You must excuse me.

304
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,140
This way, please.

305
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,300
Man Yao? What happened to you?

306
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,600
Man Yao?

307
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,399
Your Highness, I apologize for that.

308
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,740
Miss Sun?

309
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,239
Miss Sun, you ran into me.

310
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,720
How will you make up for it?

311
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,140
Your Highness!

312
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,860
General Fu?

313
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,679
Crown Prince.

314
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,479
You have important matters to see to.

315
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,239
Do not be distracted by something so trivial.

316
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
Yes, thank you for reminding me.

317
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,640
I have an important job to do today.

318
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,220
Your Highness, everything is in place now.

319
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,820
General Fu, my grand plan is done.

320
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,479
Come on, everyone!

321
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,319
Join me for this grand show!

322
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,079
Come on.

323
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,200
Pick up the pace.

324
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Not only did I arrange a lady for Prince Zhenbei,

325
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,399
I also prepared a great show for Wuyou.

326
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,239
I will make him fall hard.

327
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,800
A comeback will be impossible.

328
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,900
General Fu, the servant from earlier took Lady Rong Le with her.

329
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,600
What?

330
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,920
Hurry up!

331
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,180
What is going on?

332
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,060
Your Highness! Your Highness!

333
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,940
Your Highness!

334
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,959
- Hurry up.
- Your Highness!

335
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,839
Didn't you say it will be a great show?

336
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,100
- Why didn't you bring me along?
- You came just in time.

337
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,759
Let me show you how to catch someone in bed red-handed.

338
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,240
Your Highness.

339
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,220
Why would it be such a show in the Imperial Garden?

340
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,179
General Fu, all you ever see is the tactical layout on the battlefield.

341
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,639
You have no idea how debauched people can be in here.

342
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,599
Let me show you how it is done today.

343
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,299
Let me show you the enemy... and who your ally is.

344
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,800
Perhaps the only man who can't see the enemy... is you, Your Highness.

345
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,119
General.

346
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,639
You can dodge the enemy's arrow, but you can't if it's from your ally.

347
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:12,959
Especially the one who shares a bed with you.

348
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,639
While you are basked in her gentle embrace,

349
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,760
your end is drawing close to you.

350
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,980
Your Highness. Your Highness!

351
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,220
Let's go.

352
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,140
But... But...

353
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,160
Where is Zongzheng Wuyou?

354
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,560
There is someone on the bed.

355
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,860
It's showtime!

356
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,740
Zongzheng Wuyou?

357
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,759
But...

358
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,900
Where is he?

359
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,480
Where is he?

360
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,120
Where is he?

361
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,040
Zongzheng Wuyou.

362
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,580
Curse him!

363
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,480
Chun Hua! Qiu Yue!

364
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,759
How dare you lie to me!

365
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,799
Your Highness, I did see Prince Li and Lady Rong Le come into this room.

366
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,759
I don't know what they were doing.

367
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,719
Where is Prince Li?

368
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,300
I have heard rumors about her affair with Prince Li.

369
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,599
I never thought they would do something so shameless in the palace.

370
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,639
Right under General Fu's nose!

371
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,599
- Indeed.
- Where is he?

372
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,799
If I can't find him here, I'll make you pay dearly!

373
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,900
Your Highness, there is a bathroom behind this.

374
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,300
Yes, they must be in the bath!

375
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,719
Exciting! This is exciting!

376
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,500
Stand aside! Make way!

377
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,580
Your Highness.

378
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,839
This door leads to the bathroom.

379
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,679
Charging in there doesn't seem adequate.

380
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,359
General, you heard what the servants said.

381
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,799
Your wife and Zongzheng Wuyou are committing adultery!

382
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,959
Are you really going to defend a woman that cheats on you?

383
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,039
Do you think I would believe my own wife...

384
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,020
or the handmaidens that spread rumors?

385
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,380
We will know who to believe once we go in there.

386
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,140
Your Highness, what if...

387
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,779
you charge into the room and my wife is the only one there?

388
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,480
Your Highness,

389
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,780
that would be very indecent of you.

390
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,600
His Majesty is mad at Your Highness because of Lady Xiang.

391
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,260
Do you really want to cross the line?

392
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,599
I have always been a righteous man.

393
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,399
Even if my father misunderstands me,

394
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,900
I must catch that shameless Zongzheng Wuyou!

395
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,640
I do have a plan that works for us both.

396
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,700
Let me go in there myself.

397
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,959
If my wife is the only person in there,

398
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,399
Your Highness gets to retain your honor.

399
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,340
If there is another man in there, I'll be sure to deal with him.

400
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,639
Don't you have faith in me?

401
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,679
You do have a point.

402
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,040
It would also be more exhilarating if you catch them in the bath!

403
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,299
I assure you, I will explain everything to His Majesty,

404
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,679
that includes your pain, anger...

405
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,879
and the desperation after you see what's inside.

406
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,319
General, I shall be waiting here.

407
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,439
If you need any help, just let me know.

408
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,119
Don't hold back.

409
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,000
Go on.

410
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,580
Yes.

411
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,940
No.

412
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,860
No.

413
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,099
General Fu, did you see any sign of Zongzheng Wuyou?

414
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,700
You...

415
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,640
How could you be so careless and fall into the water?

416
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,260
You will catch a cold in there.

417
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,980
How about this?

418
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,080
You can put on my clothes. I will be waiting out there.

419
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,260
Let's go home together.

420
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,120
♫ It never ends, love will fade ♫

421
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,479
♫ The blossoms fall, and I wait in silence ♫

422
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,799
♫ I cling to the past despite the pains ♫

423
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,159
♫ I won't let our love be a regret ♫

424
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,559
♫ Living without sorrow, dying without any hate ♫

425
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,799
♫ This is the leniency that you've shown me ♫

426
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,279
♫ We are not holding hands, but you are holding my heart ♫

427
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,319
♫ Although this might not be forever ♫

428
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,239
♫ I've locked you in my heart and I've locked you in my dreams ♫

429
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:15,000
♫ Blaming myself for falling in love with you ♫

430
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,600
General Fu.

431
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,480
Zongzheng Wuyou is not in there?

432
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,480
You worried too much.

433
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,680
This may sound hilarious to you,

434
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,079
but my wife slipped and fell into the water.

435
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,020
So, she took a bath here.

436
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,100
My wife is the only one in there.

437
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,680
General Fu,

438
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,660
are you trying to defend her?

439
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,120
No, I must go in there myself.

440
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,559
You conspired with corruption and sold ranks for profit.

441
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,359
You killed Minister Yu's whole family.

442
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,700
You failed to kill Prince Li in Qingzhou with assassins,

443
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,199
and now you use incense to drug him.

444
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,839
If His Majesty knows about these,

445
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,000
who do you think will get punished?

446
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,399
His Highness has a point.

447
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,500
In that case, please go in there and have a look.

448
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,739
Forget it! It's getting warm in here.

449
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:33,239
I am sweating!

450
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,840
I am going back to take a bath!

451
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,599
Get back to your work! Don't you have better things to do?

452
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,820
- You are dismissed!
- Wait.

453
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,239
How do we punish the two servants that lied to us just now?

454
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,359
Your Highness! We were just following your order! Spare us!

455
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,919
- Guards!
- Have mercy!

456
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,079
Take these liars out of here!

457
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,199
- Please, spare us!
- Have mercy on us!

458
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,180
- Out!
- Have mercy on us!

459
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,719
General Fu.

460
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,979
If it's inconvenient, I can help Lady Rong Le get changed.

461
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,680
This is my family matter.

462
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,220
I should handle this myself.

463
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,320
Is someone really behind this screen?

464
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,740
He even went so far to tolerate her?

465
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,600
I apologize for my manners.

466
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,280
General Fu.

467
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,280
Chang Jian.

468
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,839
From now on, you will take Xiang Ying's job.

469
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:17,140
After my wife comes out,

470
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
send her back to the house.

471
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,180
Yes.

472
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,839
Are you all right?

473
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,520
I am fine.

474
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,440
Your Highness! Your Highness!

475
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,079
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

476
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,280
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

477
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,180
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

478
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

479
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,580
You need to go now.

480
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,159
♫ You are keeping me out with your care ♫

481
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,520
♫ Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

482
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,639
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

483
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,159
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

484
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:50,120
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

485
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,410
Lady Rong Le, the carrier is ready.

486
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,600
This way, please.

487
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:08,520
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

488
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,200
Please, stay away from my wife.

489
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,440
Please, keep her from harm.

490
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,639
Where are they hiding the treasure?

491
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,320
Did someone get it before I did?

492
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,759
Shouldn't you be at the front garden for your archery contest?

493
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,840
I just want...

494
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,420
What exactly do you want?

495
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,439
It's nothing serious.

496
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,379
Don't bother me then. I am looking for treasure.

497
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,560
I found the treasure you were looking for.

498
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,520
You found it?

499
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,000
Do you like it?

500
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,539
The treasure you want is in my hand. Give me your hand.

501
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,039
- Wuyu!
- Do you like it?

502
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,859
I am trying to find the treasure... and you are getting in my way!

503
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:16,599
You want the treasure from another man and not mine?

504
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,039
Is it not pricey enough for you?

505
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,780
Is the treasure really worth that much?

506
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,399
Do you really think I want the treasure for myself?

507
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,879
Do you really take me as a gold-digger?

508
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,839
- But...
- Princess Zhao Yun.

509
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,679
To express his gratitude to you for saving his life at the lake,

510
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,079
Prince Zhenbei invites you to the side palace.

511
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,519
She is not going.

512
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,039
It's all thanks to your weird treasure.

513
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,719
Why would you want to hide it? Are you out of your mind?

514
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,319
It's just a stinking trinket. What's the big deal?

515
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,859
I bet even if you give it to someone, no one would bat an eye!

516
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,679
I will.

517
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,259
I am going to get that treasure. Stop following me around!

518
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,979
I am not following you! You will regret this!

519
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,340
You can't find the treasure unless you go to the side palace.

520
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,719
Stinking brat! Stinking Wuyu!

521
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,380
I am working so hard to find the treasure for him!

522
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,740
And he thinks otherwise. What a fool.

523
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,060
Where could that treasure be?

524
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,200
Why can't I find it?

525
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,560
Wuyu, what are you up to this time?

526
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,360
A gift from Heaven!

527
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,360
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

528
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,780
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

529
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:49,360
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

530
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,800
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

531
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,860
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

532
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:07,110
♫ You are keeping me out with your care,
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

533
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,850
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

534
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,500
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

535
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:25,370
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

536
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,390
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

537
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,710
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

538
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:42,530
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

539
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:49,620
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

540
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,290
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

541
00:44:54,290 --> 00:45:03,360
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

542
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,170
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

543
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:12,450
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

544
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:24,870
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
