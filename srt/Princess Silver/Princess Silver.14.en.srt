Wuyou, did you find anything?

10
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,495
The bathroom is just straight ahead.

11
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:23,801
But it was used by my friend just now. So, it's still a little bit damp.

12
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:25,270
No need to look at it then.

Yes, General Fu.

Although this bathroom is not as luxurious as the one in the palace,

22

it's spacious enough.

23

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,960
Where can you run to?

168
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Naughty girl.

169
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,593
- Who are you?
- I...

170
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:18,070
You! This...

171
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:20,951
Beauty. Beauty.

172
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,899
Your Highness.

173
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,334
- Your Highness.
- It's all right.

174
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:28,206
Beauty, let me take a look.

175
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:29,687
You...

176
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,951
Are you mad?

177
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:36,119
You...

178
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,783
How can you bring a girl from a public house into your Eastern Palace?

179
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:43,384
Have you ever shown me any respect as your wife?

180
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:46,245
If the emperor and my father learn about this,

181
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,959
how am I going to cover it up for you?

182
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,569
Your father again.

183
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,711
You are using your father to threaten me again.

184
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:55,419
Yes. You scholars are very powerful.

185
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:58,112
All of you looked down on me.

186
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,614
Ever since I married you,

187
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:05,480
I have never made things difficult for you.

188
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,679
I had turned a blind eye to it...

189
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,474
when you enjoyed yourself with those women out there.

190
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:12,788
But, Your Highness,

191
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,142
how can you bring a lowly wench into the Eastern Palace?

192
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,120
- You...
- Eastern Palace...

193
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,737
is just a wall apart from your bed chamber.

194
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,251
It's my fault.

195
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,310
Please kick me out from the palace, Your Highness.

196
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,906
Beauty, please stand up.

197
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:34,886
You... You are just a woman. You know nothing.

198
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:36,799
Don't you know who she is?

199
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,399
She was given to me by General Fu.

200
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,454
Do you know who General Fu is?

201
00:21:42,455 --> 00:21:45,280
I've put in so much effort to get him under my rank.

202
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,660
You...

203
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:52,384
If you keep quiet, nobody will know about this.

204
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:54,479
At any rate, if you spread this out,

205
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,186
you'll be getting it from me.

206
00:21:57,186 --> 00:22:01,112
Leave now! Leave us!

207
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,684
I can't believe you.

208
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:09,171
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

209
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,554
Leave!

210
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,719
Beauty.

211
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:33,060
Beauty. Beauty.

212
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:37,788
Beauty.

213
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,180
Beauty.

214
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,356
Your Highness, after you drink this cup of wine,

215
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,856
I'm all yours.

216
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,140
I'll drink it.

217
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:05,233
Beauty.

218
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:15,705
Beauty.

219
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,177
You are here.

220
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,499
You are a scumbag who wrecks the country and ruins the people.

221
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,233
You have ruined so many nice ladies out there.

222
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:39,246
You deserve to suffer.

223
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,598
The Shilixiang Wine in the general's manor...

224
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:42,929
is from a winery in this city that has started to sell this wine recently.

225
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,319
It's called Shilixiang, but after I checked the wine recipe,

226
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,540
it's different from the secret recipe of the Qin family.

227
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,522
They just imitate the original wine so that they smell the same.

228
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:54,122
But they taste different.

229
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:57,194
Any matter regarding the Qin family is taboo in Northern Lin.

230
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:58,839
They still dare to imitate him.

231
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,779
The winery didn't mention anything about the Qin family.

232
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,354
They just took advantage of the wine's name that was so famous more than 10 years ago.

233
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:07,078
The people didn't know the relation between this wine and the old case.

234
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:10,650
I'm afraid that they are just taking a huge risk for profit.

235
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,155
The mind of a businessman is really unpredictable.

236
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:18,895
That's not right.

237
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:23,341
It's impossible that Fu Chou would be ignorant of the secret of Shilixiang.

238
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:28,934
But why would he take the risk to use this restricted wine at his banquet?

239
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:32,116
I've already investigated it. On the surface, General Fu...

240
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:34,529
and Miss Man Yao don't have any special relationship.

241
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,687
Agent Wu said that she was at General's Manor.

242
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:39,573
But we have found nothing.

243
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,879
Agent Wu is never wrong.

244
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:44,652
He must have found out about something.

245
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:47,568
I keep feeling that it's a very strange night.

246
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:52,179
Did we miss out on some details?

247
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,677
Man Yao turns up in General's Manor.

248
00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,599
Without any regard for etiquette, the unmarried princess...

249
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,333
went to the manor of his fiancé to check out the house decorations.

250
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,919
Not to mention the lead dancer in the banquet who is quite good in martial arts.

251
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:14,143
And Fu Chou actually gave such a dangerous woman to the crown prince.

252
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:19,598
Not to mention the Shilixiang wine that was purposely used in the banquet.

253
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,341
Everything is very suspicious.

254
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:26,282
But it seems like they are somehow unrelated.

255
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:30,211
Do I need to go and ask for Agent Wu's guidance?

256
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:33,604
No need. We have to find Man Yao first.

257
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:40,200
Fu Chou is not just aiming to curry favor with the crown prince.

258
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,288
If we want to know his real purpose,

259
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:44,516
I think that everything will come to light...

260
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,817
when we find Man Yao.

261
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:26,586
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

262
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:28,940
Yesterday night, I was too exhausted...

263
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,026
until I slept like the dead.

264
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,127
Yesterday night?

265
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:36,150
What happened yesterday night?

266
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,531
Why can't I remember anything?

267
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:42,872
Why did you make fun of me, Your Highness?

268
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:51,899
Looks like I've worked you too hard yesterday night.

269
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,519
No need to pay your respects today.

270
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,340
Come, let's do it again.

271
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,346
- But your wife...
- No need to care about her.

272
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,006
No.

273
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:04,008
Your Highness, this is my first day here.

274
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:07,838
I don't want to be seen... as the spoiled one just because you dote on me.

275
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:10,746
Actually, you don't need to be so attentive to me.

276
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:13,747
I already know that you are very nice to me.

277
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:16,043
Good.

278
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,537
Good. So, you know the basic principles.

279
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:28,705
Such a sensible woman.

280
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,010
I can't let Princess Rong Le marry General Fu.

281
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,239
She belongs to Wuyou.

282
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,173
This Man Yao from Moon Embrace Teahouse.

283
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:43,729
I'll make you stay away from Wuyou for sure.

284
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,319
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

285
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:54,871
Excuse me, where did the people from the teahouse go?

286
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:56,252
They have been closed for several days already.

287
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:58,579
This is weird. They were doing very well.

288
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:00,998
But they just close down suddenly like that.

289
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:06,303
Did she really think that she can become the wife of a prince?

290
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:09,307
Is that why she shut down her business?

291
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,846
Leng Yan,

292
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:15,280
we have to find her even if we have to turn the city upside down.

293
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,960
Yes, Your Highness.

294
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,220
Maybe Man Yao didn't manage to find the book yet.

295
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,022
Rather than spending so much manpower to search for Man Yao,

296
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:28,582
we could just use that manpower to find the book.

297
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,829
Wuyou, this is the first time I've ever seen you so flustered.

298
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:56,094
Didn't you look for her for the sake of the book?

299
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,230
Wuyou, in your heart,

300
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,291
Man Yao is more important than "The Book of Mountains and Rivers?"

301
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:05,714
Have you really fallen in love with Man Yao?

302
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:09,651
Wuyou!

303
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:11,396
Why are you here again?

304
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:15,279
I went to the teahouse today. Everybody said that the shop has been closed for several days.

305
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,461
Did you know where Man Yao went?

306
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:21,417
Don't come here to pester him. Wuyou has enough trouble already.

307
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,843
We have been looking for her for days as well.

308
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:26,842
Even Wuyou doesn't know where Man Yao is.

309
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:30,674
Could it really be that she's in real danger?

310
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:34,070
Although I hope that Wuyou can be with Princess Rong Le...

311
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,370
That's right. She must be in danger.

312
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:42,832
Wuyou, she will be fine. It's just a slip of my tongue.

313
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,233
With Man Yao's personality,

314
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:51,976
she wouldn't let go of the things she wants and just leave like that.

315
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,554
Moreover, this is a big city.

316
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:57,615
It's impossible that someone can disappear without a trace.

317
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,466
Unless...

318
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:02,346
Unless something had happened to her.

319
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,179
She will be fine, Wuyou.

320
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:07,586
Let's split out to look for her. We will be able to find her for sure.

321
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:11,502
If she's really in captivity, rather than looking for her in secret,

322
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:15,699
we should make a scene out of it so that her captors have nowhere to hide.

323
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:19,179
Wuyu, bring along your guards to search for her in the city with me...

324
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,779
in the name of searching for a fugitive. Search every nook and cranny.

325
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:24,143
All right.

326
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:27,336
Wuyou, it was a thoughtless comment just now. Don't be anxious.

327
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,919
You better leave. Stop pestering Wuyou. Let's go.

328
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,200
Quick. Let's go.

329
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,247
- Have you seen this lady before?
- No.

330
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:39,900
You'll be rewarded if you do.

331
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,540
No.

332
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:47,328
Have you seen this lady before?

333
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,937
No.

334
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:52,562
Have you seen her before?

335
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:54,163
No.

336
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:58,676
Have you seen this lady before?

337
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:04,754
That day, I did see a young lady walking on the street under the rain.

338
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:07,112
But it was too dark. I couldn't see clearly.

339
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:10,134
Officer, give me some money now.

340
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:12,364
Off you go.

341
00:32:19,143 --> 00:32:20,571
Prince Li is looking for a fugitive.

342
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,463
Those who obstruct the search will be killed.

343
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,434
Give it to us.

344
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,879
Officers!

345
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,330
These belong to us, officers.

346
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,650
Nothing to do with the fugitive.

347
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:38,520
Looks like Prince Li is just as bad.

348
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,673
You officers are traitors to the people.

349
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:44,430
You are just a bunch of robbers. I'm going to report on you.

350
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,259
General Fu, just like what you have expected,

351
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,994
Prince Li and Prince Chen are searching...

352
00:33:12,994 --> 00:33:16,501
from house to house looking for Miss Man Yao in the city.

353
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,078
This is quite unexpected actually.

354
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:22,235
Zongzheng Wuyou has never bothered himself with women.

355
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:24,742
It's not like him to act so desperately.

356
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:28,419
You added the fuel to the fire right on time.

357
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,844
The Eastern Palace will rely more heavily on you now.

358
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:51,799
Greetings, Your Highness.

359
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,040
Sir Xiao, are you bringing me to your master now?

360
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,300
Your Highness.

361
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,850
His Majesty left already after he bade his farewell to the Emperor of Northern Lin.

362
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:06,462
What is it?

363
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,353
Wouldn't the Emperor of Northern Lin be suspicious of my brother...

364
00:34:09,353 --> 00:34:11,814
Leaving before putting me on the bridal sedan chair himself?

365
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:15,986
I have no right to question His Majesty.

366
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:18,782
He left before he got the book.

367
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:21,078
But he left you behind to retrieve it.

368
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:23,471
Looks like you have done well for the past half-year.

369
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:27,331
You had put in so much effort to trick and spy on me.

370
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,499
You have proven your loyalty to him.

371
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,000
You are worthy to be entrusted with this task.

372
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,980
Please bring me to the book, Your Highness.

373
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,820
Bring me to Long Yue and the others.

374
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,410
You won't get to see the book until I get to see them.

375
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,047
Let's go then, Your Highness.

376
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,139
Next, let's go to that shop.

377
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,734
Welcome to my humble shop. Have a look.

378
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:01,795
Three days ago, you imported in four bales of silk from Liang.

379
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:05,170
Today, I've brought my housekeeper along to get the goods.

380
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,924
Please follow me.

381
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:48,068
- My lady.
- Are you all right?

382
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:51,009
Thank goodness you are alright, Your Highness.

383
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,412
Long Yue.

384
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:56,986
Xiao Sha.

385
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:58,817
You traitor.

386
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:01,316
How can you betray the princess?

387
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,396
Long Yue, what happened to you?

388
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:12,256
Long Yue, what happened to you?

389
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:14,013
I'm fine.

390
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:17,338
They have just given me some sedatives...

391
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,499
so that I can't fight against them.

392
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,800
Do you have to treat your own companion like this?

393
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,300
I've gotten you all into trouble.

394
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,279
That's not true.

395
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:38,226
I just got to know that you are the princess recently.

396
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:40,153
But I knew it in my heart that...

397
00:36:40,153 --> 00:36:44,360
you had sacrificed a lot in order to save our lives.

398
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:47,799
Your Highness, now that you've seen them,

399
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:50,459
can you bring me to "The Book of Mountains and Rivers" now?

400
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,148
"The Book of Mountains and Rivers"? Don't do it, Your Highness.

401
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:57,500
The book is the only thing that can guarantee your freedom.

402
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,226
How can you give it to them just like that?

403
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,080
Don't worry.

404
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,931
I'll get you out for sure.

405
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,499
No.

406
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:19,677
I can bring you to the book.

407
00:37:19,677 --> 00:37:21,899
But no harm can come to them.

408
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:25,228
I understand. After you, Your Highness.

409
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:29,777
Be careful, My Lady..

410
00:37:29,777 --> 00:37:32,377
Be careful, Your Highness.

411
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:35,312
- My Lady.
- Your Highness.

412
00:37:53,362 --> 00:37:55,046
- Have you seen her before?
- No.

413
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:56,401
- Have you seen her before?
- No.

414
00:37:56,402 --> 00:37:58,886
- Have you seen her before?
- No.

415
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:02,227
Have you seen this lady before?

416
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,853
- This height and very pretty.
- Never.

417
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:07,770
I think you know the consequences if they manage to find you.

418
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:12,472
- Have you seen this lady before?
- No.

419
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,448
I'll send someone to lure them away.

420
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:18,077
And then we'll use another path.

421
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:20,706
So, you still have someone spying on me.

422
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,562
Stop that carriage.

423
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,123
Yes, Your Highness!

424
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,760
Move aside.

425
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,290
Move aside, please.

426
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:45,300
Move aside.

427
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,405
Move aside, please.

428
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:49,365
We can go now.

429
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,626
Are you looking for me?

430
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:58,323
Man Yao, we are looking for you. Come back with me now.

431
00:38:58,323 --> 00:38:59,909
Let's go.

432
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,012
It's you.

433
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,021
I remember.

434
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,139
You are the bodyguard of the Princess of Western Qi, right?

435
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,100
Why are you meddling into others' business here?

436
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,323
Did you get the wrong person?

437
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,193
Where is Man Yao?

438
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:29,893
Man Yao!

439
00:39:32,513 --> 00:39:35,299
It's all your fault. Why did you fight me suddenly?

440
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:37,760
Your Highness, I was chasing down a servant.

441
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,419
I thought that he had ran into your troops.

442
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,800
I was too anxious, so...

443
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,619
You mean that servant who escaped in that carriage just now, right?

444
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:47,059
I saw it, but I didn't manage to stop it.

445
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,699
But you are really good in fighting.

446
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:51,838
No discord, no concord. I'll learn from you again another day.

447
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:54,051
It's just a misunderstanding. Please forgive me.

448
00:39:54,051 --> 00:39:55,771
Sir.

449
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,338
- Have you seen this lady before?
- No, goodbye.

450
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:04,850
Continue to search.

451
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,630
Yes, Your Highness.

452
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:14,948
No need to chase after her.

453
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,386
This is a matter of Western Qi. We won't need your service here.

454
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,502
This is not something that you can decide on your own, Sir Xiao.

455
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:30,266
All right. I'll follow the order.

456
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,242
- Your Highness.
- My lady.

457
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:14,702
We can't stay here for long. We have to leave this place now.

458
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:16,303
Let's go.

459
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,929
Have you seen this lady before?

460
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:26,027
- Have you seen this her before?
- Take a look, have you seen her?

461
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,519
- No, I haven't.
- No.

462
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,159
What about you?

463
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,923
- Have you seen her? Be truthful.
- No.

464
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:34,218
We have to get out from the city before the door closes for tonight.

465
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,397
- I'll carry you.
- No.

466
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,721
Your Highness, you should leave first.

467
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:44,487
Don't worry. We have to get out from the city first.

468
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:45,988
Come.

469
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,374
Are you all right? Get up.

470
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:05,509
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

471
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:08,253
Your Highness, I can't run anymore.

472
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:09,740
You should go ahead first.

473
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,901
Your Highness, looks like nobody is on our trail.

474
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:13,688
I can also feel that the sedative is wearing off.

475
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:15,459
- How about you put me down first?
- No.

476
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:17,160
I'll put you down when you are recovered completely.

477
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,180
That's right. Let's keep going for a little bit more.

478
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,720
Let's go.

479
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,139
- You saw Man Yao in the city?
- That's right.

480
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:36,060
I saw her on the street. But I lost my eye on her and she was gone.

481
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,800
Your Highness, we have news.

482
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,060
Someone saw Miss Man Yao at the west entrance of the city.

483
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,941
She must have left the city.

484
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:52,180
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

485
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:58,120
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

486
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:04,750
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

487
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:11,660
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

488
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:18,530
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

489
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:24,230
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

490
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:31,460
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

491
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,170
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

492
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:48,460
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

493
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:55,010
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

494
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:01,350
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

495
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:08,420
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

496
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:25,130
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

497
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:32,190
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

498
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:38,020
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

499
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:45,160
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

500
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:56,390
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
