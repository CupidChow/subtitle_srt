00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,600
[Episode 24]

2
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,700
I heard that Prince Zhenbei from Chen is very handsome...

3
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,159
and he's good at riding and shooting.

4
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,479
He's here this time to choose his bride.

5
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,039
I wonder which lady will be so fortunate.

6
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,359
But if we were to be married to Chen, we'll be far away from our homeland.

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,120
Arrival of Her Majesty!

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,340
All of you have found it, right?

9
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,679
Next, Prince Zhenbei will...

10
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,720
personally reveal the treasure to us.

11
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,559
Have you found the treasure?

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,840
You better think about how are you going to apologize to me later.

13
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,399
Zhao Yun, we meet again.

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,479
You've found the treasure that I've hidden.

15
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,000
So,

16
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,280
I'll give this horsewhip that represents the supreme power... of Chen to you.

17
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,879
And please agree to my request...

18
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,599
to be my wife.

19
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,240
What? Wife?

20
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,679
This must be a surprise for you, Princess Zhao Yun.

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,119
Prince Zhenbei wanted to use a special way...

22
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,859
to choose his bride.

23
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,479
He has discussed this with me in private.

24
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,079
The lucky lady who can find his treasure today...

25
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,959
will become his wife.

26
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,680
So congratulations, Princess Zhao Yun.

27
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,040
He has plotted against you.

28
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
- Let me teach him a lesson.
- Wuyu!

29
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,500
Don't be reckless. This is a serious matter.

30
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,090
- Let's bring this to Father.
- Wuyou.

31
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,500
Let's go.

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,440
It's all right. Don't be scared.

33
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,359
Everything is set.

34
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,460
We have to win this war against Wei.

35
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,799
Your Majesty.

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,120
According to our agreement with Western Qi,

37
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,039
as soon as we go into war, they will support us with food and give us a safe passage.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,159
But now, not only did they not send us any food,

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,300
they had sealed off the public road between us and them.

40
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,499
If this public road is sealed off, we'll have to make a detour if we want to march into Wei.

41
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:18,220
As soon as our travel time lengthens,

42
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,740
I'm afraid that Wei will find out about us and take precautions.

43
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,000
No need to worry about our route.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,360
As soon as we form an alliance with Chen,

45
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,020
they'll send us their best horses.

46
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,639
After the marriage alliance,

47
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,359
they'll send us 1,000 horses of the best quality.

48
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,199
If we have strong horses,

49
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,300
we can shorten the travel time.

50
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,039
Your Highness, you can't go in.

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,540
- Let me inform His Majesty first.
- Move aside.

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,800
They cannot get married.

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,540
They cannot get married. I don't agree with it.

54
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,959
Insolent fool.

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,820
Do you think I need your agreement for this marriage alliance?

56
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,960
Father, I love Zhao Yun.

57
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,540
I want to marry Zhao Yun.

58
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,720
You can't let her marry Prince Zhenbei.

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,300
What happened?

60
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,159
Father, at the imperial garden today,

61
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,700
Prince Zhenbei has proposed to Zhao Yun in public.

62
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,200
I don't think that we need Chen's support

63
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,720
to fight the war against Wei.

64
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,860
Besides, I don't agree to form an alliance through marriage.

65
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,559
This marriage alliance is already a done deal.

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,940
Moreover, I've already promised him to let him choose his own bride.

67
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,759
Since he has chosen Zhao Yun,

68
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,260
I'll keep my promise to him.

69
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,740
I won't go back on my words.

70
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,300
Uncle, please help me change my father's mind.

71
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,359
Your Majesty, I think we still have room to save this situation.

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,940
Prince Zhenbei doesn't know the ladies here well enough.

73
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,359
If you tell him that...

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,940
Princess Zhao Yun is already engaged to Prince Chen,

75
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,820
I'm sure that Prince Zhenbei won't force her to marry him.

76
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,159
That's right. You are right, Uncle.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,479
Father, please tell Prince Zhenbei that...

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,540
Zhao Yun belongs to me.

79
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,100
Your Majesty.

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,079
The envoy of Prince Zhenbei has requested to meet Your Majesty.

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,460
- Let him in.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,799
Greetings, Emperor of Northern Lin.

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,340
Please be at ease.

84
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,439
Why are you here, envoy?

85
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,199
Prince Zhenbei has chosen Princess Zhao Yun as his bride.

86
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,599
As soon as they are married,

87
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,559
we will act up to our agreement...

88
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,959
and send 1,000 horses of the best quality to Northern Lin...

89
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,439
with an extra 100 horses.

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,919
Aren't there any women in Chen?

91
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Why did you come here to take away ours?

92
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,359
Father.

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,199
When we form a marriage alliance with Western Qi,

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,039
they had promised us to hold up their end of the bargain.

95
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,820
But until now, they have paid no heed to the deal.

96
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,479
We've already learned a lesson from the alliance with Western Qi.

97
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,940
We can't make the same mistake again with Chen.

98
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,559
Emperor of Northern Lin,

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,479
if Northern Lin violates this marriage alliance,

100
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,059
Prince Zhenbei will return to Chen immediately.

101
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:13,460
And thus, I'll bid my farewell with Your Majesty in his stead.

102
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,260
Thank you for your cordial hospitality.

103
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,039
Please inform Prince Zhenbei.

104
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,320
Since I've agreed to this marriage alliance, I won't go back on my words.

105
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,450
Princess Zhao Yun will be the bride for this alliance

106
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,030
and she'll travel to Chen in two days' time.

107
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,599
Please ask Prince Zhenbei...

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,759
to carry out his promise immediately.

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,200
Thank you for your generosity.

110
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,439
Father, for the marriage alliance with Western Qi,

111
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
you've already sacrificed Wuyou's happiness.

112
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,359
Now, for the marriage alliance with Chen,

113
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
you've sacrificed my happiness.

114
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,839
If we lose in the war against Wei,

115
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,180
are you going to sacrifice another child's happiness to form a marriage alliance with Wei?

116
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,039
How dare you! How dare you question me!

117
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,719
You are the one who didn't make clear about your relationship with Zhao Yun.

118
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,359
Now, Prince Zhenbei has beaten you to it.

119
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,180
Now, you want to question me about sacrificing you?

120
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,140
Even if I do, it'll be my right to sacrifice you.

121
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,559
As my son, you've enjoyed a life of luxury.

122
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,399
It's time for you to take up your duty as a prince.

123
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,280
Father!

124
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,140
I've never wanted to be a prince.

125
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,799
If I had a choice,

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,280
I'd rather be a commoner.

127
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,639
I want a father who loves and adores me.

128
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,119
I want a father who will put my happiness first...

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,199
and not a high and mighty emperor who cares only about power and benefits.

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,620
You!

131
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,359
Wuyu, calm down.

132
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,959
Don't be so childish.

133
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,040
Wuyou.

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,580
You are so calm and collected.

135
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,860
But why couldn't you stop Man Yao from getting married back then?

136
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,639
You argued so hard with Father...

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,999
to try to stop this marriage alliance.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,039
But do you know that this form of alliance...

139
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,260
has been here for hundreds of years?

140
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,719
You want to change it all by yourself?

141
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,460
Am I the one being childish or are you the one being naive and proud?

142
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,759
Wuyu.

143
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,519
Even if Prince Zhenbei didn't choose Zhao Yun today,

144
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,240
I'd still stand up and protest this marriage alliance.

145
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,340
Wuyou, can we prioritize our problems first?

146
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,039
Now, we can't even stop Zhao Yun from getting married for this alliance.

147
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,559
Do you think it's the right time to talk about our protest?

148
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,279
This is absurd. I haven't even fought against Wei...

149
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,679
and both of you are already fighting with each other.

150
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,359
If both of you are fighting each other,

151
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,680
how are we going to fight against our enemies together?

152
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,679
Wuyu, stop rubbing salt onto your brother's wound.

153
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,279
Wuyou, your brother has spoken those words in a fit of rage.

154
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,380
Don't take it to your heart.

155
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,839
Your Majesty, your sons are still young and full of passion.

156
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,639
They aren't able to understand your difficulties for the moment.

157
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,519
Please forgive them.

158
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,519
Father, you were once young and full of passion, too.

159
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,039
Have you forgotten about those wild things that you did for Lady Yun back then?

160
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,900
Scoundrel!

161
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,999
Xuan Ming, I have to put our nation first.

162
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,599
You are their uncle.

163
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
Why didn't you help me discipline them well?

164
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,159
It's my fault for not teaching them well enough.

165
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,119
The same goes for you, Wuyou.

166
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,799
Your brother spends most of his time with you.

167
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,519
And he had only learned all the bad from you.

168
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,679
Both of you came to me to make a huge scene...

169
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,200
because of a woman! How disgraceful!

170
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,679
Wuyou, go and get your brother back...

171
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,420
in case he does something absurd.

172
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, Father.

173
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,520
Your Majesty, calm down.

174
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,319
Zhao Yun!

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,039
I'm here, Zhao Yun!

176
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,879
Come out now! I'm here for you now!

177
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,560
Zhao Yun!

178
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,759
- Who are you?
- I'm here for Zhao Yun.

179
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,319
Who are you to knock on the door so late at night?

180
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,679
Who are you?

181
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,559
You are looking for Zhao Yun? I'm her step-aunt.

182
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,239
Her servant before this has become paralyzed.

183
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,439
Useless wench.

184
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,559
- She's always with shady people.
- Who are you calling wench?

185
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,479
Say it again if you dare!

186
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,500
Let go of him.

187
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,199
Why wouldn't I dare to say it?

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,119
Since young, that wench has stayed for free in our manor.

189
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,479
Others will think that how glorious it is...

190
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,919
to have a princess in our manor.

191
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,839
But she's just a person who lives off others.

192
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,559
She doesn't even know how to serve tea.

193
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,119
She's worse than a servant.

194
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,279
I've asked her to learn something...

195
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,839
so that she can marry well one day.

196
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,780
But she always went out to play.

197
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,260
I'm just hoping to marry her off as soon as possible.

198
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,399
I want her gone as far as possible.

199
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,239
If you dare make her leave, I'll make you leave first!

200
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,079
Let go of me!

201
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,560
Stop!

202
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,279
Let go of me!

203
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,940
- Release me!
- Let go of him!

204
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,119
Where is Zhao Yun?

205
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,039
I heard that Prince Zhenbei from Chen has chosen her as his bride.

206
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,159
Maybe she has already eloped with that prince.

207
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,199
Is it Zhao Yun?

208
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,839
Just some uncultured men that Zhao Yun knows.

209
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,240
Do they think they are some kind of royalty?

210
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,860
Greetings, Prince Li. Greetings, Prince Chen.

211
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,559
Prince Li.

212
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,379
So, this is how you treat Zhao Yun usually.

213
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,600
I won't forgive you!

214
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,919
From now on, Princess Zhao Yun will be my sister.

215
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,919
She has nothing to do with you anymore.

216
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,999
If you dare pester her again,

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,599
I will punish you severely.

218
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,199
Thank you for your generosity, Your Highness.

219
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,719
- Go back.
- Yes, Your Highness.

220
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,000
- Quick, let's go.
- Let's go.

221
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,779
Go and find Zhao Yun.

222
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,090
I'll meet Ning Qianyi in the inn tomorrow morning.

223
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,819
Wuyou, when we were at the royal study just now,

224
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,799
I was in a fit of rage.

225
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,219
So, please don't take my words seriously.

226
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,419
If I took all of your words seriously,

227
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,680
I would have had a heart attack a long time ago.

228
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,640
You are the best, Wuyou.

229
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,539
Don't worry. We still have time to fix this.

230
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,320
Don't be anxious.

231
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,019
Prince Zhenbei has really chosen Zhao Yun as his bride?

232
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,079
Yes, he has chosen Princess Zhao Yun.

233
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,719
I heard that Prince Zhenbei had brought along...

234
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,139
a very valuable treasure from Chen with him.

235
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,139
And it's a priceless horsewhip.

236
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,919
And he had proposed to Princess Zhao Yun in public.

237
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,959
Her Majesty and the other ladies were present as well.

238
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,919
So were Prince Li and Prince Chen.

239
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,039
That horsewhip is really a treasure of his.

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,019
Looks like Zhao Yun had guessed correctly.

241
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,520
I never thought that it would turn out like this.

242
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,540
No. I can't let Zhao Yun be married off to Chen.

243
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,920
Greetings, General Fu.

244
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,639
Get her another bowl of medicine.

245
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,160
Yes, Sir.

246
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,600
You've decided to go and meet Prince Zhenbei?

247
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,619
Prince Zhenbei has sent his envoy to formally announce it in the court today.

248
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:12,079
After two days, he'll leave together with Princess Zhao Yun.

249
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,159
Prince Zhenbei is the one who holds the true power in Chen.

250
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,839
He won't easily change his mind for the decision that he had made.

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,039
Do you think there's still a chance to fix this?

252
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,139
But the one going to Chen is Princess Zhao Yun. I can't just look on unconcerned.

253
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,180
How are you going to stop him?

254
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,300
Don't forget. You are the princess of Western Qi.

255
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,140
If you want to meddle in this and stand against this marriage alliance,

256
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,400
you'll be representing Western Qi to put a spoke in their wheels.

257
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,719
Not only will you not be able to save Princess Zhao Yun,

258
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,279
you'll make this problem even muddier.

259
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,499
Moreover, if Princess Zhao Yun is not willing to be married to Chen,

260
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm sure that Prince Li will do his best to help her.

261
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,119
Don't tell me that you don't trust Zongzheng Wuyou?

262
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,639
What happened today is not what you think it is.

263
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,359
- We...
- The truth is not important.

264
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,119
If you still treat me as your husband and have some feelings towards me,

265
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,479
listen to my advice.

266
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,820
Don't meddle with Prince Zhenbei's... marriage alliance.

267
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,559
Princess.

268
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,839
Don't you think that the general has been a bit strange lately?

269
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,879
His personal bodyguard, Xiang Ying, is gone.

270
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,380
Now, his personal bodyguard is a man named Chang Jian.

271
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,640
- Princess Zhao Yun.
- Princess Rong Le.

272
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,679
Sister Chen Yu.

273
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,039
Princess Rong Le is not coming today?

274
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,079
Princess Zhao Yun, it's late already.

275
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,359
I think she will not come today.

276
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,060
You can find her in General's Manor.

277
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,230
I don't want to go there.

278
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,359
Although General Fu looks like a caring and tender person...

279
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,279
and I don't know why,

280
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,439
I always feel that he'll lose his temper suddenly.

281
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,359
The way he holds himself in check is so scary.

282
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,480
If you have anything urgent, I can go there to help you convey it.

283
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,300
I don't think Princess Rong Le can help me with it.

284
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,199
Even Brother Wuyou can't help me with it.

285
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,999
I just want to have a talk with Princess Rong Le.

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,599
In my heart,

287
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,720
Princess Rong Le is the only one I can share my thought with.

288
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,839
If you don't mind,

289
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,820
you can pour out your heart's content to me.

290
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,020
I promise that I won't tell it to anybody else.

291
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,580
Are you troubled by the marriage alliance with Prince Zhenbei?

292
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,060
I only realized that I have no one to turn to.

293
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,679
I really wished that I had my parents by my side.

294
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,880
I'm sure that they'll do their best to fight for me.

295
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,140
But I'm glad that they are gone now.

296
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,440
Or else, they'd have to send me away and not be able to do anything.

297
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,559
So, you are just like me.

298
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,400
I've lost my parents since young, too.

299
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,240
Actually, I was forced to be in a public house because I had no other choice.

300
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,420
I have no choice but to mingle with all sorts of people.

301
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,740
Many times, I'd dreamed that my parents were still alive.

302
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,680
But if they saw me like this now,

303
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,720
they'd be very disappointed in me.

304
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,500
Do you have a person that you like?

305
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,359
I do have someone.

306
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,359
And it's beyond just liking him.

307
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,399
Then you can understand my feelings now.

308
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,439
I really want to go and meet the person that I like.

309
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,799
But when I was already at the door of his manor just now,

310
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,320
I didn't dare to go in to meet him.

311
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,140
I understand what you are feeling now, Princess Zhao Yun.

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,880
It has been so long since I last saw the person that I like.

313
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,919
I heard that he has came back to Zhongshan recently.

314
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,919
I really want to meet him, but I'm afraid to.

315
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,540
Because...

316
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,080
Because I...

317
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,380
Is something troubling you?

318
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,679
Princess Zhao Yun.

319
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,479
Whenever I'm suffering beyond reason,

320
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,119
I'll play my zither.

321
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,720
How about I play a song for you?

322
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,520
Wuyu. are you looking for me?

323
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,880
[Southern City Inn]

324
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,239
- Stop.
- Fool. How dare you block Prince Li's way.

325
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:18,100
Please notify Prince Zhenbei that I would like to meet him.

326
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,519
Greetings, Prince Li.

327
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,239
Prince Zhenbei is not in the inn today.

328
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,399
But he has instructed me that if you come, I am to tell you that...

329
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,079
he has gone to pay his respect to a late friend in Northern Lin.

330
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,679
Pay his respect to a late friend?

331
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,639
And he purposely let me know about it?

332
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,959
Could it be that...

333
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,599
I heard that before this, Lady Yun and Sir Qin Yong...

334
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,660
had carried out a People-Based Transformation.

335
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,520
Leng Yan, tell Wuyu that we'll devise a plan after I meet Prince Zhenbei.

336
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,800
Yes, Your Highness.

337
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,000
[Yun's Tomb]

338
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,919
I've waited for you for quite some time.

339
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,479
Would you give me the honor...

340
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,119
to drink this jar of wine with me...

341
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,660
while we pay our respects and pour out our hearts to each other?

342
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,720
I've made a swear not to drink wine ever again in this lifetime.

343
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,279
Are you here today to persuade me to give up on Zhao Yun?

344
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,680
Yes.

345
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,879
I've also sworn to myself that...

346
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,319
if I ever get to meet a lady that I love,

347
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,519
I'll give her a life of happiness.

348
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,439
Since I've already met her,

349
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,679
there's no reason for me to give up.

350
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,859
But if both of us can drink to our hearts' content together today,

351
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,520
I might be open to your suggestions.

352
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,879
If you are not willing to do that,

353
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,140
I'll have to take my leave then.

354
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,660
Drinking wine is too common.

355
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,319
I wonder if you are willing to play something...

356
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,039
more exciting and different with me.

357
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,140
If the wine in my cup falls to the ground first,

358
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,079
I lose. And I'll honor your choice.

359
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,819
But if the wine in your cup falls to the ground first,

360
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,960
I won't force you to change your mind.

361
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,080
I just hope that you can listen to my suggestions.

362
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,080
Interesting.

363
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,199
You are indeed an outstanding person.

364
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,280
I admit my defeat.

365
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,240
[Yun's Tomb]

366
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,579
How are you planning to persuade me?

367
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,680
I'm all ears.

368
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,039
You said that you wanted to give Zhao Yun a life of happiness.

369
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,079
But have you asked Zhao Yun...

370
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,560
whether or not she is willing to hand herself to you?

371
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,080
Maybe Zhao Yun's heart belongs to another right now,

372
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,359
but if I can't see for myself that she is really happy,

373
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,780
I won't give up.

374
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,560
Because I don't want to be like you...

375
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,519
who sits back and does nothing...

376
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,559
while the one you love...

377
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,759
is deeply stuck in an ominous marriage.

378
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,840
Do you think your self-scarification...

379
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,020
can bring her happiness?

380
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,320
If I could bring her happiness by force,

381
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,820
do you really think that I wouldn't try it?

382
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,920
On her wedding day,

383
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,300
I had wreaked havoc in her wedding...

384
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,559
and brought her by force to this Yun's Tomb.

385
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,680
I've kept her here for three days and three nights.

386
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,180
At first, I thought that as long as we loved each other,

387
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,080
nothing could draw us apart.

388
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,820
But after that, I realized that...

389
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,220
it's not others who had drawn us apart.

390
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,559
We are the ones who did that.

391
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,640
Both of you did that to yourselves?

392
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,199
What do you mean by that?

393
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,000
You asked me before whether I regret it or not.

394
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,540
I can answer that right now.

395
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,060
I regret it.

396
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,280
But my regret is not about...

397
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,500
me not stopping her from getting married to others back then.

398
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,160
My regret is that when I met her back then,

399
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,020
I didn't treat her wholeheartedly.

400
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,639
I had lied to her...

401
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
and I had used her.

402
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
My actions will always be a painful wound between us.

403
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,239
And even now, that pain won't go away.

404
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,040
But I don't plan to trick or use Zhao Yun.

405
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,940
My love for her is sincere.

406
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,359
Your Highness.

407
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,739
If you are sincere,

408
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,999
why don't you let her make her own choice?

409
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,180
Let her make the decision herself.

410
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,100
Princess Zhao Yun, are you waiting for the one in your heart?

411
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,679
When he arrives, are you going to go with him?

412
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,239
Although I really want to meet him,

413
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:02,300
I don't know how to choose.

414
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,520
Sister Chen Yu, what should I do?

415
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,119
Actually, it can be very simple.

416
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,000
You can choose to marry Prince Zhenbei.

417
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,999
I've been to Chen once.

418
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,599
And I've heard about Prince Zhenbei's character.

419
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,359
Not only is he an open and aboveboard gentleman,

420
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,599
he's a very generous prince.

421
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,979
And he will be the emperor of Chen one day.

422
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:31,579
And as his empress, you'll hold ultimate power and status.

423
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:34,640
I don't care about all of those things.

424
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,720
I've already gotten used to being treated coldly.

425
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,180
All right.

426
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,439
Then you can choose to be with the person you like.

427
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,920
But you have to pay a price for that.

428
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,539
Not only do you have to sacrifice your power, wealth, and status,

429
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,159
you might even lose your life.

430
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,119
I want to be with him.

431
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,100
But I don't want him to sacrifice himself for me.

432
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,779
Princess Zhao Yun.

433
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,700
Although you're from a noble family and you're used to a comfortable life,

434
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,479
if you want to choose your own happiness and get a grip on your own life,

435
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,919
sooner or later, you have to learn how to deal with the consequences of your choice.

436
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,440
Zhao Yun!

437
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,940
Brother Wuyu!

438
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,120
Zhao Yun. Finally, I've found you.

439
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,799
What is it? Where are Zhao Yun and Wuyu?

440
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,059
I've failed my duty. When I reach here, they had already left.

441
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,019
The only thing I found is this letter from Princess Zhao Yun's room...

442
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:48,780
together with this wooden box.

443
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,539
Brother Wuyou, I've already made up my mind.

444
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:56,999
Take care. Don't miss me too much.

445
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,600
From Zhao Yun.

446
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,700
My heart is with another. Please forgive me.

447

Li Wu.

448
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,199
Yes, Your Highness? What do you need?

449
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:16,139
Inform the emperor of Northern Lin that I wish to meet him.

450
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:17,480
Yes, Your Highness.

451
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,479
- Your Highness.
- Prince Li.

452
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,159
Just now, in Yun's Tomb,

453
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,939
you put in so much effort to persuade me to give Zhao Yun a chance to choose.

454
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:31,180
Now, it looks like I've never had any chance since the beginning.

455
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,120
The bride that I want has eloped with another man.

456
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,539
Looks like I can only be a tyrant that forces my will against a lady.

457
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:41,899
Your Highness,

458
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:44,699
since Zhao Yun has already eloped with another man,

459
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:46,879
it means that she has already made her choice.

460
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:49,199
I hope that you can give them your blessing.

461
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,919
Give them my blessing?

462
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,559
Do you think that a man who is so sloppy...

463
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,399
and doesn't even care for Zhao Yun's reputation...

464
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,420
can bring her any sort of happiness?

465
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,839
As long as you are willing to travel the world with me,

466
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,260
I'm willing to give up everything for you.

467
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,070
[It's To No Avail Being Together Without Harmony]

468
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,759
I'll leave it to you then, General Fu.

469
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:35,239
I'll try my best to bring them back.

470
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:37,719
Rest assured, Prince Zhenbei.

471

Wuyu has eloped together with Zhao Yun.

482
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,979
Had you already known about it or were you even a part of it?

483
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,500
Father, I didn't know that they'd do that.

484
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,199
But Wuyu and Zhao Yun are still young and hot-headed.

485
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:53,279
Their actions are pardonable.

486
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,119
Pardonable?

487
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,399
As my son, he has no regards for the greater good of our nation.

488
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,799
He made off with the princess meant for the alliance.

489
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,100
Do you think that Prince Zhenbei can accept it just because their action is pardonable?

490
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,340
Father.

491
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,199
Please allow me to chase after Zhao Yun and Wuyu.

492
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:14,780
No need.

493
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,200
I've already ordered General Fu to bring them back.

494
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,339
And I've already promised Prince Zhenbei...

495
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,799
that the marriage alliance will proceed as planned.

496
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,979
In two days' time, Princess Zhao Yun will be married off to Chen.

497
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:31,980
But, Father, it's already very clear that Fu Chou has colluded with Western Qi.

498
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,899
Western Qi has every intention to prevent our alliance with Chen.

499
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:39,960
I'm worried that if Fu Chou is tasked with this,

500
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,679
their lives might be at risk.

501
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,020
I'm worried about that, too.

502
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,439
But Prince Zhenbei has specifically appointed General Fu to bring them back to him.

503
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:52,519
He even threatens me that he'll cancel this alliance with us...

504
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,039
and form an alliance with Western Qi instead.

505
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,359
Father.

506
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,479
Chen knows that we are impatient to start the war and we need immediate help.

507
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:02,520
That's why he is so arrogant.

508
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,399
If we are willing to change our plan for the war against Wei...

509
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,759
or think of another alternative,

510
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,679
Chen wouldn't dare to threaten Northern Lin.

511
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,860
You have a solution?

512
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,959
Do you have any solution that doesn't need Chen's horses?

513
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,879
Father, when I was in Qingzhou,

514
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:21,819
besides taking in refugees to reclaim wasteland to support themselves,

515
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:24,019
I've asked them to train up some soldiers and horses.

516
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:26,740
And it's quite a success.

517
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,639
As long as you are willing to delay this war,

518
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:33,120
I'm sure that I can solve this problem about horses.

519
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,679
We can't delay this war against Wei anymore.

520
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:43,400
But we can let Prince Zhenbei know about this.

521
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,159
I want to let him know that I'm not helpless.

522
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,600
I won't be threatened easily by him.

523
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,840
But I'll have to put Wuyu through this.

524
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,279
In this world, are there any fathers...

525
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:00,679
who don't wish for their sons' happiness?

526
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,559
I'm the emperor of this country.

527
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,660
But I can do nothing when it comes to my son's happiness.

528
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:12,500
Father, although Prince Zhenbei is a shrewd person,

529
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,719
he is not an unreasonable person.

530
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:18,720
I think there might still be room to fix this marriage alliance.

531
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,279
Father, let me bring back Wuyu and Zhao Yun.

532
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:25,679
When the time comes, I'll deal with Prince Zhenbei directly.

533
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,039
Trust me.

534
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,000
I promise that I can solve this issue perfectly.

535
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,099
If I had known, I would have brought some food along from the manor.

536
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,879
Not only did you not bring any food,

537
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,799
you didn't even bring any money.

538
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,879
Even if we are able to get away from pursuing troops,

539
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:00,719
we'll be starved to death.

540
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:03,439
This is my first time eloping.

541
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:05,199
I don't have any experience.

542
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,499
And I was too excited.

543
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:09,580
But look, I managed to catch a fish. Right?

544
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,219
Did you really catch it?

545
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,279
The fish is dead because it hit its head.

546
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:15,479
Just be thankful for this blind fish.

547
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:18,580
Or else, we'd be starving ourselves tonight.

548
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,479
Don't worry. I won't let my wife starve to death.

549
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,619
Didn't I tell you that I'm your fish?

550
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:29,940
You can catch me anytime you want.

551
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,739
If you can't catch a fish, you can catch me.

552
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:37,060
Who is your wife? Who is your wife?

553
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,719
Who wants to catch a fish like you?

554
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,780
Be careful with this fish.

555
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,780
Wuyu,

556
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,119
if we really managed to escape from pursuing troops,

557
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,159
we won't be a prince and princess anymore.

558
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,639
Are you going to regret it?

559
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,879
Are you going to miss the wealthy life in your prince manor?

560
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:01,959
From now on, there will be no prince and princess,

561
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:06,420
no wealth and status, and no duties for the country.

562
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,500
In our world,

563
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,460
there will be only me and you.

564
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,699
From now on, we'll be homeless.

565
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,000
The world will be our home.

566
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,559
- We have to drift from place to place.
- The world will be our friends then.

567
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,720
We have to sleep under the stars.

568
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,540
I've always loved a challenge.

569
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,640
Let's go.

570
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,120
Prince Chen.

571
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,339
His Majesty has ordered Princess Zhao Yun to be married to Chen.

572
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,119
I'm here with an order to bring her back.

573
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,219
Please don't make things difficult for me.

574
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:14,679
Stop with the nonsense.

575
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,639
If you want to bring her back today,

576
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,799
you have to go through my dead body.

577
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:21,999
Please reconsider, Prince Chen and Princess Zhao Yun.

578
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:26,220
This is not just a love story between two love birds.

579
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,899
This will affect the safety of the people in Northern Lin.

580
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:31,319
When Prince Zhenbei heard that Princess Zhao Yun had ran away,

581
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:34,500
he was already on the brink to renounce the alliance.

582
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,640
Wuyu, this has become something so serious.

583
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,160
What should we do?

584
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,280
Zhao Yun, don't listen to his nonsense.

585
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,760
I don't believe it.

586
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,099
Northern Lin is a big country.

587
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:51,539
Will all of them die just because you and I are not there?

588
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:53,759
I will bring Zhao Yun away from here today.

589
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:57,379
I want to see what Prince Zhenbei can do to me.

590
00:36:57,379 --> 00:36:59,879
Since both of you are so stubborn,

591
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:02,159
please don't blame me for my actions.

592
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,960
Arrest them.

593
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,820
Let's go!

594
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,480
Wuyou.

595
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,679
Are you here to help me...

596
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,140
bring them back to the palace?

597
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,699
Or are you going to defy the emperor's order and let them leave?

598
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,599
I'm here on the emperor's order...

599
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,119
to bring them back safely to the palace.

600
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,759
Fu Chou, I believe that His Majesty asked you to bring them back.

601
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,559
He didn't ask you to kill them.

602
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,359
Don't you know that a sword doesn't choose its victim?

603
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,559
If they follow us back willingly,

604
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,959
I would never have to hurt them.

605
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:36,000
I hope that you can change Prince Chen's mind.

606
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,559
Wuyou, how could Father send him to bring us back?

607
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,759
Does he really have the heart to take us back?

608
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:44,499
Brother Wuyou, is it really that serious?

609
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,619
Wuyu is hurt. What should we do?

610
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,879
Zhao Yun. Wuyu. Listen to me.

611
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,999
Go back to the palace first. I'll deal with Prince Zhenbei myself.

612
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,419
I'm not going to go back!

613
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:55,799
Wuyou, are you here to help us or catch us?

614
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,199
- Wuyu.
- Wuyou.

615
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,420
Do you have the heart to let us repeat after you and Man Yao?

616
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,420
Looks like you can't change Prince Chen's mind.

617
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,360
Let's go!

618
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,400
Don't blame me for doing my job.

619
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,200
Wuyu!

620
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,139
Wuyu, why are you so foolish?

621
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,860
Dummy, don't cry.

622
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:58,079
I said that I wouldn't let you get hurt even if my life is at stake.

623
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,360
I don't want you to die.

624
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,820
I want you to live well.

625
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,420
I'll go back with you.

626
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,360
No!

627
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,360
Zhao Yun! Zhao Yun!

628
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,960
Zhao Yun!

629
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,870
[It's To No Avail Being Together Without Harmony]

630
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,300
Greetings, Father.

631
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,239
Be at ease.

632
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:23,319
Father, I've brought Zhao Yun back in one piece.

633
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:26,479
As for Wuyu, although he's seriously hurt,

634
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,439
he's still kneeling in front of the Great Hall.

635
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:29,999
Please forgive him.

636
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,820
He's hurt?

637
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,059
General Fu, didn't I already remind you...

638
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,159
to bring them back in one piece?

639
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,060
It's my fault.

640
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,299
When I asked Prince Chen to come back,

641
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:47,079
he had opposed very strongly to it.

642
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,920
He even fought with my men.

643
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
I've already advised him kindly, but he still got hurt in the end.

644
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,120
Wuyou, now that you've brought them back,

645
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,759
how are you going to negotiate with Prince Zhenbei?

646
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:02,620
Your Majesty,

647
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,520
I'm willing to marry Prince Zhenbei of Chen.

648
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,900
Please allow me to do so.

649
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,699
Zhao Yun, we can still turn the tables.

650
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,600
Don't act rashly.

651
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,380
Brother Wuyou,

652
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,879
if my marriage can bring safety to the people of Northern Lin,

653
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:23,199
if it can ensure your safety,

654
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,499
Wuyu, and Princess Rong Le,

655
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:28,979
I'm willing to do it without any complaints.

656
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,519
Zhao Yun.

657
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,999
This is a serious matter regarding the alliance of two countries.

658
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:36,660
Once you've agreed, there'll be no turning back for you.

659
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,799
Your Majesty, I've already made up my mind. I won't go back on my words.

660
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,720
All right.

661
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,639
I'll confer you the title of Royal Princess Zhao Yun immediately.

662
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:49,100
And you'll be married off to Chen in two days' time.

663
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,290
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

664
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:31,760
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

665
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:40,360
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

666
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,850
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

667
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,870
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

668
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:58,270
♫ You are keeping me out with your care,
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

669
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:02,830
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

670
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:07,490
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

671
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:16,450
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

672
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:21,500
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

673
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,730
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

674
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:35,470
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

675
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:40,630
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

676
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,240
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

677
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:54,390
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

678
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,220
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

679
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,560
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

680
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:16,620
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
