[Episode 31]

2
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,780
Why do you keep following me? You are going wherever I go.

3
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,860
Can't you make your own decision? This is not fun at all.

4
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,220
Aren't you just going to gather the herbs?

5
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,960
Your Highness, there is movement at General Fu's manor.

6
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,699
- What is it?
- Miss Xiao just came out. The guards are following her.

7
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,760
That fool.

8
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,460
Let's go.

9
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,859
Miss Xiao, you are going to the eastern outskirts.

10
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:52,380
How did we end up in the western part of the city?

11
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,419
I didn't mention the eastern outskirts. I said western outskirts.

12
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:58,480
Did you hear that? Did you get it?

13
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,159
Listen closely. I am going to the western outskirts for herbs.

14
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,400
It's the bamboo forest on the western outskirts.

15
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,460
Let's go and gather some herbs!

16
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,380
Hey, pay for that!

17
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,080
What is taking him so long?

18
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,760
Where is she?

19
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,640
Search for her! Don't let her get away!

20
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,190
Yes!

21
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,000
- Split up and search!
- Yes!

22
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,959
You actually came here.

23
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,180
Of course.

24
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,780
With my wits, I can easily tell you were in trouble.

25
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,980
So, I came to your rescue.

26
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,479
You silly girl, what have you got yourself into?

27
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,580
Why are the guards after you?

28
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,919
How would I know what they want with me?

29
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,679
They started following me after I came out from the manor. I couldn't shake them off.

30
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,900
The same goes for the garden entrance. Soldiers are blocking it.

31
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,219
I have been locked up for three days. I must come out before boredom kills me.

32
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,679
What about Man Yao?

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,959
She can't get out. She sent me to get help.

34
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,639
I saw you at the market and I thought you could help.

35
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,579
Nicely done. You actually know I can help you.

36
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,840
But judging from the circumstances, there is no other way.

37
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,720
We must charge right in there.

38
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,659
While Fu Chou is gone, I can get reinforcements and save Man Yao.

39
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,500
Okay, I will inform the princess right away.

40
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,719
Where are you going? Why would you want to go back into that hellhole?

41
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,680
Come with me.

42
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,200
What is taking Xiao Ke so long?

43
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,080
Maybe she has been compromised.

44
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,239
What do we do now?

45
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Xiao Ke was our last hope to get help.

46
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,719
I can't just wait here. I need to escape.

47
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,119
This is still a safe place. You can stay here for now.

48
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,999
Your Highness, you are going by yourself?

49
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,300
Yes.

50
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,199
Wait here. I will find a way to get you out of here.

51
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,440
Be careful.

52
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,680
[General's Mansion]

53
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,599
Prince Chen, what is the meaning of this?

54
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,860
Someone broke into my house.

55
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,839
I have been tracking the thief. I found out the thief is in General Fu's manor.

56
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,719
Stand aside, I am going in for investigation.

57
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,340
I am afraid you are mistaken.

58
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,999
Your house is heavily guarded, why would anyone break in?

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,799
What thief would be bold enough to hide in here?

60
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,359
I saw it with my own eyes. I am certain of it.

61
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,799
I must search this manor.

62
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,380
Don't you dare get into my way!

63
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,660
Search!

64
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,600
- Search!
- Yes!

65
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
Someone is in here.

66
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,620
Come out!

67
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,039
- Come!
- Let go of me!

68
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,060
Your Highness, we found a girl.

69
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,439
Ling Yue?

70
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,319
- Let go of her.
- Prince Chen.

71
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,060
- Where is Man Yao?
- She couldn't wait for help,

72
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,959
so she got out on her own.

73
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,160
She escaped?

74
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,739
If she is in a hurry to leave, it must be about something important.

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,120
Could it be about my brother?

76
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,610
[To Recieve One Hundred Blessing at the Door]

77
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,559
No one is living in this shack.

78
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,660
Why is someone sending food here?

79
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:55,100
[Purple Clouds Give Auspicious Light]
("Purple Cloud" is an auspicious portent in astrology)

80
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,320
Young Master, have some food.

81
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,940
Fu Chou?

82
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,159
Isn't he on the march with His Majesty?

83
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,040
Why is he still here?

84
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,920
How was his resolve after I left?

85
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,319
Did he waver?

86
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,839
Not at all.

87
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,700
He longed for that position.

88
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,899
Now that the opportunity presented itself, he will surely hold onto it.

89
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,060
Young Master.

90
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,160
He is much more avaricious than we expected.

91
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,020
If he gets what he wants eventually,

92
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,820
not only will he kill Zongzheng Wuyou,

93
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,340
your life will be at risk too.

94
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,559
He wants to kill me? I doubt...

95
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,160
he is capable of that.

96
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,100
Keep an eye on that crown prince.

97
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,980
This is the moment when all of our patience is tested.

98
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,759
Tell him to be patient.

99
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,900
I don't want him to ruin my plan.

100
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,540
I understand. You need not worry.

101
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,000
What's the matter? How is your wound?

102
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,380
It's been years. I'll be fine.

103
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,359
I believe this will be the last time.

104
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,540
Soon, Zongzheng Wuyou will experience the pain I suffered.

105
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,279
It's been over two decades,

106
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,840
over seven thousand nights.

107
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,420
Not a second goes by without me waiting for this day to come.

108
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,919
- He and his father owe me this.
- Xiang Ying?

109
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,280
Lady Rong Le, come with me.

110
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,599
I am sorry but you must hide in here for now.

111
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,439
Ling Yue is still at the manor. Can you get her out of there?

112
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:10,260
General Fu will soon realize that you are gone.

113
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,040
The manor will be heavily secured. I doubt I can even get inside.

114
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,519
But don't worry. Ling Yue is your friend, General Fu won't hurt her.

115
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,879
You have my thanks.

116
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,919
Please, do not say that. Like I said, your wish is my command.

117
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,800
I will not regret my decision.

118
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,679
After the attack at Lake Qingliang,

119
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,640
General Fu punished me.

120
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,719
He left me at the shack.

121
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,540
No one came to my help.

122
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,960
Xiang Ying?

123
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,320
Xiang Ying? Xiang Ying?

124
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,100
You were following Fu Chou's order for the attack.

125
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,599
But I never thought he would hurt you so badly.

126
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,159
This is too much for a punishment.

127
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,620
It's his order.

128
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,580
He wants me to keep you safe at all costs.

129
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,359
I failed my duty and failed to protect you.

130
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,820
I deserve this punishment.

131
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,500
I have no complaints about it.

132
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,940
But you saved me despite what I did in the past.

133
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,980
I am eternally grateful.

134
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,840
From now on, I shall follow you.

135
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,620
I will give it my all to serve you.

136
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,820
Xiang Ying, did you know Fu Chou was still here?

137
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,540
I didn't know.

138
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,839
He secretly came back and hid in the shack.

139
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,380
What is he planning?

140
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,140
He no longer trusts me.

141
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,239
I have no access to this important information.

142
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,220
Do you know anything about his background?

143
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,060
I swear I will serve you to repay your kindness.

144
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,000
I can do whatever it takes to fulfill your order.

145
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,599
But he was once the master I swore to serve.

146
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,380
The general's past... is not something I can betray for you.

147
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,450
Very well, I shall not pry.

148
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,080
Get up.

149
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,120
I have an important favor to ask of you.

150
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,380
This is the tactical layout plan I found in Fu Chou's study.

151
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,780
The troops deployed inside and outside the capital are marked.

152
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,500
I overheard Fu Chou's conversation with Hen Xiang.

153
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,999
They have an agreement with the crown prince for a mutiny.

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800
What is your next plan?

155
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,140
I need to stop this.

156
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,900
- You want to expose his plan?
- No.

157
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,240
I must stop this tragedy from happening.

158
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,980
No matter how carefully planned a mutiny is,

159
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,500
there are sure to be casualties.

160
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,020
Bring this and rush to Prince Li. Tell him what happened.

161
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,380
What about you?

162
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,160
I am going to the main camp and will talk to His Majesty.

163
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,760
Okay.

164
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,380
I will do as you ordered.

165
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,120
Please, watch your back.

166
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,400
Rong Le must have gone to the south for Wuyou.

167
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,119
Bring her back to me.

168
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,780
If you fail, only death awaits you.

169
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,500
Yes.

170
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,640
Why isn't His Highness here yet?

171
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,620
The court started hours ago.

172
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,540
Yet the crown prince is still absent.

173
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,660
What exactly happened?

174
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,100
Right, what happened?

175
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,240
Crown Prince arrives!

176
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,760
Long live the Crown Prince.

177
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,060
At ease.

178
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

179
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,060
I stayed up all night to read through your scrolls.

180
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,380
My father's duty is not an easy task.

181
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,020
As his son, I couldn't do much to help him.

182
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,300
That is indeed my fault.

183
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,740
You made it sound so noble.

184
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
You were clearly drunk last night.

185
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,660
I bet you couldn't wake up this morning.

186
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,980
- You...
- Isn't that right?

187
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,620
Ever since His Majesty left with the army,

188
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,040
the Eastern Palace has been filled with joy and ecstasy.

189
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,380
Do you really think no one would find out?

190
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,520
You...

191
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,040
Your Highness, I have a plan to suggest.

192
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,240
- Speak.
- Your Highness.

193
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,780
His Majesty leads the march.

194
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,060
But the army needs more provisions.

195
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,660
The Eastern region was struck by disaster.

196
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,180
The yield is much less than previous years.

197
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,940
All the people have now are the seeds for planting crops.

198
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,559
It's almost impossible to get extra provisions.

199
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,399
What's wrong with seeds?

200
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,980
The warriors are fighting at the borders, they can't get starved.

201
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,460
Besides, my father is leading the army himself.

202
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,599
We will take everything, including the seeds.

203
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,319
Yes, Your Highness.

204
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,239
We cannot let His Majesty and the warriors get starved.

205
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,840
But this concerns the harvest of the following year.

206
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,300
If Your Highness ignores the consequences...

207
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,919
and force the people to hand over the seeds,

208
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,199
I am afraid without the seeds to plant the crops,

209
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,320
we might cause an uprising.

210
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,079
If there is an uprising, just suppress it.

211
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,239
We have thousands of soldiers.

212
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,780
A few farmers can't harm us.

213
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,359
Absurd! How could you make such a decision?

214
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,460
We may have thousands of soldiers,

215
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,919
but the people are the foundation of our nation.

216
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,759
Not only are you going to take their food,

217
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,220
you even threaten to kill them.

218
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,660
You are nothing more than a tyrant!

219
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,300
You are the merciful one.

220
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,020
Then you should get the provisions.

221
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,700
- But...
- Send out my words.

222
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,220
Prince Chen will be in charge of getting the provisions.

223
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,660
He has ten days.

224
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,279
If he fails, punishment by martial laws.

225
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,440
- You...
- Dismiss!

226
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,340
But this is...

227
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,380
General Fu arrives!

228
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,780
At your service, Your Majesty.

229
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,940
I just came back from the patrol.

230
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,820
I was informed Your Majesty wanted me to join the meal.

231
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,799
I was surprised and worried at the same time.

232
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,380
Sir Fu, you mean having a meal with me is too formal for you?

233
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,940
No, Your Majesty.

234
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,500
I am grateful for Your Majesty's kind offer.

235
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,559
We are in a camp, not the palace. Formality is not needed.

236
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,160
Have a seat.

237
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,380
Much appreciated, Your Majesty.

238
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,559
Our priority for this battle is the pre-emptive strike.

239
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,559
We need to be one step ahead.

240
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,700
Our army marches before the enemy does.

241
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,380
We need to hasten the march afterward.

242
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,550
General Fu, do you have any plan for this battle?

243
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,960
I think Your Majesty's plan is well thought.

244
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,660
I went on countless battles when I was young.

245
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
I claimed many victories.

246
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,620
I still carry the ambition.

247
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,000
But age got the better of me.

248
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,840
It can't be helped if I feel the lack of strength in myself.

249
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,480
General Fu, you are young and strong. You are a great warrior.

250
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,420
With so many years of experience in leading the troops,

251
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,300
you should be giving me advice on strategies.

252
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

253
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,580
Your Majesty, we have reports to make.

254
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,560
- Let them in.
- Yes.

255
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,780
We left in a hurry and didn't carry enough provisions.

256
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,620
We have only left for days.

257
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,340
But the provisions are what make the army whole.

258
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,500
Precautions are needed.

259
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,399
General Fu, write a letter for me to the capital.

260
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,440
Urge the crown prince to get ready.

261
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,460
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

263
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,320
Your Majesty, we have reports...

264
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,419
General Fu, you may leave now.

265
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,840
Yes.

266
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,160
Generals.

267
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,340
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

268
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,900
Your Majesty.

269
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,280
Have a seat.

270
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,180
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

271
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,840
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

272
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,340
His Majesty is not feeling well.

273
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,220
- Get the royal physician now!
- No!

274
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,060
It's been a long time since I led the troops.

275
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,919
We left the palace in a hurry.

276
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,060
I am simply not used to the environment. I am fine.

277
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,900
If you summon the royal physician now,

278
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
it will draw attention.

279
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,719
The morale of the army will waver.

280
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,039
But Your Majesty's health comes before everything.

281
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,759
Your Majesty was feeling unwell in the palace.

282
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,620
The main camp of the army is even more crude.

283
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,119
The march could be tiring. I am worried for you.

284
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,540
Your Majesty, maybe we should turn back.

285
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,380
Imbecile!

286
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,399
- Your Majesty.
- The army is marching.

287
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,479
We cannot turn back during a march.

288
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,479
If someone had said the same thing,

289
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,400
I would have punished him for disrupting the morale.

290
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,220
I apologize, Your Majesty.

291
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,460
I apologize for the mistake.

292
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,359
Please forgive me.

293
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,820
At ease.

294
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
What do you have to report, Generals?

295
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,760
Your Majesty.

296
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,380
Who is it?

297
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,460
Insolent woman. This is an army base, you cannot enter.

298
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,559
Leave now!

299
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,079
I am the wife of General Fu Chou.

300
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,599
I have an urgent report for His Majesty.

301
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,879
Inform him now!

302
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,839
If you delay this important information,

303
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,360
you will pay with your life!

304
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,980
These two strongholds are crucial.

305
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,679
We need to take down these strongholds.

306
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,139
With them out of the way, the Wei army will be pushed to a corner.

307
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:03,939
Your Majesty, a woman claims to be General Fu's wife. She wishes to see you.

308
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,740
Rong Le?

309
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,320
Why is she here?

310
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,280
Eunuch Chen.

311
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,139
- Your Majesty.
- See if it really is her.

312
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:18,480
If she is here, bring her to me.

313
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,220
Don't let Fu Chou see you.

314
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,940
Yes, Your Majesty. Consider it done.

315
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,639
Generals, you may go now.

316
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

317
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,119
Greetings, Your Majesty.

318
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,820
At ease.

319
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,340
Much appreciated.

320
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,080
Eunuch Chen, keep watch outside.

321
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,400
Yes.

322
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,999
Did something happen back in the capital?

323
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,459
I came here... to advise you to withdraw the army.

324
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:06,019
When the people know peace and everything is calm, we can still take down Wei.

325
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:08,260
Who sent you to tell me these?

326
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,620
- Your Majesty.
- The outcome of this campaign...

327
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,460
will decide the fate of Northern Lin.

328
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,120
I planned this for so long, I can't possibly withdraw now.

329
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,619
If you came after the main force, to try what Wuyou did...

330
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:23,959
and persuade me to cancel the campaign, then don't waste your time.

331
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:27,260
- Go home.
- That is not what I came for.

332
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,120
There are some situations in the capital.

333
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,100
The crown prince is conspiring with others...

334
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,500
to launch a mutiny while you are away.

335
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,799
Isn't this weird? Princess Rong Le came all the way here.

336
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,279
But she didn't go to Fu Chou.

337
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,780
- She is meeting His Majesty instead.
- This is odd.

338
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,799
Did something happen in the capital?

339
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,560
I bet this has something to do with Prince Li.

340
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,359
If Fu Chou and Prince Li stand against each other,

341
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,959
which side will the princess choose?

342
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,759
Who cares? Our duty is to serve the emperor and win this war.

343
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,239
Don't worry about the other matters.

344
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,380
You are right.

345
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,199
The crown prince is working with someone? Impossible.

346
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:21,999
I had everything ready before I left for the march.

347
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,959
The Armor Troops stay in Zhongshan.

348
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,600
Fu Chou is right by my side.

349
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,439
The Armor Troops won't make any sudden movements.

350
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,460
The command of the Royal Army is with Wuyu.

351
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,159
Wuyou will secretly deploy the army from the south to the capital as a precaution.

352
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,399
If the crown prince tries anything foolish, he would be digging his own grave.

353
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,420
General Fu is here?

354
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,700
This isn't right.

355
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,960
I saw him in the manor before I came here.

356
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,860
Fu Chou is in his manor?

357
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,160
Impossible. I just summoned him moments ago.

358
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,620
General Fu.

359
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,199
General Fu, why are you here?

360
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,479
His Majesty is planning the strategies inside.

361
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,540
No one should bother him.

362
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,360
If there is anything, please come again tomorrow.

363
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,520
Your Majesty, I have an urgent report to make.

364
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,599
General Fu, His Majesty didn't say anything.

365
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,399
Perhaps you should come again tomorrow.

366
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,100
The military affairs cannot be delayed.

367
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,639
Pardon my intrusion.

368
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,079
General Fu! You cannot go in there!

369
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,460
General Fu!

370
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,120
Get out!

371
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,199
At your service, Your Majesty.

373
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,839
What is so urgent?

374
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,420
What is so urgent that you ignore my order...

375
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,479
and charge into my camp?

376
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,439
Weather Prophet Qin forecasts that...

377
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,540
there will be a downpour tomorrow.

378
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,520
It will go on for two days.

379
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,420
Our camp is located in a lowland.

380
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,220
I think we should be ready to leave tonight.

381
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,039
Before the downpour arrives,

382
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,820
we must find another spot for our main camp.

383
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,340
That is our best option.

384
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,020
We shall proceed as you planned.

385
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,479
Please grant me the Tiger Emblem.

386
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,740
I shall deploy the troops tonight.

387
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,279
Very well.

388
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,900
Order General Li, General Wei, and the other officers...

389
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,079
to my camp to discuss it.

390
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,260
I will see to this matter myself.

391
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,560
General Fu,

392
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,900
you are bold enough to disobey my order.

393
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,960
What do you plan to do with the Tiger Emblem?

394
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,560
You gave me the order when we were having the meal.

395
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,480
You want me to assist you.

396
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,719
The march is tiring. Your Majesty is getting old.

397
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:30,339
Relocating the main camp should be left to me instead.

398
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,460
Your Majesty.

399
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,800
Please grant me the Tiger Emblem.

400
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,600
You really are a devoted officer.

401
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,160
You remember every word I told you.

402
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,259
Do you still remember when you returned victorious...

403
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:52,199
after you pacified the skirmish in the south?

404
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,919
We had a tour around the Royal Garden together.

405
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,100
I told you that you remind me of my younger self.

406
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,900
Of course, I remember.

407
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,759
Your Majesty values my talent.

408
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,380
I will remember that till the day I die.

409
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,160
Liar!

410
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,879
We never went to the Royal Garden together!

411
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,140
You are not Fu Chou! Who are you?

412
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,960
Guards!

413
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,240
Guards!

414
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,180
- Yes.
- Search for the girl.

415
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,800
Yes!

416
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,959
Rong Le came without permission.

417
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,759
What did she tell you?

418
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,640
What made you suspect my identity?

419
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,560
You are right.

420
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,500
I never went to the Royal Garden with you.

421
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,659
But I do remember that you once told me...

422
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:16,360
you looked a lot like me when you were younger.

423
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,140
Do you remember that?

424
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,500
You...

425
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,840
General, she is not here.

426
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,300
Where is Rong Le?

427
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,640
Where did she go?

428
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,420
She... She is gone.

429
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,520
She is gone.

430
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,700
General Fu, everything is in place.

431
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,260
All the entrances are sealed off.

432
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,740
What exactly are you planning?

433
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,260
Guards!

434
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,720
Stop wasting your time.

435
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,980
All the officers in this camp...

436
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,180
are working for me now.

437
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,980
General Fu, a letter from your manor.

438
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,340
Send out my order.

439
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,140
Split up and search for Rong Le.

440
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,540
Remember.

441
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,599
Capture her alive.

442
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,080
- Yes!
- You...

443
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,620
You...

444
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,540
What did you do to me?

445
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,300
Why do I feel so weak?

446
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,140
I can't even muster any strength.

447
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,320
Your Majesty, calm down.

448
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,560
Fear not.

449
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,460
This is just a special brew from the royal physician.

450
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,039
He used two different herbs to mix into your meals.

451
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,880
It will render you immobile for now.

452
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,519
You will live.

453
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,160
How dare you!

454
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,520
Who are you?

455
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,840
Even if you really are Fu Chou,

456
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,360
I have rewarded you and granted you ranks.

457
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,380
I made you the first rank general.

458
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,439
I gave you the right to command.

459
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,080
I gave you the reward you are due.

460
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,120
Why did you conspire with Western Qi and try to kill me?

461
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,440
That is a good question.

462
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,680
Your Majesty, don't you remember?

463
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,020
You once sent your men after a child.

464
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,200
You are Fu Yuan's son?

465
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,799
Impossible.

466
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,840
That child is dead.

467
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,159
Captain Xiang said the child fell into the river.

468
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,040
Please understand that...

469
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,860
this is known as "rebirth from the ashes."

470
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,840
If you hadn't thought he was dead,

471
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,180
how would he survive?

472
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,920
He would have died.

473
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,720
So you joined the army and climbed up the ranks...

474
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,620
just to get revenge on me?

475
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,220
Fu Chou?

476
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,620
A name of vengeance.

477
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,060
I never expect it to have such meaning.

478
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,900
You are not my son!

479
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,300
I raised you in the Cold Palace for years.

480
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,900
That was more than merciful for you.

481
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,760
Blame Fu Yuan if you must!

482
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,360
Fu Yuan set you up because you betrayed her first!

483
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,380
You are not Fu Chou.

484
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,280
No one would address his mother by name.

485
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,280
Who are you?

486
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:32,820
You... are as disgusting as you were before.

487
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,720
You are the eunuch that served Fu Yuan, you are Lin Shen!

488
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,940
So, you still remember me.

489
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,500
If you remember who I am,

490
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,920
you should be aware of...

491
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,099
how cruel you were to me and Fu Yuan!

492
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:00,260
Do you remember?

493
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,680
Now that you know who I really am,

494
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,580
I cannot allow the others... to find out.

495
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,400
Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

496
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,920
Where is the Tiger Emblem?

497
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,380
You...

498
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,920
You always thought... you had control over everything.

499
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,839
But you never realized...

500
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,799
the whole army is now under my command.

501
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,140
Guards!

502
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,299
- General.
- Keep watch here.

503
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:12,899
No one enters or leaves.

504
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:14,500
Yes.

505
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,060
Your Majesty?

506
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,779
Your Majesty, how do you feel?

507
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:30,480
Are you all right? Your Majesty?

508
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,740
Your Majesty?

509
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,560
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

510
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,360
Your Majesty?

511
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,139
- Your Majesty?
- Your Majesty?

512
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,280
I am bringing you out of here.

513
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,839
Wu...you...

514
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,319
Wuyou?

515
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:56,659
You want me to go to Wuyou...

516
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:59,320
and tell him what happened here?

517
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,400
Lady Yun...

518
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,300
Lady Yun's tomb?

519
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,059
The jade...

520
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:31,999
There is someone suspicious. Search over there.

521
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,139
- Yes.
- Your Majesty.

522
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:35,200
I am taking you with me.

523
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,299
Your Highness, this is His Majesty's order.

524
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,259
You should leave now.

525
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,820
The camp is under their control.

526
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,179
Leave before it's too late.

527
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,780
You can't escape if you take him with you.

528
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,779
I can stay and look after His Majesty.

529
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:54,539
Prince, go before you run out of time.

530
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,080
But you will be in grave danger.

531
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,800
My life doesn't matter.

532
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,219
I hope Your Highness won't let His Majesty's trust...

533
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:09,179
and Prince Li's love for you go to waste.

534
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,779
- Your Highness.
- No, I can't.

535
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:14,080
I must bring you out of here.

536
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,059
Go, Princess. Just go.

537
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,339
You are out of time.

538
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,580
Princess, just go!

539
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,540
Stop right there!

540
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,880
Stop!

541
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,499
Report!

542
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,379
Lieutenant, Prince Fanyang has returned.

543
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:01,959
What? Inform General Fu right now!

544
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,280
- I will stall him.
- Yes!

545
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,739
Prince Fanyang returns, who dares block his way?

546
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,099
Order from the general. No one shall enter the camp.

547
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,579
His Majesty is in the camp.

548
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:42,379
Which general gave the order?

549
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:44,660
Stand aside and make way!

550
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,379
His Majesty appointed me as the vanguard...

551
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:55,419
and must be deployed to the border against our enemy.

552
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,779
But there have been some situations.

553
00:40:57,779 --> 00:40:59,699
I must report to His Majesty now!

554
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:02,859
But someone told me the camp is sealed off.

555
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:04,899
Not even I am allowed to enter.

556
00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:06,259
Is it true?

557
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:07,819
Your Highness misunderstood.

558
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:10,699
It was His Majesty that gave us the order.

559
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:12,939
We didn't mean to stop you.

560
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:15,899
Princess Rong Le, General Fu's wife...

561
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:19,219
came into the camp without permission and obstructed our operation.

562
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:22,139
His Majesty is furious and wishes to punish her.

563
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:23,579
But she got away.

564
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,299
We can't find her.

565
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:28,619
We are ordered to search for her.

566
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,020
- Princess Rong Le?
- Assassin!

567
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,360
Stop right there!

568
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,460
Arrest him!

569
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,900
Stop!

570
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,200
Your Majesty!

571
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,379
Your Majesty, what happened to you?

572
00:41:58,379 --> 00:41:59,859
Brother, what is going on?

573
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:03,220
What happened here? Who was the assassin?

574
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,300
Brother? Guards!

575
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,499
Who was it?

576
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:14,419
- Your Majesty?
- Summon the physician!

577
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:16,240
Yes.

578
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,880
Your Majesty?

579
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,700
Your Majesty?

580
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,059
What is going on?

581
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:23,880
What happened?

582
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,700
Who was the assassin?

583
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,000
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

584
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,390
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

585
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:19,690
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

586
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:25,500
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

587
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,500
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

588
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:38,870
♫ You are keeping me out with your care
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

589
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,560
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

590
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,190
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

591
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:57,060
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

592
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,850
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

593
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:06,330
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

594
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:15,020
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

595
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,340
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

596
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,860
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

597
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:34,990
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

598
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:39,880
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

599
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,040
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

600
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:57,340
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
