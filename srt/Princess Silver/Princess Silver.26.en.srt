I'll hold on to your hands forever.

You can rely on me without any worries.

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Is Princess Rong Le back at the palace?

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
You have nothing to worry about.

6
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,900
I sent my men to escort her back.

7
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,800
Before she left,

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,600
she left the job of protecting you in my hands.

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,400
Thank you.

10
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,399
Your Highness' love for my sister is true and sincere.

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I appreciate it.

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,900
This is as far as I can send you.

13
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,000
Have a safe trip.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,600

from now on,

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
I won't let you shed another tear.

21
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
Even if you do,

22
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,800
that would be a tear of joy.

Love was never easy to come by.

26
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,600
If a couple that loves each other must be separated,

27
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,900
isn't it better just to be strangers?

28
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,200
Which is why we need to be together all the time,

29

till death do we part.

30

From now on, we will have no home.

The whole world can be our home.

We will wander the land without any wealth.

33
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
We will be partners in arms on the road to glory.

34
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
But we will live without any shelter and money.

You gave me this for the wound.

You go out a lot.

I don't know why you are going out so frequently.

But I hope you won't turn your back on Her Highness again.

Do you know what this place is?

Why would a little girl like you come here?

Why? Who is he to you?

There were a dozen men surrounding him.

I am certain of it, Your Highness.

I am sure he is not.

can you please keep it down? People might suspect us.

I can tell who is new and who has worked here for a long time.

114
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,800
As for you, stop keeping your head down.

115
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,000
You are drawing too much attention.

116
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Follow my lead and I promise you I will search the whole place...

117
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
and find your Sir Xiao.

118

Miss Chen Yu, he is not mine.

119

Fine, keep searching.

Why have you dressed like a guy?

127

How is it? Is it convincing?

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This gentleman here is very handsome.

129
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
No wonder Miss Chen Yu has never visited us again.

130

So, this handsome man won your heart?

Did someone come here and get into a fight?

134

I know the man you are talking about.

This is the medicine for Her Highness.

Any order from His Majesty?

137
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
Northern Lin and Chen have formed an alliance.

138
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
His Majesty wishes to know...

139
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
why you keep missing your chances and failed to kill Ning Qianyi.

140

The princess was involved in it.

141

Things got complicated.

142
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,800
This is my letter to His Majesty.

143
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,000
I explained in detail to His Majesty.

Captain Xiao, we serve the same lord.

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,500
I don't want to threaten you for His Majesty.

148

I simply wish to remind you.

149
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,400
As long as you do your job,

150
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,300
I can ensure you the safety of Miss Ke.

151
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,000
I appreciate that. I know what must be done.

152
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,100
But I have to see her today.

153
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,800
Otherwise, I won't have ease of mind.

154
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,400
If we get into a fight with another debauched guy...

155
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
and put her in danger,

156
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you will pay with more than just your life.

157
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
No.

158
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,300
His Majesty ordered her not to see anyone.

159
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
What if I insist?

160
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,900
Sir, you are forcing me to let her go...

161
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,000
and make a fuss to draw attention?

162
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,700
Indeed.

163
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,600
- Let's go.
- Wait.

164
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,200
We are leaving him behind?

165
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,400
Didn't you hear him? Miss Ke is still here.

166
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,600
But this place is huge, how do we find her?

167
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,200
- Come with me.
- But...

168
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,400
- Pick up the pace.
- Okay.

169
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,800
This wine is good.

170
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Not bad.

171
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,200
She must be here.

172
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,000
Those men are not the workers here.

173
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
They must be working with that man from earlier.

174
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
What do we do?

175
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,000
- Come with me.
- We must keep an eye on her.

176
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't worry about it.

177
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,100
Stop standing there, help me out.

178
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
This is so heavy.

179
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,000
What is this hole doing here?

180
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,200
I dug this.

181
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
You dug this?

182
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,300
What is it?

183
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
Who are you?

184
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you Miss Ke?

185
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
We are here to save you.

187
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,700
- Me?
- Come.

188
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,400
Come on, get out of there.

189
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Watch it.

190
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,000
Who is it? Let's go!

191
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,600
We need to hide! Come with me!

192
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
This way!

193
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Come over here.

194
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
Quick!

195
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Are they catching up?

196
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,000
Cover your nose and mouth.

197
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,500
What is going on here?

198
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,100
Ke'er, what did you use? You knocked them out.

199
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,900
Curse you!

200
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,100
How dare you lock me up!

201
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,900
- And you too!
- Ke'er.

202
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,000
- Ke'er!
- Eat this!

203
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
All right, we need to go.

204
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,900
They will catch you again.

205
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,800
We need to leave.

206
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,900
From Qianyi, I hope you cherish it.

207
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
Your Highness.

208
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,700
Miss Chen Yu and I brought the lady back from House of Fragrance.

209
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,200
Miss Chen Yu is serving the customers. She couldn't come with me.

210
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,600
Who are you?

211
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Fear not. I am...

212
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
I mean you no harm.

213
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
I just want to talk to you.

214
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,900
Who is Xiao Sha to you?

215
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,000
You don't need to ask, I won't tell you anything.

216
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
My lips are sealed even if you kill me.

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,700
What are you laughing at?

218
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,400
Nothing.

219
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,300
You don't need to see me as hostile.

220
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,400
I am Xiao Sha's friend.

221
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Look at you. Your hair is a mess.

222
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Let me groom it for you, okay?

223
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,700
Go ahead.

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You are letting me groom your hair?

225
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,600
What if I kill you?

226
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,000
Those who groom for me are good guys.

227
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,200
You are so innocent.

228
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you have a name?

229
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I am Xiao Ke.

230
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
From Xiao family?

231
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,600
That is a nice name.

232
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
- Who gave it to you?
- My mother.

233
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,000
I bet your mother is a very beautiful woman.

234
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,300
Yes, I know she is.

235
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,800
But I don't remember what she looks like.

236
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Maybe she is as pretty as you.

237
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,000
Where is your mother?

238
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
I don't remember.

239
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
You don't remember?

240
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Did you lose your memory, too?

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
No.

242
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,500
But my master took me when I was four years old.

243
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
I have never seen my parents again.

244
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,400
Don't you have any family?

245
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
Who raised you?

246
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
My master, of course.

247
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
I was terminally ill as a kid.

248
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,200
The doctors said I wouldn't live past five years old.

249
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,600
I was playing on the street with my brother.

250
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
My brother went to get some candied berries.

251
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
My master passed by and saw me.

252
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,800
She said she has never seen my illness before.

253
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
She got excited and took me with her.

254
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
What about your brother?

255
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,800
A year ago, someone found me and brought me to him.

256
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,000
I can recognize him with the scar on his hand.

257
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't remember anything.

258
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,500
But I remember the scar I gave him with the scalding soup.

259
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,900
Is it on his right wrist?

260
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Your are Xiao Sha's younger sister?

261
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Do you want to save your brother?

262
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What happened to him? Is he in trouble?

263
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,500
Are you all right?

264
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,300
Ke'er?

265
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Ke'er is missing.

266
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,800
Sir Xiao, come home with me.

267
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
Let's go.

268
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,900
Ke'er, these are for you.

269
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,700
Eat heartily.

270
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,000
Ke'er.

271
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,260
- Brother!
- Ke'er!

272
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,100
- Brother!
- Ke'er!

273
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,500
- Ke'er!
- Brother!

274
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,800
It really is you!

275
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,200
It's me!

276
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,600
I am so sorry.

277
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
I didn't take good care of you.

278
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,700
I lost you.

279
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,800
It's all my fault.

280
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,600
From now on, I will never let you leave my sight again.

281
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,600
Come, let me look at you.

282
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,800
Are you hurt? Did someone bully you?

283
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,200
Of course not!

284
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,800
I am a healer myself, why would I get hurt?

285
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,200
Yes, you are a healer indeed.

286
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,300
But, Brother, you are hurt.

287
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,800
It's all right, I am fine.

288
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,700
Right, Princess Rong Le said she will save you.

289
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,000
Come.

290
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I lied to Your Highness. I deserve to be punished.

291
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,400
From now on, I will leave Zhongshan.

292
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,600
I will hide my identity.

293
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
But this has nothing to do with Ke'er.

294
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Please, Your Highness. Spare Ke'er's life.

295
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,800
It's okay.

296
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
I know you have your reasons.

297
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Your sister was imprisoned and my brother used her as a hostage.

298
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,700
He ordered you to assassinate Prince Zhenbei at the lake.

299
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,900
But I was there so you failed the mission.

300
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,600
I can tell you still have some attachments for us.

301
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,400
You are still loyal to me.

302
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,200
From now on, I will take good care of her.

303
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,800
I won't let them hurt you again.

304
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,100
Your Highness' kindness...

305
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,600
shall be remembered to the day I die!

306
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,500
Ke'er, help your brother up.

307
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,700
Brother, get up.

308
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,400
Ke'er, tend to his wound.

309
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
Xiao Sha,

310
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
your life is mine as well.

311
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,900
Please take care of yourself.

312
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,900
I put you in danger many times.

313
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,500
I failed your trust.

314
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
This isn't your fault.

315
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,000
But I never thought that...

316
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
even if you grew up together with my brother,

317
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
he would still blackmail you.

318
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,400
For him, loyal officers and his own sister...

319
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,700
are both expendable for his ambition.

320
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,800
When I see you, I finally realize that...

321
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,400
this is what it meant to be brother and sister.

322
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,000
Your Highness, the emperor is...

323
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Do not say his name.

324
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,900
After all that has happened,

325
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,100
I lost my trust in him.

326
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,800
Sir Xiao, get the wound dressed.

327
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Princess Rong Le, you can trust my brother.

328
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,000
You know, my brother talked about you all the time.

329
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,100
He said you are beautiful and kind.

330
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,600
Your treat your servants like they are your friends.

331
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,200
He found me a few days ago.

332
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
He said he wounded you by accident.

333
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,200
He wanted me to treat your injury.

334
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,600
But for some reason, he said you don't need me anymore.

335
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,700
He is always see-sawing with his words.

336
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,700
Ke'er, don't talk about nonsense in front of Her Highness.

337
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
It's okay.

338
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,600
Ke'er is an innocent girl, I like her.

339
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,300
Right, I heard you know about healing.

340
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,200
You learned it from the master that took you?

341
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Your Highness, Ke'er's master is the Lone Frost Sage.

342
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,600
Zhao Yun's marriage is a reality.

343
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
This is her decision.

344
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,600
We must respect her decision.

345
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
You are here mourning for losing her and have forgotten about the world.

346
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,500
She wouldn't want to see you like this.

347
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,700
Brother,

348
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
I know you are right.

349
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,800
But I just can't forget about her.

350
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
I was too stubborn.

351
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I only wanted to have fun.

352
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,800
I should've responded to her love sooner.

353
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,400
I always saw her as a kid.

354
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,700
I wanted to wait until she grew up.

355
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,600
But I never thought...

356
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
the one person that never grew up...

357
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,500
was me.

358
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,600
I only learned the same lesson recently.

359
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,700
Sometimes,

360
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,100
we can't control everything.

361
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,800
Perhaps by the time you have learned to give up,

362
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,400
that is when you finally grow up.

363
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Your Highness!

364
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,500
Your Highness!

365
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,100
It's all right, go on.

366
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,900
Your Highness.

367
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,700
Prince Zhenbei sent this for you.

368
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,400
In order to repay you for rescuing him and being your friend,

369
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,800
while you have this token, he will fulfill one request for you.

370
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,600
No matter when or where, if Your Highness needs help,

371
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
this token can be used to get help from him.

372
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,400
The other jade pendant was given to Princess Rong Le.

373
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,500
This is his offer. We should accept it.

374
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,600
How is Prince Zhenbei's journey?

375
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,800
According to the report of the Hidden Ones' agent,

376
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,100
they made it past the border.

377
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,500
Everything went well.

378
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,600
Fu Chou didn't make any suspicious moves.

379
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,000
Good.

380
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,400
- You may go now.
- Yes.

381
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,800
Brother, you had everything planned.

382
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,200
I was too obsessed with my own loss.

383
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,900
I never thought about how to ensure her safety...

384
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,600
and take care of her.

385
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
After this experience,

386
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
you will surely learn about love.

387
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
If you are still frustrated...

388
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,700
and have some free time,

389
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,500
perhaps you can run an errand for me.

390
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,800
What do you need from me? It's time to get back on my feet.

391
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,400
I want to share your burden.

392
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,700
The agent of the Hidden Ones told me...

393
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,600
that bodyguard in General's manor...

394
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
fought with the brother of the crown prince's wife...

395
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,000
over a girl in the public house because of jealousy.

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,600
Even the empress knows about this.

397
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,300
Even Xiao Sha started to spend time at that dissolute place.

398
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,600
But, Brother, do they need us for this trivial matter?

399
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Zhao Yun ran into so much danger because of the marriage.

400
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Man Yao risked her life to save Zhao Yun.

401
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,800
Don't you think you should be in the General's manor...

402
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,900
to express your gratitude?

403
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,400
Right, you have a point.

404
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
I should thank Man Yao for saving her.

405
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,900
Then, I can send your regard to Man Yao.

406
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,300
How is she?

407
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,600
Are you sure you know?

408
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,500
Ling Yue, be patient.

409
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,600
Ke'er is the apprentice of Lone Frost Sage.

410
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,300
Her knowledge in healing must be top-notched.

411
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,600
I heard that Lone Frost Sage...

412
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,200
has vast knowledge about healing and is known by many.

413
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,800
She is called the healer of miracles.

414
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,900
But she is arrogant and has a bad temper.

415
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,800
She always comes and goes without a trace.

416
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,200
She doesn't like helping either.

417
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,600
Your Highness is right.

418
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,000
His Majesty sent the Hidden Guards to search for her,

419
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,500
hoping that she would help.

420
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,200
But they returned without any success.

421
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
But recently, they found Ke'er at her hideout.

422
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Yes, it was those bad guys...

423
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,500
that brought me to that strange place.

424
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,000
There are women everywhere.

425
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,100
There is that stench of rogue powder, too.

426
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,800
They also threatened my brother that...

427
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,200
if he failed his mission, they would kill me.

428
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,600
Ke'er, enough about this matter.

429
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
You have been reading Her Highness' pulse.

430
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,300
Did you find a way to heal Her Highness?

431
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Princess Rong Le has been poisoned.

432
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,600
This poison is very powerful, I haven't seen it before.

433
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,000
But the medicine she takes prolonged her life.

434
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Yet, the effects of the medicine clash with the poison.

435
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
It causes headaches and memory loss.

436
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,200
Princess, the poison invaded your body and made you weak.

437
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,300
All I can do is to make you live as long as possible.

438
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,700
However, we might find a cure.

439
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,100
Ke'er, don't be ridiculous.

440
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,200
Her Highness has already been healed. She is perfectly fine.

441
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,800
Ling Yue.

442
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Ke'er, thank you.

443
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,300
After so long, you are the first to be so honest with me.

444
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,600
From now on, you can stay here with me.

445
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,300
Let me protect you, okay?

446
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,000
Okay, we can be good friends.

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,100
Princess, the poison invaded your body and made you weak.

448
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,600
All I can do is to make you live as long as possible.

449
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,600
However, we might find a cure.

450
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,200
Time flies like an arrow.

451
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,000
But as I reach the end of my life,

452
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,800
I feel like there is much to be done.

453
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,300
Your Highness.

454
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,900
Ke'er was just being ridiculous.

455
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,400
It wasn't so bad. She was exaggerating.

456
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,400
You don't have to cheer me up.

457
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,200
I don't see this as a problem.

458
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,000
After all, Ke'er might still find a cure for this poison.

459
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,800
It's just that...

460
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,000
I don't want to live a life without any purpose.

461
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I want to know who I am...

462
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,400
and what I am capable of.

463
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,700
Your Highness,

464
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,800
you are still young and beautiful.

465
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,700
Why would you think about your death?

466
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,200
I just hope I can have a chance...

467
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,800
to escape from this cage that binds me.

468
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,000
I must control my own fate,

469
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
live a life of my own.

470
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,400
Your Majesty.

471
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,600
I have escorted Prince Zhenbei and Princess Zhao Yun to Chen.

472
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,500
- Everything went smoothly.
- At ease.

473
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Much obliged.

474
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,100
Nicely done.

475
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,800
The alliance of the two nations is now formed.

476
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,000
Prince Zhenbei sent us the first-rate horses.

477
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,800
It will help strengthen our cavalries.

478
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,100
The campaign against Wei must be set in motion.

479
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,400
Crown Prince and I have been planning for this campaign.

480
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,000
I think His Highness is the best man to lead our forces.

481
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,700
Never mind. I have someone... for that task.

482
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Prince Fan Yang.

483
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,500
What does Your Majesty need?

484
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,800
Go and find out if Wuyou is busy with any work.

485
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,100
Bring him to the royal study to discuss our tactical plans.

486
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,400
I am putting him in charge of the campaign.

487
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Father!

488
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,800
Wuyou is always busy.

489
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,600
I am willing to take his place...

490
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
and give it my all for the campaign.

491
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,400
Very well. In that case,

492
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,800
I have something of utmost importance for you.

493
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Yes, Your Majesty. Your wish is my command.

494
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,100
The first-rate horses from Chen have arrived.

495
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,500
I assign you to supervise the breeding process.

496
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,600
If they can't produce horses that are capable for the battle,

497
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,100
you will be responsible for it.

498
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,400
Father.

499
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,200
I don't know anything about breeding horses.

500
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,800
But I have a feeling you are best suited for this job.

501
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,200
- But I am...
- Are you seriously trying to make a bargain with me?

502
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,100
I wouldn't dare.

503
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,200
I am grateful for Your Majesty's trust.

504
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
I will carry out my duty.

505
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,999
These are the first-rate horses from Chen.

506
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,600
Take good care of them.

507
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
If this gets in the way of our campaign,

508
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,400
you will answer for it.

509
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,800
Your Highness, you are asking for the impossible.

510
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,600
There is this saying.

511
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,800
"We each have our own purposes."

512
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
The same goes with the horses.

513
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,200
Some are born to be the best of their kind.

514
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,500
Some are born to be useless.

515
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,600
You...

516
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
What is the meaning of this?

517
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,700
You are mocking me with the horses?

518
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,000
How dare you!

519
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,200
- Your Highness!
- You said I am useless!

520
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,000
Your Highness, this was a misunderstanding.

521
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
That was not what I meant.

522
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,800
I have other matters to see to.

523
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,500
I must get the best feed for the horses.

524
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,000
If Your Highness is in a hurry,

525
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you can have a look at the horses.

526
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,800
- What?
- I have to leave now.

527
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,900
Stop right there!

528
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,600
Guards!

529
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,300
Guards!

530
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,600
- Stop standing there!
- Your Highness.

531
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,400
Scram!

532
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
A bunch of insolent servants.

533
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,600
Get lost. Get out of my sight.

534
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,400
Get out of here.

535
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,800
Help me get changed before you leave!

536
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
You...

537
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,200
You have never run away so quickly before.

538
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
What happened, Your Highness?

539
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,700
Enough about it.

540
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,200
The job my father gave me...

541
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,500
is hard and tiring.

542
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,100
That old fool is trying to make a slave out of me.

543
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,900
General,

544
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,500
this is all your fault.

545
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,400
If you hadn't helped Zongzheng Wuyou...

546
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,800
in the matter with the marriage alliance of Chen,

547
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,000
none of these would have happened.

548
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,700
Your Highness, the two of us are in the same boat.

549
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,900
If I fall, so will you.

550
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,000
Blaming me won't bring you any good.

551
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,800
I got my power and status because of my achievements.

552
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,500
I can still stand tall in the Imperial Court without you.

553
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,200
As for you,

554
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,900
without me on your side,

555
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,200
do you really think the Imperial Court...

556
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
will have a place for you?

557
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,000
You are right.

558
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I was being rude.

559
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
I hope you are not offended.

560
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,800
Okay?

561
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,000
The two of us are now mutually dependent.

562
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,200
If you wish to get what you always wanted,

563
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,000
you will need my help.

564
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Yes.

565
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,400
I will listen to whatever you have to say.

566
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,800
What you need to do now is to change His Majesty's view of you.

567
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Such as staying away from women.

568
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,500
Greetings, General Fu.

569
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,800
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

570
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Your Highness,

571
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,700
I have to go now.

572
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,500
Sure, General Fu.

573
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,800
Xiang.

574
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,600
Xiang, from now on,

575
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,300
you need to keep your distance from me.

576
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,000
I must focus on my work.

577
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,400
I need to earn my father's trust.

578
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes.

579
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,300
Xiang!

580
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,400
Help me get changed before you go!

581
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,500
But you did tell me to keep you at a distance.

582
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,000
I must follow your order and leave you be.

583
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,400
You...

584
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,700
A bunch of ingrates!

585
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,100
You have no respect for me at all!

586
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,500
I must thank you for earlier.

587
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,900
I know. After so many years,

588
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,200
if you made me a promise,

589
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,300
you always did your best to help me. Right?

590
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,400
But you cannot let your guard down.

591
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,300
You come and go from the palace too often.

592
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,200
It's easy to make a mistake.

593
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,900
I know.

594
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,400
But it's different today.

595
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
Today is a day for your vengeance.

596
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,200
On this day every year,

597
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,600
I must be here for you.

598
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,000
Okay.

599
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,800
We should get going.

600
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,100
Every time you come here,

601
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,800
you set up a reminder for yourself...

602
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,700
that you cannot forget all the vengeance you have.

603
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,100
I have never forgotten about this day.

604
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,500
I think you got used to it.

605
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,600
A little blood and wounds...

606
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,400
weren't enough to make you hasten the progress.

607
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,800
You...

608
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,800
are a disappointment to your mother.

609
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,400
Let him go.

610
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,400
Don't bring up my mother on this.

611
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,000
This is my own mission.

612
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,200
It has nothing to do with the Creed.

613
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,800
Don't forget what you said.

614
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,400
You need to be decisive.

615
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,100
You need to know you are born for greatness!

616
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,800
Don't worry, Master.

617
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,600
Fu Chou has set the plan in motion.

618
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,200
Good.

619
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,000
So this is the princess' house?

620
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,400
It's so big!

621
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,800
It's huge, isn't it?

622
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,400
Xiao Ke, remember to have fun here. Okay?

623
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
Stay here.

624
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,800
Ling Yue.

625
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,800
Greetings, Prince Chen.

626
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,200
I am here for Man Yao. Please inform her.

627
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,400
Yes.

628
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Who are you?

629
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,600
Are you the new servant here?

630
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,200
You are quite the bold one.

631
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,300
How dare you stare at me.

632
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,400
Man Yao never bothers to lecture the servants.

633
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,800
- He is so annoying.
- You are the first to be so rude.

634
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,600
He is so annoying. Stop talking!

635
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,300
You have quite the sharp tongue.

636
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,800
But you do look like a cute girl.

637
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,400
What is this smell?

638
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,500
I feel so itchy!

639
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
- What did you do to me?
- Nothing.

640
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,100
I sprayed some of my newly invented poison powder on you.

641
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,600
You shouldn't have disrespected me.

642
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,600
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

643
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,890
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

644
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:54,500
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

645
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,000
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

646
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,100
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

647
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:12,600
♫ You are keeping me out with your care,
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

648
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:17,200
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

649
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,700
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

650
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:30,800
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

651
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,800
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

652
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,000
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

653
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:49,800
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

654
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,800
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

655
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,400
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

656
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:08,600
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

657
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,400
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

658
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,800
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

659
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:30,500
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
