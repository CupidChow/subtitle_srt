00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:32,682
[Episode 52]

2
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,600
They had saved your life once.

3
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,500
Zhao Yun.

4
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
Prince Li.

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Zhao Yun is your sister.

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Don't think of using her life to threaten me.

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Zhao Yun, leave now. It's dangerous here.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm not going to budge.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,700
Qianyi,

10
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,200
don't set yourself against Brother Wuyou and Princess Rong Le anymore.

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Give them back the book and return the power to our emperor.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Let's live a quiet life together.

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
All right?

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
Zhao Yun, stop wasting your time on him.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
Other than the power he seeks,

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,700
there is nothing else that he cares about.

17
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,300
Zhao Yun, don't be foolish.

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
If I let them go today,

19
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,000
they won't let me get away so easily.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
I have come so far,

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,000
there is no turning back for me now.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Otherwise, death is my only end.

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Kill them. Do not hurt my wife.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Stop!

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Let them go.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Luo Yan,

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,600
you are using the blade I gave you...

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,500
to kill me?

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Do you really have the resolve?

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Chen Yu!

31
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Not a step closer!

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Zhao Yun!

33
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,500
If I can't stop you,

34
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,400
I shall end my life here!

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,500
It's better than seeing you become a murderer.

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,800
Zhao Yun, do not make me do this.

37
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,600
You know it well.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
You are special to me.

39
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I truly love you.

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,000
You are cruel and heartless.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,200
You never cared about how I felt.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't want my child to be born...

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,800
with a cruel and...

44
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,700
power-hungry father like you!

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,400
Power-hungry?

46
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
Zhao Yun.

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
This is my last warning for you.

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,700
Come to my side.

49
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Lay down the knife.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Fine, I get it now.

51
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Kill them.

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
All of you, stop!

53
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,200
Your Majesty should be in the palace.

54
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
What brings you here?

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Prince Zhenbei, how dare you!

56
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,000
You plan to have a slaughter inside the royal villa!

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Emperor of Qi is a righteous ruler.

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,300
Prince Li and Prince Regent of Northern Lin are lords of the land.

59
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,000
You command the elite troops without my permission to kill them.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,200
Don't you realize this will make us their common enemy?

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
That is only because they are having a fight in here.

62
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
They will die from the injuries.

63
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,200
As for the Emperor of Qi, he will die trying to save his sister.

64
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,400
If Western Qi wants vengeance,

65
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,500
they should go to Northern Lin instead.

66
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,200
Such insolence! No one will believe you!

67
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,600
It doesn't matter what the others believe.

68
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,000
As soon as the three of them are dead, chaos will arrive.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,100
Chen will have the chance to unite and rule the world.

70
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,200
We can conquer the whole world!

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,400
Is this the promise Fu Yuan gave you?

72
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,200
She only promised me the land in the south.

73
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,000
But what I want is far more than that.

74
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,000
Prince Zhenbei, because of the power you hold,

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
you have never shown any respect for me.

76
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
And now you conspired with the enemy while keeping me in the dark!

77
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
You even tried to wage war on the world!

78
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,100
Guards! Take him down!

79
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,200
Don't you dare!

80
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,400
Ning Qianyi! This is treason!

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,000
How could you say that?

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
I allied with the Empress Dowager of Northern Lin...

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,800
all for the sake of expanding the territory of Chen.

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,200
Your Majesty will rule the world.

85
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,800
How is that a crime?

86
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,400
You conspire with enemies, that is a crime!

87
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,900
And you even made it sound so righteous.

88
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
If you are really doing this for my sake,

89
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,800
why don't you show me the letter of alliance to me?

90
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Who says we need a letter to forge an alliance?

91
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,600
But Your Majesty came here in the middle of the night,

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,000
did someone talk you into this?

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,900
Ever since you left the palace,

94
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,600
the officers all requested for you to take the rule,

95
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,000
they never considered the fact you are just a child.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,600
What are their intentions?

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,400
To prevent our nation from falling into the wrong hands,

98
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
I am willing to be the expendable.

99
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
Before Your Majesty becomes of age,

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,500
I must settle all the national affairs for you.

101
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,900
What else do you think I am doing this for?

102
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,600
Do you really think if no one reads the letter from Fu Yuan,

103
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,900
that there is no need to admit your crime?

104
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,500
Zhao Yun, hand it over to me.

105
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,100
Luo Yan!

106
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,700
"I have long heard about your sharp insight,

107
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,200
yet you had to bow down to a mere child.

108
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,400
It got in the way of your ambition.

109
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
That is truly unfortunate."

110
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
"I am willing to aid Prince Zhen Bei,

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
but you must use Rong Le's death...

112
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,000
as a reason to provoke Prince Li into fighting my son.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Aid my son in killing Prince Li.

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,600
When it's done, half the land in the south will be yours.

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,900
Prince Zhenbei, you shall have the throne."

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,700
Did everyone hear that?

117
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,000
You treacherous fool are trying to overthrow the nation.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,300
What else do you have to say?

119
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,700
Luo Yan.

120
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,600
I am doing this for the sake of unifying the land.

121
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,400
This was once our shared goal.

122
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,600
Don't you remember?

123
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,400
It's you who forgot.

124
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,100
If you get away with this, people will lose their lives.

125
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,400
The united world I long for...

126
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,600
is a peaceful time without any war.

127
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Even if I am not the one who wages war,

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,000
the world will never know everlasting peace.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Hate exists as long as humans live.

130
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Prince Li and Prince Regent may have reconciled as brothers

131
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,400
but they hate each other for the death of their father,

132
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,200
they hate each other because of their loved one!

133
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
The truth may be revealed,

134
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,500
but will they really be able to let bygones be bygones...

135
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,000
and see each other as brothers?

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
You are right.

137
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,200
We made a lot of mistakes because of hate.

138
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,100
We paid a dear price for that.

139
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
But you are different.

140
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,500
You thirst for power, you seize the Imperial Court, and take advantage of your young emperor.

141
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,800
You brought this upon yourself.

142
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,200
History is written by the victor!

143
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,200
All the lords and rulers have their hands stained with blood.

144
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,100
Even your father resorted to despicable means to rebuild his nation...

145
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,100
and that was how Northern Lin could thrive.

146
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
This is not justice.

147
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,500
This is the revelation of your ambition.

148
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Are you certain if the world is thrown into chaos,

149
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,900
you would be able to conquer it?

150
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,000
Or will you seize the throne for yourself...

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,200
because of your own greed?

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,600
All those lies of Prince Zhenbei started to fool even himself.

153
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
All the nations are living in peace.

154
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
People are living a good life.

155
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,800
How could you say waging war is for the peace of the world?

156
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,700
Do the lives of countless people mean nothing to you?

157
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,800
Rong Le is right.

158
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,300
In this world we live in,

159
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,800
living a life is probably a luxury for many.

160
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
You, Prince Zhenbei, enjoyed the luxury of life.

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,800
But you would risk ruining everything for your own gain.

162
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,300
You may sacrifice your own life for your goal,

163
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,500
but will you give up on the life...

164
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,700
of your loved one as well?

165
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,400
Prince Zhenbei conspired with the enemy.

166
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
He tried to seize the throne.

167
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,800
As for the rest of you who fell for his lies,

168
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,400
lay down your weapons and you shall be spared.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Guards, take Prince Zhenbei to prison so he can be tried!

170
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
Hold on!

171
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,678
Prince Li.

172
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,600
Back at Lady Yun's tomb,

173
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,500
I invited you to have a toast together.

174
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,800
I felt like in the whole wide world,

175
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,300
the only person who deserves to be my rival...

176
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,500
is none other than you.

177
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,400
I failed today,

178
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,200
but I didn't lose to anyone.

179
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,800
I lost to myself.

180
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Guards, bring forth the wine.

181
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,700
A request from a dying man.

182
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,000
Prince Li, will you accept this toast?

183
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,600
If you were my soulmate,

184
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,800
I wouldn't mind having a drink with you.

185
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
But the truth is,

186
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,600
you only ever wanted power.

187
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,200
The people's lives mean nothing to you.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,100
The man who is fit to be my rival...

189
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,400
will not be a lowly being like you.

190
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
As for this toast,

191
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,800
save it for yourself.

192
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,000
Zongzheng Wuyou,

193
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,800
you still don't have the courage.

194
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,500
- Your Highness!
- Qianyi!

195
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
Qianyi!

196
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Promise me.

197
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,200
Do not let our child know...

198
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
he has a failure like me as a father.

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Qianyi!

200
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,600
- Rong Le!
- Man Yao!

201
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
Man Yao!

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
Man Yao!

203
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,700
Man Yao!

204
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,800
[Prince Zhenbei Residence]

205
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,800
Is Man Yao suffering from an illness?

206
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,000
Why did she pass out?

207
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,079
Prince Li, the Consort passed out because of fatigue from recent events.

208
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,000
Worries are unnecessary.

209
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,600
I should congratulate Your highness.

210
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,500
Consort Rong Le is indeed expecting a child.

211
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,000
Man Yao, we are going to have a child.

212
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,200
Congratulation, Prince Li and Consort Rong Le.

213
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,100
What's done is done.

214
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,300
Young Master, there is no turning back.

215
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,200
Your only choice now...

216
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,100
is to keep going on this wicked path.

217
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
A'Chou.

218
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,800
Come here.

219
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,000
Why did you get yourself all sweaty again?

220
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Our father...

221
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
is still alive.

222
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,699
Your Majesty, Her Highness is still not awake.

223
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,000
Please come again later for your visit.

224
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,900
Your Majesty!

225
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,800
Your Majesty.

226
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,400
Xiao Sha,

227
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,600
do you know why I sent Xiao Ke to you...

228
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,700
instead of keeping her in Western Qi?

229
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,200
You mean, it wasn't to keep her as a hostage?

230
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,600
If it wasn't for Xiao Ke,

231
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
would you still betray me?

232
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,600
Both you and Xiao Ke are with Rong Le.

233
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,800
You are both loyal to her.

234
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,000
This is the outcome I was hoping for.

235
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,400
Rong Le.

236
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,100
You would even hurt yourself for his safety.

237
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,800
But you are now a wife and a mother.

238
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
You need to take care of yourself...

239
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,200
and cherish your health.

240
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Is that clear?

241
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Seeing that you are well and safe,

242
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,400
I am relieved.

243
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,800
Now that you have forgotten all the memories we shared...

244
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
I hope you will never recall them ever again.

245
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,400
Your Highness.

246
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,400
What do you want?

247
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Zongzheng Wuyou, don't you dare get in my way.

248
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,500
I am taking her back to Western Qi.

249
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,800
- She will...
- Wuyou.

250
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Man Yao, you are awake.

251
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
I am glad you are fine.

252
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
I am glad you are all right.

253
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,000
Haven't you heard? We are going to be parents.

254
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
You mean...

255
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,200
we have a child now?

256
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,300
You passed out just now.

257
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,800
I thought you were having another relapse.

258
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,300
But it was actually because you are expecting a child.

259
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,400
Your body has become weak.

260
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,200
You have always liked kids.

261
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Now, we will finally have one of our own.

262
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
I am fine.

263
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,200
Did the injury at my abdomen hurt the child?

264
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,000
I inquired the doctor. The child is fine.

265
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,600
Your Majesty.

266
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,800
Your Majesty.

267
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,000
If you have any wish you want to complete,

268
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
I am willing to help you.

269
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,700
Never mind.

270
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,700
Xiao Sha,

271
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,800
stay with Princess Rong Le.

272
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
Keep her safe.

273
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Your Majesty, you came all the way here to Chen...

274
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,800
to bring Princess Rong Le back to Western Qi.

275
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Are you certain you will return empty-handed?

276
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,300
If she wants to stay, I shouldn't take her by force.

277
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,800
Let's go.

278
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,730
♫ I tried to capture you but I've broken your wings ♫

279
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:38,100
♫ This is the destiny that I have no power to stop ♫

280
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,000
When I listen to the music you play,

281
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,200
the melodies are crisp and clear.

282
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,300
I can tell you are not one blinded by desires.

283
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,000
Maybe you had other matters on your mind.

284
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But the melodies you played just now...

285
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,500
are tranquil and momentous.

286
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,000
Perhaps your mind is cleared when you played the music.

287
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,200
It was the same song.

288
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,300
Be it the audience or the musician,

289
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,700
with different moods come different sensations.

290
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,200
You heard the tranquility and momentum in it,

291
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,300
that is because you had a pure heart, to begin with.

292
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,600
We are no longer master and servant.

293
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,700
Stop addressing me as your mistress.

294
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,200
Chen Yu.

295
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,800
Luo Yan.

296
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,000
That is my real name.

297
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
If you won't let me address you as my mistress,

298
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
you can address me by my real name.

299
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,400
From now on, we have no secrets for each other.

300
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Very well, Luo Yan.

301
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,200
Actually, I am rather curious about your past.

302
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,100
I remember what you told me when you were playing a song.

303
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,000
There are some things in this world...

304
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,600
that are more important than loving someone.

305
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,200
Those are in the past.

306
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,000
Back then, I thought...

307
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,200
acquiring "The Book of Mountains and Rivers" was my mission.

308
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,200
But I have strayed far from my goal to one that leads to regrets.

309
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,900
I even betrayed our friendship.

310
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,600
In times of turmoil, loyalty may seem like a luxury.

311
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,700
I remember the time...

312
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,400
when we talked about our own plans for the future.

313
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,900
Long Yue, Wei, Ling Yue and even you,

314
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,400
you all have your own goals.

315
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,200
Now, it does seem like we each have our own calling.

316
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,400
I realized the choices we made...

317
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,600
were decisions made out of desperation.

318
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,400
As long as we feel no regret,

319
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,000
it doesn't matter what people say.

320
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,000
This is rightfully yours.

321
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
I am returning it to its owner.

322
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,600
[The Book of Mountains and Rivers]

323
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,700
- But...
- My past was a simple tale.

324
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
When civil war spread throughout the land,

325
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
my family died in the battles.

326
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,500
I was saved by a young hero... and I survived.

327
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,500
He told me that... a ruler needs a strong army to unite the land.

328
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,400
I thought... acquiring "The Book of Mountains and Rivers..."

329
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,800
would allow Chen to unite the land...

330
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,200
and prevent war from breaking out again.

331
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,800
I shared the same idea.

332
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,600
I went to Northern Lin in search of the book...

333
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,000
for the sake of my nation.

334
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,000
I even went as far as to hurt someone.

335
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,800
I blamed my brother for this.

336
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,500
I blamed Wuyou and Fu Chou for my suffering.

337
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,500
I blamed those who lied to me and used me.

338
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,900
But now, I am freed of those burdens.

339
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,100
I have no hate.

340
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,000
I am glad this realization didn't come any later.

341
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Man Yao, you have a heart for kindness and sympathy.

342
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,800
This is why I feel like you should have the book.

343
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,100
Perhaps you can understand the true teaching within.

344
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,200
Only those without any greed or vile intentions...

345
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,800
will never take the land for their own...

346
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,000
but to bring peace to the people and save them from suffering.

347
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,600
That is when the land will truly be united as one.

348
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
I hope I won't let you down.

349
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,900
Luo Yan, what is your plan for the future?

350
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,400
I have been wanting to travel the world.

351
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,800
Now I have the opportunity to search for a path of my own.

352
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,800
Prince Li, if you may.

353
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,200
Only one of the statues is a match for the stallion of Chen.

354
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,800
You may have a guess.

355
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,600
If your choice is correct,

356
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,700
of all the stables in Chen,

357
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,500
you may pick a thousand stallions and bring them back.

358
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,200
If you make the wrong choice,

359
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,400
you shall return with nothing.

360
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,000
If my guess is correct...

361
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,800
and I can reveal the meanings behind the other two statues,

362
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
will Your Majesty grant me another request?

363
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
It won't be a problem.

364
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
I appreciate this, Your Majesty.

365
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
As for the stallions,

366
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,800
I won't disrespect Your Majesty's offer.

367
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,299
I will be taking this.

368
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,800
How are you so certain it's not the other statues?

369
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,000
After overthrowing the previous dynasty,

370
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,200
Chen returned to rebuilding its army.

371
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,800
You see horses as precious as human lives.

372
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,000
Which is why... you won't use mere silver and gold...

373
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,600
or wood and grass that rot easily... as its symbol.

374
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,200
But the clay statue in my hand...

375
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
is fused with the high spirit of Chen's troops.

376
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,200
It's made with the clay of their homeland...

377
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
and melded with high heat.

378
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,400
This is how the statue represents the empathy of your stallions.

379
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,200
I am deeply impressed with your insight.

380
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,600
Before you leave, you may bring a thousand of those stallions with you.

381
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,400
May those stallions protect your people and your home.

382
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
You have my words.

383
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,400
For the next hundred years,

384
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Chen and Northern Lin will forge an alliance.

385
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,000
There will be no war.

386
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,100
You have my word.

387
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Prince Li, if you may.

388
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:57,200
As for your request from earlier,

389
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,800
do you wish for me to spare Princess Zhao Yun?

390
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,200
Your Majesty is wise indeed.

391
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
I had everything arranged.

392
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,200
For the house of Prince Zhenbei, except for Ning Qianyi's crime,

393
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,600
all the others who were kept in the dark are spared.

394
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Ning Qianyi's ambition was of his own will,

395
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,400
the others were innocent, to begin with.

396
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,600
Your Majesty, you have my gratitude.

397
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,500
I will take Princess Zhao Yun away from this land of sorrow.

398
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,299
I envy her a lot.

399
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,200
If I could have a brother that truly cared for me,

400
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
that would be great.

401
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,500
I am going back to Zhongshan.

402
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,200
Whatever her reason is,

403
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I must get an explanation from her.

404
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,700
Those are memories of the past.

405
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
Right.

406
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,000
There is something you should know.

407
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
What is it?

408
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,100
I heard Ning Qianyi and Chen Yu talk about the book and Qin Yong.

409
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,200
Hen Xiang is actually Qin Yong's daughter.

410
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,400
Her real name is Qin Xiang.

411
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,200
The Qin family are loyal.

412
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
The whole nation is aware of this.

413
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
But because the wine they brewed was sent to the palace,

414
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,700
the whole family was executed.

415
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,700
A whole family was slaughtered over a night.

416
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,600
All the officers mourned for the loss.

417
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,000
Do you know if Hen Xiang has a sister?

418
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,200
I am not sure about that.

419
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,600

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,600
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

494
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:22,400
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

495
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,000
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

496
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:05,000
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
