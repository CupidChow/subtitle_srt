00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,731
[Episode 38]

2
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,185
A capable man never brags.

3
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:42,542
Agent Wu, do you think that you will be able...

4
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:45,299
to stop me just by yourself?

5
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,139
Do you think Zongzheng Wuyou will be able to escape and return to power?

6
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:54,417
We will have to try to find it out!

7
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,900
You scoundrel!

8
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,806
I was never a righteous man, to begin with.

9
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,826
Because of this seal,

10
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,900
you placed yourself in danger.

11
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,171
What if I lost you for good back then?

12
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,180
All hope would have been pointless to me.

13
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,699
Your father wanted me to pass this seal to you.

14
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,010
This is a promise I made to him.

15
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,930
This is his trust and love for you at the most crucial moment.

16
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,489
But sadly... because of me,

17
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,360
you couldn't say goodbye to Lady Yun...

18
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,011
or take her with you from that place of sorrow.

19
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,476
As my parents watch from Heaven,

20
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,233
they will not blame you.

21
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
They taught me this when I was little.

22
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,003
Earn the people's hearts and you will have the world.

23
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,907
A piece of jade is not capable of such.

24
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:37,429
The people must come first.

25
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,814
Even if I had rushed to my death with you...

26
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:41,611
and be loathed for generations,

27
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:43,607
I would be fine with that.

28
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,839
Because I know... I may be dead,

29
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:51,119
but the nation has someone else to protect it.

30
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,860
The nation will have a benevolent ruler.

31
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,400
I shall have no regret.

32
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,604
- Are you all right?
- Miss Sun.

33
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:01,158
Let me take a look.

34
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,694
I am fine.

35
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,139
Who dressed this wound?

36
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,596
The wound is not even cleaned.

37
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,223
This can't be good.

38
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,419
It's okay.

39
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,147
I don't want to trouble you.

40
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,640
Miss Sun, this is Ke'er.

41
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,590
She is Xiao Sha's sister and the princess' friend.

42
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,182
We were able to escape...

43
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:27,888
all thanks to her help in getting us out of there.

44
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,744
She is a great healer.

45
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:31,864
Let her tend to your wound.

46
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:34,794
Come on.

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,500
Thank you, Miss Xiao.

48
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,880
Miss Sun, you look tense.

49
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,059
My brother told me not to trust strangers easily.

50
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,260
But I just can't remember that.

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,515
When you are truly hurt by someone,

52
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:53,636
you will remember that.

53
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,340
I never thought the general would be so cruel to you.

54
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,452
I always saw him as a man we could rely on.

55
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:06,268
But in the end,

56
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:10,288
even those around him have to suffer his cruelty.

57
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,629
What he did to Princess Rong Le is even more so.

58
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,619
I am glad we escaped.

59
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,046
He can't hurt us anymore.

60
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:27,353
Miss Sun, whoever picks on you,

61
00:05:27,354 --> 00:05:29,059
then he must be the bad guy.

62
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,539
Don't be afraid. I can use my poison.

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,019
I will make him laugh and cry so hard... so he can no longer hurt you.

64
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,684
Thank you for this.

65
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:43,239
You... are the only person we should never mess with.

66
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,416
We don't want to end up like Prince Chen.

67
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,599
Miss Sun, you haven't had any good rest in a long time...

68
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,667
nor any decent meals.

69
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:58,083
I am not hungry. I am just sleepy.

70
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,648
There.

71
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:05,145
Yali, lie down and take a nap.

72
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,957
Zongzheng Wuyou is crossing the river. Stop meddling with these men.

73
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:28,929
I will catch up to him.

74
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,660
Brother, are you all right?

75
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,756
Brother, we should just take Fu Chou out...

76
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:47,459
and send him back to the palace to avenge our father.

77
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,760
Fu Chou won't be defeated so easily.

78
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,219
The reinforcements will be here soon.

79
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,619
Having a battle here will only bring us more casualties.

80
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,502
We'll wait for another day.

81
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,716
Let's leave.

82
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,899
Does it hurt?

83
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,025
While you are with me, I don't feel any pain.

84
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,279
Brother, if you are going to make any intimate moves, try to keep it low.

85
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,621
You can't move around with your injury.

86
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,433
Besides, we are on a raft.

87
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,734
You might fall into the water.

88
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:26,339
It's okay if you fall into the water. It's quite scenic down there.

89
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,586
Why don't you scout ahead for us?

90
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:33,499
I would really love to learn a thing or two from you.

91
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,899
But I can't swim.

92
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,339
Brother, you know me well. I never learned to swim.

93
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,550
- Leng Yan.
- Yes.

94
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,336
Teach Prince Chen how to swim.

95
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:45,337
Never mind, I can do it myself.

96
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,499
Brother, this rocking raft is making me nauseous.

97
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,185
Why don't we go to the princess' boat instead?

98
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:11,699
We can't bother them there.

99
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,420
You should just behave and stay here.

100
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,739
Why?

101
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,939
There are so many people on this raft.

102
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,565
We have two rafts.

103
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,997
Why can't we share them equally?

104
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,188
Brother, maybe...

105
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:30,549
I can go to her raft and switch places with that man.

106
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,624
What do you mean "that man"? That is my brother.

107
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,152
Show some respect.

108
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:38,433
Ke'er, don't be rude to Prince Li.

109
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
Prince Li?

110
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,880
So he is Prince Li?

111
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,190
And you are Prince Chen?

112
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,539
Yes.

113
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,320
It sounds like pear and orange.

114
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,551
Did you two come from the Fruit Kingdom?

115
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:55,460
You little...

116
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,615
Ke'er, look. There is a fish.

117
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,900
Brother, let's go fishing.

118
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,128
Zhao Yun,

119
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:14,128
I wonder if you are okay right now.

120
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,742
What is it?

121
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,446
Is there something you miss?

122
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,000
We can no longer see the city of Zhongshan from here.

123
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,275
The past is in the past.

124
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:17,362
Let us... bid our past farewell.

125
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,039
Because of you, I was brought to Zhongshan.

126
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,785
Because of you,

127
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:29,071
I fell in love with this city.

128
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,257
And because of you,

129
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,212
I am disgusted by this city.

130
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,920
I tried so many times to escape from this place.

131
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,260
But I never got what I wanted.

132
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,137
Wuyou, leaving this place with you...

133
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,622
is the most luxurious wish I ever had.

134
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,489
We will be happy, right?

135
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,012
We will.

136
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,933
Man Yao,

137
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,052
let's have hope for the future.

138
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:14,642
Once we get back on our feet,

139
00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:17,954
I'll earn the people's trust one day.

140
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,218
Not only will I fulfill the duty my parents left to me,

141
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:28,848
I will realize the promise of bringing peace to the land.

142
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,924
In the future, whether we succeed or not,

143
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,800
I will be there with you.

144
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,980
Till death do us part.

145
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,220
In the future, no matter how perilous it is,

146
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,600
I will be there for you.

147
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,840
To the very end.

148
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,400
If Heaven has mercy on me,

149
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,303
let me live for a little while longer.

150
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:20,255
Let me stay by his side.

151
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:22,813
I can't bear to leave him behind...

152
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,035
let him be alone.

153
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,859
How is she right now?

154
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,040
Your Majesty.

155
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,009
Prince Li and the princess have escaped.

156
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,523
They have left Zhongshan safely.

157
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
It's been over a year.

158
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,332
Rong Le...

159
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,463
I hope Zongzheng Wuyou can take you to safety.

160
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,190
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager has sent medicine for you.

161
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,680
You let the loose end get away.

162
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,050
You let your only pawn escape.

163
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,725
We may have got our revenge,

164
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:16,104
but without that woman,

165
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:19,640
what do you have to go against Zongzheng Wuyou?

166
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,376
It's too early to tell who the winner is.

167
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:26,187
Besides, even if I lose,

168
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:28,447
you are going down with me.

169
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:31,060
You are right.

170
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,792
I should envy Agent Wu instead.

171
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,780
At least he followed the right master.

172
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,819
General Fu, news from the palace.

173
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,560
The crown prince lost his mind.

174
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,367
I think he is... just pretending to be a mad man.

175
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:52,219
I am afraid it's for real this time.

176
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,220
This is interesting.

177
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,540
Father!

178
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,260
Father, the candies you gave me are so sweet.

179
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,499
I didn't take much.

180
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,574
Father, look.

181
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:05,310
I eat one candy for every paragraph I memorize.

182
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,745
Just one candy.

183
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,779
Can you stay here and keep me company?

184
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,562
I will memorize all of these.

185
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:22,183
Please stay here for me.

186
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,507
Please.

187
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:27,537
Father, please stay here.

188
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,633
Father,

189
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,219
are you mad at me?

190
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,398
Is Wuyou memorizing the lines better than me?

191
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,019
I will keep trying.

192
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,899
I want more candies.

193
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,745
I want you to stay here.

194
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,547
First, the seasons.

195
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,549
Second, the land.

196
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,712
Third, the way.

197
00:21:57,712 --> 00:21:59,139
Fourth, is the...

198
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,951
is the...

199
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,740
Father.

200
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,861
Father.

201
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:12,179
Please don't leave me. I beg of you.

202
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,953
Father.

203
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,639
Father, don't go.

204
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,699
Father, don't leave me here.

205
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,779
Father, please stay with me.

206
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,770
Father!

207
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,770
Father!

208
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,750
Father!

209
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:37,763
Please, don't go!

210
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:41,497
Please, don't leave me behind!

211
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,826
Father! I can memorize all of these.

212
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,259
Father, you can't leave me here. I can memorize all of them.

213
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,890
Father!

214
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:01,275
Father.

215
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,177
I remember the line. I remember the line.

216
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,905
First, the way.

217
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:13,425
Second, the seasons. Third, the land.

218
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,866
No.

219
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,723
You are not my father.

220
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:25,742
My father would never come here to listen to me.

221
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:27,870
He lectures me for not making friends with Wuyou.

222
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:29,951
He said Wuyou is better than me.

223
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,080
You are not my father.

224
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,011
Who are you?

225
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,467
Who are you?

226
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,510
Who am I?

227
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,081
Who am I?

228
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,554
What if I tell you...

229
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,765
I am your father's son, too?

230
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,722
You are my father's son?

231
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:11,390
So...

232
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,324
So, do you have to memorize all of these?

233
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:17,197
Can you even remember the lines?

234
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:19,506
I have to memorize the lines, too.

235
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,375
I remember them like the back of my hand.

236
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,041
But we are different.

237
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,255
Even if I remember the lines,

238
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:31,198
there won't be candies for me.

239
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:33,655
Why?

240
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:36,300
Father is not giving you candies?

241
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,926
Father never gives me candies.

242
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,538
Are your candies...

243
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,930
delicious?

244
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,240
Yes, they are!

245
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:51,129
Let me get some for you.

246
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,552
There, I am giving you all of my candies.

247
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,848
But... can you stay here and play with me?

248
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,987
They are having fun with Wuyou.

249
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,610
No one wants to play with me.

250
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,340
I will give you my candies.

251
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,829
Will you play with me?

252
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:22,800
These candies are delicious.

253
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,026
Let go of me! This is the Eastern Palace! I am the crown prince's consort!

254
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:58,374
Where are you taking me?

255
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,521
I want to see the crown prince!

256
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,060
Who are you?

257
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:12,002
If you don't live here, you can't just walk around so freely.

258
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,789
If you are one of us,

259
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:16,997
can you take me to the crown prince?

260
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,174
When I was walking around this palace,

261
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:27,460
you perhaps were still in your mother's womb.

262
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,339
But your love with the crown prince is indeed respectable.

263
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,099
I'll grant you the request.

264
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,659
You can see the crown prince one last time.

265
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,600
You! How dare you be so insolent!

266
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,734
You should be prepared to save your own skin...

267
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:47,140
after the crown prince dies.

268
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,751
He is in danger?

269
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,160
You mean he is in danger?

270
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,620
This one.

271
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,619
I lost again. This is not fun. I am done with it.

272
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,552
Your Highness! Let go of me!

273
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:16,303
Your Highness!

274
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,300
- Your Highness!
- She is...

275
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,299
Your Highness, Fu Chou is planning to harm you.

276
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,099
He was plotting to seize the throne.

277
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,579
He wants to hurt you, the candies must have been poisoned!

278
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,459
All of these people are trying to harm us.

279
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,932
They want to kill us!

280
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,139
- Run!
- You...

281
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,299
- We need to leave!
- You are the bad guy!

282
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,539
You are Lady Yun!

283
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,779
Go, I don't want to see you again!

284
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,637
- Let go of me. Father!
- Your Highness!

285
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,980
Father! Father, she is Lady Yun!

286
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,956
Take her away, quick!

287
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:50,997
She is trying to take my candies!

288
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:53,939
Your Highness? What happened to you?

289
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:57,788
I am your wife. Don't you remember your wife?

290
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,256
Your Highness, we need to leave now!

291
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:04,959
Run, Your Highness! Your Highness!

292
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,739
It must be you.

293
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,219
You turned His Highness into this sorry state!

294
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,786
When you first sent Hen Xiang to us,

295
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,699
I should have known it was your plan.

296
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,258
But I never thought you could be so vile.

297
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:28,017
In order to get the throne, you turned the crown prince into a mad man!

298
00:28:28,017 --> 00:28:31,862
Guards, take her out of here.

299
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:35,429
Don't you dare touch me!

300
00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:43,921
As of now, I have no more fear of you.

301
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:45,737
I must speak for His Highness.

302
00:28:45,738 --> 00:28:48,784
I must bring justice to the officers you oppress.

303
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:51,427
What if you get the throne?

304
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:54,478
None of the officers are loyal to you.

305
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,299
They only fear you.

306
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:00,676
You forced your own wife... into a vicious being.

307
00:29:00,676 --> 00:29:03,739
You poisoned the brother who is a threat to you and made him crazy!

308
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,712
You are the one that is truly vicious and insane!

309
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,020
Don't die on me.

310
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,942
Don't die.

311
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,659
You killed a person without my permission!

312
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,194
Zongzheng Wuyou took the Imperial Seal from you.

313
00:29:36,195 --> 00:29:39,580
Your coronation will be as good as a sham.

314
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,529
If you let the crown prince live,

315
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,681
he might become a loose end that brings trouble.

316
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,715
He has gone mad.

317
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:49,705
He is no longer a threat to me.

318
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,440
If you insist on killing him,

319
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:54,934
you will cause an uproar!

320
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:02,366
Turn around and look.

321
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,641
You are the only person here...

322
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:08,042
that is lost!

323
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,187
If I hadn't warned you,

324
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:47,772
this fool would have killed you.

325
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:52,059
Who... is going avenge your mother?

326
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,074
Even if you kill Zongzheng Wuyou,

327
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,268
my mother won't come back to life.

328
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:03,879
She is dead.

329
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,475
She is never coming back.

330
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,209
I wish the one burned to death...

331
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,400
was me.

332
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,623
♫ I can't help but to ask after you ♫

333
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,111
♫ Our hearts are a lifetime apart ♫

334
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,320
♫ No one comes, also no one asks ♫

335
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,538
I got my revenge.

336
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,765
It looks like I have everything.

337
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:12,182
But...

338
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:15,109
But this is pointless.

339
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:19,711
♫ We've thrown away fate that we'd received by chance ♫

340
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,968
♫ I have to admit to my mistakes ♫

341
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:27,299
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

342
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,646
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

343
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:35,899
♫ I asked for too much, I hesitated for too long ♫

344
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,193
♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

345
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:44,379
♫ You are behind me ♫

346
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,979
♫ Mocking the promise that I made for you ♫

347
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,219
♫ I must give all I have ♫

348
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,085
♫ To accept the lies of affection ♫

349
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,879
♫ Our fate is intertwined and I can't let go ♫

350
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,084
♫ I must preserve the memories that are wonderful ♫

351
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:13,763
I wonder...how your life is right now.

352
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:25,400
♫ I made this mistake because I was too selfish ♫

353
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,999
♫ I walk in a desert, but my heart is being flooded ♫

354
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,259
♫ My heart is beating senselessly ♫

355
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,615
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

356
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:43,019
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

357
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:48,880
♫ Blame being forced, blame being weak  ♫

358
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,020
- Don't take my son from me!
- Let go, you mad woman!

359
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:57,689
- Hand it over!
- Don't take Chou from me!

360
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,179
Let it go!

361
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,939
- Let it go!
- It's mine!

362
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,463
Don't take my child from me!

363
00:34:02,464 --> 00:34:03,651
Let go of it!

364
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:06,372
- Don't hurt him!
- You mad woman!

365
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:16,179
The rain is getting worse. We need to go.

366
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,104
Let this woman die on her own.

367
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,779
Your son is gone! He is dead!

368
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,841
Chou!

369
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,932
Chou!

370
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,807
My son!

371
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,220
Chou!

372
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,935
Chou!

373
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,253
Don't hurt him!

374
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,081
Chou!

375
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,249
My son!

376
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,861
Don't take my son from me!

377
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:35,379
Don't kill him!

378
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,179
He is innocent!

379
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,179
He has nothing to do with this!

380
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,633
Please, don't kill him!

381
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:43,344
Mother!

382
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:46,076
Mother!

383
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,802
I am Chou!

384
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,508
I am Chou!

385
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:54,033
Mother, I am Chou!

386
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:56,173
I am Chou!

387
00:35:56,174 --> 00:35:59,019
No! I don't know you!

388
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,099
I am Chou!

389
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,699
I am Fu Chou!

390
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,179
Who are you?

391
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,642
Mother!

392
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:12,005
Mother, you are still alive!

393
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,943
If I knew you were alive,

394
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,586
none of these would have happened!

395
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,971
None of these would have happened!

396
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:28,190
I wouldn't be made into the man I am!

397
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,026
No, I wouldn't.

398
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,420
It's all right. You are back now.

399
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,902
Mother, don't worry.

400
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:40,527
I won't let anyone hurt you.

401
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:44,355
Don't be afraid. Everything is all right.

402
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,023
Thank God.

403
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:50,501
Thank you.

404
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,740
Mother.

405
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,595
Right now, you are the only thing...

406
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,019
I have left.

407
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,409
Will you give me a hug?

408
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,234
All hail the empress.

409
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,709
At ease.

410
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,227
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

411
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,480
Heed my decree, General of Defense.

412
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,292
Yes, I will.

413
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,052
"As decreed by the empress,

414
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:06,319
His Majesty passed away, it's the loss of this nation.

415
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:09,597
However, the nation needs its ruler.

416
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,664
Fu Chou, the son of Empress Fu Yuan is a descendant of the royal bloodline.

417
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:17,247
He spent years in exile because of a vile setup.

418
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,459
Thanks to Heaven's protection, he has returned to the family...

419
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,099
and his bloodline.

420
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,874
He will regain his status as the elder prince.

421
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,144
His name will now be Zongzheng Wuchou.

422
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:30,000
He will carry out the duty of Heaven and succeed the throne..."

423
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,717
Hold on.

424
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,979
Your Majesty.

425
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:41,084
I think the return of General Fu to the royal family...

426
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:43,076
is the matter of the royal family.

427
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:45,059
It is also a national affair.

428
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,956
Your Majesty has the edict to appoint General Fu as the crown prince.

429
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,909
I have no objection to that.

430
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:54,739
But succeeding the throne...

431
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,099
means he must apprise the ancestors and the people.

432
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,019
General Fu has neither the Imperial Seal nor the emperor's will.

433
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,414
Naturally, this is against the rules.

434
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,137
The people will not be convinced.

435
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,918
Indeed.

436
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:17,970
Wuchou, what do you think?

437
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,099
What do you suggest, Minister of Rites?

438
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,337
I know General Fu is a man that sees the greater good.

439
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:35,272
You earned the respect of the people.

440
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:37,452
They will not bow down to a throne taken by force.

441
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:40,619
If you are willing to be crowned as Prince Regent,

442
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,219
bring peace to the land, and help the people,

443
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,040
when the disorder is appeased,

444
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,948
the people will naturally see you as the ruler.

445
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,579
Then, the empress can apprise the ancestors at the temple.

446
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,576
You will succeed the throne.

447
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:57,225
If you insist on ignoring the rites to crown yourself...

448
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:58,977
and do not heed our advice,

449
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:02,691
with the many other sons His Majesty has,

450
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:07,770
I am afraid the people might choose to follow another ruler.

451
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,670
I appreciate your advice.

452
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,838
From now on, I will not be the crown prince.

453
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:26,689
I will not take the throne.

454
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:31,068
I will rule the nation as Prince Regent.

455
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,461
Zongzheng Wuyou has betrayed his nation.

456
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:37,288
He retreated to the south to muster his army.

457
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:40,330
I, Zongzheng Wuchou, hereby swear that...

458
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,969
I will eliminate the traitors.

459
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,719
When I succeed in reclaiming the land,

460
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,526
I can face my ancestors righteously...

461
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:50,599
and become the emperor of Northern Lin.

462
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:53,749
A word given cannot be taken back.

463
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,424
I hope you remember what you said just now.

464
00:41:57,425 --> 00:42:00,898
Do not... betray your promise.

465
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:02,979
If I go against my promise,

466
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,140
Heaven will take care of me.

467
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:13,623
I, Yang Wei, am at your service, Prince Regent.

468
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:15,701
Long live the prince!

469
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:19,963
Long live Prince Regent!
