00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:32,492
[Episode 21]

2
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:36,799
You've not done well with the southern border rebellion.

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Prince Li has already taken care of it for you.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll overlook that matter.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For this alliance between us and Chen,

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,400
if you make any mistakes again...

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
This time,

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,300
I will not let Your Majesty down.

9
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,300
Your Majesty, Prince Chen returned from the southern border.

10
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,000
- He is waiting outside.
- Is Wuyu back?

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Father!

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,800
I am home! I missed you so much!

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,300
When Brother said he was coming home,

14
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,000
I rushed back here as soon as I could without delay!

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
I just hoped to see you sooner.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
You are an adult. Stop acting like a child.

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't be so whiny.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
This is not how a prince behaves.

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,400
You spent so much time with Wuyou,

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,600
didn't you learn the slightest subtlety from him?

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Father,

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,100
you only ever care about Wuyou.

23
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,200
I know Wuyou is firm and subtle.

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
He is also very sensible.

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
Father, compared to those who bootlick...

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
and the pretentious hypocrite,

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Wuyou is so much better than them.

28
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,800
How is your brother?

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,500
He started acting all mysterious after he came to Zhongshan.

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,200
He seems to have some important work.

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
He is back?

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,200
Your Majesty, Prince Chen hasn't seen you in a long time.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,700
I should not bother your reunion.

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,200
I shall take my leave.

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
General Fu!

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
We haven't met in six months.

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,600
General Fu, I did think about you from time to time.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,100
During the rebellion in the south,

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,100
I had so many questions about military affairs for you.

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,800
Do you mind sharing your knowledge with me?

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
I am flattered, Prince Chen.

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,700
To be able to learn some experience from you is my honor.

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,400
If you have the time, I will be available at all times.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,100
Mere discussion means nothing. I have an idea.

45
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,600
After my brother is back,

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,400
we can test our skills against yours and exchange views.

47
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,900
My father is here, he can be our judge.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
General Fu has other matters to see to.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
He doesn't have the time for you.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,600
We can have our discussion another day, Prince Chen.

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
General Fu, you may go now.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll be on my way.

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,200
Princess Rong Le, we can't lose.

54
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Zhao Yun, I never knew you liked to fish.

55
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,800
What made you want to go fishing this time?

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,300
Wuyou and Wuyu are coming back from the south.

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,300
Wuyu said I can't cook a fish properly.

58
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,200
He made fun of me and said I can't even catch a fish.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,600
The fish! It got away.

60
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Princess Rong Le.

61
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,000
You didn't know Wuyou was returning from the south?

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,200
General Fu didn't tell you?

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,200
I heard after Wuyou reached the southern border,

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
an uprising took place.

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,400
Brother Wuyou took the lead and ended the rebellion.

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I am sure there is a reward waiting for him.

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Besides, he regained his title as Prince Li.

68
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,900
Princess Rong Le, I know he still holds place in your heart. Right?

69
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,600
Brother Wuyou still loves you deep down in his heart.

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Otherwise, he wouldn't go through so much...

71
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
to send you the candied dates...

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,100
and still keeps it a secret from you.

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
Your Highness. Princess Zhao Yun.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,900
You must be tired from fishing all day.

75
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,000
Come on, have some tea.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Watch out! Ambush from the water!

77
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
- Run!
- Go!

78
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Catch!

79
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,300
Master, run!

80
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,100
Fall back!

81
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,300
Ling Yue!

82
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
How is it?

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you all right?

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,900
No, Your Highness. You must go on without me.

85
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,200
No, I can't leave you behind.

86
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,000
We can find a place to hide first.

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
Go.

88
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,800
Why would so many men kill a fishmonger like you?

89
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,400
Miss, don't worry about it. They are after me.

90
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
I am sure they won't try to hurt you.

91
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
My Lord, since we have gotten to meet each other,

92
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,800
we have no other choice but to make it through together.

93
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,200
Ling Yue, don't be afraid. I can protect you.

94
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,400
Zhao Yun, you don't know any martial arts.

95
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Princess Rong Le, don't worry about me.

96
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,800
I watched Wuyou and Wuyu training with their swords.

97
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I know a thing or two myself.

98
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,300
It's all right.

99
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,700
We met here by chance.

100
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,000
I never imagined we would be fighting side by side.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
I shall die without any regret.

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,300
Stop talking about dying.

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,000
I am not married yet.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,400
I don't plan to die here.

105
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,700
If we can make it out of here safely, I will...

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
Miss, we should split up and move forward.

107
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,000
They won't hurt you.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,300
We are in the same boat, I can't leave you behind.

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,400
- No!
- Your Highness!

110
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Volley!

111
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Xiang Ying?

112
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
General Fu sent his men to save us!

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
I am glad General Fu sent help.

114
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Otherwise we would
have all died in here.

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,600
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

116
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,200
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

117
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:10,200
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

118
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,000
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,400
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

120
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:27,700
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

121
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Your Highness, I had a dream last night.

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,600
You were fishing peacefully by the lake.

123
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
You looked firm and calm.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Your pose was striking.

125
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,800
A true ruler that befits the throne!

126
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
So right after I woke up,

127
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
I couldn't wait to take Your Highness on a fishing trip.

128
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
We should get a painter.

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let him draw a painting of me fishing by the lake.

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
All the ladies in this land can see how dashing I am.

131
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,300
That can't be done.

132
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
Your Highness is mine alone.

133
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,300
I won't allow the others to have any wild desires for you.

134
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,100
Of course.

135
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,300
Who is it? How dare you ride past His Highness' carrier!

136
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,000
What is going on?

137
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Your Highness, it was General Fu.

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
General Fu?

139
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
It's General Fu.

140
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,200
General Fu.

141
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
What are the odds?

142
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,100
Watch your steps.

143
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,500
Greetings, Crown Prince.

144
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,400
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

145
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,700
This path leads to Lake Qingliang.

146
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,200
- Are you heading there, too?
- General Fu.

147
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Lady Xiang told me the lake is a good fishing spot.

148
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,600
Yes, I can almost imagine...

149
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,700
the brave warrior you are that kills the enemies on the battlefield.

150
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
But I could never imagine...

151
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,400
what General Fu would do when he is fishing.

152
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,000
General Fu, you rarely get a chance to relax.

153
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,500
Why don't you join me fishing?

154
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,700
Just now,

155
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,000
His Majesty mentioned you when I met him.

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,300
I think you should go back at the Eastern Palace.

157
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,400
My father never cares to talk about me.

158
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,800
This is such bad timing.

159
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,900
Your Highness, we can go fishing first.

160
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,700
Then, we can present the fish to His Majesty.

161
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,800
Two birds with one stone.

162
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,600
Xiang, that is a great idea.

163
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Your Highness. Lady Xiang.

164
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
General Fu, there was a burglary at the eastern outskirts.

165
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
We caught the thief.

166
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,300
We have no information about his identity.

167
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,800
Your Highness. Lady Xiang. I must leave now.

168
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
General.

169
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
It's just a mere burglary and some thieves.

170
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Do they really need you to see to this case?

171
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Come fishing with me.

172
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
After I return to the palace,

173
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,700
I can tell my father I was with you all the time,

174
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,800
discussing work while we were fishing.

175
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,400
Xiang, what's wrong?

176
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,200
Your Highness, I am not feeling well.

177
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,400
Could it be that you are pregnant?

178
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,700
Head back to the palace!

179
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,800
We are going back to the palace!

180
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,600
- Get moving!
- Goodbye, Your Highness.

181
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,800
Go on.

182
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,600
- What is it?
- Lady Rong Le was hurt at the lake.

183
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Prince Li saved her and she is still there.

184
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
There are only the two of us here.

185
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Take it as we have never met before.

186
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,300
No identities, no names, no memories.

187
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,400
We are here by chance...

188
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,000
and meeting each other as strangers.

189
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,300
Miss, my hand is hurt.

190
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,200
Will you help me out?

191
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
We have different backgrounds...

192
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,000
and different stands.

193
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
We may have been in love,

194
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
but we never cherished our time together.

195
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,100
I, Zongzheng Wuyou,

196
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,600
will give you all of me.

197
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,800
I will never give up.

198
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,600
I won't let the world down, or you.

199
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,400
Who was the assassin's target?

200
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Prince Zhenbei of Chen.

201
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,800
He came here for the alliance.

202
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,900
If you are upset about what happened today,

203
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,800
perhaps you can go to the lake tomorrow.

204
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,400
Spring is almost upon us.

205
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,800
The view there is nice.

206
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
How is your injury, My Lady?

207
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
Where are Zhao Yun and Ling Yue?

208
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,600
Lady Rong Le, I sent my men to escort them home.

209
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,000
They suffer no serious injury.

210
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,900
General, a moment, please.

211
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,000
I think you owe me an explanation for what happened just now.

212
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
Prince Li.

213
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
This humble servant was shocked to hear about what happened to Prince Zhenbei.

214
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,800
That was my fault.

215
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,200
After I return to the capital, I will apologize to His Majesty.

216
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,000
I came back from the south.

217
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,600
My father put me in charge of overseeing this alliance.

218
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,500
From now on, you can report to me if there is any inquiry.

219
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,700
Don't bother His Majesty with this.

220
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,100
Prince Zhenbei was ambushed.

221
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,400
I saw the whole thing.

222
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,500
During the attack,

223
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,600
your wife was there too.

224
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,300
As for your men,

225
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,000
they were standing by in the area but didn't make a move.

226
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
General, may I know...

227
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,900
what the reason was?

228
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,400
I failed my duty as I failed to ensure Prince Zhenbei's safety.

229
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,900
I am willing to accept punishment.

230
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,100
Prince Li, you may punish me as you see fit.

231
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,000
As for my wife,

232
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,200
I must thank you for her as you saved her in time.

233
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,900
General Fu,

234
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,200
don't you realize that if I had been a moment too late,

235
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,700
your wife would have been dead by now.

236
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,600
Rong Le would have perished.

237
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Which is why...

238
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,400
I must thank you for saving her life.

239
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
After her injury is healed,

240
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
she and I will both express our gratitude to you.

241
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,500
Fu Chou,

242
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,800
do you think everyone will fall for your mask of lies?

243
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,400
Only Rong Le could be fooled by your false tenderness.

244
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
And you used her with no remorse.

245
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
She almost died because of you.

246
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,100
How dare you stand right here...

247
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,000
and claim that she is your wife.

248
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,500
That is not true, Prince Li.

249
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,700
I am sure you are well aware that...

250
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,600
Rong Le and I have been living in harmony for the past six months.

251
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,000
Our life is happy and quiet.

252
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,800
I believe you wouldn't...

253
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,200
ruin the peaceful life she worked so hard on to get.

254
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000
How do you explain what happened earlier?

255
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,200
It was simply an accident.

256
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
I never intended for Rong Le to get hurt.

257
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Not then, not now,

258
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
not in the future.

259
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,300
If you insist that I am using her as my pawn,

260
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,700
I do have some questions for you.

261
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,000
Did you not hurt and lie to her yourself?

262
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,700
If you hadn't,

263
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,200
she wouldn't have chosen to marry me.

264
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,900
Also, on our wedding day six months ago,

265
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,600
you tainted her honor and name.

266
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
She is shunned by the people.

267
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,000
She is haunted by the mocking and rumors.

268
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Don't you remember any of that?

269
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,900
So, I hereby request you...

270
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,700
to do us a favor...

271
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,600
and let Rong Le live in peace.

272
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,600
I must return and tend to my wife's wound.

273
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,400
So long.

274
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Fu Chou!

275
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,600
I hope you won't make my mistake...

276
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,100
and live in regret.

277
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,870
Between Prince Li and I,

278
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,700
we were never the same.

279
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,800
Yali, what do you think about this tea?

280
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,400
The leaves are green, the edge has a ruby red tint.

281
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,000
It has a light fragrance, the natural scent of lily.

282
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,800
The tea is clear like amber.

283
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,400
It has a rich flavor and a tint of sweetness, it's mellow and it lingers.

284
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,200
This tea is remarkable.

285
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,800
Your thoughts on the tea remind me of the person who sent them.

286
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,500
What she said when she brewed the tea for me...

287
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,800
is almost the same as yours.

288
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Who may that be? Have I met her before?

289
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,800
You have known her all along.

290
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,700
She is the wife of General Fu, Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

291
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,900
I heard she opened a teahouse.

292
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,200
It's called the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

293
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,600
After she was married to General Fu,

294
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,200
he renovated the teahouse for her.

295
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,900
The two of them paid me a visit and sent me these tea leaves.

296
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,800
Before this, I never expected a good future for them.

297
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,000
But now, I feel like...

298
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,200
they are actually a perfect match for each other.

299
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
Yali, what is on your mind?

300
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,900
The tea is overflowing.

301
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,100
Yali, I heard that... while you were in Qingzhou,

302
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,500
you were getting along very well with Wuyou.

303
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,900
You looked absent-minded just now.

304
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,600
Are you thinking about him?

305
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
Your Majesty, forgive me.

306
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
Pardon me for being so careless.

307
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,700
It's okay.

308
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,900
Yali, I was once in your shoes, too. Don't feel embarrassed.

309
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,800
Yali.

310
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,860
Come.

311
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,300
I know I am right about you.

312
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,000
In this whole wide world,

313
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you are the only one who can win Wuyou's heart.

314
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,700
Once Wuyou succeeds the throne,

315
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,500
you will become the empress.

316
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,000
When that happens, I hope you remember me.

317
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,900
Thank you for the trust, Your Majesty.

318
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,100
Right. If you ever drop by General Fu's house,

319
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,900
send my thanks to Lady Rong Le for the tea she gave.

320
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:43,000
The crown prince never cares about the nation's affairs.

321
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,200
When he learns about the marriage alliance with Chen,

322
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,500
he sent in his plans right away.

323
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,100
He recommends the ladies of the nobles he is close to...

324
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,400
just to get them to his side.

325
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Does he really think I am too foolish to see that?

326
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,300
I just can't rely on him to do anything helpful.

327
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,900
Father, calm down.

328
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,200
Have an orange, it's sweet.

329
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,700
I brought this back from the south for you.

330
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,500
I picked this orange myself.

331
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,200
I peeled this myself, too.

332
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,700
You planted the tree as well?

333
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,900
Father, you are amazing! How did you know that?

334
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,100
Fine. I am still considering...

335
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,200
which lady should be married to Prince Zhenbei.

336
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,800
I have no time for your chatter.

337
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Why did you come here?

338
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,800
Father, this isn't about anything important.

339
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
It's just that I am no longer a kid.

340
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,900
I learned a lot during my time with Wuyou in the south.

341
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,000
I think, to have my own career, I must first have a family.

342
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,800
- So...
- Your Majesty.

343
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,000
Prince Li wishes to see you.

344
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,500
- Wuyou is back?
- Yes.

345
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,600
Let him in.

346
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,000
Greetings, Father.

347
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
At ease.

348
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,000
Wuyou, your hand is hurt.

349
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,400
Bring the physician here!

350
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,300
Never mind, this is no serious wound.

351
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,400
- It's already dressed.
- Brother.

352
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,700
How is your wound? Let me take a look.

353
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,100
Sit down. Let me see it.

354
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,500
The cut is very deep.

355
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,900
Is it just as Father told me?

356
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,400
Prince Zhenbei was ambushed at Lake Qingliang?

357
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,200
Wuyou, how is the situation at Lake Qingliang?

358
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Tell me what happened.

359
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,900
Father, Prince Zhenbei was ambushed by the assassins from Western Qi.

360
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,800
But he got away safely. He is safe.

361
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,300
I ordered my men to escort him back to the inn.

362
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,700
Did you hurt your hand when you tried to save him?

363
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,500
Father, my hand...

364
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,500
Prince Zhenbei wasn't the only one there when I arrived.

365
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,200
There were Lady Rong Le and Princess Zhao Yun.

366
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,900
- However...
- What?

367
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,400
Zhao Yun was hurt, too?

368
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,600
Calm down, it was just a scrape on her arm.

369
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,400
- She is safe.
- Zhao Yun is hurt?

370
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,000
Father, I must leave.

371
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,700
Sir Chen, I will help you up later.

372
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,800
Come on, are you all right?

373
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,600
Much obliged. I am fine.

374
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,000
But your hand...

375
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,200
- Physician, dress the wound.
- Yes.

376
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,400
You should have seen how dangerous it was.

377
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,500
Those men in black were wearing masks.

378
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,800
They eyes were sharp like blades.

379
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
They swung their swords and charged right at us.

380
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,800
You know, it was so close.

381
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,700
I almost lost my arm.

382
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,200
It's all my fault.

383
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,900
I shouldn't have made fun of you in the letter.

384
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,400
I shouldn't have said that you can't stay in your room.

385
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,000
Then you would have kept yourself inside the house and away from danger.

386
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,100
I am fine. I am a skilled warrior.

387
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,400
This little wound is no big deal. It doesn't hurt.

388
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Do you think I can still get a fish?

389
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
Sure, I am the fish.

390
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,200
You can send the bait and I will bite it.

391
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,400
That is more like it.

392
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,200
It's time for your medicine.

393
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,700
Come.

394
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
You can go now.

395
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,000
After my father finishes the work with the marriage alliance,

396
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I will talk to him about our wedding.

397
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Who said I am marrying you?

398
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,200
You didn't even propose to me.

399
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,800
I took your bait just now.

400
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
You won't get rid of me.

401
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,400
- Take your medicine.
- I am not drinking it.

402
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,000
You need this to get well.

403
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,200
- No.
- Your need this to get well.

404
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,000
- No!
- Just drink it.

405
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,600
- No!
- Please!

406
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,400
I suspect that Fu Chou had his men ready...

407
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
by Lake Qingliang.

408
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,400
But when the assassins from Western Qi attacked the prince,

409
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,000
his men never came in to save Prince Zhenbei.

410
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,200
I suspected he was conspiring with Western Qi.

411
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,200
But he contributed much during the rebellion in the south.

412
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,900
He is renowned in the army.

413
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,100
If I depose him without any solid evidence,

414
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,000
it might cause an uproar.

415
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,200
Besides, this is the crucial moment for our alliance with Chen...

416
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,600
to launch a campaign against Wei.

417
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,200
Father.

418
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,800
I am against forming an alliance with Chen.

419
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,300
I strongly disagree with having a marriage alliance.

420
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Father, the affairs of two nations...

421
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,800
should never involve the love of two young people.

422
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,000
Why must we sacrifice the happiness of a young woman...

423
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,800
for the sake of glory?

424
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,400
Because you put gains before everything, my mother...

425
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,000
spent her whole life in pain.

426
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,400
And now you are using another innocent girl for your ambition.

427
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Enough.

428
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Don't bring up Lady Yun on everything.

429
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,700
Back then, I had no other choice but to marry Fu Yuan.

430
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,800
But it's different now.

431
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
A marriage alliance...

432
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,500
might not necessarily be a sacrifice.

433
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,200
When we were having a marriage alliance with Qi,

434
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
had you listened to my advice,

435
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,400
you and Rong Le would have been a couple living in joy.

436
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Do you still think the alliance is a foul plan?

437
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
I made my decision.

438
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,600
I summoned you back to Zhongshan...

439
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,000
because of this matter.

440
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,100
If we can have Chen as our ally,

441
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,300
I will personally lead our force against Wei.

442
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,200
I will complete my last goal before I pass on the throne.

443
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,900
Wuyou, tell me,

444
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,100
how was the situation in the south?

445
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
Father.

446
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,200
I went into deep cover in the south.

447
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
A dark force is working secretly there.

448
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,600
I suspect the Sun family led by Sun Jizhou...

449
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
is working for a mastermind.

450
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The south is still in danger of falling,

451
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,800
and you still insist on leading our army against Wei.

452
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I am worried that the defense of Zhongshan will be weakened.

453
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,700
The force in the south will use this opening to invade.

454
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,000
I am aware of the danger posed by the south.

455
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This is why I sent you there.

456
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Wei had their eyes on our nation for a long time.

457
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,800
It's either now or never for us.

458
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,800
If Wei and Western Qi join hands,

459
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,400
Northern Lin will be under their total control.

460
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,800
Father, our most pressing matter now...

461
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,600
is to get rid of the traitors.

462
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,300
Meanwhile, the people need to recover.

463
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,900
I am getting old.

464
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,800
I can't wait for you to finish the pacification.

465
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,600
You and Wuyu were in the south for six months.

466
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,000
When I was going through the scrolls in this study,

467
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,600
I felt like there was more to be done.

468
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,100
At night, I would stare at the moon.

469
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,200
It reminded me of your mother.

470
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Your mother made a request before she passed on.

471
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
She wanted you away from the fighting of politics.

472
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,000
She wanted a happy life for you.

473
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,900
I hoped I could make that a reality for you, but I can't.

474
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,100
However, in this world I live in,

475
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,200
I am the most helpless father.

476
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,400
All that I can do for you now...

477
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,600
is to leave you a world free from turmoil.

478
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,000
Father.

479
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,400
All right.

480
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,200
Enough about this.

481
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,000
I hope you can forget the past and start a new life.

482
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That is for the best.

483
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,400
Wuyu talked to me about forming his own family.

484
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,300
Don't fall too far behind.

485
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,800
I failed to protect Lady Rong Le...

486
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,600
and she was wounded because of me.

487
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,800
While you were waiting for the ambush,

488
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,400
didn't you realize Zongzheng Wuyou was there?

489
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,000
It was in the middle of a fight, we were focusing on Lady Rong Le.

490
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,600
I should be punished for not noticing Prince Li's presence.

491
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,600
General, everything was within our control.

492
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,200
We never expected Prince Li would show up and ruin our plan.

493
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,500
We couldn't react in time.

494
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,000
Leave and get your punishment.

495
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
General Fu, I have followed you for years.

496
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I have always been loyal and never made any mistakes.

497
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
This is my only error.

498
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Please, show me some mercy for once.

499
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,600
I wish to follow you, General Fu.

500
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,400
Sparing your life is more than any mercy you deserve.

501
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,800
- General.
- Get out of my sight.

502
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,600
Yes.

503
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,000
Zongzheng Wuyou.

504
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,600
This is the just the beginning.

505
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Sir Xiao.

506
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,800
While the Princess and I were at the lake, where were you?

507
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,800
She wants me to tell you to stop protecting us.

508
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,200
But it can't be helped if you want to spy on us.

509
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,000
Suit yourself.

510
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
General Fu.

511
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,000
General, let me send this medicine to Her Highness.

512
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,800
- You can all go now.
- Yes.

513
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,200
Rong Le.

514
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,100
You are still recovering. You shouldn't be standing.

515
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,800
Let me help you sit down.

516
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,700
I am waiting for an explanation from you.

517
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,800
Finish your medicine.

518
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,800
You are hurt. Don't bother yourself with thoughts.

519
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,600
You wanted me to be at the lake.

520
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,000
Did you want me to have a good time or was it your plan?

521
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,600
Was that really an accident?

522
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,400
Don't you dare tell me you don't know anything.

523
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Finish your medicine.

524
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,300
Once you got well, I can take you to any place you want.

525
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,400
I won't let you get hurt again.

526
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,800
You knew Prince Zhenbei was going to Lake Qingliang.

527
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,000
My brother wanted him dead.

528
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,600
You had an order from His Majesty to protect the prince.

529
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,700
So you used me to save him.

530
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,600
You knew Xiao Sha would hesitate when he saw me.

531
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Then, he would miss the chance to kill Prince Zhenbei.

532
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
You had all of this planned.

533
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,100
You took every precaution there is.

534
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,600
But my safety was never in your consideration.

535
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,100
- If I were killed...
- I won't let that happen.

536
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,400
I will never let you get killed.

537
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,100
It seems like I still have some value after all.

538
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,000
You spent the last six months...

539
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
to earn my trust.

540
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,400
Now that you finally get it,

541
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,000
it would be a waste if you don't use that trust to the fullest.

542
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,400
Rong Le, I never planned for you to get hurt.

543
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,800
I wanted you to go because I knew they wouldn't hurt you.

544
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,600
But I never expected...

545
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,000
you would risk your life for Prince Zhenbei.

546
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,400
You had never met him before.

547
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,200
He was a complete stranger to you.

548
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
A stranger?

549
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Your so-called stranger...

550
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:37,200
was willing to face the enemy just to save me.

551
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,600
What about you?

552
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,200
You claim to be my husband,

553
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,400
that you will keep me safe and love me as we grow old.

554
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,200
Would you give up your life for me?

555
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,000
I would.

556
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,100
If my life was mine to have,

557
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,000
if I were just an ordinary person,

558
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,800
I am willing to give you all of me.

559
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,000
That includes my life.

560
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
If?

561
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,600
If that is the reality,

562
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,200
I would have never become a princess of Western Qi.

563
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I wouldn't be married to this land for my duty.

564
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,200
I wouldn't be my brother's pawn.

565
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,400
I would have never married you...

566
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
or do your bidding.

567
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,900
Rong Le, I admit that I used you.

568
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,000
I regretted every second of it when I learned you were hurt.

569
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,400
I would rather take on those wounds a thousand times more.

570
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,000
Do you know how much I wish...

571
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,500
I was the person who came to your rescue?

572
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,600
All I know is that...

573
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,000
you sent me to face that ambush.

574
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,700
But it wasn't you who saved me from it.

575
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,200
There are some decisions in this world that once they are done,

576
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,700
they can never be undone.

577
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,800
Once the heart is scarred,

578
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,200
the wound may heal but the scar remains.

579
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
That scar...

580
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,000
is not something that can be healed with mere words.

581
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,400
Tell me why the scar Wuyou left in you can be healed so easily!

582
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I saw the two of you standing on the raft.

583
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It was as though you two had the world for yourselves...

584
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,600
and I was just an outsider.

585
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,800
He hurt you, lied to you, and used you!

586
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,900
He humiliated you in front of everyone!

587
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,600
If you could forgive him, why can't you forgive me?

588
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I won't ask to have your love like he did.

589
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,400
I simply wanted you to forgive me like you forgave him.

590
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,500
That is all I ask!

591
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,000
I have been married to you for six months.

592
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,600
I admit it.

593
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,400
I was never in love with you.

594
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,400
But I did put in my effort for you.

595
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,200
I hope we can be friends,

596
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,000
soulmates, or even a family.

597
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,200
Keeping each other company... and grow old together.

598
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,200
But I am your husband!

599
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Family, friends, and soulmates,

600
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,400
those are not enough for me!

601
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
I want your heart to be mine!

602
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Love me like you loved Zongzheng Wuyou,

603
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,300
that is what I want!

604
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,400
I know.

605
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,400
I am asking for forgiveness and your love,

606
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
that is too greedy of me.

607
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,500
But after twenty years of living,

608
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,400
I never expected much or wished for any sort of luxury.

609
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,800
Today, I will wish for one thing, your forgiveness.

610
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,600
Just once.

611
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,400
Our marriage has always been a lie.

612
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,800
You know that you'll use me more than once.

613
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,400
So, why do you keep on lying to yourself...

614
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,000
and why do you want to make things difficult for me?

615
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:40,800
♫ The snow falls on my palm, I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

616
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:49,500
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

617
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,970
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

618
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:58,000
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

619
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:07,400
♫ You are keeping me out with your care,
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

620
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,000
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

621
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,600
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

622
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:25,600
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

623
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,600
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

624
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,800
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

625
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:44,600
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

626
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,800
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

627
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,300
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

628
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:03,500
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

629
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,400
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

630
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,700
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

631
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:25,500
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
