1
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,840
[Episode 43]

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,710
I will have to leave Zhongshan for some time.

3
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,314
There is something that I should have done a long time ago.

4
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:43,473
Your Highness, you can't take the risk.

5
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,836
Send a double to stay in here for me.

6
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,476
Yes, Your Highness.

7
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,560
Kneel.

8
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,677
Sir Sun, what is the meaning of this?

9
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:19,222
Lady Rong Le,

10
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,835
Prince Li spent the night with Yali.

11
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,779
She couldn't inform you in time.

12
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,100
So, she is here to apologize.

13
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,117
You knew this, too?

14
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,405
Princess, Ke'er told me about this.

15
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,780
This way, please.

16
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,167
I thought you never wanted to see me again.

17
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,880
I thought even if I sent my men to get you,

18
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,275
you would refuse to come.

19
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:10,642
Your Highness asks for me,

20
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,758
I wouldn't dare to turn you down.

21
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,121
Your father was there,

22
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,349
you couldn't say anything.

23
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,645
Now that no one is holding you back,

24
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:24,210
will you tell me the truth now?

25
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,843
No one was holding me back.

26
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:37,228
Yali, even until now,

27
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:39,687
you still won't tell me what really happened?

28
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:41,986
That is what happened.

29
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:44,367
Prince Li and I slept together.

30
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:47,357
You can stop lying to yourself now.

31
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,179
I love Prince Li.

32
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,012
He has feelings for me, too.

33
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:56,097
Lady Rong Le, you should give us your blessing.

34
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,720
You once told me...

35
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,818
that you see me as your best friend and soulmate.

36
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:04,264
You want me to have a happy life.

37
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,387
I found my happiness.

38
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:08,723
But you can't accept the truth.

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,840
Yali, I remember telling you...

40
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,349
life may be hard,

41
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:20,100
but we can all be the masters of our own destiny.

42
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,184
Master of my destiny?

43
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:27,452
Each and every step I take right now...

44
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,579
is the choice of my own.

45
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,189
No one is coercing me.

46
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,380
But your attitude towards me...

47
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,920
is pushing me to desperation.

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,636
I am the daughter of the Sun family.

49
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:42,785
For a noble family like mine, name and reputation...

50
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:44,371
come before everything.

51
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:47,880
Since you are betting on the name of your family,

52
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,920
I have nothing more to say to you.

53
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,149
You and your father shall wait for Wuyou's decision.

54
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,920
If you can be part of this house,

55
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,080
I will gladly leave this place.

56
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,644
However, you should watch yourself.

57
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,251
You agreed?

58
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:09,823
If Prince Li agrees,

59
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:12,783
you won't stop me from staying with him?

60
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:16,520
Ling Yue, see the guest off.

61
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,958
Yes.

62
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,145
Miss Sun, this way, please.

63
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,140
Princess,

64
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,115
I think... if we love someone,

65
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:43,700
as long as they are happy,

66
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,303
we will feel happy as well.

67
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,175
I think... if Prince Li does love Miss Sun,

68
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:55,568
when he is happy, you will be happy as well.

69
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:59,820
Why don't you try to accept her?

70
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,564
It's up to her luck.

71
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,191
This is the allocation of funds for the victims of the earthquake in Zhuo.

72
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:16,362
Is there any objection?

73
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,739
I heard Your Highness spent the night...

74
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,844
with Miss Yali, the daughter of Governor of Qingzhou.

75
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,459
Sir Cai,

76
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,400
this is His Highness' personal affair.

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,610
How could you bring it up in court?

78
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,807
That would stain my daughter's honor.

79
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:35,628
Miss Sun has exceptional morals and benevolence.

80
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,889
She is the best lady to be the consort.

81
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,406
The best lady we have?

82
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:41,320
There can only be one consort.

83
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,979
No other woman deserves my brother!

84
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,394
Your Highness, a single woman cannot have power over the harem.

85
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:51,533
And she hasn't born any child even after a year.

86
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:54,019
If this goes on, the people might take this wrongly.

87
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,459
There are rumors that the woman is actually the wife

88
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,310
of Northern Lin's Prince Regent.

89
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,761
She doesn't come clean.

90
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:06,634
She might even be a spy Fu Chou planted here.

91
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,540
And now she is interfering with national affairs and causing disorder.

92
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,780
We all know she has vile intentions.

93
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,339
This is unacceptable!

94
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,200
This is all nonsense!

95
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,670
Wuyu!

96
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,620
Sir Cai, do you mind enlightening me of what action I should take?

97
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,385
Your Highness,

98
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:31,269
my daughter showed you her love.

99
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:34,192
She has the duty to bring your child...

100
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,482
and continue the bloodline.

101
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,811
He is right.

102
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,899
Sir Sun, you are using the innocence of your daughter...

103
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,600
to blackmail me in front of the officers.

104
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,939
This might not sound humiliating to you,

105
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,956
but have you ever considered how Yali might feel?

106
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,198
Leng Yan!

107
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,568
Your Highness, she is here.

108
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,617
Yali, what exactly happened that night?

109
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,321
Tell us what you know.

110
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:21,008
Yali, fear not.

111
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,433
I will be here to speak for you.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,560
Allow me to say it for her.

113
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,980
Prince Li and Miss Sun were never together that night, not at all.

114
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,180
How is this possible?

115
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,617
You little brat, enough of your insolence here.

116
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:43,024
Yali,

117
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:46,572
was Ke'er telling us the truth just now?

118
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,739
Your Highness,

119
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,504
did you ask me here to talk about that night?

120
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:06,419
I have always loved you.

121
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,381
I couldn't help myself...

122
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,401
when you were holding me in your arms.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,252
I don't hope to replace Rong Le.

124
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:18,052
I just want to be with you.

125
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,784
Yali, are you sure that night in this study,

126
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:29,095
we had any intimate contact?

127
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,207
If you refuse to accept me because of Rong Le,

128
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,346
then so be it.

129
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,830
I won't stay here to bother you.

130
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,885
I shall end my life with my tainted honor.

131
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:45,943
Seeing that we were childhood friends,

132
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,365
I will give you another chance.

133
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:50,626
If you want to keep this going,

134
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:53,634
then I shall show no mercy for you.

135
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,660
Come in!

136
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,427
Your Highness, the men's clothes look so awful.

137
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,768
The way of manners is complicated.

138
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,229
Miss Yali,

139
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:10,029
did you enjoy the night you spent with me?

140
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,551
You sneaked out from the infirmary.

141
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:14,903
So, you were here for your "training"?

142
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:18,205
What do you mean with that?

143
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,723
Your Highness,

144
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:33,699
General Luo Zhi wishes to know if the tactical layout you discussed last night...

145
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,392
are already done.

146
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:37,459
Last night?

147
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,244
I was already at General Luo's house at dusk.

148
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,862
We were discussing work.

149
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:46,129
I came back to the study to get changed at half-past six.

150
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:49,245
You were already awake.

151
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:53,770
The guards in this manor and the soldiers of Luo Army...

152
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,654
are witnesses for my whereabouts.

153
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,240
May I know...

154
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,980
how you and I had such an intimate night?

155
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,100
Your Highness, this can't be true.

156
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,820
I may have slept a little too soundly,

157
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,680
- but we clearly had...
- What had you done earlier...

158
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,943
to fall asleep so well?

159
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,254
I am sure you know it better.

160
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:18,338
What are you afraid of?

161
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:21,644
You lit some aphrodisiac incense,

162
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:23,907
I used some of it on you, too.

163
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:26,200
No!

164
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,956
It was Prince Li.

165
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:29,380
It couldn't be you.

166
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,832
Everyone knows I wasn't here that night.

167
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:37,455
If you insist you had any intimate time with someone,

168
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:41,694
we do have many strong men in the house.

169
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:43,250
I am afraid...

170
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,960
Your Highness!

171
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,920
I apologize! Please, do not let me carry this shame!

172
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,940
Otherwise... I will have no courage to live in this world anymore.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,589
Miss Yali,

174
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,823
if you don't want the others to know what happened,

175
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,315
you can show this to them.

176
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,400
See? The virginity fleck is still here.

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,917
Miss Yali is still a virgin.

178
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,860
It's true.

179
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,817
This is odd.

180
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,629
Please, judge this wisely.

181
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,000
Prince Li and I never did anything indecent.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,094
Nothing happened between us.

183
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:38,988
But...

184
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,720
How could a father do that?

185
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,492
Even I know men and women must keep their distance.

186
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,892
But you are tainting your daughter's innocence!

187
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,960
This brat is spitting nonsense and framing me and my daughter.

188
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,067
Is Your Highness not going to do anything?

189
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,838
You may leave now.

190
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,939
Sir Sun, I once thought this was a trick...

191
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,906
the consorts use to win the favor of the emperor.

192
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:12,539
I am surprised that an officer like yourself...

193
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,239
would stoop so low to force my brother into marrying Yali.

194
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:21,259
Right, maybe during the time Miss Sun spent in Northern Lin,

195
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,383
she was having an affair with Prince Regent.

196
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:28,665
Perhaps this is why you are in such a hurry to get her a husband...

197
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:31,611
and used such lowly trickery.

198
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:36,119
I don't know what Your Highness used to coerce my daughter.

199
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,859
Your Highness won't let my daughter be the consort,

200
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,343
but the Silver-Haired Demon that shares the bed with you...

201
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:44,463
should pay for the death of those fallen soldiers.

202
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:49,872
Sir Sun, you are frustrated because your plan failed.

203
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,107
You would even blackmail His Highness.

204
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,006
Your Highness must have overlooked the proposal I submitted.

205
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:05,383
We think the terror of Silver-Haired Demon must end.

206
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:07,542
Aside from the incident at the inn,

207
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:13,328
I also heard about the murder case in the camp of Luo Army.

208
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:17,561
The victim was Luo Qiao, the brother of General Luo Zhi.

209
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,478
How is this possible?

210
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:22,174
They are based outside the city wall, everything was fine.

211
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:25,560
I was informed they are setting out for the border tomorrow.

212
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,019
If Luo Qiao is dead,

213
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,139
General Luo will be furious and charge right in here.

214
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,758
He is right.

215
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,151
Your Highness.

216
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,340
The common folks say the culprit of the murder...

217
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,983
- is the Silver-Haired Demon that lives inside...
- Sir Cai.

218
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,420
Lady Rong Le is in the manor,

219
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,140
how did she kill those men?

220
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,299
You have no evidence and this is your own wild guess.

221
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,948
Who you are accusing now are Prince Li and all of the South.

222
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:56,739
The truth doesn't matter.

223
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,299
The people want an answer.

224
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,929
Answer? This is the answer.

225
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,695
Lady Rong Le is innocent.

226
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,424
Believe whatever you want.

227
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
Your Highness,

228
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,729
this is the request from the people and the officers.

229
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:14,296
Please, end the scourge of this demon.

230
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,820
I am curious.

231
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,128
How did the people request this?

232
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,732
How did the officers request this?

233
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:25,411
Your Highness, end the scourge of this demon for the fallen souls,

234
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:28,739
bring peace to the people. Such is their request.

235
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,116
Marry another consort and continue the bloodline,

236
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:34,040
bring order to the Imperial Court, such is the officers' request.

237
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,588
Enough!

238
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:38,120
Man Yao is my wife.

239
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,650
I won't let her get hurt no matter what the cost.

240
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,444
- Your Highness!
- Sir Sun!

241
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,659
This is where your acting must end.

242
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,931
As for where the murderous Silver-Haired Demon came from...

243
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:52,230
and who the murderer is,

244
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,340
I have the answer.

245
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,214
And I believe you know the truth better than anyone.

246
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,970
Your Highness!

247
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,281
Your Highness, bad news.

248
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:07,183
The soldiers of the northern base sent to Zhuo have returned an hour ago.

249
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,733
They are having a stand-off with the Luo Army.

250
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,496
What?

251
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,980
Last night, 13 soldiers of the northern base died.

252
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,932
Someone spread the rumors about Silver-Haired Demon to the base.

253
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:24,020
A riot broke out, they claim Lady Rong Le is the murderer.

254
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,735
They demand Your Highness to hand over Lady Rong Le...

255
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,279
or they will invade Qingzhou and seize the manor.

256
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,463
But...

257
00:16:32,463 --> 00:16:35,779
Your Highness, there is an uproar among the people and the soldiers,

258
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,520
the nation's order comes first.

259
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,500
Please, take action as soon as possible.

260
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,200
With the nation's fate at stake, Lady Rong Le cannot be the priority,

261
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,884
please consider this matter wisely.

262
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,691
We hope Your Highness will take action as soon as possible.

263
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,301
If I wanted to save someone...

264
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,297
and kill innocents without any evidence,

265
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:04,340
that would truly be a shame to my name.

266
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,656
The evidence for the murders by Silver-Haired Demon...

267
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,992
will be presented to you.

268
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,527
As for the justice the soldiers demand,

269
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:17,781
I will give them an explanation.

270
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,080
Justice for our brothers, hand over the Demon!

271
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:46,580
Justice for our brothers, hand over the Demon!

272
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,862
Brothers of the northern base,

273
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:17,155
if the 13 fallen brothers that died last night...

274
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:20,926
know that you believed the rumors so easily...

275
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,905
and accuse an innocent...

276
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:25,939
while the real culprit is still at large,

277
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,160
I doubt they will rest in peace...

278
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,075
and their souls would be disappointed.

279
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:35,721
My brother Luo Qiao was killed by the same villain.

280
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,674
You know me well.

281
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:41,862
If this is truly Lady Rong Le's doing,

282
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:44,759
I, Luo Zhi, would not tolerate it!

283
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,539
Give our brothers the justice they deserve!

284
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,880
Give our brothers the justice they deserve!

285
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,209
Soldiers, calm down!

286
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,579
- We want answers!
- Within the next 24 hours,

287
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,043
Prince Li will get the evidence and arrest the true killer.

288
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,800
- This is great.
- Good.

289
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,779
You are right.

290
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,437
Fine.

291
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,680
I followed and carried out Prince Regent's order.

292
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,600
I hope Your Highness can shield us from harm.

293
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,827
Letter from the South, all are in place just as you ordered.

294
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,468
We left no trace behind.

295
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,816
Prince Li lost the trust of the soldiers because of the lies about the Demon.

296
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,589
We can soon invade the south.

297
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,240
Sir Sun is so capable of carrying out orders.

298
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:56,340
But he is too greedy and selfish,

299
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,920
he will surely falter.

300
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,859
Very wise, Your Majesty. We asked him to get rid of Luo Qiao...

301
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,240
and he is already making demands to save his skin.

302
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,360
Fortunately, we have other spies there...

303
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,600
and killed those 13 soldiers of the south.

304
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,932
With each death, there is one more trouble for Prince Li.

305
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,459
There is another matter I wonder if I should tell you.

306
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,172
His Highness claims to be sick,

307
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:23,555
but I found out he is actually not in his room.

308
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,852
Empress Fu!

309
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:34,708
Your Majesty, His Highness is ill. He is taking his rest.

310
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,474
Stand down!

311
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,860
Greetings, Empress Fu.

312
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,126
Where is the Prince Regent?

313
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,096
Your Majesty, Prince Regent is...

314
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,627
He is...

315
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:00,640
Speak.

316
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,136
He went to the South.

317
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,460
Why would he go to the South?

318
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,146
I don't know, but he left without packing too many belongings.

319
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:10,659
I wasn't allowed to follow him.

320
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,477
He wanted me to stay here...

321
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:17,316
to keep his secret as long as possible.

322
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:21,712
What else can make him prepare so well just to leave here?

323
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:26,699
His feathers have grown full.

324
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,919
How dare he keep me in the dark.

325
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,859
Captain Chang, you failed your duty and covered up his plan.

326
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,154
By the laws of the Royal Palace, you are punished with 40 beatings.

327
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:39,577
- But...
- Why?

328
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:40,914
The Prince Regent is away,

329
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:44,354
and you dare to disrespect me now?

330
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,860
If His Highness comes back...

331
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,182
and learns that all of you have disrespected me,

332
00:21:51,183 --> 00:21:56,100
I wonder what the punishment would be for all of you.

333
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,760
I apologize, Your Majesty.

334
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,381
I mean no disrespect.

335
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:01,800
I appreciate the lecture.

336
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,720
I will accept the punishment.

337
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,197
The Prince Regent may be away,

338
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:17,868
but the laws still stand.

339
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:20,148
From now on,

340
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:23,720
all matters of the Imperial Court...

341
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,668
must be reported to Senyan Palace in detail.

342
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:29,412
I shall make the decision.

343
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:32,303
If I ever find out...

344
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:35,693
that someone is keeping secrets from me,

345
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:38,238
only a death sentence awaits.

346
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:41,409
Yes, Your Majesty's order is our command.

347
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,400
Uncle, the officers are making requests while...

348
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,077
there is a mutiny on the other side.

349
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,917
Must we to hand over Man Yao and let her get killed?

350
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,434
You know how much my brother loves Man Yao.

351
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:54,125
He would never sacrifice Man Yao just to appease the uproar.

352
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:57,188
Since ancient times, if a consort affects the people's lives,

353
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:59,969
the ruler must make the hard decision.

354
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:01,360
As for the murder in the northern base,

355
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,266
if Wuyou ignores the public outrage for Lady Rong Le,

356
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,579
he will lose the trust of the army and the people.

357
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,991
That will bring even more troubles afterward.

358
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:11,794
Look at the veteran officers that support the reformation.

359
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:15,366
Even they requested to have Lady Rong Le punished.

360
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:17,099
Under these circumstances,

361
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,800
I am afraid not even Wuyou can turn the tide.

362
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,683
Sir Sun didn't hold any punches for this plan.

363
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,348
It's one scheme after another.

364
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:28,579
He knew that even if Wuyou finds out what he did,

365
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,299
there would be no evidence.

366
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,339
After all, people are unpredictable.

367
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,220
Rumors will soon become reality with enough believers.

368
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,019
The man that set up this plot has stood out.

369
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,954
But I have no idea what Wuyou has in place.

370
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,899
The soldiers of the northern base are in high spirit.

371
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,102
Things might not bode well for him.

372
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:50,360
I don't know what my brother's plan is either.

373
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,101
He just told me to stay and keep things in check and keep Man Yao in the dark.

374
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:59,238
But he brought Sir Sun and Sir Cai to the northern base.

375
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,430
[Lingyun Pavilion]

376
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,773
Princess, what are you doing here?

377
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,579
Ke'er, did you know about this?

378
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,177
What was inside this vial? What happened here?

379
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,728
It was...

380
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,440
the Ageing Frost.

381
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,015
General Luo, you promised us Prince Li would be here.

382
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:02,619
Where is he now?

383
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,314
You take money from the ruler so you won't let justice be done to our brothers!

384
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:10,219
We are just common folks who wish to survive!

385
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,419
If Prince Li fails to hand over the Silver-Haired Demon,

386
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,339
we will hand in our armor and quit!

387
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,542
Yes!

388
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:20,019
Hand over the Silver-Haired Demon!

389
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,639
Justice for our brothers! Hand over the Silver-Haired Demon!

390
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:26,876
Prince Li arrives!

391
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,573
Prince Li is here, behave yourselves!

392
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,819
Your Highness, the 13 dead soldiers died the same way as Luo Qiao.

393
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,979
They were cut at the throat and died from blood loss.

394
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,013
There are bite marks at their wounds,

395
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:25,739
but the marks are used to cover the cut.

396
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,863
The rumors about blood-sucking is absurd at best.

397
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:31,019
This is the dagger Captain Leng gave me.

398
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,994
I examined it. This is the weapon of the murderer.

399
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,684
Bring her in.

400
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,459
A woman with silver hair.

401
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,499
- Is she the demon?
- She has silver hair.

402
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,859
- Her hair is silver.
- It's her!

403
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,779
Who else can it be?

404
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,459
The dagger was found on this woman.

405
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,164
Is she really the Silver-Haired Demon?

406
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:06,074
- She is the demon?
- She is the murderer that killed my brother!

407
00:28:06,074 --> 00:28:08,440
Get up!

408
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,219
- That is not her hair?
- It was a wig?

409
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,339
- How is it not her?
- This is weird.

410
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,548
- You are right.
- Indeed.

411
00:28:17,548 --> 00:28:19,354
Sir Sun.

412
00:28:19,354 --> 00:28:21,434
Yes.

413
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,619
Come on the stage and have a look.

414
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,079
See if you know this woman.

415
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,252
I do not know her.

416
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,000
Bring in the waiter.

417
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,753
Sir Sun, why do you want to have me killed?

418
00:28:55,753 --> 00:28:57,179
Who is this guy?

419
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,206
You are too busy to remember him.

420
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:02,299
Of course, you would forget about the insignificant waiter.

421
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,459
But he does remember you.

422
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,083
You almost had him killed.

423
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,080
A month ago, Sir Sun came to me in person.

424
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,720
He gave me a lot of money to spy on a woman in our shop,

425
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,592
especially one with silver hair.

426
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,939
He wanted me to fall down in front of the woman...

427
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,413
and expose her silver hair.

428
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:22,259
But I could tell something was off.

429
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,522
Lady Rong Le has silver hair, too.

430
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:26,779
This is absurd.

431
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,459
After some time, I faltered from this job.

432
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,960
I asked my boss to return the money to Sir Sun,

433
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:33,450
I quit my job and went home.

434
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:36,019
Then, Sir Sun used a suicide warrior to replace you...

435
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,739
as the waiter at the inn.

436
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,087
But the bard was caught in action.

437
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:41,899
Sir Sun didn't want any loose ends,

438
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,814
so he killed everyone who knew of this plan.

439
00:29:44,814 --> 00:29:49,279
He is resourceful, he bribed the prison guards to kill the imprisoned bard.

440
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,259
But you returned home and escaped his death claw.

441
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,158
I was lucky enough to find you.

442
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:58,519
Not only did I save your life, I even caught this silver-headed woman!

443
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,819
This is ridiculous!

444
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:02,820
You can go now.

445
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,414
Yes.

446
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,865
Bring the chest here.

447
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,260
I am sure you recognize this chest, Sir Sun.

448
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,779
Your house was guarded.

449
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,184
If I hadn't invited you here,

450
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:36,062
I doubt I could even find this chest.

451
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:39,218
That bard was spreading all kinds of lies...

452
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:41,612
and took control of the renowned Serene Hill Inn.

453
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,778
That inn was in fact the property of the Sun family.

454
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:47,158
The seal of the Sun family is on this land deed.

455
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,821
Do you mean the story about Silver-Haired Demon...

456
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:53,575
were all lies made by Sir Sun?

457
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,776
There is more.

458
00:30:56,777 --> 00:31:01,270
"I, Fu Chou, thank you for planning the mutiny in the year of the rooster.

459
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,579
The five thousand taels of silver shall fund your rebellion,

460
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,855
the rest can be kept for your family."

461
00:31:07,856 --> 00:31:09,920
Mutiny in the year of the rooster?

462
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,252
The mutiny six years ago... was connected to the Sun family?

463
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:17,608
- Right! The refugees' mutiny!
- How is this possible?

464
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,850
"The Zheng family is doomed, you need not worry, Sir Sun.

465
00:31:20,851 --> 00:31:23,139
I have settled everything in court.

466
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,547
I will place all the charges on the Zheng family.

467
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,899
Sir Sun, you have nothing to be worried about.

468
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,448
A hundred acres of land is for you on the eastern outskirts."

469
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:33,289
- Silence!
- Sir Sun!

470
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,877
The Zheng family conspired with the rebels, they robbed us of land with war.

471
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:41,238
Are you connected to the rebels as well?

472
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:44,899
"If the reformation in the south is a success, both the people and army will become over-powered.

473
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,459
The commoners will rise up against the weakened nobles.

474
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,754
I was hoping to marry my daughter to Zongzheng Wuyou to secure my status and power.

475
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:54,899
By spreading rumors about the evils of the Silver-Haired Demon,

476
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,100
I will make it popular to the people and convince them of such thoughts."

477
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,060
It was Sir Sun's doing?

478
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,040
I am sure you can see the truth now.

479
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,050
All of these letters are marked with the seal of General Fu Chou.

480
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,223
As for where the stories of Silver-Haired Demon come from,

481
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:30,028
I am sure all of you should know by now.

482
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:34,399
The ledgers of Sun family that records the years of land-hoarding through war...

483
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,608
and the reports from the people he suppressed with his ranks... are all here.

484
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:41,936
He committed so many crimes!

485
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,528
Sir Sun!

486
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:49,140
Sir Sun, we have witnesses and evidence.

487
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,480
What do you have to say now?

488
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,499
You made up the rumors about a demon to frame my wife.

489
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,299
That is your first crime.

490
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,748
You hired an assassin to kill Luo Qiao and 13 other soldiers.

491
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,700
That is your second crime.

492
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,639
You secretly caused years of disorder in order to help Fu Chou secure a place for you,

493
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:13,780
your doings caused countless of people to lose their homes.

494
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,499
And because of your own greed,

495
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,320
you tried to beguile the army and conspire with the enemy.

496
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,279
That is your third crime.

497
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,739
These charges alone are enough to get your wealth confiscated and your rank removed.

498
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,971
You will be tried and executed.

499
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:31,398
Lock him up!

500
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,061
Your Highness,

501
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:44,019
even if there is evidence to prove me guilty,

502
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,969
your wife still cannot run away from her crimes.

503
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:51,302
Even if she never killed anyone for blood, she is married to two men.

504
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:53,002
She disrupts the order of the court.

505
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:55,547
The people of Zhongshan died because of her.

506
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:58,461
The army is swayed because of her.

507
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:01,639
Your Highness, ask your own conscience.

508
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,669
Is it more loathsome that I hired a killer...

509
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,248
or is it more terrifying that...

510
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:11,290
the Silver-Haired Demon seduces you into abandoning your nation?

511
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,062
Take this man to the cell.

512
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,802
Walk!

513
00:34:16,802 --> 00:34:19,939
The demon is sucking His Highness dry!

514
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,859
She kills the trust of the people!

515
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,679
The people need answers! The demon must be killed!

516
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,099
The demon must be killed!

517
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,230
The demon must be killed! The demon must be killed!

518
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,054
The demon must be killed!

519
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,239
Your Highness, Sir Sun might be absurd,

520
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,379
but Lady Rong Le has silver hair, it is indeed suspicious.

521
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:49,072
The people have great fear for her.

522
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:52,570
They might start to doubt Your Highness soon.

523
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,171
If Your Highness insists to let Lady Rong Le go unpunished,

524
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:59,336
the reformation and campaign against Fu Chou...

525
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:00,979
will suffer setbacks!

526
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,659
He is right!

527
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,779
- He is right.
- The efforts will suffer setbacks.

528
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,900
Indeed.

529
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,305
If you wish to pry my resolve,

530
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:14,795
then I shall gladly show you my resolve!

531
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,179
Silver hair!

532
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,740
- What is going on?
- How did this happen?

533
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,405
I have silver hair, too.

534
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:58,040
How will you punish me now?

535
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:03,762
Whatever you wish to do to her,

536
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,212
you must first go through me.

537
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,028
What is this Ageing Frost?

538
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:23,025
It's a rare poison.

539
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,536
It's effect is violent.

540
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:26,099
It's not lethal,

541
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,629
but it brings unimaginable pain,

542
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:31,295
a pain worse than death itself.

543
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,980
♫ How much love and hate has fooled the world? ♫

544
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,759
♫ Time is passing and your lover is waiting for you ♫

545
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:52,739
♫ I'm lost in thought, thinking about my lonely fate ♫

546
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,100
♫ Red Dust is slightly hot, and sincerity is easily cold ♫

547
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,620
Any who takes this poison will suffer a reversal in blood flow.

548
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,663
The pain is worse than being pierced by volleys and smashed organs.

549
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,977
It will turn the hair silver...

550
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,314
in just one night.

551
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:15,985
Ten years of life will be taken.

552
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:23,540
♫ The wind blows across my cheeks, sending him away ♫

553
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:30,475
♫ Your words of affection had me believe you ♫

554
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:36,268
♫ Who said that the world is flourishing? ♫

555
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:43,288
♫ There are greed and jealousy
and people's hearts are unpredictable ♫

556
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:48,887
♫ You'll get nothing even if you can find out about the truth ♫

557
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:55,209
♫ I hope that I and that one person are together
until our hair turns white ♫

558
00:37:58,932 --> 00:38:04,543
♫ How much love and hate has fooled the world? ♫

559
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:11,459
♫ Time is passing and your lover is waiting for you ♫

560
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:17,819
♫ I'm lost in thought, thinking about my lonely fate ♫

561
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:24,605
♫ Red Dust is slightly hot, and sincerity is easily cold ♫

562
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,760
♫ How many rights and wrongs have fooled the world? ♫

563
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,059
♫ Time is passing and your lover is hurting ♫

564
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:08,406
♫ It's inevitable that we part but I just wish
that it wouldn't be so cruel ♫

565
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:14,753
♫ After the harsh winter, comes spring again ♫

566
00:39:14,754 --> 00:39:20,361
♫ After the harsh winter, comes spring again ♫

567
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:22,562
What if she is a woman?

568
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:24,886
What if she has silver hair?

569
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:28,799
The people believe in me, not because of my looks,

570
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,090
but for where my heart lies.

571
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,375
Lady Rong Le stood by me all this time.

572
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,619
She helped plan the reformation effort...

573
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,982
and improved the life many.

574
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,939
But to avoid any attention, she never asked for credits.

575
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,120
She never told you...

576
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,160
that half of the south is thriving because of her.

577
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,259
That is the Imperial Seal!

578
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,819
The Imperial Seal left by the late emperor!

579
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,540
- You are right!
- It's the Imperial Seal.

580
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,231
My father gave her the Imperial Seal before passing on.

581
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:08,340
In order to protect the Imperial Seal, she put her life at risk...

582
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,753
so it would not fall into the hands of the villains...

583
00:40:11,753 --> 00:40:14,620
but in the hands of its rightful owner.

584
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,805
She understands my vision.

585
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:19,419
She supports my loyalty to my father.

586
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,399
She understands my ambition to unify the land.

587
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:26,179
I did not crown myself the emperor and kept the Imperial Seal a secret.

588
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:28,139
She carries out her duty with honor.

589
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,229
Yet she never took credit for anything.

590
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,859
From now on, we will both carry silver hair...

591
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,514
and move forward as one.

592
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:45,775
She will be my only wife.

593
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,620
She will be my only princess consort in the whole south.

594
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,541
Long Live the Princess Consort!

595
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,280
Long Live the Princess Consort!

596
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,760
You may go now.

597
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,766
Yali.

598
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,826
Did Prince Li mention how he will punish you?

599
00:42:21,826 --> 00:42:23,859
He didn't say anything.

600
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,991
He did nothing either.

601
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:28,774
It's just as I expected.

602
00:42:28,774 --> 00:42:32,974
Because of old times' sake, he won't hurt you.

603
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,884
What old times' sake?

604
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:39,320
He and I have never shared any old times' sake.

605
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,495
All he has is a newly found hate.

606
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:01,780
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

607
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,140

612

613
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:41,690
