00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:32,532
[Episode 34]

2
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:35,504
This is not about anyone.

3
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,505
Even without Wuyou,

4
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:39,232
the outcome would still be the same.

5
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,835
Then I must fight for my fate!

6
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,600
The person who will be with you to the end...

7
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,162
and die by your side...

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,300
is none other than me.

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,816
For this lifetime,

10
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:57,240
this is where my fate with you ends.

11
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,959
Young Master, I am...

12
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,599
First, you disguised as her and ruined my plan.

13
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,502
I simply gave you some punishment.

14
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:52,133
And now you disguised as her and seduced me.

15
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,996
I can't wait to kill you myself!

16
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:56,640
That is because I love you too much!

17
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,257
If I could make you happy for a moment, I am willing to put on her face.

18
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:05,619
As long as you want it, I can put on a mask for you and take on her look.

19
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,582
Are you pitying me?

20
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,479
You pity me for not winning her heart and making her mine?

21
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,879
So you put on her face and show me your sympathy.

22
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,060
No, I just don't know any other way I can love you!

23
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,240
If killing me can make you happy, then so be it!

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,348
I would rather die by your blade than in the hands of the Creed.

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,996
If you like her looks so much,

26
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,973
I will make your wish come true.

27
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:56,692
All of you want me to complete that plan.

28
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:59,666
You will make it happen for me.

29
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,555
Young Master!

30
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:04,359
Not even I can see through your disguise.

31
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,519
If we make some improvements,

32
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,966
I believe Zongzheng Wuyou will be fooled, too.

33
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,759
Tell him the truth after it's done.

34
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,153
Trust me, he will feel so much guilt.

35
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,900
No!

36
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,560
Chang Jian.

37
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,161
Yes, General Fu.

38
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,700
Lock her inside the chamber.

39
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,720
- Keep an eye on her.
- Yes.

40
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,567
If anything goes wrong,

41
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,773
don't bother coming back to me.

42
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:43,118
- Yes.
- One more thing.

43
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:47,451
Summon the commanders of the Royal Army and Armor Troops for me.

44
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:49,057
Yes.

45
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,597
I knew it.

46
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:28,453
As long as you wear the face of that woman,

47
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,993
he couldn't bear to kill you.

48
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:35,416
Your mission is a great success.

49
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:39,619
After our grand plan succeeds,

50
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,782
I will let you leave this place.

51
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,623
Crown Prince has been searching for the Imperial Seal in a state of worry.

52
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:02,363
He searched His Late Majesty's royal study.

53
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:04,559
Then, he searched the empress' room.

54
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,475
Today, he searched the whole Royal Garden for it.

55
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,999
He even ordered his men to look for it in the dried well.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,416
Xiang!

57
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:15,271
- Your Highness, you are drunk.
- Hen Xiang!

58
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,335
- Hen Xiang!
- Your Highness.

59
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,959
- You are drunk.
- I was so nice to you.

60
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,200
You ingrate! You pointed a knife at me?

61
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,528
- Your Highness.
- Once I become the emperor,

62
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:30,148
my first order is to have you killed by Fu Chou!

63
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:32,529
He will sacrifice you without any hesitation.

64
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,124
Because you are just the same as me.

65
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,208
We are all his pawns.

66
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,119
I am just a pawn!

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,039
Your Highness, General Fu is here.

68
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,151
I want him out of here!

69
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:47,215
It seems like His Highness is drunk.

70
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:50,430
Your Highness, you should return to your room and rest.

71
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,907
Fu Chou!

72
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,385
Do you think threatening me...

73
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:57,811
will allow you to control me?

74
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:00,339
Think about it.

75
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,024
Without me,

76
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:07,049
you are just a traitor with command over the army.

77
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,479
When Zongzheng Wuyou is back,

78
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,406
no one will bow down to you.

79
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:14,989
Bring it here!

80
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,274
Do you even know...

81
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:27,038
what this is?

82
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,222
This is the supreme Imperial Seal.

83
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:35,094
Now that I have it, I can have my coronation tomorrow.

84
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,258
What is the meaning of this? This is treason!

85
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,740
Guards.

86
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,279
- Arrest this man.
- Yes.

87
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,782
What is the meaning of this? This is treason!

88
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,839
Your father just passed away days ago.

89
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
Zongzheng Wuyou has troops in the south.

90
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,579
You must be patient for your coronation.

91
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,978
As for the Imperial Seal,

92
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,209
I will keep it for you.

93
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,843
Bring His Highness back.

94
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:24,300
You treacherous scoundrel!

95
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:25,719
Let go of me!

96
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,957
This is treason!

97
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,959
- You are dismissed.
- Yes.

98
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,824
You can all leave now.

99
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,712
I appreciate the help just now.

100
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,960
Why are you talking to me like I am stranger?

101
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,714
General Fu, did you ask me here to the Royal Garden...

102
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:55,038
to talk about what happened at your house?

103
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,040
You won't even keep this fragrance pouch with you?

104
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,921
I know it was all too sudden.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,100
But you must understand, that was the only time I could be so brave...

106
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,734
and pursue my own love.

107
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,300
You may have turned me down, but I have no regrets.

108
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,549
You need not be bothered by this matter...

109
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,229
or be so cruel to me.

110
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,198
General Fu. But...

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,232
This fragrance pouch has been with me all this time.

112
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:38,504
Actually, I am not trying to give it back.

113
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:42,439
Do I really hold a place in your heart?

114
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:45,540
I will give it my all to fight for what's rightfully mine.

115
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,771
Soon, you will have an answer.

116
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,135
I shall always be there for you, whether in life or in death.

117
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:04,486
Do I have the honor to have dinner with you tonight?

118
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,063
Everything is ready.

119
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,662
Fu Chou is waiting in the manor.

120
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:26,470
Our men had Chang Jian distracted.

121
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:29,204
No other people can come near this house.

122
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,252
Very well.

123
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
[A Propitious Sky is Favorable for the Land]

124
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,140
Your Majesty, is the princess not in this room?

125
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,929
But the guards said she hasn't stepped outside the whole day.

126
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,330
Leave the stuff here.

127
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:13,226
You can go now.

128
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:15,648
If Rong Le refuses to see me,

129
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:17,931
then I shall be here waiting for her...

130
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:20,479
until she is willing to come out.

131
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,980
Yes.

132
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,480
Your Majesty!

133
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:37,342
Your Majesty.

134
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:40,280
You haven't taken your medicine in two months.

135
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,789
And you journeyed a long way to come here.

136
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,449
- I am worried that...
- Silence.

137
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,745
I am all right.

138
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,739
You can leave now.

139
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,378
Yes.

140
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,580
So, this is the room you live in after getting married.

141
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,363
For countless nights,

142
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,315
I would stand inside your room back in Qi.

143
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,871
I would picture the place you live in right now.

144
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,265
Whatever place it is,

145
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,566
while you are there,

146
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:36,500
it will be filled with serenity and warmth.

147
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Is this the table where you do your writing and reading?

148
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,098
So that reminiscence does not linger,

149
00:12:58,099 --> 00:12:59,986
so that sorrow never lasts.

150
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,611
Do you remember this poem?

151
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:07,827
I write it several times a day.

152
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,620
Is this where you have your meals?

153
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,006
I have Little Xun prepare an extra pair of chopsticks every day.

154
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:25,072
All the cuisines are your favorite.

155
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,240
But I was always alone.

156
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,116
It feels so awful I can barely swallow the food.

157
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,986
Do you watch the moon from here every night?

158
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:51,591
I feel glad every time I see the moon.

159
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:54,187
Because even if we are miles apart,

160
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:56,740
we can still see the same moon.

161
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,540
I thought you refused to see me.

162
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,970
Why do you come here for this sudden visit?

163
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,273
What is your plan this time? What do you want from me?

164
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,395
You finally agree to see me.

165
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,993
Rong Le.

166
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,028
How are you?

167
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,846
Don't come any closer.

168
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,820
I miss you a lot.

169
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,613
Get your hand away from me!

170
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,718
Get your hand away from me!

171
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:44,638
I miss you so much.

172
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,819
This time, I would rather die than be used by you.

173
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,240
Fear not.

174
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,919
I came to you today...

175
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,699
because I want to make up for lost time and talk to you.

176
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,573
I miss the tea you brew.

177
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,840
Will you... make some tea for me?

178
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,919
Did you really come all the way to Northern Lin...

179
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,671
just to have some tea with me?

180
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:29,846
You didn't come here for the tea.

181
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,754
Why do you bother pretending?

182
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:33,764
It's a waste of time.

183
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,999
So, asking for the tea you make...

184
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,980
has become a luxurious thought.

185
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,384
I have had enough of your evil plots and plans.

186
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:50,140
I have no means to stop you.

187
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,567
I am sure you know.

188
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,030
Thanks to your medicine,

189
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,488
I have only months to live.

190
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,738
I don't want to be caught up in your wicked conspiracy.

191
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,839
I want to live my life in peace.

192
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,639
I remember... the desserts that you loved the most.

193
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,240
I made some desserts especially for you.

194
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,780
Do you honestly think I would eat the food you sent?

195
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,565
You don't need to.

196
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:34,299
But underneath these desserts are notes.

197
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:39,131
Each of the notes... is written with a promise I can give you.

198
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,260
If you really think these promises...

199
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:45,325
are not enough to let you have these desserts,

200
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:47,491
then I shall leave you in peace.

201
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,144
Don't bother.

202
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,560
I don't need you to make me any promises.

203
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,100
I just want you out of my sight.

204
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,639
You are unwell.

205
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,880
You should return to Western Qi at once.

206
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,332
Won't you look at me just once?

207
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,874
The first is the osmanthus jelly.

208
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:31,694
I remember... you loved the scent of osmanthus flowers.

209
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:36,160
I ground the osmanthus powder myself.

210
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,702
"You shall meet Zongzheng Wuyou tomorrow."

211
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,840
Wuyou will arrive here tomorrow?

212
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,885
But... I am trapped inside this house.

213
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:57,060
How do I meet him?

214
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,470
The second dessert is the greengage cake.
(Greengages are a member of the plum family.)

215
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,657
I made this with the greengage wine I brewed myself.

216
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:11,304
"You will leave the General's Manor safely."

217
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,633
But even if I meet Wuyou,

218
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:27,100
I have only months to live.

219
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:30,719
He will be upset if he knows about this.

220
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
I would rather hide myself from him.

221
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,660
The third dessert is the maidenhair cake.
(Maidenhair is the nut from the Ginkgo Biloba tree.)

222
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,900
I plucked the leaves...

223
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,480
one by one with my own hands.

224
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,540
"You can live without sickness for one year."

225
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,440
Is this your promise for me...

226
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
or is this another one of your tricks?

227
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,300
If you are willing to have the dessert with me...

228
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,762
and talk to me,

229
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:22,284
I can swear in the name of my throne and my people...

230
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:26,783
that all three promises will become a reality.

231
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,260
I am poisoned thanks to you.

232
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,857
How do I know there is no poison in those desserts?

233
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,300
We'll each take half.

234
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,704
Will you trust me now?

235
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,869
Rong Le, you must remember...

236
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:35,846
what I am about to tell you.

237
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:39,550
Other than life and death,

238
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,361
nothing else matters.

239
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:45,300
I just want you to live.

240
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,723
Nothing else matters to me.

241
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,599
As for the pain you could overcome,

242
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,832
when you look back at them years from now,

243
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,253
you will find them insignificant.

244
00:20:56,253 --> 00:21:00,694
Besides, nothing is absolute in this world,

245
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,767
be it right or wrong, good or evil.

246
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,761
It's just like the desserts here.

247
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:09,849
They each have a different taste.

248
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:12,919
The same goes for all that happens in this world.

249
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,473
I remember you once blamed me... for marrying you to Northern Lin.

250
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:24,414
But from what I see,

251
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:26,660
you may have gone through all kinds of suffering,

252
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,335
but you met Zongzheng Wuyou.

253
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:34,330
Perhaps for you, this is the greatest joy.

254
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:56,238
Rong Le, remember,

255
00:21:56,976 --> 00:22:00,135
in order to acquire the greatest happiness,

256
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,740
you must endure the most dire of hardships.

257
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,126
No matter what happens,

258
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,453
do not give up on living.

259
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,205
You must live on.

260
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,046
Do you understand?

261
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,138
Rong Le?

262
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,700
These desserts are poisoned.

263
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,717
Didn't you take it, too?

264
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:35,530
Why?

265
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,416
Why?

266
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,559
They are not poisoned.

267
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:44,397
Sleep soundly for a while.

268
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,217
Rong Le.

269
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,086
I feel so happy tonight.

270
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,412
We had dessert together

271
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:06,300
and we talked.

272
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,923
Please.

273
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,969
These are the cuisines from Qingzhou.

274
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,538
Yes.

275
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:41,975
I heard these are your favorite, so I have the cook make these.

276
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:44,035
I wonder if you will like them.

277
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,450
I heard Prince Li will arrive in Zhongshan soon.

278
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,146
I saw the quarrel you had with the crown prince.

279
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,827
Your relationship with Prince Li was even...

280
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:05,379
The Imperial Court is in a mess.

281
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,374
I am worried for you.

282
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:11,262
You need not be worried. I am the General of Defense.

283
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:14,620
It doesn't matter who sits on the throne.

284
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,399
My sole duty... is to do what I can to protect the people of Northern Lin.

285
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:22,425
Whatever you have in mind,

286
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:25,956
you will always have my support.

287
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,440
Right.

288
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,364
There will be a great show tomorrow at court.

289
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,818
Will you join me for the show?

290
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,884
Sure.

291
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:36,602
To your health, General.

292
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,097
Rong Le, please don't blame me for this.

293
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,560
I just want you to live on.

294
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,187
I am...

295
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:20,740
General.

296
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,420
Zongzheng Wuyou led the army to the city gate.

297
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,930
Zongzheng Wuyou is finally here.

298
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,539
No! No!

299
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,958
Bring her there.

300
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,050
[Lin Entrance]

301
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,479
You treacherous prince! You killed His Majesty!

302
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,405
You will pay for it!

303
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,766
Enough of your nonsense! Silence!

304
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,928
- Take him out of here.
- Yes.

305
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,650
Fu Chou must have come prepared.

306
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:56,760
He is planning to strike from the dark.

307
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,199
According to the tactical map Man Yao gave us,

308
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:04,498
he has troops around the city gate and the surrounding areas.

309
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,319
If the Royal Army is under his command,

310
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,100
they won't let their guard down and be defeated so easily.

311
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,700
Brother!

312
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:15,925
Brother!

313
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,067
Brother!

314
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,904
You are finally back!

315
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,620
Our father is...

316
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,980
Fu Chou framed you for killing our father.

317
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:38,937
I have failed you.

318
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:42,170
Brother, I want revenge.

319
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,020
I want revenge.

320
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:47,181
Wuyu, this is not your fault.

321
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:50,120
I know it was hard for you to fight alone in the capital.

322
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,917
But this is not the time for grieving.

323
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,734
Fu Chou has control over the royal palace.

324
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:58,259
We need to be cautious. He must not get away with this.

325
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:01,550
This is the only way we can avenge our father.

326
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,699
You must promise me,

327
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,759
if anything goes wrong for me today,

328
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,819
you must keep the soldiers and the people safe.

329
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:11,780
Keep our main force safe.

330
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,624
Brother, I will follow your orders.

331
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:20,960
Wuyu, I thought Fu Chou had you under house arrest.

332
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,640
Why would he let you walk around freely?

333
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,159
Brother, I was being locked up.

334
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,766
But all the guards that watch me were redeployed this morning.

335
00:30:31,117 --> 00:30:35,763
He timed this so precisely and knows about my return.

336
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:39,011
It looks like he come prepared.

337
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,790
Your Highness, Princess Rong Le is not inside the manor.

338
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,687
Xiao Sha.

339
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:48,914
Do you know where she is?

340
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:51,631
She was in the manor before I left.

341
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:55,880
Brother, could it be that she is hidden inside a secret chamber?

342
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:59,856
Xiang Ying, you know the manor very well.

343
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:02,954
Go to the manor and find Man Yao at all costs.

344
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:04,470
Yes!

345
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,064
Your Highness, the princess wanted me to give you this letter.

346
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,640
[Dear Wuyou]

347
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,637
Wuyou,

348
00:31:18,637 --> 00:31:21,825
if you have to choose between me and the greater good,

349
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,680
do not hesitate because of me.

350
00:31:26,274 --> 00:31:28,199
After the parting with each other in this lifetime,

351
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,691
we will meet again in our next life.

352
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:33,136
After all of this is over,

353
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:36,287
and if I have the chance to meet you again,

354
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:40,281
I will explain why I turned you down.

355
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,440
If we never meet again,

356
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,680
maybe we will in our next lives.

357
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,513
Your Highness, we have enemies from all corners.

358
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,829
Wei is waiting to strike us down.

359
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:17,881
There are traitors waiting to launch a mutiny.

360
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:19,546
The nation needs its leader.

361
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,646
Please hold the coronation as soon as possible.

362
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:26,803
Lead the officers and bring peace to the Imperial Court.

363
00:32:26,803 --> 00:32:29,657
My father was killed by my treacherous brother.

364
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:34,177
I am in great pain for my loss.

365
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:37,514
You are right, the nation needs its leader.

366
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:40,380
I think the matter with my coronation...

367
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,305
needs to be done with haste and without grandeur.

368
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:49,678
But...

369
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,860
But...

370
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,220
- Prince Li.
- Prince Li?

371
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,001
Our father just passed away.

372
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:13,912
Yet you couldn't wait to get on the throne.

373
00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:18,260
Guards! Get this traitor arrested!

374
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,335
Have him executed!

375
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,419
Where is Captain Zhao and his 3,000 men?

376
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,730
Where are General Fu's Armor Troops?

377
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,240
The Royal Army is under my command.

378
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,400
As for Fu Chou's whereabouts,

379
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,183
I was hoping you can tell me.

380
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,460
You traitor!

381
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,640
You killed our father and obstructed the campaign,

382
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,928
and now you are leading the troops to charge in here!

383
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:49,840
How dare you make demands while standing there bold like brass!

384
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:51,936
Prince Li,

385
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:56,019
do you think forcing my hand will cover your crime and get you the throne?

386
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:59,840
Do you think of me and the other officers as fools?

387
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,209
Do you really think I would stay in silence...

388
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:06,701
and be shunned while you accuse me for what I never did?

389
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:08,405
I am a traitor?

390
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:10,441
Other than what Fu Chou told you,

391
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:15,331
what witness and evidence do you have to prove that I killed our father?

392
00:34:15,331 --> 00:34:20,472
But I have all the soldiers of the south to be witness...

393
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:23,628
that I never left the camp of the southern border.

394
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,822
But you, as Crown Prince,

395
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:29,326
you didn't investigate to catch the real killer...

396
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:31,455
and avenge our father.

397
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:34,083
And yet, you are worried about your coronation?

398
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,360
You are just an ingrate.

399
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,838
You...

400
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,254
You said I am an ingrate?

401
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:43,939
While our father was still alive,

402
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:47,836
I never disrespected him even when he lectured me.

403
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,119
What about you? You are Prince Li.

404
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,514
In the whole of Northern Lin,

405
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:54,917
you are the only man who can make him mad and fall ill.

406
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:59,830
It was you that had a fallout with him before the campaign.

407
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,520
And now you are leading your troops to force my hand.

408
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,679
You would have brought them to the camp the other day!

409
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:09,077
Even if you failed to assassinate him,

410
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:12,075
you would have driven him to death!

411
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,140
Everything points towards you.

412
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Why would I need any evidence?

413
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,872
If you accuse me of killing him,

414
00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:21,685
I bet no one would believe you.

415
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:24,946
I may have argued with our father on some matters.

416
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:27,645
But it was all for the sake of the people.

417
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:30,140
I didn't do so for personal gain.

418
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,156
Crisis rises from all corners.

419
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:39,959
Wei and Western Qi are waiting for a chance to invade our land.

420
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,380
Just outside Zhongshan,

421
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,845
hundreds of fugitives have lost their home and are starving.

422
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:47,060
If anyone tries to sway their minds,

423
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,030
it will cause an uprising.

424
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:52,378
Tell me, Crown Prince,

425
00:35:52,378 --> 00:35:55,848
did you send an ambassador to persuade the Emperor of Qi?

426
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:59,800
Did you think about deploying troops to guard the border?

427
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:03,958
Did you think about how to help those fugitives?

428
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:10,026
If you do nothing, you have no right to rule.

429
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:14,345
You are incapable of bringing peace to the people.

430
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:18,119
Because I am the crown prince that His Majesty chose!

431
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,315
You are just a prince.

432
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,019
Whether you can keepthe title or not...

433
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,490
depends on how I feel about you after the coronation.

434
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:32,088
Your Highness, the coronation is a pressing matter.

435
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:36,368
No matter how simple it can be, two items are necessary.

436
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:39,599
First of all, the will of the late emperor.

437
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,707
The second item is the Imperial Seal.

438
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:45,114
Does Your Highness possess...

439
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,000
The Imperial Seal?

440
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,413
Read my father's will aloud.

441
00:37:08,413 --> 00:37:10,272
I have reigned for 26 years.

442
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,962
The nation is at peace and the people live in harmony.

443
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:17,430
The crown prince is an honorable man like myself.

444
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,959
- Keep it going.
- I will pass the throne to him.

445
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:23,063
I hope the other princes will assist him...

446
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:25,291
in leading this nation.

447
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,800
- It's a fake!
- How is that a fake?

448
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,154
What is going on?

449
00:37:43,154 --> 00:37:45,248
But...

450
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:46,612
This is...

451
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:48,860
This can't be a fake.

452
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,800
Before our father set out,

453
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,345
he passed this to me personally.

454
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:57,506
It's you!

455
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:00,011
You swapped the Imperial Seal!

456
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,688
Give me back the seal! Give it to me!

457
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:06,011
- Give me the Imperial Sea!
- Stop pretending!

458
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,186
Gentlemen, you are all the pillars of Northern Lin.

459
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:15,137
You gave it your all to serve this nation.

460
00:38:15,137 --> 00:38:17,339
My father placed his trust in you.

461
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:21,144
I am standing right here... not because I want the throne.

462
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:25,004
If my father passed on the duty of a ruler to the crown prince...

463
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:27,266
and he is capable and benevolent,

464
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,670
I will do my best to assist him.

465
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,283
But the crisis and the crown prince's actions...

466
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:35,875
are something we witnessed together.

467
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,835
What do you think must be done?

468
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,607
Your Highness, I think we must reconsider everything carefully.

469
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:49,033
I hope Prince Li will lead us to resolve the situation.

470
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,619
Please lead us to resolve the situation.

471
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:04,046
Please lead us to resolve the crisis.

472
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,420
Your Highness!

473
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,176
Your Highness, General Fu is waiting for you outside.

474
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,826
General Fu, what took you so long?

475
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,717
Crown Prince!

476
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,086
To prevent the mutiny from General Fu and casualties,

477
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:25,021
I want everyone to stay in here.

478
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:26,770
Prince Chen and I have a plan.

479
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,643
We will deal with him and his scheme will never succeed!

480
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,865
Prince Li, you sure took your time.

481
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:23,075
I have been waiting here for quite a while.

482
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:25,359
You were always a righteous person.

483
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,170
Where are all your manners today?

484
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,271
I lost my manners?

485
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:37,560
Why are you allowed to be carried in here on your bed...

486
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,704
and I can't even have some booze outside the hall?

487
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,999
I wonder if you recognize...

488
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:47,940
the soldiers of the southern border behind me.

489
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,184
They all lost their homes and families...

490
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:01,463
thanks to your doing.

491
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:04,740
You alienated the nobles in the south and caused uprisings...

492
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,560
just so you could claim the glory from the skirmishes...

493
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,544
and help you secure a place in the Imperial Court.

494
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,859
The skirmishes were clearly your doing.

495
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:16,240
Prince Li, you are planning to commit treason.

496
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,920
Why are you accusing me...

497
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,630
of the crime you've done?

498
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,706
Prince Li, I came all the way...

499
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:28,976
from an insignificant sergeant...

500
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:31,523
to become the General of Defense I am today.

501
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,779
I spent years slaying the enemies...

502
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:37,111
and fought countless uphill battles.

503
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:40,466
You cannot deny my achievements by mere accusations.

504
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:42,860
You expand your troops without permission.

505
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,659
With your troops here,

506
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:47,694
your ambition of seizing the throne is clear to all of us.

507
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:51,020
How are you going to face the loyal soldiers that follow you...

508
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,920
and the people that trust and respect you?

509
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,276
General Fu, don't you have a conscience?

510
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,590
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

511
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:40,020
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

512
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:48,650
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

513
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,120
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

514
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,100
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

515
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:06,530
♫ You are keeping me out with your care
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

516
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:11,150
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

517
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,730
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

518
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:24,900
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

519
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,760
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

520
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,070
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

521
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:43,810
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

522
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:48,890
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

523
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:53,530
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

524
00:44:53,530 --> 00:45:02,570
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

525
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:07,570
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

526
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,560
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

527
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:24,950
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
