00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,600
[Episode 46]

2
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,300
Your Highness. A report from Agent Wu.

3
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,800
They found Fu Chou at the border.

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Your Highness, Lady Yun's tomb collapsed.

5
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Her remains were stolen and are nowhere to be found.

6
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,400
Fu Chou!

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I will end you with my own hands!

8
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Princess Rong Le, you are still on the fence about the Blood Raven Root?

9
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
In order to save me,

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
he got the herb and burned his own hand.

11
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,700
I don't want him to be upset or disappointed.

12
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,800
But I don't want to owe Fu Chou any kindness.

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
I am confused about what I should do.

14
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
I am no expert in this.

15
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
All I know is your health comes first.

16
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,100
The Blood Raven Root can subdue the poison in your body...

17
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,600
and even turn your hair dark again.

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,000
It can also revert the effect of the Aging Frost on Prince Li.

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,600
Do you mean... the Blood Raven Root can heal the damage of Aging Frost?

20
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Yes, the herb can suppress all
kinds of poisoning effects.

21
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
That includes the Aging Frost.

22
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I will render the Blood Raven Root into a remedy.

23
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Both you and Prince Li can take the medicine together.

24
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,000
If the herb can revert the effects of Aging Frost,

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,700
- well...
- Princess Rong Le.

26
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,900
Princess, Prince Li just left.

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,800
I heard the men from the Hidden Ones came here.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
I don't know what they talked about,

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,600
but Prince Li looked terrifying when he left.

30
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,200
Your Highness, the Tong Pass is just over this hill.

31
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Please, you must hold on.

32
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
From the moment you stepped into the south,

33
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,400
you should have seen this coming.

34
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,000
Even if I must die by your hand,

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
I have no regret for coming here.

36
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
I am standing right here.

37
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,000
If you must, come on and kill me.

38
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
Stop!

39
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,400
I always thought you were mad when you said...

40
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,000
that you wouldn't accept the herb I sent.

41
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,600
But now that I see the two of you...

42
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,000
both have white hair despite your young age,

43
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,000
I realized all the effort I put in...

44
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
was only for my own wishful fantasy.

45
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
And this is all thanks to you.

46
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,800
Stop pretending like you are the victim here.

47
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,300
You are the future ruler of Northern Lin.

48
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,200
You can't carry the sin of killing your own brother.

49
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Allow me to do it for you.

50
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,400
For my whole life,

51
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
I resorted to all kinds of plots for my revenge.

52
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,600
But this time,

53
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,200
I simply followed my heart without any planning.

54
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,600
I don't care whatever reason you have to come here.

55
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,700
I will not show any mercy with my blade.

56
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,600
I will have no regret for ending your life.

57
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Today... is the day I severe

58
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,000
all the grudges we have.

59
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,200
My vengeance for him is greater than all hatred.

60
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,800
Even if I will be loathed by the people,

61
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I must end him myself!

62
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,600
History is written by the victors.

63
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,300
Today, I fall by your hands.

64
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Kill me if you must,

65
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,600
do what you want.

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,600
To seize the throne, you killed my father,

67
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,900
the crown prince, and the other officers.

68
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,500
For your own revenge,

69
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,700
you used Man Yao for your bidding and her life as a bargaining chip.

70
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,000
To disrupt the order in the south,

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you conspired with Sun Jizhou to spread lies.

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
You caused the mutiny.

73
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,100
Your crimes are more than what words could describe.

74
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,200
Now that you are in my hands,

75
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,400
you even tried to use your life...

76
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,900
to leave Man Yao with guilt.

77
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Fu Chou,

78
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
I will never let you get what you want.

79
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Tell me.

80
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What did you do to my mother's body?

81
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Where is she now?

82
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,400
You are Sun Jizhou's student.

83
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
Me? Conspiring with him?

84
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
This is ridiculous.

85
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
As for your mother,

86
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,600
she is lying in her tomb.

87
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,300
If you remember your duty as her son,

88
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,600
you should sneak past the enemy line...

89
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,700
and visit her yourself.

90
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,600
Do you even have such courage?

91
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,400
I just got the report.

92
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,100
The tomb collapsed and my mother's remains are missing.

93
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,100
I do hate you.

94
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,600
I hate her as well.

95
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,000
But I would never use a deceased person just to hurt you.

96
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,500
Zongzheng Wuyou!

97
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,800
If you dare hurt my son,

98
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
I will make you feel the pain your whole life!

99
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Please, save my son!

100
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,300
Let go of my son!

101
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Your son?

102
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Fu Yuan?

103
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,800
You are still alive?

104
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Good.

105
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,800
You want to save your son?

106
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,400
Then hand over my mother's body... all in one piece!

107
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,400
If not,

108
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,500
I will kill him!

109
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,900
Guards!

110
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,700
Prince Li, is this... what you asked for?

111
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Fu Yuan.

112
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What did you do to my mother?

113
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,100
An idea came to my mind.

114
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,500
I wanted to visit my sister at her tomb.

115
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,900
But she sobbed her frustration to me.

116
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,800
She got bored of that ice-cold tomb.

117
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,400
She wanted me to take her away.

118
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,100
I had no other choice but to agree with her.

119
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,800
But I never thought...

120
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,200
you would spit at my kindness.

121
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
If you lay a finger on my son, I will not show any mercy.

122
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Don't you want your mother's remains?

123
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,600
I gave you the chance.

124
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
It was you who wasted it away.

125
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,100
You even destroyed my mother's remains.

126
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,200
All I have to do is to kill you and your son.

127
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,600
I will apologize to my mother once I am back in Zhongshan!

128
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,900
Wuyou.

129
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
You knew the remains...

130
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,400
could only be preserved by keeping it in the crystal coffin.

131
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,700
But you moved Lady Yun's remains from her tomb.

132
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,010
What exactly do you want?

133
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Tell me! Are her remains... still intact and safe?

134
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,400
She has been dead for over a decade.

135
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Of course, the remain can't be preserved outside the crystal coffin.

136
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,600
When you abandoned your nation for a woman,

137
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,300
you should have seen this day coming.

138
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,500
This is the last chance you have.

139
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,800
I want my mother's remains...

140
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,900
returned in one piece!

141
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,600
Otherwise, I will behead your son right in front of you!

142
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,400
I dare you to do so!

143
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
If you dare,

144
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,200
let's see if it's easier to kill someone...

145
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
or to crush this wooden chest.

146
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,700
- Stop!
- Wuyou.

147
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
If it's his life you want,

148
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,700
we'll have our chance.

149
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,500
But your mother...

150
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,200
This is too great of a risk.

151
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,500
Fu Chou, I swear in the name of Heaven,

152
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,300
you won't get away alive next time.

153
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Hold on!

154
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We will let him go.

155
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,500
But you must hand over the chest.

156
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,100
As soon as my son is here,

157
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,700
I will lay the chest on the ground.

158
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,600
You can take it yourself.

159
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,800
If you play any tricks,

160
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,200
I will end both of you with a dreadful death!

161
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,700
Get on the carriage.

162
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Hand the chest over.

163
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,400
Mother.

164
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,900
I am sorry.

165
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,000
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

166
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,400
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

167
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,300
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

168
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,400
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

169
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,500
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

170
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,200
♫ You are keeping me out with your care ♫

171
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,300
♫ Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

172
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,000
Fu Yuan!

173
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,400
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

174
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,200
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

175
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
Wuyou!

176
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,400
Wuyou!

177
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:20,600
♫ I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫

178
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,400
- Chang Jian.
- Yes.

179
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,100
Pull over!

180
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,300
Chang Jian, give me your horse.

181
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,400
Your Highness.

182
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Send Her Majesty to the palace.

183
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,600
- But...
- Wait.

184
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Chou, what is this about?

185
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Mother.

186
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Chang Jian will send you back.

187
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,900
I...

188
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,800
I must go back there.

189
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,600
Going back?

190
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,100
Do you really wish to get yourself killed?

191
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,700
Zongzheng Wuyou hates you to his very bones.

192
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,400
If you turn back now,

193
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,300
he will not let you leave with your life.

194
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
I know you are trying to save me.

195
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,400
But why must you use such a cruel means?

196
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
You may be unfeeling in the past,

197
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,090
but you have become much more gentle after we reunited.

198
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,400
But I never thought...

199
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Are you surprised that...

200
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,200
I made Zongzheng Wuyou watch as his mother...

201
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,000
fades into oblivion?

202
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,900
Mother, how could you make it sound so lightly?

203
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,800
Everything I told you was taken lightly as well.

204
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,000
You risked your life and came here alone.

205
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
If I hadn't arrived in time,

206
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,000
you would have died by his blade.

207
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,700
But I have to go back there.

208
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,300
If I don't, I will never be at peace.

209
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,500
What about the peace I deserve?

210
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,800
I was all alone in the palace full of sinister eyes.

211
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,600
I am worried for your safety.

212
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,400
I went through every plan I could think of to finally...

213
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,100
figure out a way to save your skin.

214
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,500
But this is unnecessary. This is unnecessary!

215
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,400
If you rush to your own death,

216
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,200
you won't be the only life that is lost.

217
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,900
There will also be the soul of your pitiful mother you abandoned in this cruel world!

218
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,400
What are you waiting for?

219
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
Help His Highness to the carriage.

220
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
We are leaving this place!

221
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,440
Help His Highness to the carriage.

222
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,960
Your Highness, let's go.

223
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,900
Your Highness, you need to rest well.

224
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,700
Thank you, doctor.

225
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,500
I shall take my leave now.

226
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,559
Your Highness, there was a contraption under the chest.

227
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,479
Once it was opened, the bottom of the chest would open at the slightest touch.

228
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:43,039
I am afraid Lady Yun's ashes... have already blown away by the gust of wind.

229
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,519
Is my mother asleep?

230
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,679
Yes. She said she is tired from the journey all day.

231
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,560
She went to bed.

232
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,120
Dismiss.

233
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,620
Yes.

234
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,479
Do not bother His Highness unless it's urgent.

235
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,660
- Yes.
- Wait.

236
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,100
What is it?

237
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,280
Your Highness.

238
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,439
Prince Li and his soldiers retreated, but his consort is still there.

239
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,460
Rong Le? What is she doing there?

240
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,000
She kneeling in the snow and digging for something.

241
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,900
- Dismissed.
- Yes.

242
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,899
Your Highness? The doctor just advised you to rest well.

243
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:40,900
You must take care of yourself.

244
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,660
Ready the carriage. Ready the carriage.

245
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,880
Yes.

246
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,640
Rong Le, stop digging.

247
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,600
Rong Le, stop it.

248
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,040
Rong Le. Rong Le, stop digging.

249
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,039
Rong Le, stop it.

250
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,940
Rong Le, stop it.

251
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,740
Let go of me.

252
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,339
Rong Le, it's pointless to dig for ashes now.

253
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:10,439
The wind is too strong. All the ashes have blown away.

254
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:15,260
Even if you dig a grave here, there is nothing to be buried.

255
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,600
There is nothing!

256
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,080
Rong Le!

257
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,300
Leave me alone!

258
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,920
I spent a year...

259
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,940
to walk out from the shadows of the past.

260
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,580
As soon as you came,

261
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,360
I lost everything.

262
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,320
Zongzheng Wuyou is the reason you are happy.

263
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,820
That isn't your fault.

264
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,200
Do you honestly think there could be any happiness for us?

265
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,560
Your mother is right.

266
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,040
In order to save me, he gave up on all that could have been his.

267
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,760
He gave you the chance to hurt him.

268
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,580
So tell me, how is this not my fault?

269
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,780
I am to be blamed.

270
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,700
Zongzheng Wuyou won't blame you for this.

271
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,300
Yes, he won't.

272
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,040
But he will blame himself for his mother's fate.

273
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,839
He will never shake away this guilt.

274
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,260
Fu Chou, leave my sight now if you understand how much I hate you!

275
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,480
I don't want to see you again!

276
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,860
Perhaps...

277
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,840
I shouldn't have come here at all.

278
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,160
Wuyou. Wuyou.

279
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Mother.

280
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,840
Come to me.

281
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,419
Your Highness, reports from the prison guards. Sun Jizhou escaped.

282
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,540
I have ordered the men to conduct a man-hunt.

283
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,939
Your Highness, my condolences for what happened to Lady Yun.

284
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,640
I must avenge my parents' deaths!

285
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,600
Send out my order. Gather the troops and provisions.

286
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,320
I am launching an assault on Zhongshan!

287
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,859
I swear I will slay... both Fu Yuan and Fu Chou!

288
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,159
Your Highness, I just received reports that Princess Consort has yet to return.

289
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,680
Should we search for her?

290
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,479
Anger caused blood congestion at your heart last night.

291
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,930
I panicked. So I chose to send you back as a priority.

292
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,990
Princess Consort said she had work to do.

293
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,130
I assumed she would be back soon.

294
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,240
Man Yao? Man Yao?

295
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,720
Man Yao?

296
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,840
[Sun Residence]

297
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,040
Captain Xiao, there is no sign of Sun Ji zhou.

298
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,660
Captain Xiao, we found nothing either.

299
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,639
You, search every corner of the house.

300
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,020
Yes.

301
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,340
What do you want?

302
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,100
Captain Xiao, these are just some clothes and jewelry.

303
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,700
There are no suspicious letters.

304
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,639
Your father just escaped prison.

305
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:20,419
And now you are in a hurry to leave.

306
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:23,320
Are you meeting your father somewhere?

307
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,159
I don't know what you are talking about.

308
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,979
If you refuse to confess, then you shall come with us.

309
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:34,820
With you around, your father will surely show himself.

310
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,279
- Take her away.
- Yes!

311
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,439
- Come with us!
- Miss Sun!

312
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,810
- Let go of me!
- Miss Sun!

313
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,200
- All right, dismissed.
- Yes.

314
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,019
Princess Rong Le, the medicine has gone cold.

315
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:22,420
You should drink it now.

316
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,380
Why does this soup have the taste of blood?

317
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,640
I brewed this soup with the Blood Raven Root.

318
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,119
I am not drinking it.

319
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,740
No, Princess Rong Le.

320
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,179
You knelt in the snow for so long, it took a toll on your body.

321
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:02,619
The coldness of the snow is causing a relapse by the poison.

322
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:05,139
It wasn't easy to nurse you back to health.

323
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,219
You are still in bad shape.

324
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,740
If you don't take this medicine,

325
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,360
we won't have enough time to search for a cure for your illness.

326
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,120
She is right. Please, take the medicine.

327
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,760
So be it then.

328
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,360
You did your best.

329
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,520
I tried all I could.

330
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,440
This is my fate.

331
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,080
There is nothing we can do.

332
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,640
Princess.

333
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,440
He killed my father...

334
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,340
and now my mother is gone.

335
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,860
I hate him just as much.

336
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,320
But compared to your life,

337
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,860
owing him a favor for the herb...

338
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,980
is no big deal.

339
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,740
Don't think too much.

340
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Rest well.

341
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,380
Wuyou.

342
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,420
I am sorry.

343
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,360
This is all my fault.

344
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,860
Do not blame yourself.

345
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,120
I made this choice.

346
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,140
It's not your fault.

347
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,680
Rest well.

348
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,840
Your Highness, Sun Jizhou is waiting outside.

349
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,780
Even if he runs from me,

350
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,940
I still have a score to settle with him.

351
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,619
This could be good.

352
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:17,000
He actually came here by himself.

353
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,400
Let him in.

354
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,920
Yes.

355
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,359
It's been a year, how are you?

356
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,580
I am fine. But you on the other hand...

357
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,340
is not doing so well.

358
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,159
I turned over a new leaf.

359
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,860
I will get back on my feet.

360
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,179
But there is something that worries me.

361
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,700
Turning over a new leaf?

362
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,780
Do you mind enlightening me on how you are supposed to do so?

363
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,680
My daughter is still in Qingzhou.

364
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,819
I am willing to trade military secrets of the south...

365
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:01,779
for you to invade Qingzhou...

366
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:04,160
and reunite me with my daughter.

367
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,620
Sir Sun, why do you think I would agree with this deal?

368
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,060
I have known you for years.

369
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,700
I think I have aided Your Highness in some ways.

370
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,799
Because of your deed in the battles of the south,

371
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,719
you became a renowned general.

372
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,639
Because of my support for you, you became Prince Regent.

373
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,079
And now, I have top secret information of the south.

374
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,540
I can aid you in your campaign.

375
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,720
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

376
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,070
♫ We have been through so much ♫

377
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,720
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

378
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,020
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

379
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:12,900
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

380
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,430
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

381
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:26,320
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

382
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,720
♫ I cried when you leave and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

383
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:39,110
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

384
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:45,900
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

385
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:52,530
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

386
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:59,200
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

387
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,260
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

388
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:42,480
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
