00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,502
[Episode 37]

2
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,048
I have but one piece of advice for you.

3
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:40,519
Maybe your feelings for Rong Le... are just the same as mine for you.

4
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:44,548
This is not true love. You just wanted to best Prince Li.

5
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,511
Let it go.

6
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:48,588
Going astray on this path...

7
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,421
will make you suffer the same consequences as mine.

8
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,348
You are not me.

9
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,917
Don't draw your own conclusion.

10
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,448
Live well...

11
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,717
and focus on recuperating yourself.

12
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:07,580
Only by taking good care of yourself...

13
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,900
can you have a chance.

14
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,579
Just like you'd expected,

15
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,802
General Fu has sent Chang Jian and the others to track us.

16
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:39,652
He, also, sent someone immediately to check on the madwoman we had met on the street just now.

17
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:42,899
Fu Chou is over-suspicious. He won't let me get out from the manor easily.

18
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,939
He has eyes on my every move when I'm outside the manor.

19
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,360
Greetings, Princess Rong Le.

20
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,539
When I came back just now, the guards in the manor looked anxious. What happened?

21
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,363
General Fu is looking for the Imperial Jade Seal.

22
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,979
He has searched the whole palace.

23
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,259
And he even searched the manors of the royals and important ministers.

24
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,419
But he ended up empty-handed. So, General Fu... is furious now.

25
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,382
Crown Prince once did the same thing as well.

26
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:12,838
But he came back empty-handed as well.

27
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,760
Your Majesty, I'm going to bring you away from here.

28
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,954
Yun's...

29
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,269
Mausoleum.

30
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,410
Yun's Mausoleum.

31
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,060
Jade...

32
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,880
Insolent fool!

33
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,376
I want to leave.

34
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,219
How dare you stop me!

35
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,406
Do you have any respect for me?

36
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,619
Please spare my life, Crown Prince.

37
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,939
- Don't hit me.
- Crown Prince.

38
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,191
- Who are you calling Crown Prince?
- Crown Prince, don't hit me.

39
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,771
- Don't hit me.
- Who are you calling Crown Prince?

40
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,723
- Save me.
- What are you doing?

41
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,938
What are you doing?

42
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,499
Do you know who I am?

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,957
I'm the Son of Heaven. I am the emperor.

44
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,905
I'm the Son of Heaven!

45
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,459
Save me.

46
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,819
Go!

47
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,592
Get the crown prince here.

48
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:29,233
Go!

49
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,279
All of you... have shown no respect towards me!

50
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,080
All right then.

51
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,233
I am the emperor.

52
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:41,391
Nobody can stop me...

53
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:44,322
from killing anybody as I please!

54
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,859
Does it hurt?

55
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,170
Do you know who I am now?

56
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,219
Who are you calling Crown Prince?

57
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,339
I am the emperor.

58
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,711
Remember that.

59
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:07,553
I am the emperor.

60
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,700
Who are you?

61
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:22,100
I think... Crown Prince has lost his mind...

62
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,897
because he's too upset about losing his throne.

63
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,874
He has gone mad.

64
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:31,353
He has contracted an illness... called insanity.

65
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:35,399
Before this, I heard about a treatment.

66
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,360
- Guards.
- Yes, Master.

67
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,839
Go to the hill at the back... to capture some insects.

68
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,025
- Feed them to the crown prince.
- Yes, Master.

69
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:45,920
- No!
- What is it?

70
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,539
Are you saying that you are not insane...

71
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,899
or that my treatment is wrong?

72
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:53,260
You!

73
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,240
Who are you?

74
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,442
How dare you play me.

75
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,539
I can sentence you to death... together with your family.

76
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,859
Until now, you are still like this.

77
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,974
You are still pampered and peremptory.

78
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,398
When I was in Senyan Palace...

79
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,993
serving the empress who had fallen into disgrace and was jailed,

80
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:22,147
you were there, hitting on me when I was down.

81
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,779
You humiliated and tortured me.

82
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,254
But I thought that, for the empress,

83
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:29,901
I had to endure it.

84
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,619
I never thought that you...

85
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,041
would become more and more insatiable.

86
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,985
You...

87
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,291
You are...

88
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,627
Important people have short memories.

89
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:53,175
How would you remember me?

90
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,963
Back then, you were in power and you were in the emperor's favor.

91
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:59,173
You were so high and above.

92
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,219
For someone like you,

93
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,599
others were just like weeds.

94
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,620
Now,

95
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:08,844
you've been reduced to this state.

96
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,139
This is called karma.

97
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,500
You'll have to pay for what you did.

98
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,565
The suffering that I had endured back then will be...

99
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,911
given back to you today.

100
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,533
Just wait while death comes to you.

101
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,640
Don't come near me!

102
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,912
Where are you taking me?

103
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:33,473
You!

104
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,580
Let go of me!

105
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,819
Who are you?

106
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,219
I am Agent Wu.

107
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,979
Princess Rong Le came here this morning.

108
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,788
Did she ask you to pass something to me?

109
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,414
It's you. You gave me a fright.

110
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:02,912
You can just come in normally. Why do you have to move like a shadow?

111
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,005
Where is it?

112
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,096
Do you know what it is?

113
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,697
A fan.

114
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,380
Move aside.

115
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,160
This is the one, right?

116
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,777
He's in Senyan Palace. In three days' time,

117
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,098
I'll pass the General's Pass to you.

118
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,169
Here you go. I think it will be of use to you.

119
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,880
You trust me that much?

120
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,219
Princess Rong Le has put in so much effort to pass this fan to you.

121
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,219
It means that you are someone she trusts.

122
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,619
If she trusts you, then I'll trust you, too.

123
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,499
Besides, Princess Rong Le has described... your looks to me.

124
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:00,738
Thank you. Goodbye.

125
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,480
Agent Wu.

126
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,360
Wuyou.

127
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,505
Brother.

128
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:22,916
Here.

129
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,184
This ointment was specially crafted by Xiao Ke.

130
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:31,285
It's can boost up your recovering speed to heal your wounds.

131
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,100
How is she?

132
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:40,543
Don't worry. Nobody has had it worse than you.

133
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,550
Brother, how's the arrangement?

134
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,259
Wuyu is gathering the troops.

135
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,491
The retrieve-and-retreat team is ready.

136
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:52,055
We are just waiting for you to leave this place.

137
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:56,507
But now, Fu Chou has heavily surrounded the palace with soldiers.

138
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:59,699
And Senyan Palace is guarded by experts in martial arts.

139
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,259
Without Fu Chou's General's Pass,

140
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,289
we'll have to fight our way out if we want to save you.

141
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:06,948
You are severely wounded right now.

142
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:11,101
If we take a detour, not only will it take a toll on you, we'll be hunted down for sure.

143
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,259
Only by using the General's Pass can we use the...

144
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,037
shortcut to get to the official route and have a clear passage.

145
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:20,132
Is Man Yao risking her safety... to get the General's Pass?

146
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:22,880
She passed a message to Xiao Ke. In three days' time at night,

147
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,057
she'll meet up with us after she gets the General's Pass.

148
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,260
Wuyou,

149
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,486
she is no ordinary lady. She is very meticulous.

150
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:36,579
She must have certainty of success.

151
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,299
Don't worry. I'll send someone to protect her in secret.

152
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,488
Brother, you have to make sure that she is safe.

153
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:46,531
Don't worry. I know the score.

154
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,571
Yali.

155
00:10:57,572 --> 00:10:59,664
Guard the palace from the outside.

156
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:02,818
- Your Majesty.
- Yali.

157
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,271
It must have been hard on you these few days.

158
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:09,580
I never thought that Fu Chou would turn out to be someone like that.

159
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:12,499
He had brought shame and ruin upon Wuyou.

160
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,299
And we are not sure if he's dead or alive.

161
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,182
I heard that he promised to marry you in public.

162
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,831
But now, he puts you under house arrest here.

163
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:21,739
Save me, Your Majesty.

164
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,200
I don't want to be trapped here forever.

165
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,657
And I don't want to be used by Fu Chou.

166
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:29,788
Now, in this palace, the only one who can save me...

167
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,114
is you, Your Majesty.

168
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:35,439
Yali, I have no children.

169
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,905
You are the only one who came to visit me usually.

170
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,556
I already regard you as my daughter.

171
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,771
In the past,

172
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,221
in order to have someone to rely on for the rest of my life,

173
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:49,733
I had insisted for you to marry Wuyou.

174
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,673
I did it for your own good.

175
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:56,699
But I had never once considered your own feelings.

176
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,121
I'm ashamed to face you.

177
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:01,380
It's not like that, Your Majesty.

178
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,748
I'm the one who is too naive.

179
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:06,859
If I had listened to you back then...

180
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,519
and gave my heart to Prince Li,

181
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,497
even if I have to suffer together with him now,

182
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:16,610
it would still be better than being tricked and used by Fu Chou.

183
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,899
I understand.

184
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,665
It's all right. It's all in the past.

185
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,209
Don't be scared. I have a way. Let's go.

186
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,539
I've sent someone to lure away the guards from this palace.

187
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,539
You have to leave now.

188
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,263
The guards in at the south door are my men.

189
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,739
Go out from the south door and leave this palace at once.

190
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,579
What about you?

191
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,760
Escape together with me.

192
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,290
No.

193
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,151
I can't leave.

194
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,739
You are still young.

195
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,019
You can still start over.

196
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,760
But I...

197
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:50,819
I've given the best period of my life to this palace.

198
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,459
All of my memories are here.

199
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,871
I can't leave this place anymore.

200
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:58,728
You have to go. Go now.

201
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,504
I will never forget about your kindness today.

202
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,699
Please take care of yourself.

203
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,520
Enough. Go now.

204
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,779
Take care and leave now.

205
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,595
- Your Majesty.
- Quick!

206
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,252
Go!

207
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,763
Yali...

208
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
In this life,

209
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,529
we won't be able to meet each other again.

210
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:31,460
For the rest of your life,

211
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,094
you have to be safe and happy always.

212
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,637
There's a sound over there! Go and take a look!

213
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,060
Let's go!

214
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,300
Let me bring you some clean water.

215
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,280
Why?

216
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:58,469
Why did you want to treat me like this?

217
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:05,373
Do you know... how much courage it took...

218
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,696
to believe in a person who had used me...

219
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,760
and hurt me?

220
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,124
And do you know that...

221
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,940
I almost...

222
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,500
I almost fell in love with you?

223
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,960
What did you say?

224
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,440
It's too late now.

225
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,076
You've betrayed my trust.

226
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,882
You've used your own way...

227
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:49,840
to push me into others' hands.

228
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,781
You've used your actions...

229
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:59,255
to teach me a lesson crueler than death.

230
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,880
Hate.

231
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,300
I never utter this word easily.

232
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,682
But today,

233
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,370
I'm going to give this word...

234
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,440
to you.

235
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,199
Yes.

236
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,739
Everything is too late now.

237
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,940
Rong Le,

238
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,976
if you are willing to give me one more chance,

239
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,534
I can let Zongzheng Wuyou go.

240
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,275
If you want him to go to the southern border,

241
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:47,351
I can give him the entire southern border.

242
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,800
I promise you.

243
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,446
From now on, I won't use you or hurt you anymore.

244
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,838
I'll love you with all my heart...

245
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,294
and live a good life with you.

246
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,320
Zongzheng Wuyou.

247
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,680
Wuyou.

248
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,524
You are the one who locked him up.

249
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,814
I want to meet him.

250
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,096
I want to meet him now.

251
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,860
Rong Le, I've given in more and more.

252
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,019
But why are you still thinking about him?

253
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,060
You can't see me even though I'm right in front of you.

254
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,739
You have only Zongzheng Wuyou in your heart.

255
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,300
Why can't you forget about him?

256
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,960
Rong Le...

257
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:59,832
you've tricked me.

258
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,270
Now, we don't owe each other anymore.

259
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,000
I know that you are over-suspicious.

260
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:13,979
I can't fool you easily.

261
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,859
So, I put some harmless and odorless powder on your zither first...

262
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,264
without you knowing about it.

263
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:24,239
But as soon as that powder... comes in contact with my blood,

264
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,930
it'll become the strongest tranquilizer.

265
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,160
Fu Chou,

266
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,939
since you've treated me with affection,

267
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,980
I won't kill you.

268
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,408
In this life,

269
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,320
I'll love only Wuyou.

270
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,370
But I have to thank you for it.

271
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,860
You... made me realize...

272
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,565
who the one is... that treated me wholeheartedly.

273
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,733
This is a futile effort.

274
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,675
Rip off one's robe as a sign of breaking off all ties.

275
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,979
Tonight, we are done.

276
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,006
We don't have any ties anymore.

277
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,454
Let me out!

278
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:19,800
Let go of me!

279
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:23,519
Let me out!

280
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,845
How dare you!

281
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,851
Anybody here?

282
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,228
Anybody here?

283
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,146
Are you human or are you a ghost?

284
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,256
Say something.

285
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,045
Say something.

286
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,120
Father.

287
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,919
Father, you are still alive!

288
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,074
I thought that...

289
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,426
I thought that...

290
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,000
Father.

291
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,701
Hit me, Father!

292
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:34,954
Hit me and scold me, Father!

293
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:38,219
Father, please give me a scolding!

294
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,660
Father.

295
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,636
How did you become like this, Father?

296
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,897
I'm going to get you out now. I'm going to get you out now!

297
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,675
I'll get you out.

298
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,773
I'll get you out!

299
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,219
You! Let go of my father.

300
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:11,199
Let go of my father!

301
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,680
Father.

302
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,400
Father, I'm an unfilial son!

303
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,460
I'm unfilial and I'm dumb.

304
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,680
I shouldn't have trusted that low-life, Fu Chou.

305
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,525
He's the one who had reduced you to this.

306
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,345
By the way, Father.

307
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,860
Father.

308
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,876
Fu Chou is the son of the late Empress Fu.

309
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:38,343
So, he deliberately planned all of these...

310
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,360
in order to get his revenge, Father.

311
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,313
What should we do?

312
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,100
What should we do, Father?

313
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,120
I know.

314
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:04,782
You put great care about your appearance.

315
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,955
I'm going to tidy you up now.

316
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,656
I won't let you lose your dignity.

317
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,320
Father, I know that...

318
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,087
you have only Wuyou in your heart.

319
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:29,045
I want to get some love from you, too.

320
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,835
I did all of those...

321
00:25:30,835 --> 00:25:33,592
because I wanted to prove myself to you.

322
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:34,827
But...

323
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,832
But I've harmed you instead.

324
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:43,059
Father.

325
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,650
Father, I'm willing to kneel and beg Fu Chou...

326
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,000
to exchange my life with yours.

327
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,180
I'm going to protect you!

328
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,909
I'm going to protect you, Father!

329
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,291
My life is worthless.

330
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:06,360
As long as you still have me in your heart,

331
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,569
I will not hesitate to do it.

332
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,420
Father.

333
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,729
I see my mistake now. I see my mistake now.

334
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,835
Father.

335
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,480
Father.

336
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,499
Who is it?

337
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,580
General Fu has ordered me to transfer the criminal to the Ministry of Justice.

338
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,840
Transfer the criminal to the prison of the Ministry of Justice?

339
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,100
Shouldn't Sir Chang, Head of the Guards be the one...

340
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,300
to give out this kind of secret order?

341
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,784
My order is to carry out this emergency mission.

342
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:58,109
And I have to transfer the criminal within two hours' time.

343
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,760
You are not General Fu's man.

344
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,486
You are very attentive.

345
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:06,547
I used to serve Princess Rong Le.

346
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:10,015
But now, Northern Lin is under General Fu's control.

347
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:12,580
A wise man understands and submits to circumstances.

348
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,418
Now, I serve the general.

349
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:16,551
But I am a trusted man of General Fu.

350
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,365
That's why he entrusted me with his General's Pass.

351
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,558
From now on, please take care of me.

352
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,800
The prison cart of the Ministry of Justice is just outside of the Cold Harem.

353
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,480
You have to trust me.

354
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,250
If you are still suspicious,

355
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,406
you can go to the Ministry of Justice and ask General Fu.

356
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:36,453
But if I am late...

357
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,446
and General Fu found out that his pass didn't work on both of you,

358
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:42,152
I'm not sure how you are going to explain it to him then.

359
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,581
Since it's General Fu's pass, his pass represents him.

360
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,315
Quick. Open the door.

361
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,082
Master, it's clear outside.

362
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,382
Let's go.

363
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,265
General Fu.

364
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,700
Go to the palace now.

365
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,808
If you see Zongzheng Wuyou,

366
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:15,500
kill him on the spot.

367
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,820
Yes, General!

368
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,420
I'm here to transfer the criminal under General Fu's command.

369
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,360
Open the city gate!

370
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,028
- Stop!
- Help!

371
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,020
- Stop!
- Somebody help!

372
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
- Help!
- How dare you run!

373
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,750
I'm going to teach you a lesson!

374
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,460
How dare you run!

375
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:45,200
- Help!
- Stop running!

376
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,221
- Stop!
- Your Highness, we have to stay put.

377
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,701
Save her.

378
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,080
Release the arrows.

379
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,119
Leave now!

380
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:47,520
Rong Le,

381
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,620
you forced my hand.

382
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,060
General Fu!

383
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,910
What happened?

384
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,939
Xiao Sha took your pass and saved Zongzheng Wuyou together with...

385
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:06,599
a group of well-trained fighters. There's a girl with him as well.

386
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,899
Is she Lady Rong Le?

387
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:10,579
General Fu, due to my carelessness, I didn't get a clear picture of her.

388
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,839
- Does she have black or white hair?
- She doesn't have white hair.

389
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,556
Zongzheng Wuyou, you've pushed me too hard.

390
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,239
- Chang Jian.
- Yes, General.

391
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,406
- Bring him back.
- Yes, General.

392
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,298
Wuyou.

393
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:37,436
Where is Man Yao?

394
00:34:37,436 --> 00:34:41,377
Princess Rong Le has gone to the Yun Mausoleum to get something vital.

395
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:43,195
Let's go to the Yun Mausoleum.

396
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,443
Don't worry.

397
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:02,364
You are safe now.

398
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,959
Come to think of it, both of us are really fated to meet each other.

399
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:15,742
When we were in Qingzhou, both of us were utterly helpless.

400
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:20,240
Now, we are both cast away from the world.

401
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,979
Wuyou.

402
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:26,840
How's your body? Can you take it?

403
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
Don't worry, Brother.

404
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,700
Here.

405
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,959
Your Highness, your wounds...

406
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,680
I'm fine.

407
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,960
Lady Yun.

408
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,725
Because of me, Wuyou...

409
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,640
gave up his country...

410
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,440
and gave away his dignity.

411
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,260
He almost lost his life as well.

412
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,580
Once, I had rejected...

413
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,188
his vow at this very place.

414
00:37:22,188 --> 00:37:27,339
Today, I'm going to make a vow here.

415
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,759
No matter how much time I have left from now on,

416
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:35,619
I'll treat Wuyou... wholeheartedly.

417
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,880
I won't fail him.

418
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,459
I'd rather sacrifice myself... to save him.

419
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,940
Please allow me... to protect him for you.

420
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,888
That old man...

421
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,721
has indeed given the seal to you.

422
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,227
I've underestimated you.

423
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,259
It's you again.

424
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,126
Don't waste your energy.

425
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,379
You won't be able to fight me.

426
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:52,904
But you've improved a lot.

427
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:54,579
Improved a lot.

428
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,380
You know me?

429
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,680
Do you think you can escape?

430
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,719
Your love for Zongzheng Wuyou is really true and genuine.

431
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:54,825
But it'll still be a waste even if you give your all.

432
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:58,199
The things and people that I want...

433
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,844
have never slipped past my grasp.

434
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,600
Today, I'm afraid that you won't be able to... get the thing that you want.

435
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,882
For Zongzheng Wuyou, you are willing to sacrifice yourself?

436
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:58,299
I don't care who you are to Fu Chou.

437
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:01,180
And I don't care what conspiracy you have.

438
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,735
But if you want to threaten Wuyou's life,

439
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:07,839
then I'd rather... burst into flames together with this seal.

440
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,339
Burst into flames together with the seal indeed.

441
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,560
I won't let you die.

442
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,439
The Creed of Vengeance is so shameless.

443
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:47,979
There are so many of you against a woman and you have her cornered.

444
00:41:47,979 --> 00:41:51,050
I was still wondering who you were.

445
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:56,603
So, you are the almighty Agent Wu who was once defeated by me.

446
00:41:56,603 --> 00:42:01,199
I never thought that... you were the master of The Hidden Ones.

447
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,439
It's too bad that you've chosen the wrong master.

448
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,059
You chose to serve under Zongzheng Wuyou.

449
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:10,396
Now, he's just a stray cur.

450
00:42:10,396 --> 00:42:11,939
Everybody wants his head.

451
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:16,219
It's up to me for the one I choose to serve. But there's one thing.

452
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:20,705
I'll never be associated with a rude and shameless eunuch like you.

453
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,329
A capable man never brags.

454
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:35,559
Agent Wu, do you think that you will be able... to stop me just by yourself?

455
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,810
Do you think Zongzheng Wuyou will be able to escape... and return to power?
