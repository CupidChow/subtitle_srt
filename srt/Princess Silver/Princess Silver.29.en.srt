00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,720
[Episode 29]

2
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,619
Even if you kill me today, I won't let you go.

3
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,599
But if I die, there'll be no one in this world...

4
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,660
who will treat you sincerely.

5
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,980
I lost my family since I was young.

6
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,279
Our master took me in...

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,359
and I went through the cruelest training together with you.

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,079
There were so many days and nights...

9
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,919
where we relied on each other.

10
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,059
We've spent the toughest time together.

11
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:15,820
I thought that I was different from others.

12
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,859
You once told me that I was your most trusted person.

13
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:20,560
Because of that, all these years,

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,479
no matter what you asked me to do,

15
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,479
I did all of them willingly. Because I believe that...

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,760
I was very important to you.

17
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,039
But recently, you've been disappointing me with the tasks that you are given.

18
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,580
That's because I'm afraid.

19
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm afraid to see you falling deeper and deeper for Rong Le.

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,939
I'm afraid that she'll one day harm you.

21
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,639
I don't wish to see you suffer from the bone-piercing hurt again.

22
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,740
I don't wish to see you suffer from any harm.

23
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,559
I don't want you to be tortured by hate.

24
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,780
Even for our master,

25
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,100
I won't give him any excuses for him to hurt you.

26
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,439
The pain that you've suffered in the past...

27
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,580
should be repaid by all the best things in the world.

28
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,600
But now, I want to have even more.

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,039
Do you mean Rong Le?

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,139
She is not worth it.

31
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:12,039
She was once betrayed by her family.

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,580
And she was used by the people she trusted.

33
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,940
But she is still so kind and generous.

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,720
She is different from me and you.

35
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,059
That's because she's not hurt enough.

36
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:27,239
If everything is taken away from her...

37
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,560
and she can only survive by fighting in blood and sweat,

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,039
I don't believe that she can still keep her hands clean.

39
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,000
So, I won't turn her into another you.

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,880
We have the same enemy.

41
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,640
All these years, we have had the same goal.

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,120
So, everything that you did today...

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,290
was not only for me.

44
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,820
It's for yourself as well.

45
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,120
Because you want this revenge, too.

46
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,480
Hen Xiang,

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,099
I don't want to kill the person that you want,

48
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,680
and I won't let you kill her either.

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,920
I'll disappoint you sooner or later.

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
Will you betray me?

51
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,460
The feelings and loyalty that you've mentioned...

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,720
are just something very shallow.

53
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,880
You are no longer my match.

54
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,000
I've never wanted to become your match.

55
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,400
I just wanted to try my best...

56
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,139
to help you with everything within my power.

57
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,260
You constantly remind me about revenge.

58
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,420
But she... has always given me light.

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Where am I?

60
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Why am I here?

61
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,980
Why are you laughing?

62
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm just laughing at my own foolishness.

63
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
I've always wanted to protect you.

64
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,520
I never thought that you would be malicious towards me.

65
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,140
Chen Yu,

66
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,280
what do you want from me?

67
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,940
I won't hurt you.

68
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,319
My goal is just "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

69
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,980
So, you are here for the book as well.

70
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,019
Looks like you are not the real descendant of Qin.

71
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,420
You are indeed very smart. A hint is all you need.

72
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm not Chen Yu.

73
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,420
And I'm not a descendant of Qin.

74
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,900
My only purpose in Northern Lin...

75
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,919
is to get my hand on this almighty, remarkable book.

76
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,359
And here I am, seeing you as my friend...

77
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,799
and trying my best to protect you.

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,559
It looks like you don't need it at all.

79
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,439
You used your hand in exchange for my life.

80
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,259
You gave me the zither music score...

81
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,120
and gave me refuge in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

82
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,639
The sincerity that you had shown me is something so rare.

83
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,200
Actually, I've already considered you as my close friend.

84
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,120
But this book is with Prince Li now.

85
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
It's too hard to get it from him.

86
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,900
I don't have any other choices.

87
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,020
This is the only way.

88
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,520
The only way.

89
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Who are you working for?

90
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,479
You are neither a person from Northern Lin...

91
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,219
nor a person from Western Qi.

92
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:04,619
Stop asking me. I won't tell you.

93
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:07,519
You have no choice because you are under someone's thumb.

94
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,239
Tell me. Maybe I can be of help.

95
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,419
Look at yourself. How can you help me?

96
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,580
You are stuck in this situation today because of that book, too. Right?

97
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,619
Although our identities are different, our fate is very similar.

98
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,979
Both of us are here for "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

99
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,819
But I'm doing it on my own free will...

100
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:39,339
while you were forced to do it. And you were betrayed by others.

101
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,579
All pawns will be sacrificed sooner or later.

102
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,660
You are no exception.

103
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,200
Maybe you are right.

104
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,030
Now, no matter if it is to be...

105
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,179
controlled by others in the name of a mission...

106
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,600
or to live our lives freely,

107
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,500
we have no say in it.

108
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,099
At least I'll fight for my right to choose.

109
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,920
I won't be a string puppet forever.

110
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,919
I'll remember... what you have said today.

111
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,159
I've already informed Prince Li.

112
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,180
As long as he is willing to give me the book,

113
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,420
I'll release you at once.

114
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,920
You've calculated wrongly. He won't come.

115
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,559
The onlooker sees most of the game.

116
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,259
You are too blind to it because you are a part of it...

117
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:36,720
but I see it very clearly.

118
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,299
Although Fu Chou is very gentle and attentive to you, he bears a deep grudge.

119
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:45,560
He might not derail his plan for you.

120
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,259
Prince Li on the other hand... is very cold towards you,

121
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:51,119
but he's a sentimental and righteous man.

122
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:54,959
He won't even hesitate to sacrifice himself for you.

123
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,700
Let alone "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

124
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,260
What if he doesn't come?

125
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,540
He will.

126
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,539
Ever since he came back to Zhongshan, he has saved you repeatedly.

127
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,140
He still loves you. Even the blind can see it.

128
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,680
And you still love him, too.

129
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,820
But you are not willing to admit it.

130
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,519
That's right.

131
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,699
All of you can see it very clearly.

132
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,299
That's why all of you have a reason to use me.

133
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,820
And you said that you have no other choices.

134
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,180
Fine.

135
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,979
You have your own standing.

136
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:33,100
I understand.

137
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,079
I was once like you.

138
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,920
But, Chen Yu,

139
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,559
no matter what your reasoning is, you've used me.

140
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,040
And it's a fact that you've betrayed me.

141
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,360
We can't be friends anymore.

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,520
The nation's affairs are not a child's play.

143
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,880
Where did Wuyou go?

144
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,019
Father, I...

145
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,559
Do you want to be sent to the royal tomb?

146
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,200
Please calm down.

147
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,039
A report from the southern region came.

148
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,899
It's an emergency about an outbreak of rebellion in Qingzhou.

149
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,580
Wuyou had gone back to take care of it.

150
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,240
This is bad. Come back quickly, Wuyou.

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,659
I can't cover up for you much longer.

152
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,160
What did you say?

153
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,060
- I...
- Your Majesty.

154
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,899
Your Majesty, Prince Fanyang has requested to meet you.

155
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,420
- Let him in.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

156
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,420
You may leave first.

157
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes, Father.

158
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,360
Uncle.

159
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,199
Greetings, Your Majesty.

160
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,599
Be at ease.

161
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,179
Xuanming, you'll be in charge of the war against Wei.

162
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

163
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,780
But Wuyou is respected for his brilliance in leading an army.

164
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,200
He's way better in the art of war than me.

165
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,960
Wuyou is indeed bold and talented.

166
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,820
But he has always opposed to the war against Wei.

167
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,620
He won't agree to go into war with me.

168
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,260
I plan to bring along Fu Chou with me.

169
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,000
And I'll leave the crown prince behind to take care of the country.

170
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,260
You want to bring General Fu away and leave behind the crown prince.

171
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,860
Are you trying to separate the two?

172
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,620
Although Fu Chou looks very gentle, respectful, and cautious,

173
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,340
he is a cunning person.

174
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,420
He's like a tiger or wolf.

175
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,500
He used the banquet as an excuse...

176
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,960
to give a girl to the crown prince.

177
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,440
He must have wanted to use the crown prince's status to his benefit.

178
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,460
So, it's better to keep him by my side.

179
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,780
If he so much as blinks wrongly,

180
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,880
I can punish him at once.

181
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,060
You are indeed thorough and far-sighted.

182
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,580
You have my admiration.

183
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,000
Prince Li, long time no see.

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,960
How are you?

185
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,300
The thing that you want is here.

186
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,300
Release her.

187
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,140
Why are you here?

188
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,100
There is no need to care about me.

189
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,300
Instead of using my life as leverage to harm another innocent,

190
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,380
I'd rather you just kill me.

191
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,359
I told you before. I can see clearly the feelings you have for each other.

192
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,619
Prince Li, do you know that...

193
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:11,780
Man Yao wasn't married to General Fu willingly?

194
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,119
She did it because the Emperor of Qi threatened her...

195
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,820
with the lives of everyone.

196
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,900
You are the only one she has ever loved.

197
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,420
Stop the nonsense!

198
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,660
Is it nonsense?

199
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,100
You clearly haven't forgotten about him.

200
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,780
You'll be depressed whenever you think of him.

201
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,859
She says all of these because she wants you to give the book to her quickly.

202
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:41,860
That's right. I'm here for "The Book of Mountains and Rivers,"

203
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,560
but what I said is true.

204
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,939
While you were away from Zhongshan, she often went to the teahouse alone...

205
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,280
to spend most of her time there.

206
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,620
She'd sit at the place where both of you first played chess together.

207
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,460
And she'd look at the plants in the garden...

208
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,400
while reminiscing the time you had together.

209
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,800
Sometimes, she'd be brought to tears.

210
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,140
Man Yao, is she telling the truth?

211
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,940
Chen Yu, you were indeed my best friend.

212
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,159
I'll kill her if you take one more step forward!

213
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,500
She saved your life before. Is this how you'll repay her?

214
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,159
Who sent you?

215
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,820
What's your purpose here besides "The Book of Mountains and Rivers?"

216
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,220
- Cut the nonsense.
- Stop it!

217
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,060
If you want to save her life, hand me the book.

218
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,580
Or else, I'll jump off from here together with her.

219
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,759
I'll be dead anyway if I fail my mission. I'd rather die with her.

220
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,940
- At least I'll have a companion.
- All right!

221
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,140
- I'll give it to you.
- No!

222
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,680
I'm the one who found the book. You have no right to give it to her.

223
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,680
You want to die, right? If you're not afraid, why should I be?

224
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,200
Man Yao!

225
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,080
Do you know how much effort I put into getting this book?

226
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,260
Because of this book, I had used you.

227
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,620
And because of this book, you had tricked me.

228
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,180
But you can't let this book...

229
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,660
fall to the wrong hands just because of me.

230
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,860
Are you done yet?

231
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,439
You don't believe what I said just now, right? I'll prove it to you now.

232
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,759
Miss,

233
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,299
although you no longer treat me as your friend, I still want to give you a word of advice.

234
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:04,399
Flee to a faraway place with him.

235
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,100
Because in this world, nobody else will treat you better than he does.

236
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,720
Farewell.

237
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,780
Can you come up by yourself?

238
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,599
Was she telling the truth just now?

239
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,120
This is not the time for you to think about it! Your life is at risk here!

240
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,859
- Don't let go of your hand!
- Is it true?

241
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,820
Yes! I think of you every day and I can't forget about you! Satisfied?

242
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,639
♫ I don't want distance but I stayed away from you ♫

243
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,140
♫ I want to do it but I can't ♫

244
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:45,799
♫ I just want to watch you in this cold world ♫

245
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,680
Everybody sees very clearly the feelings we have for each other.

246
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,240
But we ourselves are too afraid to be sure of it.

247
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,660
Man Yao, I've always been confident and arrogant.

248
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,720
But when it comes to you,

249
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm afraid that it's just an unrequited love.

250
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,580
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,380
I've made you suffer.

252
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,920
Aren't I the one who had got you into trouble?

253
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,400
Their target is me.

254
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,180
You were dragged into it...

255
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,020
because I've fallen in love with you.

256
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,799
It's my fault for putting you in constant danger.

257
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,180
Man Yao, remember this.

258
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,479
It's my choice to like you.

259
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:52,479
And it's my decision to hand over the book.

260
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,920
You did nothing wrong.

261
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,800
Chen Yu is right.

262
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,780
You should flee to a faraway place with me.

263
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,080
Leave Fu Chou.

264
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,179
I can only protect you well when you are by my side.

265
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,459
I'll make sure that no one will harm you and use you ever again.

266
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:16,760
I can give you an unrestrained life.

267
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,240
I can give you the freedom you crave.

268
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Unrestrained life.

269
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
Freedom.

270
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,839
The southern border has spring all year round.

271
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,560
It's brimming with flowers.

272
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,440
You'll like it there.

273
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,300
But I...

274
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,100
Do you know...

275
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,560
how happy I was when I saw this chess piece?

276
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,940
You've kept it by your side all this while.

277
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,120
It's proof that you've never forgotten about me.

278
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,720
Finally, we are together again.

279
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,060
Man Yao,

280
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,360
as long as you are willing to come with me,

281
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,160
nothing in this world will be a problem for me.

282
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,320
Are you willing to come with me?

283
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm willing.

284
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
But...

285
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,060
But I made a promise to Fu Chou.

286
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,420
We have a one-year marriage contract.

287
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,139
I don't want to break my promise. I owe him an explanation.

288
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,799
Don't worry.

289
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,959
I'll wait at the hunting ground for you at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

290
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,479
If you are not there,

291
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,880
I'll settle this personally with Fu Chou.

292
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,500
Are you all right, Rong Le?

293
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,180
You are hurt.

294
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,639
It looks like you know what happened to me.

295
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,380
This is not my doing.

296
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,980
I know.

297
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,680
When I heard that you were gone, I had searched for you everywhere.

298
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,399
I wanted to save you, but I never thought that...

299
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,440
someone would beat me to it.

300
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,279
You should know that...

301
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,800
no matter how many people there are to stop me,

302
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,080
I won't leave you alone to fend for yourself.

303
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,980
I believe you.

304
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,439
But now, there's no point for you to tell me that anymore.

305
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,240
I know.

306
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,039
Chen Yu is the perpetrator.

307
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,519
I will send someone to kill her.

308
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,680
This is between me and Chen Yu. Don't stick your hands into it.

309
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,079
You are Chen Yu's savior. Not only did she not repay your kindness,

310
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,879
she had tricked and hurt you. People like her...

311
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,799
are not worthy for you to plead on her behalf.

312
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,600
Chen Yu had indeed hurt and tricked me.

313
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,559
But now, she's not the only one who had tricked and used me.

314
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,079
If you want her dead just because she did this,

315
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,060
it would be more dangerous for you.

316
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,040
In your heart,

317
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,620
I'm the same as Chen Yu?

318
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,980
No, it's not the same.

319
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,719
At least, you've treated Chen Yu sincerely...

320
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,960
while you've treated me coldly and you're always on your guard.

321
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,160
Forget it. Since you are back, get some rest.

322
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,460
Fu Chou, I don't want you and I to turn out like me and Chen Yu.

323
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,520
How about we stop it here?

324
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,800
Such a cruel thing for you to say.

325
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,500
You want to leave me for him, right?

326
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,160
During our wedding night, I already saw your handwritten divorce paper.

327
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,500
You hid it in the wedding suit so, that one day,

328
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,420
I could choose the answer that you want from the two choices you gave me.

329
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,900
You've never cared about the two choices that I gave you.

330
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,639
Because in your heart,

331
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,679
you already have the answer, right?

332
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,679
You had given me your true love before.

333
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,220
And I'm thankful for it.

334
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,420
But so much had happened. There's no turning back for us anymore.

335
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,920
How can you act as if nothing had happened?

336
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,540
I don't care if you think that I'm insensible,

337
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,699
that I behave capriciously, or even think that...

338
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:05,540
I'm a villain who goes back on my word.

339
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,080
From now on,

340
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,700
I won't allow you to leave me again.

341
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,899
When I searched for you everywhere like a lunatic, I swore to myself.

342
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:19,480
Our fate is still not over as long as our promise is still valid.

343
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,200
From now on, I won't let you leave me.

344
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,070
Chang Jian.

345
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,239
General Fu.

346
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,020
Zhongshan has been quite chaotic recently.

347
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,980
Take good care of Lady Rong Le.

348
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,980
If she takes a step outside of this manor...

349
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,900
or if she has another wound on her,

350
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,239
I'll have your head.

351
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,880
Yes, General Fu.

352
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,180
- Lady Rong Le.
- Fu Chou!

353
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,780
I've already sent someone to bring Ling Yue and Xiao Ke here.

354
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,620
If you dare leave this manor without permission,

355
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,420
I can't guarantee their safety.

356
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,839
Princess Rong Le.

357
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,280
Xiao Sha, have you found a way to get out?

358
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,300
Just now, General Fu has given his order to tighten security.

359
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,460
I've checked. Only Tranquil Garden and the front yard are heavily guarded.

360
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,300
Not so much for the rest of the place.

361
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,680
Maybe at night, when they change their shift,

362
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,240
we might be able to find an opening.

363
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,280
All right.

364
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,080
At first, I wanted to end this on good terms.

365
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,640
He's the one who has forced me to do this.

366
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,799
No matter what, we have to get to the hunting ground at 8:00 tomorrow.

367
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,480
Yes, Miss.

368
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,980
Prince Li.

369
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,340
Where is Man Yao? Did something happen to her?

370
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,540
As soon as she went back to the manor yesterday, she was grounded.

371
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,120
She has asked me to tell you that we'll have to plan this out first.

372
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,720
[General's Manor]

373
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,160
Who dares barge into the General's Manor?

374
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,240
Prince Li.

375
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,350
General Fu.

376
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,690
[A Calm Foundation, A Quiet Residence]

377
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,300
I thought that you'd rein yourself in after...

378
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,200
your introspection at the southern border.

379
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,860
I never thought that you'd still act with such arrogance.

380
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,900
This is the third time you've barged into my manor.

381
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,940
Looks like you don't have any respect for this General of Defense.

382
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,480
Cut the nonsense. Give me Man Yao.

383
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,880
I don't have a Miss Man Yao here.

384
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,079
Rong Le is the Elder Princess of Western Qi.

385
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,400
She is the legal wife of the General of Defense.

386
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,580
If you want to see her, I'll have to say sorry.

387
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,500
She is not feeling well today.

388
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,060
She's not fit for a visitor.

389
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,600
Princess! Princess!

390
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,140
Princess.

391
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,620
Prince Li is here.

392
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,459
Didn't I tell you to pass on my message to him?

393
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:31,410
I've failed my duty. Prince Li is confronting General Fu in the front yard now.

394
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,670
Don't think of using the imperial order to threaten me.

395
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,890
You know I have no care for it.

396
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:41,219
Fu Chou, you talked about imperial order and status repeatedly.

397
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:45,399
Is there anything else between both of you besides that?

398
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,840
What a foolish question it is.

399
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,700
We have the mutual affection of husband and wife,

400
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,239
the time we spent together for half a year...

401
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,200
and more than 200 nights of sleeping together between us.

402
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,840
Not to mention that these are false,

403
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,000
but even if they are true, so what?

404
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,659
Do you think I'm like the others...

405
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:07,900
who will give up just because of that?

406
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,320
Fu Chou, you are a somebody.

407
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,200
It doesn't matter that you lie to me with those.

408
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,420
But isn't it ridiculous that you're trying to kid yourself?

409
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,660
You've had her once and then you lost her.

410
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,559
You did all of those by yourself.

411
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,780
Now, she's been married to me for months.

412
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,519
And you want to take her back now?

413
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,200
Who is being more ridiculous?

414
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,220
Looks like you are set on keeping her to yourself.

415
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,720
Don't blame me for being rude then.

416
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,900
I've always been courteous towards you.

417
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,639
But you've become even rude to me.

418
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,120
You barged into my manor several times and treated me as a nobody.

419
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,880
I can tolerate it, but...

420
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,800
I'm already at my limit.

421
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,399
This is the real Fu Chou.

422
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,580
Today, let us fight like real men.

423
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,440
I'm curious to see how capable you are as well.

424
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,740
- Princess Rong Le.
- Princess Rong Le.

425
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,680
What's wrong, Princess?

426
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,320
Did the poison in her body attack her again?

427
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,840
Tell me.

428
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,319
You've been without a cure for too long.

429
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,220
Without the cure to suppress it,

430
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,180
the poison has eaten through your organs and has gone into your blood.

431
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,280
If it attacks again, you'll faint if it's mild.

432
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,100
And you'll die... if it's serious.

433
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,580
How much time...

434
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,780
do I have?

435
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,460
Maximum half a year and minimum three months.

436
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,219
Aren't there any other ways to neutralize the poison?

437
00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:57,580
This is a complex poison.

438
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,500
Without a prescription, it's hard for me to create the cure.

439
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,740
But I'll try my best to find a way to neutralize the poison.

440
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,620
Worst comes to worst...

441
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:15,880
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

But why do I have...

446
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,980
no control over my life?

447
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,300
- I'll get the cure form His Majesty.
- Xiao Sha!

448
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,020
Princess.

449
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,640
I don't want to beg him.

450
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,660
And don't tell anybody...

451
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,900
about this either.

00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,679
- Princess.
- Princess Rong Le.

458
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,180
Princess.

459
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,480
Man Yao, why?

460
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,040
Do you know how dangerous it is?

461
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,280
You can't hurt him.

462
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,600
He is my husband.

463
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,279
He set you up for marriage, he used you,

464
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,379
put you in constant danger and now, he imprisoned you and took away your freedom.

465
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,780
Do you still see him as your husband?

466
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,120
This is between me and him.

467
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,000
It's best if you stay out of it.

468
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,880
You barged into my manor today with an army...

469
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,879
and you almost hurt my wife.

470
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,239
I don't think it'll do you any good if His Majesty knows about it.

471
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,379
Since I dare come here, I won't be afraid of that.

472
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,580
Man Yao.

473
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,680
Did something happen?

474
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,460
It's nothing.

475
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,280
Are you still going to leave with me?

476
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,340
No.

477
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,820
Fu Chou, what did you do to her?

478
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,800
He didn't do anything to me.

479
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm the one who is not willing to leave this manor.

480
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,020
Although he had made some mistakes, he is sincere towards me.

481
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,060
I'm not willing to betray him.

482
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,620
Do you think I'll believe you?

483
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,519
Man Yao, I know clearly...

484
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,560
what kind of a person you are and what kind of a life you want.

485
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,520
It's fine if you are not willing... to leave with me.

486
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,740
But I want to hear the truth.

487
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,840
I don't want to ruin my reputation...

488
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,680
and I'm not willing to give up my identity as the princess.

489
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,840
Because I think that...

490
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,520
you are not worth it.

491
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,580
Prince Li, please leave.

492
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,280
I don't want to see you again.

493
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,240
I'm not worth it.

494
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,680
Man Yao, if you really mean it...

495
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
Of course, I mean it.

496
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,080
I'm at fault for today's incident.

497
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,340
It's my fault for not making things clear between us before this.

498
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,120
I've troubled you to come here for nothing.

499
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,480
If His Majesty wants to blame someone,

500
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,080
I'll take full responsibility for it.

501
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,240
No need.

502
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,040
I've always borne the consequences of my own actions.

503
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,220
No need to trouble yourself, Lady Rong Le.

504
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,380
That's right. I'm the wife of General Fu.

505
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,320
Please keep it firmly in mind.

506
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,560
From now on, if someone else threatens my life,

507
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,640
please remember to mind your own business.

508
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,020
My husband will save me.

509
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,760
Mind my own business.

510
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,540
I'll make sure to keep it in mind.

511
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,839
Why did you say that?

512
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,640
Are you telling the truth or are you lying?

513
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,920
I lied.

514
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,559
Everything that you did... is indeed for the good of Zongzheng Wuyou.

515
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,620
You are worried that I'll gather up the officials and generals...

516
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,460
to exert pressure on His Majesty together with the crown prince.

517
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,500
Of course, you can take full responsibility for it.

518
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,599
And for His Majesty, he'll be glad to punish you alone...

519
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,020
given that I'm not hurt.

520
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,620
You know clearly that his attack won't kill me.

521
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,640
He'll only hurt me.

522
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,639
Of course, you don't care about whether I'll be hurt or not.

523
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,860
The only thing that you care about is,

524
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:51,160
if I'm hurt, others will say that Zongzheng Wuyou has no regard for the law,

525
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,900
that he barged into the manor fully armed to take you by force.

526
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,540
And I almost lost my life while protecting my wife.

527
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
If this spreads amongst the soldiers,

528
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,999
someone would be indignant with unfair treatment.

529
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:04,240
And by that time,

530
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,279
His Majesty wouldn't be able to protect him...

531
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,300
in case there was a mutiny amongst the troops.

532
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,279
Although you've thought ahead for him,

533
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,700
have you ever thought that what if he didn't manage to stop his attack?

534
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,020
It's very possible that you'd die by his hand.

535
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,180
He won't do it.

536
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,400
You are right about everything but one.

537
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,460
It's very possible that he knows about your sinister intentions.

538
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,739
If he wants to kill you, he won't bring along normal guards but The Hidden Ones instead.

539
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,860
You didn't give your best and neither did he.

540
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,120
Or else, how could he stop his attack so quickly?

541
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,440
He came to find me today...

542
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,300
just to make sure that... I was fine.

543
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,599
If that's the case, why didn't you leave with him?

544
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,700
It's possible that... he'll be able to give you the happiness and freedom...

545
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,600
that you crave.

546
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,420
Freedom.

547
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,740
What freedom?

548
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,980
My life is in others' hands.

549
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,520
My craving is just wishful thinking.

550
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,060
I'm just a heavy burden.

551
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,400
What did you say?

552
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,400
Fu Chou, don't put your hopes in me.

553
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,520
I can't give you... what you want.

554
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,350
[A Propitious Sky is Favorable for the Land]

555
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,260
You are back, Wuyou.

556
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,320
Where did you go, Wuyou?

557
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,300
What happened, Wuyou?

558
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,320
What's wrong with Wuyou?

559
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,840
What happened? Why is he so angry?

560
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,900
It's Man Yao again, right?

561
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,680
- Let me confront her.
- It's better if you don't.

562
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,700
- Why not?
- You still don't get it after so long?

563
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,020
She is the one Prince Li loves. No matter what she does,

564
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,560
nobody can touch her without Prince Li's permission.

565
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,039
What should we do then?

566
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,540
Are we going to sit here and watch while he dwells in depression?

567
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,960
Your Highness, Eunuch Chen is here.

568
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,599
Your Highness, His Majesty has summoned Prince Li to the palace.

569
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,660
All right.

570
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,459
Wuyou! Eunuch Chen is here.

571
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:43,880
Father must have had something for you. Today, I...

572
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,919
Leng Yan, ask Agent Wu to investigate these people in secret.

573
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,560
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Let's go.

574
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,260
Wuyou!

575
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,070
These are the names of the generals in the army.

576
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,300
Looks like Wuyou has found a way to take down with Fu Chou.

577
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,280
Wei has always been a festering wound for me.

578
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,080
All these years, we've been in a constant war with them.

579
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,260
Many have sacrificed themselves for us.

580
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:19,739
A few years ago, we had the chance to defeat them once and for all.

581
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:23,600
But we were defeated because of the crown prince's mistake.

582
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,280
Once this war starts,

583
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,020
it'll take a huge toll on both of the countries' armed forces.

584
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,220
For the past years, both countries had been making preparations for this war.

585
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,940
We trained up soldiers and gathered food.

586
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,960
A few days ago, our scout from the frontier pass had reported that Wei...

587
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,620
is gathering up their troops and is readying themselves for war.

588
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,519
So, this war between us is inevitable.

589
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,199
In order to have the upper hand,

590
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,860
I've decided to attack them first.

591
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,080
And this time, I'll lead the troops myself.
