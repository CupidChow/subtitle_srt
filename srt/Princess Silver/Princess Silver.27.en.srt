[Episode 27]

2
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,700
What is that smell?

3
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,879
It's so itchy!

4
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,999
- What did you do to me?
- Nothing.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,559
I just sprayed some of my newly invented poison powder on you.

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,559
You shouldn't have disrespected me.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,999
My brother said boys and girls should not touch each other.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,559
A man that touches me is a bad guy!

9
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,479
- Give me the antidote!
- No!

10
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,980
Give me the antidote!

11
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,959
- It's so itchy! Stop right there!
- What do you want?

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,720
Stop! Stop right there!

13
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,620
Give me the antidote! Give me the antidote!

14
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,279
It's so itchy!

15
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
Hurry up!

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,719
It's so itchy! It's killing me.

17
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,660
It's so itchy!

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,879
It's so itchy!

19
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,039
Ke'er? Ke'er?

20
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,320
- It's so itchy!
- Ke'er?

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,860
Ke'er?

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,420
It's so itchy!

23
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,439
Wuyu, what's wrong with you?

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,719
I didn't do anything and she just passed out.

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,039
It's so itchy! Man Yao!

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,599
Man Yao, save me!

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,020
It's so itchy! I can't stand it anymore.

28
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,039
You pinched my face,

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,039
and now you are holding the princess' hand!

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,359
Do that again and I will use an even more powerful poison!

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,799
You are threatening me?

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,660
You'll pay after the effect wears off.

33
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,079
Just you wait, you'll see!

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,959
- It's so itchy!
- Ke'er.

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,759
Prince Chen is not a bad guy.

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,879
He is my friend, he doesn't mean you harm.

37
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,720
Why don't you give him the antidote?

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,840
He is your friend?

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,599
But this poison is newly brewed.

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,599
I don't have the antidote yet.

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,719
Don't worry, the effect will wear off after a few hours.

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,719
What? A few hours?

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
Give me the antidote, now!

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,879
Fine.

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,999
- I lied just now.
- It's so itchy!

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
The princess wants me to help you,

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,559
I will let it slide this time.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,580
Hurry up!

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Insolent girl! Apologize now!

50
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,959
Why should she apologize?

51
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,879
You disrespected her first.

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,039
I...

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,119
Yes! Princess Rong Le, you must help me out.

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,279
My brother told me not to get disrespected by men.

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,759
Otherwise, I will never get married.

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,960
Don't be such a big head. I am already in love with someone.

57
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,460
I thought you would be frustrated by Zhao Yun's marriage.

58
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,239
But seeing you are laughing so gleefully,

59
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,180
you don't seem to need consolation.

60
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,980
Zhao Yun?

61
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,120
I do feel better now.

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,079
Fine.

63
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,160
I am a generous prince.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,700
I shall forgive you this time.

65
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,599
What do you mean you forgive me? That should be my line!

66
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,860
You are getting all worked up!

67
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,879
Insolent girl, if it wasn't for Man Yao,

68
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,479
I would make...

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,319
Stop talking. Eat this snack.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,999
Ling Yue made them.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,460
This is Ke'er's favorite, right?

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,519
Xiao Sha, why did Ke'er pass out just now?

73
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,079
Ke'er suffers from an incurable sickness.

74
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,999
She always faints without any reason.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,399
But isn't her master the Lone Frost Sage?

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,040
Not even she can heal Ke'er's sickness?

77
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,039
It's not that. My master is amazing.

78
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,319
But my sickness is so rare...

79
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,799
that my master spent her life only to find one cure.

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,519
But she couldn't find one of the herbs she needs.

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,719
That is her greatest regret.

82
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,759
Can't you cure yourself?

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,839
I was supposed to die after five years old.

84
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
I shall live every day I can.

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,559
But my brother insists to cure my illness.

86
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,359
But fate is only on your side to find the herbs.

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,679
It can't be helped.

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,839
This girl may look silly,

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,160
but what she said does make sense.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,559
The remedy requires the Leaf of Seven Locutions.

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Leaf of Seven Locutions? Where do we find that?

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,840
Leaf of Seven Locutions?

93
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,640
- I think I know about it.
- Tell me what it is.

94
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,900
As long as we can cure Ke'er, I am willing to do anything.

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,239
I only know even if you find the herb,

96
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,900
it's hard to preserve it.

97
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,440
If you want an exact location of it, you need to ask my brother.

98
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,039
See? You are just the same as my brother.

99
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,639
You are clearly in love but you can't face each other.

100
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,920
Very well, I can be on my way now.

101
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,400
Wait.

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,320
Give this to your brother.

103
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,140
Wuyou actually gave this to you?

104
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,559
Why? What does it mean?

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,279
This Inked-Jade Fan is the greatest item for the Hidden Ones.

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
You can use it to deploy the elites of the Hidden Ones.

107
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,880
As long as you want it, you can even overthrow the entire kingdom.

108
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,800
Do you mean I can trade this fan for the herb?

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
If my brother is willing to give you this,

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,519
he will give you the Leaf of Seven Locutions.

111
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,559
But that leaf means something special for my brother.

112
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,719
If you really want the leaf,

113
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,820
it wouldn't hurt to bow down for once.

114
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,160
Yun, I am here for you.

115
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,100
I have made up my mind to lead the army against Wei.

116
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,780
I may be old, but my spirit is still strong.

117
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,540
You can understand me, right?

118
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,740
As you watch from Heaven,

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,799
I pray to you so Northern Lin can thrive on forever.

120
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,220
We must win this war.

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,760
Wuyou doesn't understand my pain.

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,360
But you, you understand better than anyone.

123
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,460
In order to rebuild this nation,

124
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,240
I had to marry Fu Yuan.

125
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,900
You agreed despite the pain it caused you.

126
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,520
But I never thought...

127
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,040
my son would have such a similar experience as ours.

128
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I may be the ruler of this land,

129
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,220
but there are times when I can't make the decision.

130
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,100
I felt so hopeless and helpless.

131
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,080
My heart has been filled with regret and it's been haunting me.

132
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,079
When Wuyou brought that woman and locked themselves up in here,

133
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,500
I wondered if they bothered your rest.

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,240
That day, I felt so furious...

135
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,840
but then I started to understand.

136
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Rather than being mad at his mistake,

137
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,640
I should be mad at myself...

138
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,880
for not having the courage he had that day.

139
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,360
The whole world is saying that I let Wuyou do as he pleases.

140
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,179
But only I know the pain he has been suffering all these years.

141
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,600
At night, the pain is so excruciating.

142
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,839
My mind is haunted by the nightmares.

143
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,220
He may have walked out from the sorrow of the past,

144
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,399
but he is shackled by love.

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,480
He can't love who he loves.

146
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,020
Yun,

147
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,500
what should I do to wipe away the pain in Wuyou's heart?

148
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,199
Greetings, Lady Rong Le.

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,159
I am sorry but I cannot let you pass.

150
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,999
His Majesty is in Lady Yun's tomb. I am ordered to keep watch here.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,880
No one can pass through there.

152
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,719
Thank you, Captain Xiang.

153
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,639
I shall wait here.

154
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,900
You should go home. His Majesty spends hours in here.

155
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,720
I don't know when he will come out.

156
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,799
Is Prince Li inside the tomb as well?

157
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,919
Prince Chen told me to wait for Prince Li at this place.

158
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,380
I am not at liberty to say anything.

159
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,119
I understand.

160
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,539
You can leave me be. I shall wait here.

161
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,180
[Yun Mausoleum]

162
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,480
Every time I came to pay my respects,

163
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,040
it reminded me of my childhood.

164
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,220
My mother was gentle and kind.

165
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,060
She taught me about gratitude... and kindness.

166
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,460
My father was merciful and generous.

167
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,820
He taught me how to ride a horse and archery.

168
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,390
My teacher was a man of knowledge.

169
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,300
He taught me how to be a good person.

170
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,780
Everything was perfect back then.

171
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,360
It made me feel like the world was filled with light,

172
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,500
that darkness never existed.

173
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,140
But after the case with Shilixiang Wine,

174
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,180
my mother was murdered.

175
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,940
My teacher's whole family was executed.

176
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,260
Whatever happiness I had,

177
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,600
the same tragedy came right after.

178
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,519
This is a good wine. The Shilixiang Wine from Minister Qin's family...

179
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,639
is indeed amazing.

180
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,219
Your Majesty puts a lot of trust in Yu Shihai and his men.

181
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:37,779
They go against Minister Qin's reformation on every corner.

182
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,680
That also goes against the interests of Northern Lin.

183
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,500
Your Majesty, now that you had their wine,

184
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,560
you should understand how loyal Minister Qin is to you.

185
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,660
Your Majesty must never suspect him again.

186
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,440
Your Majesty!

187
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,380
Your Majesty, what happened?

188
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,360
I am feeling dizzy.

189
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
Let's get some rest.

190
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,640
Come on.

191
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,740
Lie down.

192
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,590
Your Majesty.

193
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,780
Your Majesty?

194
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,160
- Help!
- This headache!

195
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,040
Your Majesty, I am calling for the imperial physician.

196
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,460
Someone, help!

197
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,660
Help!

198
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,100
Fu Yuan!

199
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,800
- Your Majesty!
- I will kill you!

200
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,240
I will kill you!

201
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,040
- Your Majesty!
- Fu Yuan!

202
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,720
Mother!

203
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
Yun?

204
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,299
- Your Majesty.
- Yun'er!

205
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,019
- Yun'er!
- Your Majesty.

206
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,740
Yun'er? Yun'er?

207
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,280
Your Majesty.

208
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,420
Why?

209
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,559
Yun'er? Yun'er!

210
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,360
I blamed you.

211
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,179
But I didn't blame you...

212
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:19,400
because of the crime you committed after being drugged.

213
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,419
It's because... you never face what you have done.

214
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:27,160
You keep making excuses for your mistake.

215
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,299
I couldn't face your mother's death.

216
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:34,200
I have always thought of you as a coward.

217
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,220
I swear I will never be like you.

218
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,000
But when I locked myself and Man Yao in here,

219
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,560
when I can never win her heart no matter what I try,

220
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,120
I finally realized that loving someone doesn't mean...

221
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,480
you get to spend your life with her.

222
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,580
As we live,

223
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,360
there are moments when nothing can be done.

224
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,460
Perhaps I don't have the right to blame you.

225
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,720
After all, I'm not you...

226
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,700
and I know nothing about your reasons.

227
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,799
It's just like how the world never knew about my past with Man Yao.

228
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,040
Yet they insist to judge us for what we did.

229
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,080
Wuyou, does Rong Le...

230
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,200
Does Rong Le... really mean that much to you?

231
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,340
I know.

232
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,590
[Yun Mausoleum]

233
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,299
Your Majesty, Lady Rong Le is here.

234
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,900
She has been waiting for a long time.

235
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,520
Your Majesty.

236
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,660
Rong Le greets Your Majesty.

237
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,460
Why are you here?

238
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,560
Are you here for me or Wuyou?

239
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,700
Tell me. Do you love Wuyou?

240
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,839
If you do, why did you choose to marry General Fu?

241
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,939
If you don't, why are you here for him again?

242
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:19,940
Your Majesty, whether I love him or not,

243
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,540
for me, it's all in the past.

244
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,600
I came to Prince Li because there is something...

245
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,020
that absolutely needd his help.

246
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:36,020
But how do you know, all that happened,

247
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,580
are left in the past for him?

248
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,459
I wouldn't draw any conclusion about His Highness' thoughts.

249
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:46,040
I only know to follow my heart.

250
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,920
A girl that made Wuyou fall in love so deeply...

251
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,800
would never be a woman of vile schemes.

252
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,259
Fine. I'll believe you.

253
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,560
You follow your heart and know not to cross the line.

254
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,519
You are a smart person.

255
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,940
I hope you can see the big picture.

256
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,400
Thank you for your teachings.

257
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,779
Very well. Go to Wuyou if you want.

258
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,160
Be nice to him.

259
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,700
I owe him too much.

260
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,239
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

261
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,640
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

262
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,260
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

263
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,920
Your Highness.

264
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,300
The last time you were here was like a lifetime ago.

265
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,979
Those are memories of the past, there is no need to bring them up.

266
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,840
This is my mother.

267
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,480
Man Yao, will you pay your respects?

268
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,479
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

269
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,580
♫ I will be your hearth in the coldest of places ♫

270
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,400
Don't you want to know why I am here?

271
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,560
I don't want to and there is no need to.

272
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,819
Your Highness, I am...

273
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,780
There is no need to return what I gave you.

274
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,200
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

275
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:23,360
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

276
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,019
This was a meeting gift from my mother. Keep it.

277
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,259
See? I told you.

278
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:52,060
As long as you ask, my brother will give you the leaf.

279
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,000
Why is the Leaf of Seven Locution inside Lady Yun's tomb?

280
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,900
When my brother was just a kid, someone poisoned him.

281
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,700
Lady Yun went through a lot of hassle to get this herb for him.

282
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,780
I don't know what happened back then.

283
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
But when my father heard about this,

284
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,020
he was mad at Lady Yun for the first time.

285
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,080
He didn't talk to her for three whole months.

286
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,700
This herb really is precious.

287
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,859
If this leaf was used to cleanse the poison, why is it still kept here?

288
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:27,659
The leaf was originally much thicker.

289
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,379
The poison can be cleansed with just half of its fluid.

290
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,139
The other half was too hard to preserve.

291
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,920
So it was kept inside the ice chamber of the palace.

292
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,619
Then, my brother placed it inside Lady Yun's tomb.

293
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,779
For my brother, this leaf represents his mother's love for him.

294
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,580
This is the most precious belonging she left for my brother.

295
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,580
I can't keep this herb. It means too much to him.

296
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,970
You should take it.

297
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:55,919
Never mind. Once this herb leaves the ice chamber, it won't be easy to preserve it.

298
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,939
Since you are using it to save a life, you should use it.

299
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,140
Don't let my brother's kindness go to waste.

300
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,980
After all, you mean the world to him.

301
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,619
I must ready the medicine for Ke'er.

302
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:12,500
Take it as Prince Li is saving her life.

303
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,799
Man Yao, this is not about my brother saving Ke'er's life.

304
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,600
This is about his love for you.

305
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,180
Till the end of time, he will always be there for you.

306
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,980
♫ Our hearts are a lifetime apart ♫

307
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,619
♫ No one comes, also no one asks ♫

308
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,340
♫ How do we keep living this life? ♫

309
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,920
♫ Finally, I've learned how to trust ♫ -

310
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,280
♫ But I've underestimated love and hate ♫ -

311
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,899
♫ We've thrown away fate that we'd received by chance ♫

312
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:55,139
♫ I have to admit to my mistakes ♫

313
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:59,439
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

314
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,820
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

315
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,099
♫ I asked for too much, I hesitated for too long ♫

316
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:12,500
♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

317
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,779
♫ You are behind me ♫

♫ Mocking the promise that I made for you ♫

319
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,380
♫ I must give all I have ♫

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,919
♫ This is the leniency that you've shown to me ♫

327
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,420
♫ We are not holding hands, but you are holding my heart ♫

328
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,619
Wuyu, you can see yourself out. I have other work to be done.

329
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,219
It's okay. I am not in a hurry.

330
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:15,579
I recall I have something to discuss with Lady Rong Le.

331
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,779
Please wait, Prince Chen.

332
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:20,099
I was simply passing by.

333
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,800
I'll be on my way now.

334
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,140
Man Yao, are you two...

335
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,980
Wuyu, you should go.

336
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
I wish to be alone.

337
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,020
Okay.

338
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,739
Ke'er, I did as you said...

339
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:02,539
and used the leaf as a remedy along with your prescription.

340
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:04,179
I made sure the ingredients were used perfectly.

341
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,539
You will get well after you take this medicine. You will live a long life.

342
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:10,779
Princess Rong Le, I don't want a long life.

343
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,299
My master tried everything she could to keep her beauty.

344
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:16,139
She wasted so much time on it.

345
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,519
If I have the time, I should see the world...

346
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,860
and have all that are delicious and fun.

347
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,639
So many people are afraid of getting old and want to stay young.

348
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:30,240
Even a sage like your master couldn't escape from that fear.

349
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,019
But you are so innocent.

350
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:34,820
Time will never stop you from doing anything.

351
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,579
Princess Rong Le, what are you talking about? I don't get it.

352
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,960
You know it the best.

353
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,499
Your Highness saved our lives.

354
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:58,000
We will never be able to repay your kindness.

355
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,520
From now on, I swear to follow Your Highness till the day I die.

356
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,090
I will never betray you.

357
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,840
Please, get up.

358
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,100
Xiao Sha, I didn't save Ke'er to ask for you to repay me.

359
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,500
Long Yue stayed loyal to the end.

360
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,779
I hope you can uphold your loyalty as well.

361
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,979
I... understand Your Highness.

362
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,740
Brother, why are you crying? Let's go to the House of Fragrance.

363
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,820
Sir Xiao, are you still meddling with the people there?

364
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,739
I do hate that place.

365
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:48,059
But the people there said men love to hang out at that place.

366
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,579
Ke'er, enough of this nonsense.

367
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,619
It's not nonsense.

368
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,900
I misunderstood.

369
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,879
Lady Rong Le, you have been looking absent-minded recently.

370
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:33,460
Is something bothering you?

371
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,960
I want to spend some time living in the teahouse.

372
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,739
Ling Yue told me that...

373
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:47,500
you and General Fu have a cold relationship.

374
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,640
He should have known that ever since the attack by the lake,

375
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,559
all the false kindness and gentle gestures he gave were all exposed.

376
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,659
But he can't face it.

377
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,900
He is trying to make up for it.

378
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,459
And now, it seems like his pretentious love has met its limit.

379
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,240
Lady, are you sure about this?

380
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,699
Just because you are angry, this decision cannot be made lightly.

381
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:20,460
After you got used to this place and the people here,

382
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,660
it won't be easy to leave everything behind.

383
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,530
Keeping what should be deposed of will cause more harm.

384
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,160
Chen Yu, I envy the life you are having.

385
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,140
It's simple and plain.

386
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,580
You have no desires.

387
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,800
Right. I keep having headaches.

388
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,740
I keep seeing flashes of memories.

389
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,840
They are so vague... yet so real.

390
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,899
Ke'er said I might be recovering my memories.

391
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:57,979
I was thinking... if these memories...

392
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:02,160
are reminding me that it's time to leave this place.

393
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,219
Lady, I owe my life to you.

394
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:09,000
If you are leaving, please take me with you.

395
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,539
Princess Rong Le. Miss Chen Yu, you are here too.

396
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,499
Princess, let me read your pulse. Let's see if you are getting better.

397
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:23,380
Ke'er, can you do me a favor?

398
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,459
A person I know is hurt.

399
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:28,419
But he wouldn't let me see it or let the others know.

400
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:30,539
Can you treat his wound for me?

401
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,379
The wound is at his shoulder.

402
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:35,219
There might be some old injuries beneath them, too.

403
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:37,179
I hate these kinds of people.

404
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:39,279
A doctor needs to observe the patient for diagnosis.

405
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,539
If he won't let anyone see or touch him, he clearly wants to die.

406
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,680
I am not going to help him.

407
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,020
I am afraid he never wanted to live a good life.

408
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,579
Otherwise... he wouldn't get himself hurt so easily.

409
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:56,159
Your Highness, you are all here.

410
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,339
- Miss Chen Yu.
- Ling Yue, just in time.

411
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,379
Can you take Ke'er to General Fu?

412
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:05,299
Tell him I sent her. Let Ke'er tend to his wound.

413
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,779
General Fu is hurt? How do you know?

414
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,520
Didn't you...

415
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,880
Yes, I shall go right away.

416
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,539
Lady Rong Le, if you are in a bad mood,

417
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,699
let me play you a song.

418
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:26,059
I learned every song in the score you gave me.

419
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,739
Music calms the mind.

420
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:30,440
It might help you realize something.

421
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,460
[Carefree and Relaxed]

422
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,380
I thank Your Majesty for my grandmother.

423
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,739
As for the jade sculpture of Long Life and Prosperity,

424
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:23,699
my grandmother placed it in the main hall. She prays to it every day.

425
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:26,419
Good. Yali, at ease.

426
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:28,440
Formality is not needed here.

427
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,659
Your mother was like a sister to me.

428
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,419
I see your grandmother as my own since I was a child.

429
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,979
Now that her birthday is behind us,

430
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:42,560
what do you plan to do next?

431
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,819
I am waiting for a reply from my father.

432
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:51,860
If his men come from the south, I must return to Qingzhou.

433
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,779
I thought you finally saw it through.

434
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,720
But you are still mindless as ever.

435
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,579
The campaign will be launched soon.

436
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,020
His Majesty is in a good mood lately.

437
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,699
Both you and Wuyou are in the capital.

438
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:08,199
Allow me to be your witness and grant you two a marriage.

439
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:13,059
You won't need to return to Qingzhou and you may stay by my side all the time.

440
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,299
I thank Your Majesty for the kind offer.

441
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,660
But Prince Li...

442
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,439
Ever since the proposal from Prince Zhenbei of Chen,

443
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:24,360
the two of us haven't met.

444
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,680
Really?

445
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,959
I heard... Wuyou and the General's wife have a suspicious relationship.

446
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:39,039
Was it my mistake for letting them meet each other again?

447
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,799
This has nothing to do with Your Majesty.

448
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,659
I do share a friendship with Lady Rong Le.

449
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,980
I know she is not that kind of person.

450
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,859
When Zhao Yun got married,

451
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:52,259
both she and I kept Zhao Yun company in the inn.

452
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,619
She kept her distance from Prince Li.

453
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,939
What? They met at the inn?

454
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,619
Yali, fear not. I will speak for you.

455
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,499
I must sever all of their past ties.

456
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:11,659
I won't allow that woman to ruin Wuyou's future and your marriage.

457
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,000
But Prince Li is...

458
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,819
With his temper, we can't force him to do anything.

459
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:21,100
It's all right. I won't work on Wuyou.

460
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,859
Guards, ready the sedan to the General's manor.

461
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:25,540
Yes.

462
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,170
[Carefree and Relaxed]

463
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,300
- Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

464
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,260
- At ease.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

465
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,019
I have some free time with me today.

466
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:43,579
I can go to General Fu's manor with you...

467
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:45,860
and show my caring to the general.

468
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,720
- Your Majesty, I was...
- Enough chatter.

469
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,920
Ready the sedan to General Fu's manor.

470
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,720
Yes.

471
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,559
General Fu is not seeing anyone. Get lost!

472
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,839
Bad guys. You are all bad guys!

473
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,459
The man inside is even worse!

474
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:04,579
Lady Rong Le asked me to tend to his wound.

475
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,339
But he sent his dogs on me.

476
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:07,539
What did you say?

477
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,360
I said, he set his watch dogs loose on me!

478
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,559
Ke'er, are you all right?

479
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,460
I am fine.

480
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,259
What about you? Are you all right?

481
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,839
I am fine.

482
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,939
- But General Fu is...
- He needs more than medicine for his heart.

483
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,240
The princess can't give him the cure.

484
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,040
Ke'er, we might as well just leave him be.

485
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,540
Let's go.

486
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,239
Brother, the princess herself is ill,

487
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:46,019
why would she care about another person's life?

488
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:49,999
Ke'er, everyone in this world has their own way of living.

489
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:53,979
For the princess, if someone helped her, she will do her best to repay them.

490
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:55,899
She did the same for us.

491
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,339
Right, Ke'er. Didn't you say you have a cure for the princess?

492
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,699
Yes. I will give it my all to save her life.

493
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:06,780
Miss Ling Yue, can you please tell me about her condition?

494
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,559
Chen Yu, I feel like... playing the qin wasn't so hard at all.

495
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,940
Judging by the way you played it,

496
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,840
perhaps you knew how to play it back in the days.

497
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,600
I am glad you are here to keep me company and cheer me up.

498
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,820
What is taking Ling Yue and the others so long?

499
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,019
Did Ke'er get herself into trouble again?

500
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:15,840
I am worried. I should go check on her.

501
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,480
His Majesty arrives!

502
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,019
I didn't know Your Majesty and Empress would be visiting.

503
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,180
I apologize for not welcoming Your Majesty.

504
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,600
Lady Rong Le, at ease.

505
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,619
While we were having a conversation,

506
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:46,699
I thought about you.

507
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:50,919
His Majesty was in the mood and wanted to pay General Fu a visit.

508
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,919
He won't let anyone inform you, so we came uninvited.

509
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:57,000
I hope you are not offended.

510
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,979
At your service, Your Majesty and Empress.

511
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:13,140
Greetings, Miss Sun.

512
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,859
At ease, General Fu.

513
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

514
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,239
My wife came from a foreign country.

515
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,760
She never welcomed Your Majesty here.

516
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,179
If there was any lack of manners, I am willing to take the punishment for her.

517
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,920
I was suddenly in the mood to pay you a visit.

518
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,479
Your wife showed us good manners, befitting that of a noble.

519
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,820
She didn't cause you any trouble.

520
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,000
Recently, there were some rumors in the palace.

521
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,059
Rumor has it General Fu and Lady Rong Le have a cold relationship.

522
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:58,299
Now that I see it for myself,

523
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:01,219
you two have great respect for each other,

524
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,240
a loving couple indeed.

525
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,800
It seems to me those rumors are all lies.

526
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,219
Your Majesty is right.

527
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:15,079
The matters between husband and wife can only be known by the couple themselves.

528
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:18,179
Besides, the matter of my family...

529
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,179
is not something an outsider should judge us for.

530
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,900
After the parting at the inn, how are you, Lady Rong Le?

531
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,059
Thank you, Miss Yali. I am fine.

532
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:33,199
If you are feeling unwell, continue as always.

533
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,479
Formality is not needed here. Have your seats.

534
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,020
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Yes.

535
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,219
I heard the melodies of a qin just now.

536
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:55,059
It seems like Lady Rong Le is feeling very well.

537
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,539
You have quite the quality time in your life.

538
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:01,739
General Fu has great skills when it comes to music.

539
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:03,459
It's known by all.

540
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:07,100
Can you play a song together?

541
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,500
I haven't had any song in such a long time.

542
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,499
I wouldn't dare to make a scene here.

543
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:17,499
The song from earlier was just part of the learning.

544
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,900
I am just a beginner, I am no expert in this.

545
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,579
If Lady Rong Le insists, we shouldn't make it hard for her.

546
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:28,000
Perhaps I can play a song?

547
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,499
I know you learned from the master musician since your childhood.

548
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:34,259
You have a great talent for music.

549
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:37,360
Why don't we let Yali present a song for us?

550
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,020
Let us witness her marvelous music.

551
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,740
I apologize. I wouldn't want to disrespect the hosts.

552
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,579
I have an idea.

553
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,899
Maybe General Fu can start playing.

554
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:55,499
I can play to his accompaniment.

555
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:58,159
Together, we can present Your Majesty a song.

556
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:03,139
Good. I have only ever heard about General Fu's talent in music.

557
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:05,680
But I have never seen it in person.

558
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,540
Your Majesty.

559
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,579
General Fu is an officer with high rank.

560
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,320
He cannot lower himself to be a mere performer.

561
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,179
His hands are supposed to wield swords and slay our enemies.

562
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:29,579
Even if he is playing the qin, a proper ceremony is needed.

563
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,760
He cannot play music for the sake of mere entertainment.

564
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,059
Lady Rong Le, you won't agree to any suggestions.

565
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,979
That is rude of you.

566
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:43,540
Don't you have any respect for the emperor and me?

567
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,800
Your Majesty, please calm down.

568
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,099
I hope Miss Yali would play for us.

569
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:54,499
I may just be a beginner, but I am willing to play to her accompaniment.

570
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,780
Very well.

571
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,059
I have heard about how crude and rude the people of Qi are.

572
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,660
They pay no attention to manners at all.

573
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,019
But to witness the music played by a lady from Western Qi...

574
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:15,120
could be rather interesting.

575
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,539
The people of Western Qi live on barren land.

576
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:24,539
They learn about farming and martial arts in order to keep the land safe.

577
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:29,599
Compared to them, I am but a noble that contributed nothing to the land.

578
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,459
I learn to play the qin because of interest.

579
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:33,459
I have no right to speak for them.

580
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:37,219
I live in a foreign land and have no choice but to please the lords.

581
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:38,700
You...

582
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:48,219
What you said just now does carry the courage of turning down Prince Li at the main hall.

583
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:51,139
"A pearl may be covered in dust,

584
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:54,520
but the shines will never fade."

585
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,600
Much appreciated, Your Majesty.

586
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,080
Miss Yali, if you may.

587
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,600
♫ The snow falls on my palm ♫

588
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,910
♫ I just want to gaze at you one more time ♫

589
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:52,450
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

590
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:58,010
♫ We are fated to get hurt from the moment we met each other ♫

591
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,090
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

592
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:11,530
♫ You are keeping me out with your care,
Although we are together, I feel lost ♫

593
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:16,100
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

594
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,680
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

595
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:29,880

596
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,460
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

597
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,950
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

598
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:47,820
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

599
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,830
♫ In a blink of an eye, my hair has turned silver ♫

600
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:58,430
♫ I'm fated to live in loneliness without any regrets ♫

601
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:07,590
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

602
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:12,500
♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

603
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,730
♫ I'm willing to live in darkness for you ♫

604
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:29,120
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫
