[Episode 16]

2
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,771
When are you going to let me go?

3
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,420
We will each take a step back.

4
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,158
Forget about the unpleasant past. What do you think?

5
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:05,021
I don't care if you lied about your identity.

6
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:09,659
I don't care if you approached me with motives.

7
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,320
I don't care what happened between you and Fu Chou.

8
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,576
I can leave those in the past.

9
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:19,819
Man Yao, what's done is done.

10
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:24,819
Blaming and loathing each other is completely meaningless.

11
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,741
I promised you.

12
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:29,709
Your future is my future, too.

13
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:31,664
Future?

14
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:36,460
There is no future between us.

15
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,000
I do want to marry you.

16
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,299
I also believe that...

17
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,420
it doesn't matter if that book was a fake when you handed it to me,

18
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,000
you were hoping I can keep it safe. Right?

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,632
What does it matter?

20
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,814
Fu Chou and I completed the ceremony.

21
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:58,549
Speaking about this won't make a difference.

22
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:02,211
I will find a way to get the dissolution letter.

23
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,460
You are the emperor's favorite son.

24
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,460
But you are not all mighty.

25
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,891
No,

26
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,528
you have to trust me.

27
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,089
I can't trust you anymore.

28
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:26,206
In mere days, I was deceived again and again.

29
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:30,220
Since we can no longer trust each other,

30
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,080
what is the point of staying together?

31
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,037
Let it go.

32
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,678
This day is destined to come since the day you turned me down.

33
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,216
We have different backgrounds and stands.

34
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:52,301
We may have felt love,

35
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:55,420
but we were never honest to one another.

36
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:58,726
We should just let go.

37
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,855
Let us become strangers.

38
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:05,286
It's better than a life of distrust and pain.

39
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,262
Is that what you want?

40
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,800
This is my wish.

41
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,820
Please, grant me this last wish.

42
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,900
Do you think Fu Chou will truly love you?

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,820
That is not your concern.

44
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,220
Have you ever loved me?

45
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,873
If you did,

46
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:44,920
how much did you love me?

47
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,172
I have one final request.

48
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,360
Keep me company for another three days.

49
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,870

will give you all of me.

71
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:04,736
I will never give up on you.

72
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,440

82
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,533
The door is opening.

83
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,840
- What is going on?
- Where are they?

84
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,210
No one came out.

85
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,973
She is coming out.

86
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,180
She came out dressed in that?

87
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,550
What happened in the last three days?

88
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,340
[Yun Mausoleum]

89
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,359
Brother.

90
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,369
Your Majesty.

91
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,299
It really is you.

92
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,720
You are Princess Rong Le.

93
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,134
Yes.

94
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,916
During the feast, both you and the Emperor of Western Qi were there.

95
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:25,354
You allowed the fake princess to choose her husband.

96
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:28,804
What exactly are you planning?

97
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,517
You are supposed to marry my son.

98
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,899
You should have stayed inside the manor.

99
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,294
But you spread your lies everywhere and seduced Prince Li.

100
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,434
You beguiled General Fu.

101
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,295
You tried to alienate my two most important officers!

102
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,163
You caused disruption to the Imperial Court.

103
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,102
This is outrageous!

104
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,229
- Guards!
- Yes.

105
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,999
Arrest her and lock her up. She will be put on trial!

106
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,475
Your Majesty.

107
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,621
- Your Majesty.
- General Fu, do you want to plead for her?

108
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,379
She brought shame to you!

109
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,219
You will be humiliated for your whole life!

110
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:07,962
You should be hating her!

111
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,443
Your Majesty.

112
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:12,432
For the time being,

113
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,913
while we just signed the treaty with Western Qi,

114
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:19,579
imprisoning the Princess of Western Qi might cause an uproar.

115
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,209
It might not bode well for us.

116
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,776
Which is why I suggest...

117
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:26,725
Your Majesty to calm down for the sake of the greater good.

118
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,559
Father.

119
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,179
All of these things happened because Wuyou turned down the engagement...

120
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,896
and took the bride.

121
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:37,272
General Fu shouldn't be blamed.

122
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:38,865
Silence!

123
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,639
What happened today was brought on us because she wanted revenge.

124
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,806
- Your Majesty.
- My decision is certain.

125
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,579
Say no more.

126
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,719
- Lock her up.
- Yes.

127
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,446
Let her go!

128
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,621
- Let her go.
- Let her go?

129
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,790
Thanks to her insolence, we were all placed in this predicament!

130
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,208
What happened back there was my doing alone.

131
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,165
The others are innocent.

132
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,874
But she lied about her identity to approach you.

133
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,579
She lied to approach me...

134
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,110
to fulfil the six-month agreement we made in the main hall.

135
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,116
But she has chosen another man.

136
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,428
I gave her the right of choice.

137
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:36,739
Wuyou.

138
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,760
Please, Your Majesty.

139
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,060
Let my mother rest in peace.

140
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,020
Since Prince Li has pleaded for you,

141
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,620
this shall be the end of this matter.

142
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,269
From now on, no one shall mention this again.

143
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,357
Is that clear?

144
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,509
Yes.

145
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,019
Your Majesty, I will leave with my wife now.

146
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,440
Brother!

147
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,945
Brother!

148
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,499
Ling Yue, help the princess change into these clothes.

149
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,222
Yes.

150
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,680
This should have been done three days ago,

151
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,304
but the wedlock drink is still needed.

152
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:02,399
After all, this is part of the wedding.

153
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,135
With this done,

154
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:06,203
it will be a good omen for us both.

155
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,439
The meaning behind wedlock drink...

156
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,739
is for the husband and wife to live as one,

157
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:21,078
they will never be separated.

158
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,879
I know you understand well enough...

159
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,332
the two of us will never become a real married couple.

160
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:31,179
Which is why this drink is simply meaningless.

161
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,040
I need to have a word with my wife.

162
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,539
You may go now.

163
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:07,286
Yes.

164
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,419
Your Highness, I'll be right there.

165
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,327
I'll be standing by.

166
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,899
It must be hard to put up an act all day.

167
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,519
There is no need for acting while we are here.

168
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,499
I brought shame to you.

169
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,980
You must have hated me for it.

170
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,233
Why would you pretend nothing has ever happened?

171
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,870
Nothing happened between you and Prince Li in the tomb.

172
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,139
The Yun Mausoleum is the resting place for Lady Yun, Prince Li's mother.

173
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:49,839
No matter how vile he can be,

174
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,134
he would never do anything to disrespect you inside his mother's tomb.

175
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:55,779
You know him well.

176
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,860
You like him a lot.

177
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,360
He brought you into his mother's tomb for three whole days.

178
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,940
He seems to be deeply in love with you.

179
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,784
This conversation we are having, don't you think it's strange?

180
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:17,161
I can forget what you two did together.

181
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:20,355
I care not about what the others say.

182
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:23,559
Reputation is just a show for strangers.

183
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,149
Besides, everyone can be a topic for gossip.

184
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,988
But there is something you must remember.

185
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:35,420
From now on, you are the wife of General Fu of Northern Lin.

186
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,280
No matter how much you like someone, you must tell no one.

187
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,070
Did you forget?

188
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:45,700
This marriage is just a deal you brokered with Western Qi.

189
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,509
Whatever the motive is, a marriage is no child's play.

190
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,162
Since you are married to me,

191
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:55,199
from now on, each and every action of yours...

192
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,543
no matter how humiliating it is to me,

193
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,915
must not be humiliating to you.

194
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:01,485
What do you mean?

195
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:03,442
You saw it at the tomb today.

196
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,839
I may be the General of Defense,

197
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,552
I may have achieved great feats for this nation,

198
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,159
but at the most crucial moments,

199
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,354
Prince Li's words weigh more than mine.

200
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:18,404
I do want to protect you and save you, but I cannot do it all the time.

201
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,660
Even under such circumstances,

202
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,074
I will do my best to keep you safe.

203
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:37,025
You might not even believe this, but when I married you,

204
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:41,230
it was not just because you are the Princess of Qi.

205
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,550
When we first met, you could understand the song I wrote.

206
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,199
At that moment,

207
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,433
I felt like you were the only person in this world...

208
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,727
that understood the shackles in my heart.

209
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:55,330
After all this time, I am used to giving up and sacrifices.

210
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,194
But for once,

211
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,041
there is something that I want.

212
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,240
I am flattered, General Fu.

213
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:07,080
That was just some nonsense I told that day.

214
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,641
How could I possibly understand your thoughts?

215
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,000
That will never be a reality.

216
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,800
It's not that you couldn't, it's just that you won't.

217
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,399
Rong Le,

218
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,368
you see me as an enemy.

219
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,322
That's only because...

220
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:28,606
we planned your future without asking for your thoughts.

221
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:32,057
You felt like you were tricked and disrespected.

222
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:34,434
Isn't that true?

223
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,860
You and my brother were planning this for years.

224
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,279
You knew who I was and you pretended like you knew nothing.

225
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,390
I played right into your hands.

226
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,405
I hope you take my words for it.

227
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,128
I will treat you well.

228
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:47,889
Treat me well?

229
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:49,218
Then you should get a divorce.

230
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:52,073
- Not now.
- When?

231
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,643
A year later.

232
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:03,540
A year? The same excuse again.

233
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,079
Who knows what kind of scheme you and my brother will have?

234
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,760
I don't wish to achieve anything.

235
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,584
I simply want to have a chance at you.

236
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:16,440
A year-long plan and you claim it's for me?

237
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,100
If this were six months ago, I might have bought it.

238
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,191
But when you said it just now, it's simply felt ridiculous.

239
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,684
It doesn't matter whether you believe me or not.

240
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:32,899
All I want to know... is what you need.

241
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:35,100
I hereby give you my word.

242
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,079
I will respect your decision.

243
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,801
I won't demand anything unacceptable.

244
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:43,698
Not until you are willing to become my real wife.

245
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:46,006
That day will never come.

246
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,275
If a year has passed...

247
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,310
and you still refuse to accept me,

248
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,340
I will end this marriage.

249
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,091
You will be freed.

250
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:10,015
You have my word for it.

251
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,500
♫ We've thrown away fate that we'd received by chance ♫

252
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,850
♫ I have to admit to my mistakes ♫

253
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,110
♫ I regret one mistake that I made so much ♫

254
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,990
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

255
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,580
Rest well.

256
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,060
♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

257
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,390
♫ You are behind me ♫

258
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,720
♫ Mocking the promise that I made for you ♫

259
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,950
♫ I must give all I have ♫

260
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:56,750
♫ To accept the lies of affection ♫

261
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,060
When did you find out she was the Princess of Western Qi?

262
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,540
I only found out on the day of their wedding.

263
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,839
You spent so much time with her and you didn't notice it?

264
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,577
And you said you are good with riddles.

265
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:09,500
Why didn't you see this coming?

266
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,239
It was all your fault.

267
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,199
You always said the sight of her terrifies you.

268
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,652
I wouldn't dare to get any closer to her.

269
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:18,740
She was so nice to me.

270
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,420
Whatever the reason is, I shouldn't suspect her.

271
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,781
Look at how it ends.

272
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:26,472
The princess you like broke my brother's heart.

273
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,249
I don't even know who I should side with now.

274
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:35,680
Right now, Brother Wuyou must be very upset.

275
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,479
He locked himself up in the tomb for days.

276
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,689
I wonder how he is holding up.

277
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,100
Why don't we pay him a visit?

278
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,770
Don't talk to him about the princess or Miss Man Yao.

279
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,191
Tell him about the recent good news.

280
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:55,358
Try to cheer him up.

281
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,495
Prince Chen.

282
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,067
Captain Xiang, how may I help you?

283
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,529
Your Highness, someone made a report that a few days ago,

284
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,580
you allowed your men to commit a heinous crime to search for a girl.

285
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,072
A dozen of lives were lost.

286
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,420
His Majesty is now furious.

287
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,582
I was sent here to bring you in for investigation.

288
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,763
How is this possible?

289
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:19,808
Wuyu is afraid of everything, he would never do that.

290
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,049
I need to inform Brother Wuyou.

291
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,489
It's fine, calm down.

292
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,415
I know the Supreme Court well enough.

293
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,784
It'll be okay. They just have some questions.

294
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:32,745
My father will never wrong me.

295
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:37,033
As for you, stay here and wait for me.

296
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,799
Remember, do not bother Wuyou with this.

297
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,592
Okay, it's all right. I am going now.

298
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:11,128
If a year has passed...

299
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:13,458
and you still refuse to accept me,

300
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,668
I will end this marriage.

301
00:25:15,668 --> 00:25:17,460
You will be freed.

302
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,338
You have my word for it.

303
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,056
Princess?

304
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,057
Princess, what's wrong?

305
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,910
Princess?

306
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,391
You can let it all out if you want.

307
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,377
Brother Wuyou! Bad news!

308
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,220
Wuyu is...

309
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,264
Brother Wuyou, look at yourself.

310
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:04,079
Lady Yun won't rest in peace if she sees you like this.

311
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,453
Pull yourself together!

312
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:09,676
Wuyu needs you to save him.

313
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,489
While you were searching for Man Yao on the street,

314
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:19,780
Wuyu's men turned on him.

315
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,540
Someone made a report saying that he led his men in heinous crimes.

316
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,517
A dozen of lives were lost.

317
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:29,237
Wuyu has now been arrested by the Royal Guard.

318
00:27:29,237 --> 00:27:33,348
Brother Wuyou, you must save him.

319
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,722
Brother Wuyou? Brother Wuyou?

320
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,307
Let's go.

321
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,380
[Qianlin Palace]

322
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,819
At your service, Your Majesty.

323
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,958
You finally decided to come out.

324
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:53,500
Look at what you have become.

325
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,394
I have heard about Prince Chen's arrest.

326
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:58,464
I gave the order to search for the girl.

327
00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:01,152
Prince Chen was just following orders.

328
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:02,628
The men caused troubles.

329
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:05,279
Whatever the reasons are, they are still my men.

330
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,198
Prince Chen is innocent.

331
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,702
Take a good look at this!

332
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:12,976
More than ten people were killed!

333
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:17,075
You wreaked havoc to the city for one peasant girl!

334
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,892
And you made it sound so lightly...

335
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,471
and admit it without hesitation.

336
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:25,224
I bet you think I won't punish you. Isn't that right?

337
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:26,979
For the commotion my men caused,

338
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,731
I will take full responsibility.

339
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:33,218
I will see to it that all the involved families are relocated.

340
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:34,561
You...

341
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,079
Your Majesty, the real culprit is yet to be found.

342
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,900
We don't know the truth for sure.

343
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,509
Even if Prince Li made an error in his line of duty,

344
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,377
he takes the initiative help the victims' families.

345
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:51,125
That calls for consideration for leniency.

346
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,660
Never mind.

347
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,714
I, Zongzheng Wuyou, will give up all my titles and be exiled.

348
00:29:56,714 --> 00:30:00,005
Together with Wuyu, I hand in my resignation.

349
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,570
Since you are determined to leave the capital,

350
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,183
you will have my permission.

351
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,775
Your title as the prince has been removed.

352
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:13,740
With the name as the son of the emperor,

353
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,040
you will be sent to the south to manage the land there.

354
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:21,463
Your Majesty.

355
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:23,167
Your Majesty loves Prince Li deeply...

356
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:26,387
and can't bear to see Prince Li and Prince Chen suffer.

357
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:28,540
But lives were lost.

358
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,220
It's not something that can be made up with titles.

359
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,058
Your Majesty, how do we explain this to the people?

360
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:37,620
The princes broke the law.

361
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,760
They must be punished like other citizens.

362
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,140
Sir Yang,

363
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,045
His Highness saw you as his right-hand man.

364
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,825
How could you turn your back on him?

365
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,500
Sir Yang has compassion for the people.

366
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,514
You obey the laws to your heart.

367
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:54,380
I respect that.

368
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:56,872
In that case,

369
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,399
Prince Li won't receive a death sentence.

370
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,951
But he must be punished.

371
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,759
Fifty beatings to him.

372
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,084
Go on.

373
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,219
Your Majesty, the campaign against Wei will be launched soon.

374
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,020
Managing both the nation's and military affairs might be too tiring.

375
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,220
Your Majesty once ordered Prince Li to aid you in the affairs.

376
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,580
Now that Prince Li is stripped of his ranks and titles,

377
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,900
and there are many works to be done,

378
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,159
I wonder which of the princes will be able to aid Your Majesty?

379
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:47,839
The other princes are still too young.

380
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,980
They are not interested in national affairs.

381
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,221
- And the Crown Prince is...
- Your Majesty.

382
00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:55,472
I understand Your Majesty's concern.

383
00:31:55,472 --> 00:31:59,780
However, the Crown Prince is still under house arrest.

384
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,368
He had his time to reflect.

385
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:05,863
From now on, he is freed from house arrest.

386
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:07,726
He must return and assist me.

387
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,291
Yes.

388
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,400
Your Majesty, I have a request to make.

389
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,242
Officer Sun, what is it?

390
00:32:19,243 --> 00:32:22,464
The autumn is upon us, the weather has gone cold.

391
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:25,962
My health is not as well as it should be.

392
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:27,802
I am too old for the work, too.

393
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:31,980
I am willing to follow Prince Li to the south and assist him...

394
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,040
and at the same time return to Qingzhou for retirement.

395
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,285
You are willing to assist Wuyou.

396
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:39,200
I am grateful for that.

397
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,592
Permission granted.

398
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:43,610
I appreciate the consideration.

399
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,465
General Fu.

400
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,639
His Majesty gave the order.

401
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,843
I must go to the royal study for discussion.

402
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,844
Congratulations, Your Highness.

403
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:25,168
General Fu, likewise.

404
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:27,700
I thank you for the help.

405
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,027
I have both the lady and power that I wanted.

406
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:34,663
That mere peasant that has nothing...

407
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:37,400
has no means to cause us any troubles.

408
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,078
This city is finally rid of that cursed Zongzheng Wuyou.

409
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:56,760
Northern Lin will be mine!

410
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,881
Congratulations, Your Highness.

411
00:34:03,881 --> 00:34:05,860
Your goal has been realized.

412
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,568
Xiang, come over here.

413
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:19,814
What do you need?

414
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:21,375
I will give it to you.

415
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,006
How about the title of Fair Consort of Crown Prince?

416
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:31,580
Your Highness, I am just a commoner.

417
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,759
I have no place in the palace.

418
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,610
I dare not ask for any title.

419
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:38,087
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

420
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:39,571
What do you want then?

421
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:41,200
You can let me know.

422
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,099
My birthday is two weeks from now.

423
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,612
Will Your Highness invite some of those officers you are close to?

424
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:51,990
Why would you want to invite them?

425
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,300
I may not have a title,

426
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,360
but I want the world to know that...

427
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,993
I am already yours.

428
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,610
Even if I am a present from General Fu,

429
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:07,378
when I see him again,

430
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:11,259
I don't wish him to see me as a mere songstress.

431
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:15,419
I want to be Your Highness' treasure.

432
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:18,480
Good. You have my word.

433
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,199
You will live a decent life.

434
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,764
No one will ever look down on you again.

435
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,586
What is going on? I don't know.

436
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:42,300
Hurry up.

437
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,779
Father, are we leaving for somewhere far away?

438
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:52,780
Yes, we are going back to Qingzhou.

439
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,155
We will probably stay there for some time.

440
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,724
Come on.

441
00:35:57,429 --> 00:36:01,344
Is this part of your work in the Imperial Court?

442
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,250
You may go now.

443
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,800
Yes.

444
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:13,466
You need not worry. This is a good news.

445
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,453
I requested to be sent there.

446
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,357
Father, are you retiring from your career as an officer?

447
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:26,336
You are returning to our hometown for retirement?

448
00:36:26,336 --> 00:36:28,499
Congratulations, Father.

449
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:31,980
Why didn't you think about your life?

450
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,475
By good news...

451
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:36,764
I actually meant your marriage.

452
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:41,463
Please, don't make fun of me.

453
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:44,810
I would never arrange your marriage lightly.

454
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,832
I remember the fortune teller once said...

455
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,580
you are destined to live like a phoenix.

456
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,066
You stand out in the crowd.

457
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:55,420
The husband I am picking for you is none other than Prince Li.

458
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,028
He is the man above all.

459
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:59,983
The prideful son of Heaven.

460
00:36:59,983 --> 00:37:03,130
Father, the engagement of Prince Li and Princess Rong Le...

461
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,368
made a great wave throughout the land.

462
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:09,539
I may be living in the inner manor, but I have heard about it, too.

463
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:12,020
- Come on.
- Father!

464
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,447
You need not be worried about Prince Li's future.

465
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:18,020
He was only acting on impulse with the engagement.

466
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,539
He won't make the same mistake again.

467
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,819
I could tell earlier that His Majesty is still not impressed by the Crown Prince's behavior.

468
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:26,629
His Majesty punished Prince Li as a reminder.

469
00:37:26,629 --> 00:37:28,980
It's for his own good.

470
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,720
Prince Li will go on an ordeal in the south.

471
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,079
Soon enough, His Majesty will find an excuse to summon him back here.

472
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,011
Father, I am worried that Prince Li is already in love with someone.

473
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,783
He will never marry me.

474
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:44,460
It doesn't matter.

475
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,060
He requested to be exiled to the south.

476
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,962
It means he wants to severe the past.

477
00:37:49,962 --> 00:37:52,541
With influence of the Sun family in Qingzhou,

478
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,080
and the time you will be spending with him,

479
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,739
you are almost certain to become his consort.

480
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:01,499
Father, I don't want it.

481
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:03,873
This is more than just about your marriage,

482
00:38:03,873 --> 00:38:07,114
it also concerns the honor of the Sun family.

483
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,899
Yu Shihai placed the wrong bet.

484
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:13,975
His family failed after three generations.

485
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:17,649
I don't want to witness the Sun family fail in my hands.

486
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:20,783
Get up. As the daughter of the Sun family,

487
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:24,427
this is the only time you can forget yourself.

488
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:36,059
Sixteen years ago, His Highness lost the protection from his mother's family.

489
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:40,059
I took the risk of being killed like Qin Yong and became his teacher.

490
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:44,465
It was a wager. What if he does become the emperor?

491
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:47,733
He will repay us with a thousand times more.

492
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:52,579
Once you have married him, you can use your family name to gain his trust.

493
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:54,997
This isn't hard on you.

494
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,470
Send this to Qingzhou.

495
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,210
When they see this, they will know what to do.

496
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,465
Prince Li, Zongzheng Wuyou, has been exiled to the south.

497
00:39:07,465 --> 00:39:11,199
Naturally, we need to prepare a warm welcome.

498
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,194
Yes, consider it done.

499
00:39:14,194 --> 00:39:15,810
How are the matters in the manor?

500
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,766
Everything is set for the princess.

501
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:19,579
My men are keeping watch on her.

502
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:22,090
She keeps herself in the Tranquil Garden.

503
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,084
She won't find out about anything.

504
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:27,067
Take good care of her.

505
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,057
General, Central Secretary Sun sent a letter for you.

506
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:36,187
- Dismissed.
- Yes.

507
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,916
Sun Jizhou. Isn't he leaving for Qingzhou?

508
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,314
I never got the chance for a proper farewell since we met in the south.

509
00:39:50,314 --> 00:39:52,029
It's time for my leaving again.

510
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:53,340
This is urgent.

511
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,877
Can we meet in the Flying Swan Tavern?

512
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:59,006
If this is about something urgent,

513
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:01,947
he should be inviting me to his manor instead.

514
00:40:01,947 --> 00:40:05,586
Why would he want to meet in a place with a crowd?

515
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:09,940
Something is at miss. Maybe it's best to turn him down.

516
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,716
No bother.

517
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:16,428
I want to see just what Sun Jizhou is up to this time.

518
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,377
Miss Sun?

519
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,700
I hope you are not offended.

520
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,899
I invited you here in the name of my father.

521
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:32,642
I was being presumptuous. I apologize for that.

522
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,720
Please, come in.

523
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,137
Why do you invite me here, Miss Sun?

524
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:44,100
If this is something within my capability,

525
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,820
I am willing to give you a hand.

526
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,437
Please have a seat and hear me out.

527
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,955
Please.

528
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,970
I have been thinking about this.

529
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,035
I had to ask for your help.

530
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,511
Thank you.

531
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:22,384
I don't want to follow my father to Qingzhou.

532
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:25,034
I wish to stay by your side.

533
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,583
What you said... is not something I would draw any conclusion on.

534
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,820
I have been admiring you for a long time.

535
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,480
Ever since we met in the south,

536
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,845
I have been having dreams...

537
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:50,560
about how astounding you are.

538
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,610
You must have had too many drinks.

539
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,190
It's the wine talking.

540
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,579
Let's pretend I didn't hear a word.

541
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,392
No, my mind is clear as day.

542
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,479
I may have been raised in the inner manor,

543
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:09,998
but I have great respect for the heroes.

544
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:12,499
Since the moment I saw you,

545
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:15,529
I have waited for a day when my dreams can come true.

546
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,279
All I ever do... is to look at you from distance.

547
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:34,640
Every month, I will sew one of these fragrance pouches.

548
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,114
I could only hide my thoughts inside these needleworks.

549
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:42,454
- Miss Sun.
- Please, hear me out.

550
00:42:42,454 --> 00:42:47,400
I am afraid if I don't speak now, I will never muster the courage again.

551
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,290
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

552
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:02,890
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

553
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:09,850
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

554
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:16,760
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

555
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,660
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

556
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:29,640
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

557
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:36,630
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

558
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:42,860
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

559
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:53,690
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

560
00:43:53,690 --> 00:44:00,230
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

561
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:06,530
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

562
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:14,010
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

563
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:30,200
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

564
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:36,950
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

565
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:43,190
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

566
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:50,430
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

567
00:44:50,430 --> 00:45:01,090
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
