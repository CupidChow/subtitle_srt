00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,634
[Episode 20]

2
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:40,575
Long live the emperor!

3
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,291
Please rise.

4
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,821
Thank you, Your Majesty!

5
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,977
General Fu, I have something to ask you.

6
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:54,420
Go ahead, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,740
I've received the letter of credence from Western Qi.

8
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,639
They have given another excuse to not join us in the war against Wei.

9
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,079
This alliance is nothing but a shell.

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,079
I'm really worried about it.

11
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,416
You have been married to the princess of Western Qi for half a year already.

12
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,750
Have you heard anything about it?

13
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:13,392
Your Majesty, my wife is just a woman.

14
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:15,780
She wouldn't know anything about national affairs.

15
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,499
And I'm an official of Northern Lin.

16
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:21,098
It's impossible that I'd have private contact with Western Qi.

17
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:24,768
I think that Western Qi is going back on their words...

18
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,562
because they know that we are impatient to go into war against Wei.

19
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,516
And our nation is in civil strife.

20
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:33,256
So, they are acting haughty just to gain an upper hand on us.

21
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:36,832
I think you have underestimated Western Qi.

22
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,819
Just like last time... when you had underestimated the condition on the southern border.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,159
Please punish me for my incompetence.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,839
No need to take this to heart.

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,838
But regardless of Western Qi's plan,

26
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,759
we won't delay our declaration of war against Wei.

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,996
I have been planning this for quite a while with the crown prince.

28
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:02,195
I can prepare a draft on the strategies for Your Majesty to go through.

29
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:03,876
No need.

30
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:05,888
My seventh son, Zongzheng Wuyou...

31
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,119
has contributed to putting down the rebellion on the southern border.

32
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,739
I've decided to reconfer the title as Prince Li upon him.

33
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,439
I'll summon him back to the capital...

34
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,100
to discuss the war strategies against Wei.

35
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:23,980
Your Majesty.

36
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,119
Lord Wuyou is adored by all on the southern border.

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,599
Everybody knows about his statecraft and military achievements.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,407
I think that he's a born commander.

39
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:32,919
If he leads this war against Wei,

40
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,879
I'm sure that Northern Lin can come out as the victor.

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,519
Xuan Ming, go to Qingzhou to announce my decree.

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,717
Don't tell him about the war against Wei yet.

43
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:43,942
Just say that I'm going to reconfer the title as Prince Li upon him.

44
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:46,399
So, I'm summoning him to come back to receive his title.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,240
What? Zongzheng Wuyou is going to come back?

47
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,679
I've already advised you to tone it down.

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,060
But you never listen to me.

49
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,964
Whenever you did something, you'd remind His Majesty about him.

50
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:10,041
If Wuyou comes back to the capital, your place will be threatened.

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,591
No.

52
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,230
Your Highness, it looks like it's best if I leave the palace now.

53
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,330
Please send me away from the palace.

54
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,823
Send you away from the palace?

55
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:25,678
In this life, I will never send you away from the palace.

56
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:28,382
Zongzheng Wuyou is coming back to the capital.

57
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,240
General Fu.

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,399
It looks like there's no way for me to turn back now.

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,319
It's either him or me.

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,930
Please don't act recklessly.

61
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,039
If something happens to Zongzheng Wuyou,

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,702
they'll first implicate you to it and you'll be the primary suspect.

63
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,445
It'll just be a suspicion.

64
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,906
Without proof, nobody will dare accuse me.

65
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:51,167
- I strongly suggest you...
- General Fu.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,140
You may leave now.

67
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,944
No need to worry about this.

68
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,392
Xiang, pour me some wine.

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,983
I'll take my leave now.

70
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
Please calm down.

71
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,639
General Fu is being too cautious.

72
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,244
Actually, it's quite an easy feat to murder someone in Qingzhou.

73
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:43,279
As the crown prince, you should be decisive.

74
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,679
That is what I like about you.

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,679
You are straightforward.

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,740
And you never doubt yourself.

77
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,000
Xiang,

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,333
you are really an understanding person.

79
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:05,215
How could I bear it to send you away from the palace?

80
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:09,845
Zongzheng Wuyou.

81
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,740
General Fu?

82
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm here today because...

83
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,118
I want to talk to you.

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,060
I'm feeling...

85
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,520
doubly depressed today.

86
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,559
So, I would like to spend some time with you.

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,288
Are you willing to accompany me?

88
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,532
I don't drink.

89
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,479
It's been so long since I last drank like this.

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,780
This wine... is so sweet.

91
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,980
Tell me.

92
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,334
What is the purpose of us living in this world?

93
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,119
As the general of Northern Lin,

94
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,006
I've risked my life again and again...

95
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,745
on the battlefield for my country.

96
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:51,205
But in the end, not only was I scolded by His Majesty,

97
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,767
I was even scolded by that crown prince.

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,005
General Fu, are you all right?

99
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:05,416
Don't call me general.

100
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,516
I don't care about that title!

101
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,300
Wife,

102
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,596
as long as... you stay by my side,

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,751
I'll be willing to do anything.

104
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,160
Xiao Sha.

105
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,002
Princess Rong Le, I'll bring the general out immediately.

106
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:39,108
Rong Le. Rong Le.

107
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:41,413
Why are all of you so lenient towards him?

108
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:44,074
No matter what he does wrong,

109
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:46,380
all of you will forgive him in the end.

110
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,956
But why are you all so strict towards me?

111
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,028
General Fu, what are you talking about?

112
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:58,028
Yes. He's all high and mighty.

113
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,883
He can do as he pleases.

114
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,222
But I can only endure everything in silence.

115
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,727
General Fu is drunk.

116
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,223
You may stand guard outside.

117
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:17,873
- Princess Rong Le.
- I'll be fine.

118
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,850
Call me if you need help.

119
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,913
♫ I can't help but to ask after you ♫

120
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:37,033
Rong Le.

121
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,275
Am I that bad compared to him?

122
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,798
The things that he can do,

123
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:47,083
I can do them too.

124
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:51,599
♫ Finally, I've learned how to trust ♫

125
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,901
♫ But I've underestimated love and hate ♫

126
00:09:55,901 --> 00:10:00,467
♫ We've thrown away fate that we'd received by chance ♫

127
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,833
♫ I have to admit to my mistakes ♫

128
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:08,608
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

129
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,700
Mother.

130
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:15,201
Don't die, Mother.

131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:23,219
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

132
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,839
♫ This is the leniency that you've shown to me ♫

133
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,100
♫ We are not holding hands, but you are holding my heart ♫

134
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,557
♫ Although this might not be forever ♫

135
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,000
♫ I've locked you in my heart and I've locked you in my dreams ♫

136
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,700
♫ Blaming myself for falling in love with you ♫

137
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,559
The Creed of Vengeance. The crown prince must have sent them.

138
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,730
The things that I've asked you to do. Are they done?

139
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:02,631
Don't worry. Everything is on track.

140
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,580
It's time.

141
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,540
I was... drunk yesterday.

142
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,980
Did I do something rude to you?

143
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,380
Did I scare you away?

144
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,329
You were drunk yesterday. And you had spent the night here.

145
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,490
Nothing else happened.

146
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,860
This is a hangover soup.

147
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,740
What is it, General Fu?

148
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,354
You cooked this yourself, right?

149
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,514
Yes.

150
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:57,644
Ling Yue is not here. So, I have to cook it.

151
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:59,999
This hangover soup is really extraordinary.

152
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm wide awake... after taking just a sip.

153
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:19,520
I remember that... I joined... the army when I was 12.

154
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,061
I had to be on guard every day even when I slept.

155
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,748
All these years,

156
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,807
yesterday night...

157
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,514
was the only night that I had slept so soundlessly.

158
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:46,039
Wuyou, on my way here,

159
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,140
I noticed that the southern border has begun to recover.

160
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,871
Everybody is living in peace.

161
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,959
You've made a huge contribution.

162
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,334
You are too kind.

163
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,399
The southern border has always been a flourishing place.

164
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,797
But lately, many of the refugees keep rebelling...

165
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:03,319
even during the harvest season.

166
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,944
I think the reason behind it is something very complicated.

167
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:10,180
So, my original idea is to stay at the southern border.

168
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,559
But since you are here to summon me,

169
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,678
I'll have to go back to thank His Majesty first and decide after.

170
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:19,580
Wuyou, are you really going back?

171
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,618
Looks like Wuyu is impatient to go back already.

172
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:27,076
Looks like somebody is waiting for you in the capital city.

173
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,580
That's not true, Uncle.

174
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,382
I just miss all those pretty ladies in the capital.

175
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,879
Do you know how complicated the affairs are on the southern border?

176
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,854
I just want to visit and have fun in those public houses again.

177
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,049
Greetings, Prince Fan Yang.

178
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,932
Greetings, Your Highness.

179
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,839
Miss Sun, long time no see.

180
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,126
You've became even prettier.

181
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,050
You are too kind.

182
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,980
Yali.

183
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:01,668
Come and sit beside me.

184
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
It's warmer here.

185
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,694
I haven't seen you for so long.

186
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:22,698
Wuyou can even take care of others now.

187
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,263
Yali, we will be going back to the capital soon.

188
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:30,676
And I've kept my promise to you.

189
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,520
Get yourself ready to depart for the capital.

190
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,879
That's great.

191
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,143
Yali's grandmother's 70th birthday is approaching.

192
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:42,380
So, she has been asking her to go to the capital.

193
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,759
If you can together with her, I'll rest assured.

194
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,279
But there are many things that needed to be done on the southern border.

195
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,663
When you leave, there'll be more tasks for us.

196
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:55,839
So, I won't be joining you to go back to the capital.

197
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,825
I'll leave everything here to you then, Teacher.

198
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:01,010
All right, Your Highness.

199
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,366
Leng Yan, you have to pass this letter personally to Princess Zhao Yun.

200
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:14,045
I want her to be the first to know that I'm going to marry her once I'm back.

201
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:17,879
For this trip, I just need you to go back with me, Leng Yan.

202
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,359
I'll leave Agent Wu here to tie up the loose ends on the southern border.

203
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,436
Especially those wealthy and influenced clans.

204
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:25,159
We need to investigate them.

205
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,468
Yes, Your Highness. I understand.

206
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,839
Wuyou, you investigated other clans but left the Sun family untouched.

207
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,679
What are you thinking?

208
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,860
Although you are going to marry Sister Yali,

209
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,704
you are being too kind to your father-in-law.

210
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,260
What are you talking about?

211
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,909
Wuyou, before this, you said that you didn't want to go back to the capital.

212
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,639
Until now, only I know that...

213
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,123
you've decided to go back because you'd promised Sister Yali to do so.

214
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:52,319
Wuyou, have you ever thought about...

215
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,176
what you're going to do when you go back?

216
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,200
Nonsense.

217
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,079
Wuyou.

218
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,653
Don't you have any other thoughts about this trip to the capital?

219
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,244
For example, I want to go back to meet Zhao Yun.

220
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:09,550
Do you have anyone that you want to meet?

221
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,959
I want to go back because the assassins that came at me...

222
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,174
that day were from the Creed of Vengeance.

223
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,380
I need to go back to investigate...

224
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,559
to make sure that the crown prince stays put.

225
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,600
What? It's crown prince again?

226
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,975
[Eastern Suburb Inn]

227
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,156
Why didn't you tell me that the crown prince...

228
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:33,999
had sent someone to assassinate Wuyou?

229
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,230
I didn't know about it beforehand.

230
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,220
Crown prince had never mentioned it to me.

231
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,079
I don't care what your plan is, but remember your place.

232
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,275
Make sure to follow my orders.

233
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:44,936
Don't make your own decisions.

234
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:48,118
I've never forgotten about my mission.

235
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,697
But I'm afraid that you've forgotten about it.

236
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,278
I heard that you stayed the night...

237
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:57,802
in the princess's chamber a few days ago.

238
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:00,583
Now that you've gotten your woman,

239
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,460
I'm afraid that you've forgotten about your mission.

240
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,060
You're spying on me?

241
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,496
I grew up with you since young.

242
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,098
For your every flesh and blood...

243
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,239
and even for your scent,

244
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,700
I'll know it...

245
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,931
if there are any changes with them.

246
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,239
Hen Xiang, I'll repeat myself again.

247
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,535
The things that I do... have nothing to do with you.

248
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:36,625
If you act on your own again, I won't forgive you.

249
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,532
You should be very clear... about the things that I can do.

250
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,839
There can only be one survivor for every test.

251
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,980
Survival of the fittest.

252
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,840
You won.

253
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,661
I've known... since I first saw you when I was 10 that...

254
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:09,810
you'd be the strongest among us.

255
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,936
Your eyes are burning with fire.

256
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:17,724
You made the same choice like the one you made when you were 10.

257
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,327
Don't worry.

258
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,519
As long as I live,

259
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,640
I won't let you die.

260
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:20,099
I'm willing to do anything for you.

261
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,819
But do you really understand what I want?

262
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:25,768
We are so similar.

263
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:30,079
That's why I've made myself into your shadow.

264
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,404
How could you...

265
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,020
fall in love with somebody else so easily?

266
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,366
Mistress, ever since I found out that Hen Xiang was from Western Qi,

267
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:52,541
I've used all my connections to find out about her background to no avail.

268
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,308
People from House of Fragrance told me that...

269
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:57,452
she suddenly appeared half a year ago during that time.

270
00:22:57,452 --> 00:22:59,607
She had offered herself to become a dancer there.

271
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:03,224
After that, she became famous and she went to theGeneral's Manor to dance.

272
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:06,461
As for the rest, you already know about it.

273
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,706
Thank you for your hard work.

274
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:15,447
I don't think... we need to continue on this investigation.

275
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:18,140
I understand.

276
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,860
Actually, I've been to the manor a few times in the past half-year.

277
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,592
You're living a good life.

278
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:24,379
They say that ignorance is bliss.

279
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:29,019
I think that sometimes, it'll be better for us to know nothing.

280
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,597
Maybe I've been living too comfortably.

281
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:39,064
That's why I no longer wish to find out the truth.

282
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:42,199
I'm not sure if this is right or wrong.

283
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:45,054
And I'm afraid that the faux happiness I have...

284
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:47,095
will turn out to be a dream only.

285
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:51,511
Miss, no matter what decision you make, I'll support you.

286
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,445
But half a year ago, in this very place,

287
00:23:55,445 --> 00:24:00,539
you told me that you wouldn't be willing to live a life of lies and deception.

288
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,644
And you wouldn't hand yourself over to others easily.

289
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:07,231
I wonder if you still feel this way?

290
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:09,520
I don't know.

291
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,354
Actually, I'm just a normal person.

292
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:14,400
When I'm having a headache,

293
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,221
I'll still take those medicine that I had once doubted.

294
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:21,160
I took it just to reduce my sufferings.

295
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,560
Take our fate into our own hands?

296
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,011
Easy to say... but difficult to carry out.

297
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:30,885
Miss, don't give up easily.

298
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:35,480
If you really believe in General Fu, try to accept him.

299
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,315
If you still want that book and you want to choose an unknown path,

300
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:42,408
I'll go with you too.

301
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,680
Chen Yu...

302
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,309
Thank you.

303
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,384
Your Majesty, I've done as you asked...

304
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:57,414
and have conveyed your message to Lord Wuyou...

305
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,299
regarding his title as Prince Li.

306
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:02,138
After he settles everything at the southern border, he'll reach here...

307
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:04,699
in approximately five days' time, including his travel time.

308
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:09,360
Good. I have something that I need him to do for me.

309
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,646
Western Qi is a treacherous bunch. They've gone back on their words.

310
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:15,772
But we can't delay the war against Wei anymore.

311
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:19,457
So, I've decided to form an alliance with Chen.

312
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:21,195
Chen has an impressive army.

313
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:24,079
If we have them, we won't be needing Western Qi anymore.

314
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,185
We can go into war with the help of Chen.

315
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:31,356
- How is that possible?
- We have never worked with Chen.

316
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:33,539
No need to be so anxious.

317
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,739
In order to make sure that this alliance stands,

318
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:39,700
I've already sent a secret messenger to Chen to discuss it.

319
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,374
Although there's dissension among us, the brother of the Emperor of Chen,

320
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:46,948
Prince Zhenbei who holds the real power greatly supports this idea.

321
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:49,900
He's already on his way here.

322
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,836
Your Majesty, this is too sudden.

323
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,739
The Board of Rites knows nothing about their conditions.

324
00:25:56,739 --> 00:26:00,259
Please instruct us on how to fulfil their conditions.

325
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,514
Western Qi and Chen are different.

326
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:06,779
Western Qi is weak. They offered their country's princess and food supplies to us.

327
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,919
It's because they wish to use our name as a deterrent for other countries.

328
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,101
Chen is poor but they have a strong army.

329
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:18,079
Prince Zhenbei will be here this time to choose a princess of ours for himself.

330
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,839
And the dowry will include tools, appliances, money, and other valuables...

331
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,278
in exchange for their soldiers.

332
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,338
They'll join us in the war against Wei.

333
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,020
Your Majesty, I think we should discuss this more.

334
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,461
I've already made up my mind.

335
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:41,120
We'll discuss it again when Prince Li is here.

336
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,660
Emperor of Qi is too impatient.

337
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,235
Because of the failure of this alliance,

338
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,479
His Majesty has lost his trust in me.

339
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,761
That's why he's set on breaking off the alliance with Western Qi.

340
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:01,021
You have acted rashly by coming here.

341
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:04,919
Are you trying to push me into the abyss?

342
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,738
General Fu, His Majesty has asked me to tell you this.

343
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:10,269
He clearly knows about your plan.

344
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:14,859
If you still want your revenge

345
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:17,659
you have to obey him.

346
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:20,322
If you are not willing to help Western Qi,

347
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:24,318
we can't promise that we won't show the crimes that you've committed

348
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:26,773
to the Emperor of Northern Lin.

349
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,481
Are you threatening me?

350
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,404
I don't dare to. I'm just asking you to reconsider carefully.

351
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:36,629
What does the Emperor of Qi want?

352
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:37,761
It's simple.

353
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:42,079
Before Ning Qianyi, Prince Zhenbei of Chen reaches here, kill him off.

354
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,772
Chen is already doubtful about this alliance.

355
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:47,099
As soon as Prince Zhenbei who supports this alliance is dead,

356
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,443
Chen will be plunged into civil strife.

357
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:53,400
Ask him to wait for my news.

358
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,979
Master, Rong Qi is not to be trusted.

359
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,619
Do we really have to do that?

360
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,344
I won't be their string puppet.

361
00:28:12,502 --> 00:28:14,899
We have to proceed with our plans as soon as possible.

362
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:17,325
We just need an opportunity.

363
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:20,862
As soon as the war against Wei starts, this nation will be in chaos.

364
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:23,081
And it'll be the best time for you to take over this country.

365
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,059
So, not only can you not murder Ning Qianyi,

366
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,059
you have to make sure that he reaches here safely.

367
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,747
We have to make this alliance work for the war to start soon.

368
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:31,859
You've heard it just now.

369
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,540
The people of Western Qi... are threatening me.

370
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,118
I believe that you can think of a way to satisfy both parties.

371
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,519
You can protect Prince Zhenbei and silence Western Qi at the same time.

372
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,696
But you can't bear to do it.

373
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,419
Actually, you've already known that it's my only choice.

374
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,219
That's why you are here to remind me.

375
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,580
Yes.

376
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,400
I've always known you best.

377
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,703
Is something troubling you?

378
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:19,844
It's nothing. Don't think too much.

379
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,460
Why would I think too much?

380
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,820
By saying so, you've already given yourself away.

381
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,195
You are indeed troubled by something.

382
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,143
Can I stay here tonight?

383
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,948
Don't worry, I won't disturb you.

384
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,680
I can just sleep on the couch.

385
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,279
This manor was once a cold and frigid place.

386
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,902
I have neither family nor friends.

387
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:04,320
Every time during the festive season,

388
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,899
I'll only dream about...

389
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:10,919
mountain of swords, sea of flames, and the gruesome battlefield.

390
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,013
Mistress, don't give up easily.

391
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:18,259
If you really believe in General Fu, try to accept him.

392
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:25,201
Do as you please.

393
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,076
Are still awake because I'm here and you're worried?

394
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,037
Since we can't sleep,

395
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,925
let's have a talk.

396
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,951
What do you want to know?

397
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,529
Just go ahead and ask me.

398
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:28,110
I want to know everything about you.

399
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,800
I know too little about you.

400
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,686
I think you know everything about me.

401
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,721
I'm sure that the Western Qi has told you a lot about me.

402
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:42,552
Everything else about me is quite normal.

403
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,516
Nothing interesting for you to know.

404
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,340
Look at you.

405
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,459
You are always like this.

406
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:52,722
Your words and your expression...

407
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,431
have put so much distance between us.

408
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,620
Rong Le, what can I do...

409
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,724
to make you open your heart,

410
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,400
to lower your guard and to let me in?

411
00:32:10,547 --> 00:32:14,482
Isn't it good between us right now?

412
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,921
- Why do you...
- When I'm with you, I'm not a general.

413
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,100
I am your husband.

414
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,208
I'm your husband... who will help you and protect you forever.

415
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,518
From now on,

416
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,200
can you address me as your husband...

417
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,820
or by my name?

418
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,666
I've known you for so long.

419
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,912
I've already gotten used to this form of address.

420
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:42,439
It's hard for me to change it suddenly.

421
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,339
You can cultivate a habit.

422
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,635
You'll get used to it after you say it a few times.

423
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,426
I've forgotten about...

424
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,566
when the last time someone used my name was.

425
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,014
Why does it matter if someone uses your name or not...

426
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,283
or how they address you?

427
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,820
Why is it you never see me...

428
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,379
even though I'm standing right in front of you?

429
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:25,719
You remembere that we've known each other for more than a year.

430
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:28,510
But why do I feel like...

431
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,860
in your eyes, I'm just another stranger?

432
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,100
General Fu, so what if I can see you?

433
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,841
What can it prove?

434
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:41,037
I don't trust my eyes.

435
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:45,189
So, don't waste your effort, General Fu.

436
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,510
If you can't see with your eyes,

437
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,321
then see with your heart.

438
00:33:52,012 --> 00:33:55,432
Try to look at me with your heart.

439
00:33:58,061 --> 00:33:59,700
Can you do that?

440
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,820
I'm sorry.

441
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,765
My heart sees nothing.

442
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:12,660
It's better if you look inside yourself first.

443
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,675
Isn't it good between us right now?

444
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,201
We accompany each other and become each other's family.

445
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:30,900
If we want to keep our secret to ourselves, it's fine.

446
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:36,400
And if we wish to tell each other our secrets one day, we'll do it then.

447
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,840
So, you are still not willing to tell me today, right?

448
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,719
General Fu, I'm trying to tell you that...

449
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,920
although I've been hurt,

450
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,540
I hope that one day,

451
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,022
I can be true to the people who are true to me.

452
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,220
Can you let go of me now?

453
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,000
Rest well.

454
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,160
If you're unhappy because of what I said today,

455
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,660
how about you take a stroll at Qingliang Lake tomorrow?

456
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,740
Spring is almost upon us.

457
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,890
The scenery at that place is fantastic.

458
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:54,060
All right.

459
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,609
General Fu, you are looking for me?

460
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,620
General Fu.

461
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,300
Has Lady Rong Le gone out?

462
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,859
She's about to leave. The carriage is ready.

463
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:08,020
Bring more men.

464
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,019
Nothing can go wrong.

465
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,952
Make sure that Lady Rong Le is safe.

466
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:13,553
Yes, General Fu.

467
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,220
Remember to go according to the plan.

468
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,880
- Yes, General Fu.
- You may leave now.

469
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,860
Come out.

470
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,700
You've finally decided.

471
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,176
You've put so much effort into her for the past half-year.

472
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:47,819
If you don't use her well, it'll be a waste for such a good chess piece.

473
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:50,820
I thought that you'd really fallen in love with her.

474
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,840
It's not up to you to question my thinking.

475
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,983
This is my last warning for you.

476
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:04,737
You are now a wife of the crown prince.

477
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:08,120
Your mission is to keep an eye on the crown prince.

478
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,100
Not to spy on me.

479
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:12,324
Zongzheng Wuyou is coming back to Zhongshan soon.

480
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,919
Control your crown prince.

481
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,688
Don't let him act recklessly and make some idiotic moves.

482
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:18,540
Ask him to just do his part well.

483
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,200
Should anything happen, I'm sure that you know the consequences.

484
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,579
And... with your current identity,

485
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,260
it's best for you to stay away from my manor.

486
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,259
From now on, don't come and find me unless I order you to do so.

487
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,180
I understand.

488
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,880
Thank you for your reminder.

489
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,900
Go back.

490
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,001
Princess Rong Le, General Fu is so considerate of you.

491
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,461
He knows that you are bored in the manor.

492
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:41,427
So, he had you brought to such a quiet and refreshing place. That's so good.

493
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,878
Such a tranquil place is best for fishing.

494
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:48,030
Unfortunately, I didn't bring any fishing tools.

495
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,599
Princess Rong Le, I have the tools here. Come over here.

496
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,080
Princess Zhao Yun?

497
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,277
Greetings, Princess Zhao Yun.

498
00:39:58,277 --> 00:40:00,099
I have a complete set of tools here.

499
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:04,179
But I couldn't even get a fish after two hours.

500
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:05,795
It's that fishmonger's fault.

501
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:08,535
He has roped in all the fish.

502
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,499
Fishmonger, why are you pretending to sleep?

503
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:31,699
Do you really think that you're above us all?

504
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,739
No need to get angry over some fish.

505
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,406
You need to be calm if you want to fish.

506
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,522
You need to remain calm in all situations.

507
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:46,632
You've scared off all the fish with your temper.

508
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,099
I've been fishing here every day.

509
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,859
But I have never had such a good yield.

510
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:54,620
Thank you for sending all the fish my way.

511
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,359
In order to repay you, how about I give you all of my fish?

512
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,274
This is your catch. It has nothing to do with me.

513
00:41:09,274 --> 00:41:11,055
I can't take your fish just like that.

514
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:13,296
How about I buy them from you?

515
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,459
How about this?

516
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:22,627
We'll have a fishing competition. Winner will get the fish.

517
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,525
Princess Rong Le, we can't compete with him.

518
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,099
He'll win for sure.

519
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:32,027
It'll be so embarrassing when we lose.

520
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:34,828
Don't worry. I'll compete in your stead.

521
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:39,152
We'll do as you say then. Let's begin the challenge.

522
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:45,299
Prince Zhenbei of Chen has already reached Zhongshan.

523
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:47,739
He's now at the Qingliang Lake in the eastern suburb.

524
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,336
I've already sent someone to protect him in secret.

525
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,444
I heard that the Emperor of Chen...

526
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:55,019
adores and thinks highly of Prince Zhenbei.

527
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:57,419
He has high hope for the prince to become his successor.

528
00:41:57,419 --> 00:42:02,179
The alliance between us and Chen this time is very important.

529
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:04,580
If Western Qi knows about it,

530
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,449
they'll eye us like prey and try to sabotage us.

531
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:12,772
If anything untoward happens to Prince Zhenbei in Northern Lin,

532
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:15,109
the consequences would be disastrous.

533
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:18,240
Don't worry, Your Majesty. I understand.

534
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,180
I'll try my best to take care of Prince Zhenbei's safety.

535
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,628
You'd not done well with the southern border rebellion.

536
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:27,859
Prince Li has already taken care of it for you.

537
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:30,738
I'll overlook that matter.

538
00:42:30,738 --> 00:42:33,906
For this alliance between us and Chen,

539
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:37,219
if you do any mistakes again...

540
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:41,960
This time, I won't let you down.

541
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:50,810
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

542
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:56,450
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

543
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:03,320

544
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:10,210
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

545
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:17,040
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

546
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,850
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

547
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:30,060
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

548
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:36,540
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

549
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:47,090
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

550
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:53,760
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

551
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,000
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

552
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,530
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

553
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:23,630
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

554
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:30,420
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

555
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,610
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

556
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:43,740
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

557
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:53,810
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
