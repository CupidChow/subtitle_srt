00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,540
[Episode 6]

2
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,799
In order to save me, you had a fallout with the crown prince.

3
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,180
People might take it wrongly if words got out.

4
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,019
What they think is none of your concern.

5
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,560
But for me, you are...

6
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,720
a rare well-matched partner in chess.

7
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,080
I really enjoy playing chess with you.

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,360
I don't wish to be affected by common views.

9
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,500
Did you really save me... for the sake of chess only?

10
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,140
♫ You who came to a strange land to build our lands together ♫

11
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,179
♫ I think of you when night has fallen... ♫

12
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,899
♫ and when the fog has parted ♫

13
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,379
Your Highness, we have reached the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

14
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,280
♫ My yearning for you has turned you... ♫

15
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,580
Thank you, Your Highness. Farewell.

16
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,339
♫ You are my happiness, my worries and... ♫

17
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,280
♫ my abyss ♫

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,739
♫ I can't touch you for you are like... ♫

19
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,900
♫ the reflection in water ♫

20
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,859
♫ I don't want distance... ♫

21
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,619
- Leng Yan.
- Yes, Your Highness.

22
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,400
- Let's go back.
- Yes, Your Highness.

23
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,219
♫ I just want to watch you... ♫

24
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,300
♫ in this cold world ♫

25
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,299
I didn't manage to protect you. I have failed the emperor.

26
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,520
And I have failed you, too.

27
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,520
You did well in arranging the matters in the manor.

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,499
Ling Yue and Lian Xin have become smarter, too.

29
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,059
I should have gone back immediately.

30
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,419
But Long Yue has destroyed all the contraptions.

31
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,150
And I can't just use the front door.

32
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,740
Mistress.

33
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
Mistress.

34
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,739
Thank you for sacrificing yourself to save me.

35
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,519
It's my fault for not being meticulous enough... until I had caused you such disgrace.

36
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,779
If you need anything else from now on,

37
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,980
I'll put my life to it.

38
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,619
We are here in Northern Lin.

39
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,459
We should take care of each other and complete this mission.

40
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,780
I won't let you sacrifice yourself.

41
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,419
Thank you, Mistress.

42
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,099
How's Chen Yu?

43
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,699
She is still unconscious from being severely wounded.

44
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,979
Prince Chen has already sent someone over to treat her.

45
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,400
She can come when she's feeling better.

46
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,780
I'll leave this Moon Embrace Teahouse to you.

47
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,939
We can no longer use this place as our rendezvous point.

48
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,819
We need to find a new place immediately.

49
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,259
Yes. Don't worry, Mistress.

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,619
I already made the arrangement last night. We can get in touch...

51
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,880
with the kite and Western Qi soon.

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,379
But we can no longer use the original secret path.

53
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,139
Meanwhile, I hope that you can stay put...

54
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,620
while I look for another route for you.

55
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,439
For now, it's better if you go back to the manor at once... in case something else happens.

56
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,340
Arrival of Her Majesty!

57
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,940
Greetings, Mother.

58
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,699
It has already been two months.

59
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,620
Why isn't there any progress at all?

60
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,179
Don't be anxious, Mother.

61
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,259
- Recently, the kite...
- You can't be overcautious.

62
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,000
You need to give them a kick.

63
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

64
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,900
Your Majesty.

65
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,740
Your Majesty, drink the medicine.

66
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,360
You'll feel better after you take it.

67
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,320
Go out.

68
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,480
I am in good health.

69
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,880
No need to worry about me.

70
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,660
As for the rare book hunt,

71
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,960
put your safety before everything else.

72
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,000
There is no rush.

73
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,960
I feel relieved that you are doing well...

74
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,920
in Northern Lin.

75
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,720
Xiao Sha.

76
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,339
What do you need, Princess?

77
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,339
For the Eastern Suburb Inn and the man that saved me...

78
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,099
that I had asked you to investigate, have you found anything about them?

79
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,859
I already checked the inn.

80
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,379
It often has a lot of customers and it looks normal enough.

81
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,159
As for that man, I had asked the innkeeper. He did remember the man.

82
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,379
But that man left after staying for just a day.

83
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,360
And he didn't leave behind his name.

84
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,099
It might be because I was wounded that day.

85
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,659
That's why he had to find the nearest inn the treat my wounds.

86
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,540
I don't think it's necessary for you to repay his kindness.

87
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,600
In this world, this kind of meeting is a fate.

88
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,459
But there is something that I have been wanting to report to you after some considerations.

89
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,020
I think I know what it is.

90
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,900
Answer me first.

91
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,080
Did you touch the lock on this box?

92
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,499
That box contains the secret letters between you and the emperor.

93
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
And I have never touched it.

94
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,019
Usually, only you, me, Ling Yue, and Lian Xin...

95
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,259
can come into this room.

96
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,020
And you are the only one who knew what's inside.

97
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,980
But I believe you.

98
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,560
Are you going to report that there are spies in our midst?

99
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,800
How did you know?

100
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,259
By the way, where is the assassin that was knocked unconscious?

101
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,659
That day, after I changed and came out from the room,

102
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,299
I saw that the hiding spot for the assassin was not very secure.

103
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,579
I was afraid that he'd cause trouble if he woke.

104
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,739
That's why I and Lian Xin tied up his hands and legs...

105
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,299
and threw him into the firewood storeroom.

106
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,899
After that, we rushed to your side...

107
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,979
and we don't know what happened next.

108
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,280
That's right.

109
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,219
After Yu Wenjie barged into my manor,

110
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,459
I started to feel that something was not right.

111
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,459
How can two girls that grew up in a palace...

112
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,220
know how to deal with an assassin so cleanly and neatly?

113
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,579
And somebody had touched this lock.

114
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,380
I had laid down a trap when I designed this box.

115
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,860
That's right. Recently, I had found some problems as well.

116
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,979
- Princess Rong Le.
- Princess Zhao Yun!

117
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,360
Princess Rong Le.

118
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,819
I had read Princess Zhao Yun's pulse.

119
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,939
Her blood flow is blocked. I think someone pressed on her pressure point.

120
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,280
She didn't faint because of the drugging mist.

121
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,939
No one else can know about this. Keep a close eye out for these few days.

122
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,540
Yes, Princess.

123
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,459
Lately, the weather is very nice.

124
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,379
Everything is coming to life.

125
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,899
I'm old already.

126
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,499
I have to come out and take a walk more.

127
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,140
Luckily, I have you to accompany me.

128
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,059
It's my fortune to be able to accompany you.

129
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,120
Moreover, you are still young.

130
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,259
There are many troublesome things in this palace. Here, we grow old fast.

131
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,299
But under the spring sunlight, you look so lively.

132
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,300
It must be because something good has happened.

133
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,199
I heard from your father that... Wuyou has already promised...

134
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:12,520
to go flower viewing with you in the suburb in a few days' time.

135
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,499
Prince Chen is tagging along, too.

136
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,599
Both of them are very busy. So, we haven't set the date.

137
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:24,719
Actually, I'm already very happy that I can accompany you... to come out for a walk.

138
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,080
Look at you.

139
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,019
I heard that Princess Rong Le has recovered.

140
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,579
How about you pay her a visit in my stead and invite her along for your excursion?

141
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,699
We can use this chance... to matchmake her and Wuyu.

142
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,259
Prince Chen and Prince Li are very close.

143
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,379
If Princess Rong Le is willing to marry Prince Chen,

144
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,859
His Majesty will be glad to see that too.

145
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,540
All right.

146
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,059
You have good taste.

147
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,539
This hairpin is from the Western region. It's expertly carved in copper.

148
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,499
The carved flowers symbolize good fortune.

149
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,099
They said that Moon Embrace Teahouse has a mysterious Rare Item Chest chamber.

150
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,140
And it contains treasures from all over the world. I'll take this.

151
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,459
Welcome to the Rare Item Chest chamber, Miss.

152
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,019
We have high quality silks and satins here,

153
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,019
high-quality rouge in rose color...

154
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,339
and jade-wares that are expertly carved.

155
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,539
I'm not sure if you are willing to sell the things that I want.

156
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,139
What do you want?

157
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,299
I want the string of a soft-winged kite.

158
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,859
Soft wing can stand against the wind to rise up to the sky.

159
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,200
We have this in our collection as well.

160
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,100
Your Highness.

161
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,179
Unfortunately, our mistress has gone to the tea plantation to check on the source.

162
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,699
She will only be back after a few days.

163
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,619
Recently, I had come here three times.

164
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,720
But every time, I just happened to miss her.

165
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,699
Our mistress is very devoted to this teahouse.

166
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,899
I'm truly sorry, Your Highness.

167
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,779
How about I ask Miss Chen Yu to come and play a song for you?

168
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,780
No need. I'll just come again next time.

169
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,620
[Rare Item Chest]

170
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,659
Wuyou.

171
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,100
Our teacher is set on marrying her daughter, Yali to you.

172
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,859
Even the empress has supported that.

173
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,619
But you are still engaged to Western Qi's princess. What should we do?

174
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,339
What they want has nothing to do with me.

175
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,259
But Wuyou, you are in love with Miss Man Yao from Moon Embrace Teahouse, right?

176
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,059
Look at you. You should just admit to it.

177
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,779
You went to the teahouse again these few days, right?

178
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,820
But she's avoiding you. Actually, that's weird.

179
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,200
For a money-grubber business woman like her,

180
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,150
you are a money tree for her.

181
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,299
She's not a money-grubber.

182
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,979
Please tell me more.

183
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,800
The art of steeping is about patience and the state of mind.

184
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,419
If you are not a resolute person who is indifferent to worldly matters,

185
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,320
you can't capture the quintessence of the art of steeping.

186
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,919
I think the way to enjoy tea is not about the tea itself...

187
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,139
but the state of mind one has when one drinks tea.

188
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,220
How about you relax your mind and taste the tea in earnest?

189
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,539
A person like her cannot be a money-grubber.

190
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,299
She is not a person like that.

191
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,320
Why did she act like that then?

192
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,939
She is keeping you at arm's length.

193
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,360
Could it be that she's baiting you to attract your attention?

194
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,480
How can you make a hasty conclusion?

195
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,840
Look at you. You clearly like her.

196
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,300
Arrival of His Majesty!

197
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,360
Wuyu, recently, I haven't seen you much at the court.

198
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,179
You hang out at Prince Li Manor every day.

199
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,019
You learned nothing but bad habits from your brother.

200
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,419
That's not true.

201
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,619
Enough. Leave us.

202
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,620
I have something to discuss with your brother.

203
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,720
Yes, Father.

204
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,540
Wuyou.

205
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,859
I haven't seen you in a long time.

206
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,120
Ever since I last saw you at Yun's Tomb,

207
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,200
I have been thinking a lot.

208
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,019
If you really don't want to marry the Western Qi's princess,

209
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,580
I won't force you.

210
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,259
The empress told me that...

211
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,879
you had known Yali, the granddaughter of the Central Secretary since young.

212
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,499
This will be a good marriage, too.

213
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,160
I don't see how this is a good marriage arrangement.

214
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,739
Do you really like the granddaughter of the Sun family...

215
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,059
or just the power of the Sun family that takes root in three states of the southern region?

216
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,339
Wuyou, you should understand the troubles I took...

217
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,659
to give you those three states in the southern region.

218
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,360
Why do you have to fight with me every step of the way?

219
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,220
Somebody told me that you reject the idea of marriage alliance...

220
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,459
because lately, you had been spending your time with a businesswoman.

221
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,419
And you wrecked the prison of the Ministry of Justice because of her.

222
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,080
My choice has nothing to do with her.

223
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
As for why I refuse to marry the Western Qi's princess,

224
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,940
I think you know it better than anyone.

225
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,020
You hung the map in your reading room.

226
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,300
I can see that you are very clear about the situation of Northern Lin.

227
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,440
The crown prince's failure has affected the Northern Li.

228
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,460
We have lost hundreds and thousands of our soldiers.

229
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,399
In order to avenge them... and to get rid of this thorn in our side,

230
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:39,419
I have decided to band with Western Qi to battle Wei.

231
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,979
Do you really think that we lost that war because of the crown prince's mistake alone?

232
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,499
The people have to pay war tax every year and they are suffering.

233
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,420
Northern Lin is not in top condition anymore.

234
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,139
Even if I marry the Western Qi's princess or the daughter from a noble family,

235
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:58,540
it would do the country no good.

236
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,459
I had never lost in a battle before.

237
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,140
If I personally lead the army this time, we can defeat Wei for sure.

238
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,739
When the time comes, we can conquer the world.

239
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,379
We are not racing against the time to conquer the world.

240
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,540
If we begin another war now, you'll ruin our country.

241
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,360
For now, it's best to recuperate and wait until the country is strong again.

242
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,980
Shut up!

243
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,900
Until now,

244
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,760
you are still holding on to the fallacy of that traitor, Qin Yong.

245
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,360
His People-Based Transformation theory. What nonsense!

246
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,410
He killed your mother!

247
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,920
My teacher is not a traitor.

248
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,379
Since you don't dare to mention his name in front of others,

249
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,980
how dare you speak of my mother?

250
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,900
I know clearly who killed my mother.

251
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,750
And don't ever forget.

252
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,859
The reason Northern Lin can become so strong in such a short time...

253
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,160
is because of my teacher's People-Based Transformation theory.

254
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,360
Looks like you still haven't given up on it.

255
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,659
I don't take part in managing the country anymore.

256
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,679
Do I have to let you dictate my thinking and my beliefs, too?

257
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,700
Fine.

258
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Since you are like this,

259
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,379
I'll make a half-year deal with you too.

260
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,059
Within half a year,

261
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,179
if you can find the long lost rare book of the Qin family, "The Book of Mountains and Rivers,"

262
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,940
I'll allow you to restart your People-Based Transformation.

263
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,579
And I'll allow you to marry freely.

264
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,219
"The Book of Mountains and Rivers?"

265
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,040
Yes. You didn't forget about that book, right?

266
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,519
If you can't find it, you have to marry the princess of Western Qi.

267
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,980
And you have to help me take down Wei as well.

268
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,150
The book has been lost for so long.

269
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,590
It is not an easy thing to procure in the first place.

270
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,140
Moreover, even if I managed to find "The Book of Mountains and Rivers,"

271
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,280
you won't give an explanation to the world about my mother and teacher, right?

272
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,780
You!

273

[Princess Manor]

274
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,379
Other noblemen and women in the capital city treated me with venom.

275
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,380
Why are you willing to befriend me?

276
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,339
I feel very guilty for passing on my illness to you the last time.

277
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,499
That was just a false alarm. I'm so healthy that I recovered after a nap.

278
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:59,170
I remember that when I was bullied by others,

279
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,950
you were the only one who stepped out to help me.

280
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,520
Look at this. Is this flower pretty?

281
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,979
- You are prettier than the flower.
- Really?

282
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,760
Looks like both of you are having a good time.

283
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,320
Greetings, Princess Rong Le and Princess Zhao Yun.

284
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,419
I heard that Princess Manor is decorated with Western Qi's design.

285
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,859
Now that I see it today, it's really the work of craftsmanship.

286
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,960
You flattered me, Miss Sun. Take a seat.

287
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,860
Miss Sun, have you been to Western Qi?

288
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,359
I'm a home type of girl. Unlike you who traveled the world,

289
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,559
besides Zhongshan, I only ever traveled to the southern area every year during the Qingming festival.

290
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,259
Zhongshan is very beautiful. You should go out and walk around.

291
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,899
All right.

292
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,679
By the way, Prince Li and Prince Chen have invited me to go on an excursion in the suburb.

293
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,739
Are you willing to come along as well?

294
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,050
That's great.

295
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,230
Princess Rong Le, you are already engaged with Brother Wuyou.

296
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,059
You should get to know each other more and bond with each other.

297
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,979
Although Brother Wuyou looks fierce most of the time,

298
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,239
he's actually a righteous, bold, talented, intelligent, and sophisticated man.

299
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:14,460
He's the real hero.

300
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,859
I think that Prince Chen is younger, more energetic, and interesting.

301
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,739
He is an intriguing person.

302
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,059
In comparison, Prince Li is cold and hard to predict.

303
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,300
How did you become so close with him?

304
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,019
I stayed in the palace for a while when I was young.

305
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,059
He wasn't like this in the past.

306
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,939
He treated others kindly.

307
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,499
He still treats me kindly now.

308
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,060
A few days ago, he had helped me by teaching that elder son a lesson.

309
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,339
Princess Rong Le, don't be fooled by Wuyu.

310
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,219
That man is a sweet talker and he's insensible.

311
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,520
He has many fans in every corner of this city.

312
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,099
Princess Rong Le.

313
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,259
Moon Embrace Teahouse has sent this new tea for you to taste it.

314
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,159
Their shopkeeper said that today, they have an important guest.

315
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,539
They have tea tasting, chess playing, flower viewing, and sword dance.

316
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,299
They had reserved a seat for you.

317
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,660
If you ever have the time, the invitation will is open.

318
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,939
I just asked Xiao Sha to go and buy me some tea leaves.

319
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,419
I never thought that their shopkeeper would be so generous.

320
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,259
Award the person who sent the tea.

321
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,019
Express my thanks to the shopkeeper for the invitation

322
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,899
I'll go there when I have fully recovered.

323
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,580
Yes, Princess.

324
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,259
You know the shopkeeper of Moon Embrace Teahouse?

325
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,899
I heard that she's really good.

326
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,339
And she has collected many treasures from all over the world.

327
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,999
For example, she has this high-quality dress and rare night-luminescent pearl...

328
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,059
from the Western region in her Rare Item Chest chamber.

329
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,760
Princess Rong Le, can you bring me along?

330
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,859
Princess, what is wrong?

331
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,139
You have just recovered.

332
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,600
The doctor said that you have to rest more.

333
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,499
We have disturbed you from resting.

334
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,699
Princess Rong Le, rest well.

335
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,739
We'll invite you again to go out with us another day.

336
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,100
I'll take my leave then.

337
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,160
Princess Rong Le, I'll visit you again on another day as well.

338
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
All right.

339
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,240
Tea tasting, chess playing, flower viewing, and sword dance.

340
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,880
The teahouse is all about peace and tranquility.

341
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,240
They don't allow any weapons.

342
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,259
Usually, Long Yue will find some excuse for me.

343
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,759
Since she sent someone over today, it must be because there's no other way.

344
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,959
- Ling Yue. Help me change.
- Yes, Princess.

345
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,800
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

346
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,100
You are here, Miss Man Yao.

347
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,060
I'm wondering if you could make me some tea today.

348
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,859
I know clearly whether you are here to drink tea or to find troubles.

349
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:17,900
How can you be so sure that I'm not here to drink tea?

350
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,510
If you are here to drink tea,

351
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,220
why would you hide wine inside the bamboo tube?

352
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,339
I purposely used this old bamboo tube for soup to hide this wine.

353
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,659
I thought that it would be able to hide its smell.

354
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,379
I never thought that you'd find out about it. You are really good.

355
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:41,379
Wuyou can't drink wine. But I can't drink tea.

356
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:44,699
I can not eat for a day but I can't live without wine.

357
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,360
You are the mistress here. How about you drink some with me today?

358
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,060
What are you thinking about? Wuyou is not here.

359
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,860
Since you have already invited me, of course, I can't reject your kindness.

360
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,079
But I'm the same as Prince Li. I can't drink wine.

361
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,379
We have a full house today.

362
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,219
If I drink too much and embarrassed myself,

363
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,419
not only would I humiliate myself which is nothing,

364
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,899
but I'd affect your reputation which is the real problem if someone sees me.

365
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,379
After all, everybody knows that...

366
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,860
Moon Embrace Teahouse sells only tea and no wine.

367
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:26,519
I never thought that besides being meticulous, you are good with words as well.

368
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,459
Since you already said that, I'd feel guilty to force you.

369
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,560
Fine. I'll act nobly today...

370
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,800
and enjoy this good wine by myself.

371
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,560
Take a seat.

372
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,840
Sit down.

373
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,240
Somebody, please bring me my tools to warm up the wine.

374
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,380
- Miss Long Yue.
- Miss Chen Yu, yow's the mistress?

375
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,100
She is still with Prince Chen.

376
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,260
They have been in there for so long. I'm worried that she'll be in danger.

377
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,619
Prince Chen is very unpredictable. I don't know what his plan is.

378
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,299
Please spare my life.

379
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,579
No matter what, you have to make tea for me today.

380
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,800
All right, Your Highness.

381
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,300
Go and check on them again at once.

382
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,740
All right.

383
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,059
Miss Man Yao.

384
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,939
Before this, I heard from Long Yue that you just came to Zhongshan not long ago.

385
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:46,800
Before this, where were you?

386
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,019
Are you interrogating me?

387
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,640
No, I'm just asking for fun.

388
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,539
My father is a businessman.

389
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,739
I had followed him everywhere since young.

390
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,640
We don't stay in one place.

391
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,419
Traveling around the world has always been on my wish list.

392
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,140
Where have you traveled before?

393
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,779
I have been to many places.

394
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,280
I don't know where to start.

395
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,360
Just tell me about some of the places you've gone to. Just think of it as broadening my horizon.

396
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,460
Are you drunk?

397
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,560
I heard that you are an expert in traveling and having fun.

398
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,220
How can there be places that you don't know of?

399
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,080
Where were we just now?

400
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,140
You want to know that which places are beautiful to me.

401
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,360
Yes. I really want to know. Tell me.

402
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,339
I already told you just now. Are you drunk?

403
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,939
You didn't tell me just now.

404
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,680
I want you to tell me about some places but you haven't said anything.

405
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,300
Let me think about it.

406
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,600
Miss Man Yao, before you come to Zhongshan,

407
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,999
where were you?

408
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,780
Before I come to Zhongshan,

409
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
I am...

410
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,040
Where were you?

411
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,700
What's wrong with me?

412
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,080
I am...

413
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,080
in a tearoom.

414
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,859
It sounds so nice.

415
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,160
Where is the tearoom?

416
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,350
The fire for your wine has gone out.

417
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,190
Let me light it up for you again.

418
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,020
Miss Man Yao, are you all right?

419
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,640
Wuyou, you are here.

420
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,019
Wuyou, this is the Shilixiang wine that I stole from your manor.

421
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,619
I thought that it can lower one's guard.

422
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,160
We were doing fine just now.

423
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,050
Wuyou, I never thought that it would...

424
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,380
That it would...

425
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,999
It will indeed lower one's guard.

426
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,899
Are you all right, Miss Chen Yu?

427
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,219
Your Highness, I feel dizzy.

428
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,410
It'll be all right.

429
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,370
♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

430
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:48,700
♫ You are keeping me out with your care.
Although we are together... ♫

431
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,390
♫ I can wait for you until my hair turns white ♫

432
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,970
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

433
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:06,940
♫ I can endure all the loneliness just for you ♫

434
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,800
♫ For you, I am willing to suffer ♫

435
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,200
♫ I want to ward off the coldness for you ♫

436
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:25,280
♫ As long as I can be with you, I'm willing to give you all of me ♫

437
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,320
You are awake.

438
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,640
This is a specially brewed hangover soup.

439
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,260
Do you want me to feed you personally?

440
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:00,410
♫ The winter may be cold,
but I will watch from afar and keep you warm ♫

441
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,500
Slowly. It's a little bit bitter.

442
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,220
♫ I'm willing to wipe off the blood and wounds for you ♫

443
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,520
Thank you for your help. I won't disturb you then.

444
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:24,540
♫ As long as I can be with you, I don't mind... hiding in the dark ♫

445
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,199
Look. You can't even stand straight. How are you going to go back?

446
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,739
Don't worry. After you sober up,

447
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,459
I'll ask someone to send you back to Moon Embrace Teahouse.

448
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,280
I'm really grateful to you for saving me.

449
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,639
But I can't trouble you further.

450
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,059
Why do you have to keep me here?

451
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,459
Why did I go into the prison to save you that day?

452
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,659
Because you know that I'm innocent.

453
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,099
You are wise and just.

454
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,760
You can't just be impervious to injustice, right?

455
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,140
Do you have to lie all the time?

456
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,899
I know that you bear goodwill, but I really need to go back.

457
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,419
I have to take care of the teahouse.

458
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,220
How much can your teahouse earn in a day? I'll pay you.

459
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,659
What is it?

460
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:56,699
Man Yao, this is a good chance for you to name a price.

461
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,720
Aren't you glad?

462
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:06,219
Since you have invited me so warmly to stay here,

463
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,660
I'll accept your invitation.

464
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,939
100 tael a day. I thank you first, Your Highness.

465
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,200
All right.

466
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,939
The water is reflecting the light and dusk is upon us.

467
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,920
This beautiful scenery is fleeting.

468
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,179
But you are not willing to enjoy this scenery with me in peace.

469
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,720
You are just thinking about rejecting me.

470
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,259
It's not that I'm not willing, but I...

471
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,680
am different from you.

472
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,499
Unlike you who can do things as you please...

473
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:48,300
Again with your teahouse.

474
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,539
Man Yao, you are not like others.

475
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,739
But you keep on pretending to be a sordid merchant.

476
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,539
Are you looking down on me?

477
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,460
Do you think that I'm not worthy for you to treat me sincerely?

478
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,480
You have exaggerated.

479
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,360
You are a royal, you are charming and elegant.

480
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,459
Unlike me who is just a commoner. I'm not very knowledgeable.

481
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,300
- That's why you'll think that...
- Forget it.

482
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,960
I don't like to force people.

483
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,759
If you really want to go back, go ahead.

484
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:33,779
Helmsman, please turn back and let me off at the nearest wharf.

485
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,920
Helmsman.

486
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,660
Helmsman. Helmsman.

487
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,480
He is old. His hearing is not that well.

488
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,000
I have a way if you want to go back.

489
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,880
Calm down and enjoy the scenery with me.

490
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,820
And I'll ask someone to send you back to Moon Embrace Teahouse.

491
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,580
Why do you have to make things difficult for me?

492
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,419
Prince Chen had invited me to join him with wine.

493
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,260
What are you going to do to keep me here?

494
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,819
Sister Ling Yue, how about we go back?

495
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,960
Go back?

496
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,779
Lian Xin, think carefully.

497
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,000
This is a rare chance that the princess is not in tonight.

498
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,200
Are you sure about that?

499
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,520
Fine. Let's go.

500
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,299
Here. Carry them here.

501
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,160
Yes, Sir.

502
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,979
Cover them well.

503
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,000
Line them up nicely.

504
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,379
- We still have some bodies there.
- All right.

505
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,080
Scoop him up.

506
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,139
- Check over there.
- Yes, Sir.

507
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,160
Be careful.

508
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,499
Greetings, Your Highness.

509
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,579
What happened here?

510
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,080
Your Highness, it's a shipwreck.

511
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,640
Quick! There are bodies over there.

512
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,240
Yes, Sir.

513
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,260
Move it over here.

514
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,500
Deputy Minister Ma from the Ministry of Personnel.

515
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,699
Give them a proper burial. Make sure to get all of them out of the water.

516
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,680
Get me two horses as well.

517
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,830
I rushed here after I received the report.

518
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,970
I just simply brought that horse with me.

519
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:07,500
You can take that horse if you don't mind.

520
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,280
He is just a child.

521
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,500
Is this an accident?

522
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,860
There won't be so many accidents.

523
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,579
Let's leave now. We can still make it back to the city before the gate is closed.

524
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,939
Do you know this man?

525
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,060
If this is an accident, will someone uphold justice for them?

526
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,680
Justice?

527
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,680
There is no justice in this chaotic world.

528
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,560
Aren't you a self-claimed merchant that cares only about money?

529
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,040
Why are you so set on this?

530
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,020
Everybody has compassion.

531
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,200
Even you won't feel nothing when you see such tragedy, right?

532
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,860
Then what do you think I should do?

533
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,300
I wouldn't dare to ask you to do anything.

534
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,140
I just feel that...

535
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,560
what have they done wrong...

536
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
until they have to suffer like this?

537
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,500
I'm too much of a busybody.

538
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,819
In the end, I'm just another person in this world.

539
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,740
We can do nothing about it in this chaotic world.

540
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,479
Maybe one day, I'll become one of the innocent sacrifices as well.

541
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,140
Let's go.

542
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,200
With me here, who dares to sacrifice you?

543
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:51,260
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

544
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,640
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

545
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,740
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

546
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:10,630
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

547
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:17,560
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

548
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:24,240
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

549
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,550
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

550
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:36,550
♫ I will still try with my utmost to make a home for us ♫

551
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,600
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

552
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:54,250
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

553
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:00,500
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

554
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,540
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

555
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:24,300
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

556
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:30,860
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

557
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:37,000
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

558
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:44,330
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

559
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:54,200
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
