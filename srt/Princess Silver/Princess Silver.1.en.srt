1
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,640
[Episode 1]

2
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,742
You can never escape us.

3
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,349
Your Highness!

4
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:06,561
Your Majesty. Princess Rong Le is awake.

5
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,317
Your Majesty.

6
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,474
Come on.

7
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,946
Even if you disagree with this marriage alliance,

8
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:26,446
you shouldn't have run away on your own.

9
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,839
You have been wounded and blamed.

10
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,598
Are you happy now?

11
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,732
Who are you?

12
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:37,773
What is this place?

13
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,500
Rong Le.

14
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:47,327
Your Majesty, Physician Liu's worry came true.

15
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,820
Her Highness might have had a concussion.

16
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,855
That is why she lost her memories.

17
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:55,540
- Your Highness?
- What are you talking about?

18
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,099
I lost my memories?

19
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,440
I don't understand a thing you say.

20
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,951
You are in the royal palace of Western Qi.

21
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:06,020
I am the Emperor of Western Qi.

22
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,040
You are my younger sister.

23
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,530
You are Princess Rong Le of this nation.

24
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:15,152
I am...

25
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:18,900
Princess Rong Le of Western Qi?

26
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,500
Yes.

27
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,679
Your Majesty.

28
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,279
The medicine is ready.

29
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,336
Don't be worried about this.

30
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,370
According to the physician,

31
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,739
as long as you take your medicine on time, you will slowly regain your memories.

32
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,969
Take your medicine.

33
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,480
I am not drinking this.

34
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:04,269
It's all right.

35
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,280
You just woke up, you must be feeling a little discomfort.

36
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,380
Stay here and rest well.

37
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,846
You may drink it when you wish to.

38
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,166
Little Xun.

39
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,919
Rong Le,

40
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,866
you have my word.

41
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:54,179
I will do whatever it takes to help you regain your memories.

42
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:58,441
Calm down and get well.

43
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,277
You are dismissed.

44
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,500
Let the princess have some rest.

45
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,559
Yes.

46
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,514
Rong Le?

47
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,550
Princess?

48
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,614
Marriage arrangement?

49
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Amnesia?

50
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,236
An emperor for brother?

51
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,020
Why can't I remember any of these?

52
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:47,001
Who exactly am I?

53
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:14,030
- Is this where I lived?
- Yes, Your Highness.

54
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,900
You are His Majesty's only sister.

55
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,117
His Majesty loves you very much.

56
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:20,251
No matter how busy His Majesty is with the nation's affairs,

57
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:23,775
whether it has been days or longer, he will be here to visit you.

58
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:25,816
Your Highness is very clingy to His Majesty, too.

59
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,216
Your Highness—

60
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,757
Your Highness?

61
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,202
Your Highness?

62
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,868
Your Highness.

63
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,414
Your Highness.

64
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,047
Am I really a princess?

65
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,519
Your Highness!

66
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,647
Your Highness, why are you here? Are you all right?

67
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,890
Your Highness.

68
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,261
Your Highness?

69
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,742
Your Majesty.

70
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,333
You seem to be feeling better now.

71
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,862
I promised you I will help you find the memories.

72
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,819
I can help you regain the lost memories if you want.

73
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,863
However, if you act recklessly like you were just now...

74
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:19,045
and charge right into everything,

75
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,569
not only will it not help,

76
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:24,709
you will even get hurt and lectured.

77
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,171
Please, refrain yourself from doing that.

78
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,400
This was your favorite place once.

79
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,817
It feels familiar, does it?

80
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,540
Does it remind you of something?

81
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,002
Rong Le,

82
00:10:55,805 --> 00:11:00,083
back in the days, you loved to brew tea in this room.

83
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,816
You were great at brewing tea.

84
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:06,588
No one in the whole palace can best your skills.

85
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's give it a try.

86
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,211
You should try, too.

87
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,576
How is it?

88
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,959
See? You may have lost your memories,

89
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,614
but I think...

90
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:11,619
the muscle memories for your interests still remain.

91
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,479
Rong Le, don't worry about this.

92
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,746
Everything will be back to normal.

93
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,873
These are your favorite desserts.

94
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,155
Give them a try.

95
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:43,350
It's okay.

96
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,051
One step at a time.

97
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,296
Let me play you a song.

98
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,999
It was once the song you loved the most.

99
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,577
You always asked me to play it for you.

100
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,619
I always think...

101
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,370
the time we spent playing melodies and brewing tea...

102
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,923
were the happiest moments of our life.

103
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,427
"So that reminiscence does not linger,

104
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:04,032
so that sorrow never lasts."

105
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,597
Why is this written in different handwriting?

106
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,629
Your Highness.

107
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,162
Your Highness, it's time to take your medicine.

108
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,106
Ling Yue.

109
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:40,656
Can you tell if I wrote this poem?

110
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:45,918
Yes, you wrote this.

111
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,547
I was there when you wrote this.

112
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,688
All right, Your Highness.

113
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:54,879
Come on, finish this medicine.

114
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,740
I will drink it later.

115
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:01,180
The Empress Dowager arrives!

116
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,007
Come on, Your Highness. We should be kneeling.

117
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,868
Arrest her.

118
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,578
What do you want? Let go of me!

119
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:33,959
Why are you arresting me?

120
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,900
The alliance of Western Qi and Northern Lin is a reality.

121
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,319
You are going to the Northern Lin whether you like it or not!

122
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,901
Seize her!

123
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,314
Your Majesty.

124
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:55,020
Mother, please calm down.

125
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,303
Rong Le broke the rules because she has amnesia.

126
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:01,736
She must fulfill this marriage with or without her memories.

127
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:04,586
Mother, Northern Lin is far from here.

128
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:07,556
She might never have a chance to return if she leaves.

129
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:11,672
Rong Le is hurt and suffering from injury. It's only reasonable if she refuses to go.

130
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:15,279
As for the marriage arrangement, maybe we should delay it.

131
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,380
The army of Chen is advancing on our borders.

132
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,836
There are still skirmishes within our land.

133
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,519
We have no means to fight the enemies.

134
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,963
The fate of this nation is hanging by a thread.

135
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:28,819
If we ally with Northern Lin, Chen will be pincered by both of our nations.

136
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:30,761
They will retreat tactically.

137
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:32,946
I simply don't understand.

138
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:36,890
Why are you still hesitating on making a decision?

139
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,719
As for the war with Chen, I will come up with a strategy.

140
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,439
But Rong Le is suffering from wounds and amnesia.

141
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,999
The matter with the marriage needs more time to be considered.

142
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:51,396
In the end, it's all about her.

143
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:59,239
I was kind enough to spare your life and crowned you the princess.

144
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:05,262
Now, I still have the power to make you die a slow death.

145
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,034
Mother, please show mercy.

146
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,815
The date for the wedding is a week from now.

147
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:15,276
I shall order a servant to place that poison wine in the main hall.

148
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:18,661
Mother, why must you do this?

149
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:22,500
You can either send her on a palaquin to Northern Lin...

150
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,550
or you can prepare for my funeral a week from now.

151
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,871
The choice is yours.

152
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,959
Your Majesty.

153
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,241
Rong Le!

154
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,842
Rong Le?

155
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,108
- What do you want?
- Don't be afraid.

156
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:02,691
I will not send you away for a marriage alliance.

157
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:04,700
I will sneak you out of here now.

158
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:16,938
Fear not. I am taking you to a place.

159
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:18,920
Once you are there,

160
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,957
everything will be clear to you.

161
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,263
You lived here for quite a while once.

162
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,212
You liked this place.

163
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:25,572
Do you like it?

164
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,695
"So that reminiscence does not linger, so that sorrow never lasts."

165
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,901
How did you know?

166
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,572
Are you suspecting that...

167
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,853
these words weren't written by your hands?

168
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,979
Come with me.

169
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,198
These handwritings seem similar to mine.

170
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:20,039
The writings on the wall are mine.

171
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,999
Rong Le, you were very fond of my handwriting.

172
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,346
You always tried to copy the way I wrote.

173
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,163
The words on these papers... are the writings you copied...

174
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:46,763
while you had free time.

175
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:05,616
This little hut does feel familiar to me.

176
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:09,020
If I were a delicate princess that grew up in the palace,

177
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,764
why does it feel so alien to me?

178
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:16,589
You were born and raised in the Cold Harem.

179
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:21,180
Your mother was a peasant with mesmerizing beauty.

180
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,211
But she offended my father and was banished.

181
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:26,712
She was already pregnant with you.

182
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:30,533
Eight months later, she gave birth to you in the Cold Harem.

183
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:35,944
That is why Empress Dowager was so mean to me.

184
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,432
She went through an accident.

185
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,119
Her face was scarred.

186
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,132
It changed her personality as well.

187
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:48,445
I see.

188
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:56,229
Rong Le, you suffered a lot in the past.

189
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,878
But you were stubborn.

190
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,446
A royal guard once received the kindness of your mother.

191
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,839
During your time in the Cold Harem,

192
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,886
you secretly learned some martial arts from him.

193
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,768
So, I wasn't some kind of delicate lady at all.

194
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:16,595
That is why I have so many calluses on my hand.

195
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,628
When we first met each other,

196
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:26,252
we were still children.

197
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:28,924
I remember you said that...

198
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:30,804
"If anyone ever tries to pick on you,

199
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:34,115
I will be the first to stand up for you."

200
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,755
Why didn't you tell me any of these earlier?

201
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,819
Rong Le,

202
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,201
I don't really want you to remember these unpleasant memories.

203
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:48,614
But I never thought... you would grow suspicious of me.

204
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,352
The genesis of thoughts is nothing but an illusion.

205
00:22:54,352 --> 00:22:56,984
You need to trust your heart.

206
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:59,383
You must believe that...

207
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:04,133
I am the person that wishes to see you happy the most.

208
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,989
Rong Le, these were your favorite flowers.

209
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:34,669
What's wrong? Are you all right?

210
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:38,237
- Are you all right?
- I am fine.

211
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:39,744
Your Majesty!

212
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,429
Your Majesty, I must send you back now.

213
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,455
Take Rong Le with you.

214
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,319
You are severely wounded, we must go now!

215
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,602
Take Rong Le with you and go!

216
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,207
Yes.

217
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:03,075
Are you all right?

218
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,859
Brother! Wake up!

219
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:11,033
Brother! Xiao Sha, head back to the palace! Hurry up!

220
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,519
Yes!

221
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,826
Your Majesty wished to cheer Princess Rong Le up...

222
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:50,779
and even took the risk of sneaking her out of the palace.

223
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:54,630
But you were ambushed by the assassins of Chen.

224
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,905
Are you happy now?

225
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,316
Take Xiao Sha out of here. Punish him with eighty beatings.

226
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:05,764
Thank you for sparing my life.

227
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,358
Stop.

228
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,253
Come with me.

229
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,590
[Yongyang Palace]

230
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,979
As of now, the land is in turmoil.

231
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,999
War ravages the nation.

232
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,739
The land of Qi is not rich with resources.

233
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,018
Our army is weak.

234
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:56,419
The national treasury is almost empty because of the war.

235
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:59,245
We should be having peace to recover from the loss.

236
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:01,876
But as you can see now,

237
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:05,327
all the new recruits in the army...

238
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:08,690
are either too old or ill for battle.

239
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,959
Sending them to face the force of Wei and Chen...

240
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,534
is as good as a suicide mission.

241
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,811
It's either the marriage... or the war with enemies?

242
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,416
Correct.

243
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:33,141
If you can feel no guilt while they are sent to their deaths,

244
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:36,241
if you can bear to see His Majesty fight for this nation...

245
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:38,410
despite all the pain he is carrying...

246
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:44,442
and in the end have his head hanging over the city gate,

247
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,139
then I hope...

248
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:52,729
you can live to be a witness of this tragedy.

249
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,515
Why did you come back?

250
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,080
It would be nearly impossible to leave the palace again.

251
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:42,601
Drink the medicine.

252
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,740
[A Clean Heart is as White as Snow]

253
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,199
Your Majesty, we are short on troops and crops.

254
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,379
The people are running out of resources.

255
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:18,139
The marriage alliance with Northern Lin can save us.

256
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:21,599
Your Majesty, the marriage is the best viable plan we have.

257
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,438
If Your Majesty is unwilling to give up the princess,

258
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:27,386
I shall gladly send my daughter instead.

259
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:29,523
I cannot allow that!

260
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,419
Silence, all of you!

261
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,488
The peace of Qi...

262
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:40,392
is not to be traded with a woman's life!

263
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:42,630
Your Majesty, for the sake of Qi,

264
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,907
I shall send my daughter in Her Highness' place.

265
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:47,680
I am willing to do the same.

266
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,241
You...

267
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,940
[A Clean Heart is as White as Snow]

268
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,623
Need I remind you... that I am the Princess of Qi!

269
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:07,287
If anyone is going, it should be me.

270
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,456
Brother, I heard Northern Lin is wealthy and powerful.

271
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:22,581
They have an abundance of resources.

272
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:25,241
Rather than listening to all the officers' complaints...

273
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,903
and Empress Dowager's loathing, maybe I should go.

274
00:30:27,903 --> 00:30:30,942
I might change my life for the better.

275
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,535
Brother, I made you some tea. Try it out.

276
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,075
Come on.

277
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,610
Try it out.

278
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:47,020
Try it out.

279
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,100
Come on.

280
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,680
Is it good?

281
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,452
Indeed.

282
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,642
Rong Le.

283
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:16,067
Thank you.

284
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,561
Your Majesty, medicine for Princess Rong Le.

285
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Rong Le,

286
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,989
it's the advice from the royal physician.

287
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,907
You need to take this medicine every month regularly.

288
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:39,950
It will help to regain your memories.

289
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,403
Greetings, Princess Rong Le.

290
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,291
Your Highness, look.

291
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,054
This bridal robe is beautiful.

292
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,651
Look at the fabric and its texture.

293
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,745
Your Highness, please forgive me.

294
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:39,031
I was thinking Your Highness might miss His Majesty a lot.

295
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:40,799
I was trying to cheer you up...

296
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,846
so you won't be frustrated by this arrangement.

297
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:44,948
Your Highness, please forgive me.

298
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:47,207
I know it's my mistake.

299
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,919
After we moved to Northern Lin,

300
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,479
I wonder when will we be back again.

301
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,339
After our nation has prospered, you can come home eventually.

302
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:02,721
As for me, I have been alone my entire life.

303
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:06,361
I can be a servant anywhere.

304
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:10,829
Ling Yue, while you are with me,

305
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,289
don't think of yourself as a servant.

306
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,283

307

As the good will of His Majesty...

308
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:42,643
for forming an alliance with Northern Lin,

309

Princess Rong Le shall be sent for the sake of the marriage alliance.

In hope that Prince Li of Northern Lin, Zongzheng Wuyou...

311
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,979
and the Elder Princess of Qi, Princess Rong Le... can live in harmony,

312
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:59,239
and lead a life happily ever after.

313
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,848
The end.

314
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,579
At ease.

315
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,412
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:42,432
I have carried this jade pendant ever since I was a child.

00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:44,442
Take this with you.

319

321
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:54,254
Take care of yourself.

you shall be Princess Rong Le's personal bodyguard.

Keep her safe.

I heard the man Princess Rong Le is going to marry...

331
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:57,686
is Prince Li of Northern Lin.

332
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:00,130
He is the favorite son of the emperor.

333
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:03,555
I heard he has a dashing look and strong figure.

334
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:06,951
Lian Xin, if Prince Li is such a great person,

335

why isn't he married yet until now?

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,960
Well, I don't know.

337
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,590
Prince Li of Northern Lin, Zongzheng Wuyou... may be living in seclusion...

338
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,134
and rarely interferes with the matters of the imperial court,

339
00:37:26,134 --> 00:37:29,942
but according to our spies in Northern Lin,

340
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,345
Prince Li is actually...

341
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:36,326
a man of great intelligence and tactics.

342
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:40,039
Once, General Fu Chou of Northern Lin...

343
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,020
pacified the skirmish at the southern outskirts with thirty thousand soldiers...

344
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,279
while the enemy was strong with over a hundred thousand warriors.

345
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,877
He overcame the enemy that outnumbered them.

346
00:37:50,783 --> 00:37:53,950
It was all thanks to Prince Li's strategy.

347
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,735
Maybe being married to this man is not so bad.

348
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,154
Your Highness, that mask cannot be removed if you wear it.

349
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,164
It could be a bad omen.

350
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,600
[Lin Entrance]

351
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,681
The sedan of Princess Rong Le has arrived.

352
00:38:34,324 --> 00:38:38,032
I, Yang Wei, welcome the arrival of Princess Rong Le.

353
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:42,140
Why isn't Prince Li here to welcome the bride himself?

354
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,759
Well...

355
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,294
A moment, please.

356
00:38:46,294 --> 00:38:48,340
Princess Rong Le traveled all the way here.

357
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,789
Yet you refuse to welcome her into your palace.

358
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,667
You are clearly looking down on us.

359
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,039
We are starting to doubt your sincerity...

360
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,579
for the marriage alliance between our nations.

361
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,180
Please, don't take this wrongly.

362
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,579
His Highness has work to see to at this moment.

363
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,659
He couldn't manage to come here in time for the welcome.

364
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:10,919
Please, we apologize for this.

365
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,524
Prince Chen arrives!

366
00:39:23,749 --> 00:39:25,482
Your Highness.

367
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,191
At ease.

368
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,723
So, Princess Rong Le from Western Qi is in the sedan?

369
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,169
Greetings, Prince Chen.

370
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:38,719
I heard rumors about your hideous look and odd temper.

371
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,052
Which is why you are yet to be married until now.

372
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:47,025
But surprisingly, you do have a pleasant voice.

373
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,577
Lian Xin.

374
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,278
I appreciate the praise, Prince Chen.

375
00:39:59,278 --> 00:40:02,686
Perhaps my voice is the only aspect of me that is decent.

376
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,962
Rumour has it you are ruthless and stubborn.

377
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:07,560
You are a lady without manners.

378
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:10,773
From what I see here, that might not be the case.

379
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:13,479
At least you do possess the manner a princess should have.

380
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,310
At least you know your place here.

381
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,620
Your Highness.

382
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,219
I welcomed Princess Rong Le's bridal sedan.

383
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,639
I was hoping Your Highness would set out...

384
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,348
to welcome our honorable bride.

385
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:28,620
If my brother doesn't want her here, nothing can be done.

386
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,209
Trust me, you might as well just go back.

387
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,012
You know the temper of Wuyou well enough.

388
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:34,946
If you anger him,

389
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:37,696
- I doubt I can save your neck.
- But...

390
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:46,874
Order from the emperor, welcome Princess Rong Le to the palace.

391
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:21,218
I am Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

392
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:24,080
It's my honor to meet Your Majesty.

393
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,020
At ease, Princess. Rise.

394
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,028
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

395
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,073
Greetings, Princess Rong Le.

396
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:40,197
Pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.

397
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,614
I wonder why you are wearing that mask.

398
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:45,499
This is the custom of Qi.

399
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:50,043
The bridegroom must take off this mask himself on the wedding day.

400
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,301
I hope Your Majesty is not offended.

401
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:56,392
In that case, it won't be an issue.

402
00:41:57,788 --> 00:42:01,826
Your Majesty, Prince Li is...

403
00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:03,279
What happened?

404
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,119
The servants at his manor said that...

405
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,365
Prince Li is taking a rest.

406
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:09,307
His Highness won't be coming here.

407
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,921
- Wuyu.
- Yes, I am here.

408
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:18,374
You and Captain Xiang of the Royal Guard will go to the manor.

409
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:22,050
Bring him here with any means necessary.

410
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,558
Should you fail, there will be no place for you in the imperial court.

411
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:27,980
Are you serious? I don't need to be here again?

412
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,072
You will spend your life guarding the royal tomb in Western Lin.

413
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:36,649
Father, you know Wuyou's temper well.

414
00:42:36,649 --> 00:42:38,902
He is just...

415
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,596
Fine, your wish is my command.

416
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,359
Father, Wuyou is here.

417
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,707
Prince Li arrives!

418
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:30,470
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

419
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:36,020

423
