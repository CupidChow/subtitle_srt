00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:32,336
[Episode 44]

2
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,236
Yali,

3
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,372
did Prince Li mention how he will punish you?

4
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:41,465
He didn't say anything.

5
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:43,578
He did nothing either.

6
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:46,384
It's just as I expected.

7
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:50,441
Because of old times' sake, he won't hurt you.

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,500
What old times' sake?

9
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,869
He and I never shared any old times' sake.

10
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,248
All he has is a newly found hate.

11
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:02,333
I hope that he'll do something to me.

12
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,860
It'll be better than him ignoring me like this.

13
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,385
It's just like I've never existed to him.

14
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:13,285
Yali, wait for me in the manor.

15
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:16,390
Even though I might not be able to stage a comeback,

16
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,759
I will find another way to bring you away from here and give you a better life.

17
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,532
What do you mean?

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,976
You are still unwilling to give up? Or are you planning to escape?

19
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:32,956
Yali, I've always taught you that if you have something that you want,

20
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,497
grasp it tightly and never let go.

21
00:02:35,497 --> 00:02:37,682
Even if you might lose your freedom for a while,

22
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:40,062
but as long as you live,

23
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:43,049
you'll have a chance to get it back.

24
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,459
Stop forcing me to accept that false reasoning of yours.

25
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,440
I've always listened to you.

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,512
But what did I get in the end?

27
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:56,359
The love that I want... is used by others...

28
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,349
And in the end, I am cast away like a pair of worn-out shoes.

29
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,739
I want to have status but now, I've fallen into a bottomless pit...

30
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,340
and I'm trampled by others.

31
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,000
What more chances do I have?

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,019
And what more chances do you have?

33
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,960
Yali, everything that I did, I did it for your sake.

34
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,900
I don't believe it.

35
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:19,411
I only realized it when I heard about the things that they blamed you for.

36
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:22,193
The father that I had admired and respected...

37
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:26,196
is a traitor that brings disaster to the country and to the people.

38
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:29,240
Why should I listen to you again?

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,686
Yali,

40
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,013
others don't believe me.

41
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,098
You don't believe in me either?

42
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:38,122
Yes. Because of my selfishness,

43
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:41,309
I had made up lies about the Silver-Hairded Demon.

44
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,259
And I've killed those who stood in my way.

45
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,429
But I will never admit that... I'm a traitor to this country.

46
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:52,216
If I wanted to rebel, why did I try to marry you off to His Highness?

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,737
The 13 lives in the northern camp and the mutiny riot...

48
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,615
have nothing to do with me.

49
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,276
Father,

50
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,376
I can never tell if you are lying or speaking of the truth.

51
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,580
And I don't want to know.

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,532
The justice, virtue, loving father and filial daughter are just lies...

53
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:15,747
that you've portrayed to cover the ugliness in your heart.

54
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,277
Yali!

55
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,553
Why would you turn out to be like this?

56
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,946
Why would I turn out to be like this?

57
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:28,499
Because you've never tried to get to know me.

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,600
Of course, you don't know what kind of a person I am.

59
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,854
I have always been your filial daughter.

60
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:39,111
I've always been the daughter of the illustrious Sun family.

61
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,623
The people that I like, the life that I want to live in.

62
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:48,371
Sometimes, even I don't have answers for them.

63
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,760
Because I don't dare to think about it and I don't dare to do it.

64
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,940
Finally, I mustered the courage to take a step forward.

65
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,135
But I'd ended up with such a sad ending anyway.

66
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,565
It's not just you.

67
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:05,060
Even I...

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,231
don't know why I would turn out to be like this.

69
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:16,285
Yali, this is my fault.

70
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,748
I shouldn't have been so strict to you.

71
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:22,119
But now, you have to believe in me.

72
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,517
And you have to listen to me. Or else,

73
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:27,459
this will be the end of the Sun family.

74
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,300
Father!

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,080
Do you know?

76
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,271
When you show me this kind and loving face of yours,

77
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:38,696
it means that you are going to use me again.

78
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:41,720
I prefer the cold treatment that you had shown me...

79
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,460
when we had just come to Qingzhou.

80
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,737
At least I knew back then that...

81
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,465
your dislike for me was real.

82
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,699
And I didn't need to guess about what evil plans...

83
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,550
you were plotting next under your façade.

84
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:04,321
This time,

85
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:07,788
it'll be the end between us as father and daughter.

86
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,433
I don't care if you want to escape or what.

87
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,736
From now on,

88
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,897
your plans have nothing to do with me.

89
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,966
They have nothing to do with me.

90
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,061
Yali.

91
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,129
Yali!

92
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,789
Why can't you understand?

93
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:39,988
You are my daughter.

94
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:42,349
I will not hurt you.

95
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:47,395
And I won't leave you behind unattended.

96
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:58,185
You can't do this!

97
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,900
You can't take it away!

98
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,949
Go away.

99
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,285
Finally, you are back, Miss Sun.

100
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:13,900
Did you go and visit your father? How is he?

101
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,800
Don't mention him again!

102
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,357
Do you want to announce to the world that I'm the daughter of a criminal?

103
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,877
I don't mean to do that.

104
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,659
- You say it.
- Just say it.

105
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,574
Miss Sun, you know about the current situation in the manor.

106
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:39,150
The properties in this manor, including us servants, are supposed to be...

107
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,139
- confiscated as well originally.
- That's right.

108
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,830
Now, His Highness has shown mercy and let go of us.

109
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,520
- But what about our wage this month?
- Yes, what about our wage?

110
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,861
How can you be like this?

111
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,690
How can you be so ungrateful?

112
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,390
Miss Sun has treated you so well.

113
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,930
The whole manor is empty now.

114
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,939
- Where would she find money?
- What about our wages then?

115
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,160
- That's right, what about our wages?
- Stop it.

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,169
Miss Sun, we know that everybody has left.

117
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,808
And this manor is now an empty shell.

118
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,840
But we are sure that there are still some valuables left in here.

119
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,419
Rather than letting them confiscate those valuables, it's better if you can give some of them to us.

120
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,991
- Yes, that's right.
- It'll be better to give them to us.

121
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,116
Get lost. All of you, get lost!

122
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,549
Let me tell you.

123
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,215
I'd rather smash all the things in this manor...

124
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,939
than give them to you!

125
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,933
- Are you mad?
- That's right. She has gone mad.

126
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:34,304
Get out! All of you, get out!

127
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,099
Get out now!

128
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,200
What is her problem?

129
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,290
No.

130
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,307
No!

131
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,040
Miss Sun.

132
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,153
Miss Sun, what's wrong with you?

133
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,721
Help!

134
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,332
Miss Sun!

135
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,392
Wake up, Miss Sun!

136
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,093
Wuyou.

137
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,295
Ke'er told me that...

138
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,372
when one takes the Ageing Frost,

139
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,824
he will suffer unimaginable pain.

140
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:02,220
And death will be a better choice.

141
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,333
Plus, his life will be deducted by 10 years.

142
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,387
How are you able to endure that?

143
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:12,541
Everything is in the past now.

144
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,136
We are both fine now, right?

145
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:18,253
During the Lantern Festival back then,

146
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:21,499
I had vowed to hold your hands until we were old and gray.

147
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:24,023
Looks like I've fulfilled it earlier.

148
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:28,017
In such a short day,

149
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:31,254
you've made me go through the most immense pain.

150
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,696
But at the same time,

151
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:37,844
you've given me the greatest happiness.

152
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:49,633
Man Yao, from now onward,

153
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:53,059
there will be only happiness. No more sufferings.

154
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,646
Marry me.

155
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:02,640
Tonight, now. Let us love each other.

156
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,688
I don't want to wait anymore. And you don't have to wait anymore.

157
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:12,216
Yes. I accept.

158
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:55,277
The moon will be the witness. The sky and the land will act as our matchmakers.

159
00:11:55,277 --> 00:12:00,191
I, Zongzheng Wuyou, am going to take Man Yao as my wife.

160
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:07,417
We will be together... until death draws us apart.

161
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:17,097
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

162
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:23,324
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

163
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:30,698
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

164
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:37,633
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

165
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:43,511
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

166
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,535
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

167
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:56,737
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

168
00:12:56,737 --> 00:13:01,314
These cups of tea will be our nuptial cups of wine.

169
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,400
♫ Half of autumn is gone. And it's still a long way with winter ♫

170
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:21,128
♫ But I'm already waiting for spring together with you ♫

171
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,300
♫ In order to preserve your naivety,
I'll fight for the world to be peaceful again ♫

172
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,582
♫ This chill will bridge the path for two lovers who are apart ♫

173
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:33,102
Man Yao.

174
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:36,544
After we wipe out our previous humiliation...

175
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:38,940
and reunite Northern Lin,

176
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,660
I'll give you a grand wedding.

177
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:46,072
It's already very good like this.

178
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:48,552
We are married because of love...

179
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,981
under the sun and the moon.

180
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:54,936
I like it a lot. And I have no regrets.

181
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,579
Although a ceremony is important,

182
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,122
it's not as long-lasting as the sky and the land.

183
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:03,085
I just hope that as long as the moon is still there,

184
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:06,430
I'll always be by your side.

185
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,612
For us to become husband and wife...

186
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:12,798
is what I've always dreamed about.

187
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:17,255
Now that it has become a reality, it is so unbelievable to me.

188
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:19,804
It's like I'm still in a dream.

189
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:23,916
♫ But I can't help but to say it to you ♫

190
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:31,100
♫ Fate will tear down my mask for me ♫

191
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,500
♫ Through your reflection in the mirrow,
you are always so quiet ♫

192
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,331
Now, do you still think that you are dreaming?

193
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:50,619
♫ Wishing to silence the warbler's cry and calling you into the mortal world ♫

194
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,196
♫ Telling you I will never leave you ♫

195
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:04,300
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

196
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:10,977
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

197
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:17,370
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

198
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:24,041
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

199
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,619
Man Yao... is calm and pure in nature,

200
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:44,198
virtuous and refined, friendly, kind,

201
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:46,522
smart, and courteous.

202
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:49,640
I, Prince Fanyang, am here to officiate the wedding.

203
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,554
Prince Chen will become the witness for this wedding.

204
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:56,459
I hereby enthrone Man Yao as the fair consort of Prince Li.

205
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,240
She had contributed to the policy to help make it successful.

206
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,455
So from now on, she will attend the court together with Prince Li...

207
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:07,361
and they will rule together.

208
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,537
The ceremony is now over!

209
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Greetings, Prince Li.

210
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,320
Greetings, Princess Consort Rong Le.

211
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:24,640
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫

212
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:57,509
Father. Mother. I have an important thing to report.

213
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:08,879
I and Man Yao have mutual affinity.

214
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:10,777
From now on,

215
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,219
she will be my wife.

216
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,618
And we will be a family.

217
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,042
I believe that both of you will be...

218
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,691
glad about it, too, in the afterworld.

219
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,967
Please protect her well.

220
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,876
And please guard over us.

221
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:32,960
Let us be safe and our lives smooth sailing.

222
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,671
Let us hold each other to the end of our lives.

223
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:06,197
For your journey back to defend the border with General Luo Zhi this time,

224
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:08,069
I won't be sending you off.

225
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,277
You've been training for quite a while in the Luo Army.

226
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:13,265
I believe that you know the situation at the border better than I do.

227
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:17,359
As soon as there's any movement from the north, report back to me immediately.

228
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,360
Wuyou, you too, think that there will be movement from the north soon. Right?

229
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,812
From Sun Jizhou's case, it's clear that Fu Chou hasn't given up yet.

230
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,891
He made up this story about Silver-Haired Demon...

231
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,097
because he wanted to use Man Yao against you...

232
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:31,638
to affect the southern border.

233
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:35,079
When we first came to Qingzhou, I told you that...

234
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,780
there will be a huge battle between you and Fu Chou in the future.

235
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,680
Wuyu,

236
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,036
Wuyou had told you back then.

237
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:46,700
The sudden downfall of Zhongshan...

238
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,878
was possible because Fu Chou was selfish...

239
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,019
and he did it without caring for the lives of the people.

240
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:56,006
Wuyou won't be like Fu Chou.

241
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,659
We implemented the transformation here...

242
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,059
to recuperate and rest.

243
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,659
When the people are strong and the country is rich,

244
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,420
and when we have recuperated enough and are ready,

245
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:09,022
we will take over the world with the smallest price.

246
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,635
We can wait. But Fu Chou won't.

247
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:15,957
Wuyou. Rong Le. He has made a move already.

248
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,739
Rather than letting him gain the upper hand,

249
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,080
how about we attack him first?

250
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,508
I already ordered Leng Yan to let Serene Hill Inn...

251
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,218
operate as usual again without tipping them off.

252
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,659
We already know that...

253
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,078
this is where Sun Jizhou colluded with the enemies in secret.

254
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:34,882
We might be able to catch some prey that fall into our trap.

255
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:39,357
As soon as Fu Chou makes a move,

256
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:41,656
I will fight him back.

257
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:45,097
Wuyou.

258
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:48,205
Whenever we hold a memorial for our parents in such a faraway land,

259
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,980
I blame myself.

260
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,475
I keep thinking that if I was smarter...

261
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,545
or more capable back then,

262
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,980
Father wouldn't have turned out to be like that.

263
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:04,525
And now, we can't even set up spirit tablets for...

264
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:07,801
Father and Lady Yun.

265
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:11,351
We can only grieve for them beside the river in a faraway place.

266
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:15,439
Whenever I think about that, I wish that I can go into...

267
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:19,419
a life or death battle with Fu Chou who had murdered our father at once.

268
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:23,674
I understand.

269
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:27,385
I blame myself, too.

270
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:29,356
And I'm in pain as well.

271
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:45,266
Father. Mother.

272
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:48,634
I'm not sure if I have the rights to call you those.

273
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:50,172
I'm sorry.

274
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,684
If it wasn't for me back then,

275
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,219
Wuyou wouldn't have abandoned Zhongshan.

276
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,569
And Lady Yun wouldn't have to stay in the Yun Mausoleum all by herself.

277
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,948
He has been blaming himself.

278
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:04,059
But in order to not make me feel guilty,

279
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,535
he has never mentioned about this unfilial sin that we've committed.

280
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,977
I'm willing to bear this sin alone.

281
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:15,375
Please don't blame Wuyou for it.

282
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:47,916
Here.

283
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:50,853
You just recovered from a serious illness.

284
00:21:50,854 --> 00:21:52,921
It's like you've come back from death's door.

285
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:55,598
You've gone through a calamity in your life.

286
00:21:56,521 --> 00:22:00,219
Yali, you have to live well from now on Uunderstand?

287
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,080
Here, Chun Ni.

288
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,563
If Chun Ni didn't tell me about it...

289
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:06,890
and if the physician couldn't get here in time,

290
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,090
you would have been in real danger.

291
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:16,472
Now, everybody... is trying to avoid me at all cost.

292
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:19,277
And I don't want to trouble others.

293
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:24,199
But... I never thought that you'd still be willing to visit me here.

294
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:27,964
I'll remember this friendship... that you've extended to me.

295
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,400
But now,

296
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,616
I have nothing to repay you with.

297
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:36,180
Yali, no need to think about that.

298
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,219
I'll be satisfied if you can live well.

299
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,859
Moreover, if you didn't live your life well,

300
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,180
how would you have the chance to repay me?

301
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,147
If there's one day when I need you to repay me,

302
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:52,059
you better be generous with me.

303
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,219
Don't worry. I'm not joking.

304
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,240
In the future, I'll give you anything that I have.

305
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:19,210
You are not that good with children, right?

306
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,330
Why did you bring me here all of a sudden?

307
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:26,360
Ever since we came back from the river, you have seemed depressed.

308
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,309
And you even had to massage your head when we were in court.

309
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:32,582
I'm afraid that you've used your brain too much.

310
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,489
You'll feel better coming and meeting these new children.

311
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,725
And your body will feel better, too.

312
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,339
- Brother Li!
- Sister Rong Le!

313
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:57,724
- Such good kids.
- All of you are new here?

314
00:23:57,724 --> 00:23:59,290
What is your name?

315
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,480
Brother Li gave me a name. I am Ya Ge.

316
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,264
- I am Zi Jin.
- I am Bo Yu.

317
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:08,864
I am his brother, my name is Bo Rong.

318
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,682
"Emperor Wen watches from Heaven,

319
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,160
shining bright and brings us light.

320
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,779
The Zhou kingdom has it's age,

321
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:16,300
but the fate of the nation is yet to be known.

322
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,520
How glorious Zhou Kingdom is.

323
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,500
It has done as Heaven says.

324
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,100
Emperor Wen walks up to Heaven.

325
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,206
And how mighty he is, standing beside God."

326
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:27,960
Bo Rong, your turn.

327
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,208
What's next again?

328
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:34,040
You taught them all of this?

329
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,715
Brother Wuyou has hired a teacher for us.

330
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:40,055
We are going to serve the country when we grow up.

331
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,186
- Good boy.
- Good boy, Zi Jin.

332
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:43,179
Go back to your studies.

333
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,025
- Such good kids.
- Let's go.

334
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,350
Wuyou, why did you teach them this poem specifically?

335
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,760
My late teacher taught me this first when I was young.

336
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,920
It's really rare for me to hear about your childhood.

337
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,120
When I was young, I was a troublemaker.

338
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,880
I was not as obedient as they are.

339
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
I remember that when I was playing on the swing one time,

340
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,330
I almost kicked the maidservant into the water.

341
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,427
My late teacher gave me that swing.

342
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:17,873
He purposely hired someone to build it for me.

343
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:19,941
He said that I had been studying too hard.

344
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:22,141
So, he wanted me to do some physical exercises.

345
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:32,511
After that, I made a windchime for him...

346
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:34,662
as a return gift for him.

347
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,399
This is for you.

348
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,191
- Thank you, Brother.
- You are welcome.

349
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,643
After that, I rarely touched that swing anymore.

350
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:51,863
I was immersed in learning how to fight with weapons.

351
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,163
Brother Li, teach us how to write.

352
00:25:57,163 --> 00:26:00,115
- Sir said that your writing is good.
- Sure.

353
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:01,615
Here.

354
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,332
I'll teach you how to write the word...

355
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:10,991
- "Yao," all right?
- Yes.

356
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:12,940
Is she me?

357
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,040
Who is he then?

358
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:21,142
Wuyou... or...

359
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,449
- Man Yao!
- What's wrong with Sister Rong Le?

360
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:31,850
Man Yao.

361
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:35,069
Are you all right?

362
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,332
Are you having headaches again?

363
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:41,020
Here. Let's go back and ask Ke'er to take a look at you.

364
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,363
Let's go.

365
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:00,369
Man Yao, did you really have no relapse for the past year...

366
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,837
or have you been hiding it from me?

367
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:06,858
Your Highness, are you doubting Princess Rong Le or me?

368
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,279
I am the physician. I've been treating Princess Rong Le for a year.

369
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,635
And she has been so lively and has never fallen ill.

370
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:15,119
Maybe it's your fault.

371
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:17,139
Did you work Princess Rong Le too hard?

372
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:19,739
Is that the reason she has been having headaches?

373
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,103
You are not lying to me?

374
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:24,270
Or course not. I never lie.

375
00:27:25,963 --> 00:27:29,210
Before this, you went out with Wuyu for quite a while.

376
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,697
- Where did you go?
- I...

377
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:34,314
didn't go anywhere in particular.

378
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:37,826
We were just walking around for fun.

379
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:42,455
Wuyou.

380
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:44,886
Look at here. Her face is all red already.

381
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:50,608
She must have had some secrets with Wuyu that she can't tell you about.

382
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:52,499
I don't have any secrets with him.

383
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:55,639
We just went out together to collect some herbs.

384
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:58,095
Collect herbs? What herbs?

385
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,323
Show me.

386
00:28:00,323 --> 00:28:02,311
We didn't get to find them.

387
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,051
You didn't get to find them?

388
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,340
It's true.

389
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:14,375
There. I'm looking for this.

390
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,077
It took me so long to find this magical herb.

391
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:19,600
But somebody has already taken it away.

392
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,020
Blood Raven Root.

393
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,759
Ke'er, stop hiding the truth from us anymore.

394
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,899
The reason for you, Wuyu and Agent Wu to collect herbs together...

395
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,460
must be something that is connected to Man Yao's illness.

396
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,899
Tell me the truth.

397
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:43,520
How is her condition?

398
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,340
How is the treatment working on her?

399
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,962
Princess Rong Le's illness is...

400
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:55,480
Princess Rong Le, you haven't had headaches for quite a while already.

401
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,540
Maybe the countless weird concoctions that I had made are truly working.

402
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:03,515
Ke'er.

403
00:29:04,518 --> 00:29:08,079
Remember. If someone ask about my illness from now on,

404
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,355
tell them that it's just a normal headache.

405
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:13,372
Don't let them know that it's because of the poison.

406
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:15,300
Especially Prince Li.

407
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,023
If he asks you about it,

408
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:19,603
don't mention anything about poison.

409
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:22,694
Just tell him that you'll be able to cure me of my illness.

410
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:26,640
But Princess Rong Le, I don't know how to lie.

411
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,847
Ke'er, I know I shouldn't teach you how to lie.

412
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:33,834
But there are a lot of things...

413
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:37,542
where ignorance is bliss.

414
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,277
All right then, Princess Rong Le.

415
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,960
I'll keep it a secret from Prince Li.

416
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,662
I don't really know him anyway. I'll just avoid him from now on.

417
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,374
If he knows that I'm poisoned,

418
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:56,305
he'll let go of everything to find a cure for me.

419
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:58,795
He'll only wish to live with me for the rest of my life.

420
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,536
But he has lofty aspirations...

421
00:30:02,536 --> 00:30:04,631
and an implacable debt of blood.

422
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:08,487
I'll hate to let him let go of them again because of me.

423
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,195
Princess Rong Le's headache is not a huge issue.

424
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:19,426
I just heard that Blood Raven Root can cure headaches.

425
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:20,779
And it can darken the hair.

426
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,400
But it grows in the most dangerous place in Youji Mountain.

427
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,199
That's why I had asked Uncle and Wu Yu to go with me.

428
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:30,155
I didn't tell you because I don't want to disappoint you if I can't find it.

429
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:32,919
See. I didn't get to find it in the end, right?

430
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,427
Ke'er.

431
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,242
Why are you so nervous, Ke'er?

432
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,010
We know. You went to collect herbs,

433
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,991
not to have a date with Wuyu.

434
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:55,320
Look at me.

435
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,658
I've already recovered. Don't be so nervous.

436
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,787
You are scaring Ke'er.

437
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,020
Enough. Don't give Ke'er a fright anymore.

438
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,840
Let's go back now.

439
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:15,918
[Serene Hill Inn]

440
00:31:30,378 --> 00:31:32,472
Is he really here?

441
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:25,570
You are getting better and better at hidden weapons now.

442
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,744
It's not because of my skill. It's because you make good hidden weapons.

443
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:31,711
We've been in hiding for the past year.

444
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:34,320
And we didn't dare to use the martial arts we had learned before.

445
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,283
We are able to save ourselves many times because of your hidden weapon.

446
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,663
Thank you.

447
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:15,620
Is she getting better now?

448
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,849
The physician came just now. He said that her fever has gone down.

449
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:23,802
Her fever has indeed gone down. She should be fine now.

450
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:32,210
Ever since this child was born,

451
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,428
you are the only one who can coax her.

452
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,706
After giving birth to my daughter,

453
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:44,036
I just realized that besides fighting,

454
00:33:44,036 --> 00:33:47,205
I can do nothing and I know nothing.

455
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,663
If you weren't here for the past year,

456
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,183
I'm afraid that she wouldn't have been able to come into this world healthily.

457
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,545
You've done very well already.

458
00:33:57,545 --> 00:33:59,072
Now, in this world,

459
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:02,869
there are only you, me and this child where we can depend on each other.

460
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:05,407
Both of you are my only family in this world.

461
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:09,007
Of course, I need to do my best to protect the both of you. But...

462
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,960
What is it? Something happened?

463
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:23,638
Pack your clothes, take this money and leave Qingzhou now.

464
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:26,199
Leave Qingzhou?

465
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,390
It's not easy for us to find a place where we can live.

466
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,638
- Why do we have to leave suddenly?
- Don't ask.

467
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:32,279
Just do it.

468
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,722
After you leave Qingzhou, go south.

469
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:36,484
Mark the way with our usual code.

470
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:38,410
I'll catch up to you soon.

471
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,955
If you don't tell me why, I won't leave.

472
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:48,072
I heard rumors about the Silver-Haired Demon in the village.

473
00:34:48,072 --> 00:34:50,909
- Is it...
- This has nothing to do with us.

474
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,893
Believe me. Leave now.

475
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:55,235
It'll be the best choice...

476
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:57,217
for you and your daughter.

477
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:04,370
We had been through so much.

478
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,259
No matter how dangerous the situations were,

479
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:09,040

For some things, I think it's better for you not to know.
