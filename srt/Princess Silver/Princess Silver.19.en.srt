00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,790
[Episode 19]

2
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:38,908
Miss Sun, this is the present Lord Wuyou sent.

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,979
These silver bracelets are beautiful. They came in a pair.

4
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,263
Miss Sun, is His Highness...

5
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:23,961
Brother, the rebels are advancing. They almost reached the city.

6
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:27,719
Fear not, I ordered Agent Wu and his men to set up an ambush.

7
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,919
The South has been plagued by the rebels.

8
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,086
But Fu Chou never succeeded in getting rid of them.

9
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,639
It's high time we put an end to this.

10
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,140
Maybe Fu Chou wasn't trying to get rid of the rebels.

11
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,681
Maybe this was his plan.

12
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:43,753
I ordered Agent Wu to search for their backgrounds.

13
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:48,225
Most of them are desperate fugitives who have lost their homes.

14
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:52,040
These people are easy to be talked into an uprising.

15
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,362
But at the same time, they are easy to break.

16
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:05,586
Your Highness, the rebels have been recruiting sooner than expected.

17
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:08,862
They are getting impatient. It's time to meet them in person.

18
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,586
Who made us lose our families?

19
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:28,202
Who took our homes from us?

20
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,918
It's the rich and powerful from the city...

21
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,299
that took our land and food!

22
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:39,975
Today, we will reclaim what's rightfully ours!

23
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:42,449
We will make them pay.

24
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,236
For us! And for our families!

25
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:47,378
Kill them all!

26
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:49,639
Kill them all!

27
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,599
Kill them all!

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,461
They are putting the civilians at the front lines.

29
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,837
They are using the people as human shields!

30
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,420
I won't allow the people to die in vain!

31
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:07,199
Kill them all!

32
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,119
I, Zongzheng Wuyou, give you my word!

33
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,939
As long as you lay down your weapons, I will give you what you need.

34
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,459
I will let you have a peaceful life.

35
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,586
I swear on my life!

36
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,710
I will not go back on my words!

37
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,599
All hail His Highness!

38
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,635
All hail His Highness!

39
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:16,918
All hail His Highness!

40
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,039
The skirmish at Qingzhou was pacified.

41
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,294
The Zheng family was prosecuted for conspiring with the rebels.

42
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:25,479
They hoarded the land for their own during the war.

43
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,159
Their crime was informed to the Imperial Cour which angered His Majesty.

44
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,211
Zongzheng Wuyou was ordered to eliminate the Zheng family.

45
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:36,800
The Zheng family estate is to be returned to the Imperial Court.

46
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,350
[Qingzhou]

47
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:43,572
"As ordered by His Majesty, the skirmish in the South was pacified.

48
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:45,639
The Zheng family is no more.

49
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,281
I remember the feat of General Fu Chou...

50
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,999
which helped to weaken the force of the rebels.

51
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,279
You are hereby granted the special silk from Qingzhou,

52
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,949
jade, and rice grains...

53
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,119
as a token for your attachment to the South.

54
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,239
Period."

55
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,381
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

56
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,942
Please accept the royal decree.

57
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:20,395
You are welcome, General Fu. I must leave now.

58
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,251
Much appreciated.

59
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:32,095
Leave us be.

60
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:49,879
General, I just came back from the South.

61
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,399
Everything is going well there. The people live in peace.

62
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,870
The land will soon regain its prosperity.

63
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,639
I paid Lord Wuyou a visit in the South.

64
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,795
His Highness praised you for the previous achievement.

65
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,979
His Highness achieved a great feat and is high in morale.

66
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,719
He spent his time helping the people.

67
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,519
The Zheng family has been eliminated. The Sun family has a great influence.

68
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,439
Perhaps it's because of His Highness' support.

69
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,711
When I arrived, His Highness was playing chess with Miss Sun.

70
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:15,319
There are rumors in Qingzhou.

71
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,100
Maybe Lord Wuyou really is marrying Miss Sun.

72
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:26,018
General, I should go now.

73
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,254
All these gifts from His Majesty...

74
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,759
is sarcasm to me for not killing all the rebels.

75
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,589
I failed to get rid of all the remnants.

76
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:02,536
This is a slap to my face.

77
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,211
Nicely done, Agent Wu.

78
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:40,490
Wuyou, your swordplay has improved.

79
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,638
The battlefield is the best training ground.

80
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:49,879
How does it feel to kill the enemies along my side?

81
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,359
The Hidden Ones have some fame among the vagabonds.

82
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,940
But we have always worked in the dark.

83
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,923
Killing the enemies on the battlefield...

84
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:59,358
is to complete what my father started.

85
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:02,079
The pain in my heart faded away.

86
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,768
This brings a tint of comfort.

87
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,551
It must have been hard all these years.

88
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,957
The case from 16 years ago...

89
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,470
caused your whole family to be executed.

90
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,317
You got away with your life, but not your name.

91
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,079
You founded the Hidden Ones with all you had.

92
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,961
You helped gather all the information in the dark.

93
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:25,490
But I don't even have the means... to retrieve your honor.

94
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,461
Wuyou, I owe my life to Sir Qin.

95
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,519
He is also a good friend of my father.

96
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,559
I never blamed you for what happened.

97
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,909
The one thing I was worried about...

98
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:39,905
was how you brought your guards and took the bride from General Fu.

99
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,839
I thought you lost your senses...

100
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,900
and forgot about the unfinished mission left by our master.

101
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,592
Now that you are on your feet again,

102
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:52,679
- that is a relief.
- Don't worry, Brother.

103
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,141
I will walk the path I am destined for.

104
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:59,260
I will do my best to complete my mission.

105
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,247
Your Highness, you are back.

106
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:18,039
Have a seat.

107
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:34,337
Your Highness, have some tea.

108
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,059
What's wrong? Are you not used to it?

109
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:50,319
The tea from Qingzhou has a special flavor.

110
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,033
I couldn't get used to it at first.

111
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:55,569
But I slowly learned to enjoy it.

112
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,510
It is quite a unique flavor.

113
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:02,694
I lost the game of chess that day.

114
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:04,783
I will do my best today.

115
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,126
How about a few rounds?

116
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,679
I will pass for today.

117
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,529
Can you play a song for me instead?

118
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,743
As you wish.

119
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,525
This brat's handwriting is getting better.

120
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:11,066
She has become more gentle, too.

121
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:16,019
How is she right now?

122
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:24,119
What? Do you miss the capital?

123
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,159
Yes. Wait, no.

124
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,461
I am not in a hurry to go home.

125
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:31,628
Wherever you go, that is where I will go.

126
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:35,086
In that case, the news from the capital...

127
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:37,067
won't pick your interest.

128
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,294
Wait! What news?

129
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:41,865
Is His Majesty summoning you back?

130
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:44,378
I knew it, pacifying the rebellion was a great feat.

131
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,439
There is no way he won't reward you.

132
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,732
Weren't you not in a hurry to go home?

133
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,850
Brother, stop messing with me.

134
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,811
Just tell what it is.

135
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,272
- Sir.
- Sir.

136
00:13:57,273 --> 00:14:00,170
Greetings, Your Highness.

137
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:02,456
How may we be of help to you?

138
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:03,968
Your Highness.

139
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:08,559
I did as you ordered for the case with the Zheng family.

140
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,933
Those with crimes will be punished.

141
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:15,178
But the fortune involved with the family is a huge sum.

142
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,159
There were debates for the estates all along.

143
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,880
They are now occupied by fugitives.

144
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,062
They won't hand the land in.

145
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,493
How will Your Highness deal with this issue?

146
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:27,977
I wish to listen to your suggestion.

147
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,279
I think while the Zheng family was in charge,

148
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,877
they were greedy enough to hoard lands for their own.

149
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:37,279
They used any vile means necessary.

150
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,253
Those lands were not used for farming,

151
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,175
but he won't let anyone use them.

152
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:45,567
We can use these lands to relocate the fugitives.

153
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:49,755
Your Highness, why don't we do them a favor for once?

154
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,347
We shall proceed with your plan.

155
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:54,032
The rebellion just ended.

156
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,719
The welfare of the people comes first.

157
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,460
There is no need for us to fight with the people.

158
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,109
However...

159
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,089
What is Your Highness' concern?

160
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,439
I think the deeds to these lands must be registered.

161
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,294
The provincial government will support them to open up the wasteland.

162
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:16,059
We cannot allow them to sell the land... to the other nobles.

163
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,351
We finally got rid of the Zheng family.

164
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,279
If we have to deal with another uprising,

165
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,759
that could be troublesome.

166
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,039
Yes.

167
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,266
I will proceed with Your Highness' plan.

168
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,279
If I leave this to you, I will have no worries.

169
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,288
Your Highness' trust is much appreciated.

170
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:36,879
But Your Highness accomplished the task in triumph.

171
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,359
His Majesty will surely reward you.

172
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,359
You might even regain your titles.

173
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
If His Majesty summons you to express his gratitude,

174
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,279
there will be many works to be done,

175
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,898
do I have the permission to proceed as I see fit?

176
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,877
Whatever His Majesty wants,

177
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:58,117
I am not going back.

178
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:00,114
Brother?

179
00:16:00,114 --> 00:16:01,971
You are not going home?

180
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,336
Do you mean you won't go back for the time being...

181
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:07,839
or...

182
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,639
The provinces in the south are recovering from the battles.

183
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,840
They will soon return to their respective glory days.

184
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,610
Serenity in the countryside.

185
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,344
Far from the game of power.

186
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,812
This is where I wish to stay for the rest of my life.

187
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,199
If I must live here forever,

188
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,119
without my title...

189
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,420
in peace and far away from the fighting,

190
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,561
I will gladly accept this life.

191
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:33,378
Brother, I thought you forgot about what happened in the past.

192
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:36,613
You carry a great ambition but you choose to live in peace?

193
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,399
Please, reconsider this decision.

194
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,439
Your Highness is the center of attention.

195
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,439
This is the chance of a lifetime.

196
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,979
Not only can you return with glory, but you might also gain the title as Crown Prince.

197
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:47,600
Teacher.

198
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:51,518
Something is best left unsaid.

199
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,461
My decision is certain.

200
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:56,042
It's pointless to persuade me.

201
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,519
Wuyu, you wanted to go back.

202
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,451
Express my gratitude and send my regards to our father.

203
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:04,569
Tell him about the decision I made.

204
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,775
Brother? Brother?

205
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,107
But...

206
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:38,799
Yali? Are you all right?

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,246
Don't worry, I am fine.

208
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,690
Is something bothering you?

209
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,977
Your Highness, I heard you are not going back to the capital.

210
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:55,286
Indeed.

211
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,199
But His Majesty is getting old.

212
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,039
As his son, you have to carry out your duty.

213
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,140
Yali, do you want to go home?

214
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,503
Did you talk to me of your own will...

215
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:08,554
or your father's order?

216
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,319
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

217
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,279
I was simply asking.

218
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,211
The choice is still up to you.

219
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:16,586
Worry not.

220
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:18,336
If you wish to leave this house...

221
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:20,013
or even leave Qingzhou,

222
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,013
I will not stop you.

223
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,846
My father will never agree.

224
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:28,075
That might not be true.

225
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,100
The situation changes from time to time.

226
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:32,941
The same goes for the human heart.

227
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:34,959
Have you ever thought about...

228
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,260
spending your time with me instead of...

229
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,650
the son from the Zheng family?

230
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,420
Your Highness, you knew it all along?

231
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,157
That is for sure.

232
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:51,069
The two of us are actually facing the same problem.

233
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:54,529
I never wanted the others to make me forget about the past.

234
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,336
The more you try to forget,

235
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,488
the more you remember it.

236
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:00,479
Which is why I gave you these bracelets...

237
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,140
so you could put up a good act for me.

238
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,193
You hate it when people force you to make a choice.

239
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:11,859
The more they demand of you, the more you hate it.

240
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,959
Which is why you accepted my gifts.

241
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,560
Isn't that right?

242
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,461
If Your Highness understands,

243
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:20,289
can you please help me?

244
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,008
I want to go back to the capital.

245
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:25,269
I want to be with the one I love.

246
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,652
Yali, please stand up.

247
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,570
Whether you can go back or not... is not up to me.

248
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,902
It must be decided by someone else.

249
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,360
[General's Mansion]

250
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,479
General Fu, there is no sign of Zongzheng Wuyou coming back.

251
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,388
Everything is quiet in the South.

252
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,839
Rumors are saying he is renovating the manor.

253
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,837
He is turning that temporary house into his permanent home.

254
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,336
He might never come back again.

255
00:19:57,337 --> 00:19:59,439
His Majesty mentioned...

256
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,918
the rewards for those who battled the rebels.

257
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,319
But he never mentioned anything about Wuyou coming back.

258
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,684
Don't you think is... rather odd?

259
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:12,624
Do you need me to investigate again in the South?

260
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,769
Don't bother.

261
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,515
If he does nothing, I do nothing.

262
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,075
Since Zongzheng Wuyou doesn't plan to return,

263
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:24,262
it would make our next move in the plan a lot easier.

264
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:26,759
Right.

265
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,545
Another letter came from Western Qi.

266
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:31,608
They are rushing me to get "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

267
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,002
But Lady Rong Le is...

268
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,878
Do not bother her with this matter.

269
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,058
I will figure something out... to keep them preoccupied...

270
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,409
and keep them from getting in our way.

271
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,360
General Fu.

272
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,235
The sound must be coming from the Tranquil Garden.

273
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,936
I should go and take a look.

274
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,683
I can handle it.

275
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,988
It's so beautiful!

276
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,527
Wonderful!

277
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,812
This is so nice!

278
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:27,878
Princess, come on and join us for the fireworks.

279
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:29,461
She is right.

280
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,879
Come on and join us. It's not fun without you.

281
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,490
Go ahead, I can watch you play.

282
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,319
Join us. It's not fun without you.

283
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,133
She is right. Look at that.

284
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:41,551
The fireworks are not as pretty without you.

285
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,159
Indeed!

286
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,878
You are a slick.

287
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:47,480
- I'll join you.
- Sure.

288
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,676
Look!

289
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,047
Princess, look at how pretty it is!

290
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,496
Rong Le, do you know?

291
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:22,846
I would love to see you smile every day.

292
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,839
How may I help you, Crown Princess?

293
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:38,378
His Majesty is not feeling well and has already gone to bed.

294
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,211
I am going to get my sleep as well.

295
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:43,571
We must pay our respects to the ancestors at the Imperial Temple.

296
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,920
If this is not about something important,

297
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,753
you may leave now.

298
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:51,461
Mother, please take this seal from me.

299
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:53,919
Depose me of my title as the Crown Princess.

300
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,894
What are you talking about?

301
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,119
You were always generous and modest.

302
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,333
Why would you be so rude tonight?

303
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:06,701
Mother, as you know, the Crown Prince...

304
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,545
has always been reckless when it comes to relationships.

305
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:11,559
I advised him for his own good.

306
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,815
When there is nothing I can do, I let him do as he pleases.

307
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:18,517
But his behavior is getting out of hand.

308
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:20,459
Enough.

309
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:23,482
I have talked to you about these matters.

310
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:27,170
Husband and wife must tolerate each other. You are his wife.

311
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,054
You must endure what the others could not.

312
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:36,057
If you wish to surpass the others in this palace...

313
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:38,670
and secure authority for your family,

314
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:41,731
having a small quarrel is nothing significant.

315
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,628
I held up for over a decade.

316
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:46,343
Even now,

317
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,319
I must still be cautious of what I say... and what I do.

318
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:55,659
Mother, it's not that I can't stand it anymore,

319
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,199
but I have no place in His Highness' heart.

320
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,799
Before this, he held a feast at the Eastern Palace for a mere courtesan.

321
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,670
His Majesty was furious because of it.

322
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,918
But His Highness disobeys the order and hides that girl in the palace.

323
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,379
His affection for her is greater than before.

324
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:13,839
Tomorrow is the day to pay our respects.

325
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,395
I advised him to get changed and rest well.

326
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:18,336
Go to bed earlier.

327
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:22,563
But he disagreed... and hit me.

328
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,038
Is this how you were hurt?

329
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,839
Do you need a doctor?

330
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:30,211
Insolent child.

331
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:32,503
Tomorrow is the day we pray to the ancestors.

332
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,586
What if His Majesty sees the wounds you have?

333
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:38,599
The wounds mean little to me.

334
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,337
But if His Majesty finds out...

335
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,639
Your Majesty, what woke you up?

336
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,503
How can I possibly fall asleep?

337
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,759
That insolent prince is simply licentious!

338
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,420
He failed his duty and now he is disobeying my order?

339
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:56,278
The nation will be ruined by his hands.

340
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,079
Your Majesty, calm down.

341
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,350
That was simply a one-time mistake.

342
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,630
He was seduced by that woman.

343
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,604
Father, this is all my fault.

344
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:05,973
It's my fault.

345
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:09,439
I exaggerated the prince's wrongdoings because I was upset.

346
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,878
He is loyal to Your Majesty.

347
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,396
- He will never lie to Your Majesty.
- Yes.

348
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:14,128
Stop defending his actions.

349
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:17,340
He is my son and I know very well what he is.

350
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:22,761
You may go now. I will see to this matter.

351
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,818
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

352
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:38,519
Your Majesty, the matter of the harem is part of my duty.

353
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,359
I failed you. I apologize for my action.

354
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,848
I will resolve all the issues in the harem...

355
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:46,711
and guide the Crown Prince...

356
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,198
so he may never worry you again.

357
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:53,376
My Empress, please stand up.

358
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:56,991
This is not your fault.

359
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:00,589
I am getting old.

360
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:03,603
Some works are getting harder for me to accomplish.

361
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,319
You are still young.

362
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,159
You are not even much older than he is.

363
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,338
Why would he listen to you?

364
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,039
We have been married for 16 years.

365
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,840
But you have no child of your own to rely on.

366
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,918
Your life in the palace is not an easy one.

367
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:22,918
Your Majesty.

368
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,716
I never blamed you for the life I have now.

369
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:27,599
During Fu Yuan' rebellion,

370
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,121
I was but a mere peasant girl in my family.

371
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,878
But you already rebuilt this nation on your own...

372
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:37,128
and was a hero admired by many.

373
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:41,828
Marrying you... is the greatest honor of my life.

374
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,519
I am not a person with great wisdom.

375
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,759
All I have ever known is to keep myself away from risks.

376
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,376
I did it so I can stay by your side for the rest of my life.

377
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,763
I understand.

378
00:26:57,763 --> 00:27:01,938
I will have everything arranged for you if I pass one day.

379
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:05,439
I don't want the tragedy...

380
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,537
with Yun to repeat itself.

381
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,999
Princess Zhao Yun, are you here to help us or make a mess?

382
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,636
Look at you! You got the flour all over the place.

383
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:45,140
Ling Yue, I didn't mean it.

384
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,371
You did it on purpose! Eat this!

385
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:51,359
Princess!

386
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,500
Ling Yue!

387
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:23,415
General Fu, a kitchen is not a place for men.

388
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,685
What brings you here?

389
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:39,711
The night is almost here.

390
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:43,044
I was thinking whether you would join me for dinner?

391
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:47,028
But it seems like... you don't need me.

392
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,564
General Fu, why don't you join us for dumplings?

393
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:00,223
What do you think, My ady?

394
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,980
General Fu, please wait for me in the Tranquil Garden.

395
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:09,977
Thank you for the invitation.

396
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,545
I haven't had a good appetite in so long.

397
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:22,865
Your cooking is quite remarkable.

398
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,598
I didn't make these. Ling Yue and the others did.

399
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,119
You scared Zhao Yun when you came in just now.

400
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,259
You are having a good mood, but she left before she was even full.

401
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,479
General Fu. Princess Rong Le.

402
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,159
Princess Zhao Yun is in the palanquin.

403
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,420
Ling Yue, it's been a long day for you.

404
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:45,521
Have some dumplings for yourself.

405
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,260
General, do you need anything else?

406
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:52,218
Never mind. Thank you, Miss Ling Yue.

407
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,705
I shall leave you be for now.

408
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,089
This girl is getting smarter by the day.

409
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:05,359
She is good in many ways, but not very loyal.

410
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,420
I wonder what you gave her as a bribe.

411
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:09,769
She keeps helping you.

412
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:12,714
But I think she is very loyal.

413
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:15,430
Think about this. We are a family.

414
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:18,478
She is loyal to me. I am loyal to you.

415
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:21,565
It's just the same, isn't it?

416
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,510
♫ I can't help but to ask you ♫

417
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,930
♫ Our hearts are a lifetime apart ♫

418
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,650
♫ No one comes... ♫

419
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:43,640
This place was once... an empty and cold house.

420
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,060
I had no family or friends.

421
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,879
All that kept me company... were the swords and blades.

422
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,503
When the day for a reunion came,

423
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:56,086
all I ever saw in my dreams were bloodshed...

424
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,227
and the smoke rising from the battlefield.

425
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:00,939
But today, everything is different.

426
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:05,794
For the first time, I can feel... the warmth of a family.

427
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,320
I have no family with me either.

428
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,079
But I could feel the serenity today.

429
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,890
Perhaps this is the best way for me to live.

430
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,860
♫ Living without sorrow, dying without any hate ♫

431
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,040
♫ This is the leniency that you've shown to me ♫

432
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,230
♫ We are not holding hands, but you are holding my heart ♫

433
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:37,810
♫ Although this might not be forever ♫

434
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,230
♫ I've locked you in my heart and I've locked you in my dreams ♫

435
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:50,960
♫ Blaming myself... for falling in love with you ♫

436
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,439
General.

437
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,140
But...

438
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,470
From now on, the Western Qi and I are no longer allies.

439
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,559
General, if you do this,

440
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,479
not only will you lose financial support,

441
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,110
- they might even expose you!
- I can deal with anything.

442
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:10,598
But I can never afford to lose Rong Le.

443
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:13,799
She made up her mind to severe her past.

444
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,270
I must not let Western Qi and "The Book of Mountains and Rivers" to bother her life.

445
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,802
As for the kite agents, get rid of them.

446
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:24,068
Remember, Rong Le must never find out about this.

447
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,596
Yes.

448
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:41,503
Your Majesty.

449
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:44,119
Your Majesty, you need the help of Empress Dowager.

450
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,217
Without the medicine, you will be in pain.

451
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:48,336
I am worried for you!

452
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,110
Nameless Guard!

453
00:32:55,546 --> 00:32:56,997
Yes.

454
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:58,528
How...

455
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:02,169
How is she lately?

456
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,703
Your Majesty, Her Highness is doing well in General Fu's house.

457
00:33:05,704 --> 00:33:07,729
They have become more intimate over the months.

458
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,273
Their life is rather happy.

459
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,648
Leave me be.

460
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:45,018
Rong Le, I hope you can live in peace for the rest of your life.

461
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,420
Crown Prince!

462
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:08,090
We were praying in the Imperial Temple.

463
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,026
How dare you fall asleep.

464
00:36:10,027 --> 00:36:11,804
Your manner is disrespectful!

465
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:13,999
You disrespected the sacred temple.

466
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,837
You should be punished for it!

467
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,439
Father, I apologize for my mistake.

468
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,092
But I was exhausted from assisting you with work.

469
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,519
I am feeling tired.

470
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,999
That's why I fell asleep.

471
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,239
I spend my days with work,

472
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,919
and now you have more work than I do?

473
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,659
Father, the South is at peace and I am making preparation.

474
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,479
I am setting things in motion for the campaign against Wei.

475
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,961
I discuss the plan with General Fu until it's way over midnight!

476
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:44,753
Do you take me as a fool?

477
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:47,991
You spent your time in dissolution with those women!

478
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:51,279
Father... But...

479
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:55,014
Father, who is framing me now?

480
00:36:55,014 --> 00:36:57,559
That is not true, Father! That is not true!

481
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,159
You think I am framing you?

482
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,239
I want you out of here to the Eastern Palace.

483
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,572
Get rid of those debauched women!

484
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:05,279
I want you to reflect on your mistakes!

485
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,279
Do not come to the court again without my permission!

486
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,160
Get out!

487
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,341
I will be on my way.

488
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,753
Calm down, Your Majesty.

489
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:25,039
The Crown Prince's actions may be unacceptable,

490
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,336
but what he said reminds me of another issue.

491
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:30,495
The campaign has been delayed for too long.

492
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,377
What is Your Majesty's next plan?

493
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,294
First, Wuyou left the capital.

494
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,279
The rebellion in the South came right after.

495
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,384
All of these have delayed the campaign.

496
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,628
Western Qi is not making a clear stand either.

497
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:46,079
I sent my emissary to urge them about the matter.

498
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,039
But their emperor keeps putting this matter on hold.

499
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,848
They won't let us pass through their land or give us provisions.

500
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,616
I have the same suspicion. Six months passed since the marriage.

501
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:57,060
But Western Qi is not showing any sign of goodwill.

502
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,919
It's like they have forgotten about the princess they sent here.

503
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,799
Other than the grains they gave when the Emperor of Qi arrived,

504
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,639
they have provided us with no substantial help at all.

505
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,257
This is indeed worrying.

506
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:11,832
You are right.

507
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:17,136
But if we rush the campaign,

508
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:20,670
I am afraid Western Qi might break the alliance...

509
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:22,670
or even fish in troubled water.

510
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:27,279
They used a fake princess for the engagement.

511
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,223
It ended up in such a mess.

512
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,340
I... am worried

513
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,258
about this marriage alliance with Western Qi.

514
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,543
Your Majesty.

515
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:40,294
I felt something was off about everything.

516
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:42,336
I am not sure if I should tell you.

517
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:45,378
Xuan Ming, we are brothers by blood.

518
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:47,444
You can tell me anything.

519
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:50,399
I received reports.

520
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,559
General Fu has been contacting Western Qi through letters.

521
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,378
But I am not sure about the reliability of the source.

522
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:02,749
It came from a vagabond faction called the Hidden Ones.

523
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:06,086
Besides, the princess is married to General Fu.

524
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:09,159
Writing letters to her family is perfectly normal.

525
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,239
I dare not draw my own conclusions.

526
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,253
But General Fu's response to this marriage alliance...

527
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:16,211
is rather peculiar.

528
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:18,111
You are right.

529
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:22,298
Xuan Ming, send you men to keep watch at his manor.

530
00:39:22,298 --> 00:39:24,918
If we can get our hands on their letters,

531
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:28,113
we will have answers for Western Qi's doings.

532
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,853
Understood.

533
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,950
[Numerous come together to blossom]

534
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,539
Greetings, Your Majesty.

535
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:56,458
These are the tea leaves you asked for.

536
00:39:56,458 --> 00:40:00,753
I also brought Your Majesty the best rose rouge from Qi.

537
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:02,790
I hope you like them.

538
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:07,719
I heard about this from Princess Zhao Yun.

539
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,378
There are many fancy items in the Rare Item Chamber.

540
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,994
The rumors are true.

541
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:19,854
Look at this rouge.

542
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,948
The color is even more brilliant than what we use here.

543
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:26,880
This is lovely.

544
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,599
If Your Majesty likes it, I can order my men...

545
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,194
to bring the rouge here for you.

546
00:40:35,194 --> 00:40:37,668
How thoughtful of you, Princess.

547
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,670
No, you are the general's wife now.

548
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,478
Have a seat.

549
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,476
Why did you ask me here, Your Majesty?

550
00:40:53,476 --> 00:40:55,479
It's nothing important.

551
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,999
I haven't seen you in a long time.

552
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,959
I just wanted to have a conversation with you.

553
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,319
There is unease in the palace.

554
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,339
I am sure you have heard of it.

555
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,235
The Crown Prince's consort has no time to talk to me.

556
00:41:08,236 --> 00:41:10,323
So, I thought about you.

557
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:14,184
I appreciate the honor. It's my pleasure to have this conversation.

558
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,518
These are the white jade glaze cups you brought.

559
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:27,639
These are meant for tea.

560
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,199
They need someone who knows to appreciate them...

561
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,253
so they can be useful again.

562
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,838
Today, I am returning them to you.

563
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:38,169
They could be your consolation when you miss your home.

564
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,837
Thank you, Your Majesty.

565
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:43,745
But as of now,

566
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,604
I don't need them anymore.

567
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:49,754
Why?

568
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:52,586
Lady Rong Le, you have nothing to be worried about.

569
00:41:52,587 --> 00:41:54,479
I am returning them as a gift.

570
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,170
It's has nothing to do with the alliance.

571
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:00,072
Your Majesty,

572
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:03,838
they are the trinkets I brought from the Rare Items Chamber of Western Qi.

573
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:06,354
But I am married to a man of Northern Lin.

574
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:08,189
I don't belong in Western Qi.

575
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,759
It's not adequate for me to keep them.

576
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,839
They should be left in the palace.

577
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,120
Don't you have any attachment for Western Qi?

578
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,545
No.

579
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:21,782
I severed all ties with Western Qi.

580
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,043
Not even letters to your family?

581
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,776
Ever since I am married General Fu,

582
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:34,030
I never contacted my family in Western Qi.

583
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:38,519
Very well. Have some tea.

584
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:49,390
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

585
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:56,040
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

586
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,920

589
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:22,420
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫
