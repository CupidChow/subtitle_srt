[Episode 53]

2
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:41,840
Chang Jian, I don't care what it takes,

3
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,580
I want you to find out where Fu Yuan is at all costs.

4
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,157
Your Highness, there is no one in the Lingxiao Palace.

5
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:50,383
According to the guards, Empress Dowager went missing three days ago.

6
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:53,001
We searched everywhere, she is nowhere to be found.

7
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:56,220
I suspect this might have something to do with Lin Shen.

8
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,528
A witness said Lin Shen went into Lingxiao Palace.

9
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,720
- Maybe the two of them...
- She's been working with Lin Shen.

10
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,168
It's just that we never found out.

11
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:07,900
Fu Yuan was never my mother.

12
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,625
Perhaps... she never even saw me as her son.

13
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:17,853
Very well, you may go now.

14
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,262
Yes.

15
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:53,581
Chou'er.

16
00:02:56,063 --> 00:03:00,631
Kill them! Kill them.

17
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:05,685
Chou'er, kill them!

18
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:10,106
Kill them!

19
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,240
Zhao Yun.

20
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:52,400
Wuyu?

21
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,174
How are you?

22
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,075
I am fine.

23
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:01,357
It's been two years, how have you been?

24
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,180
Look what I have for you.

25
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,380
Flowers are blooming on the hill, come with me to pick some plum blossoms.

26
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,719
Pretty lady, are you a guest here? Will you join us?

27
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:23,263
Don't be rude. She is not a guest.

28
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,680
We are not going for the flowers.

29
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,975
Go on without me.

30
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,779
Ke'er?

31
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,160
Zhao Yun, don't take this wrongly.

32
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,099
You can stay here all you want. Don't think of yourself as an outsider.

33
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:47,595
For me, you have always been like family.

34
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,378
You are also...

35
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:01,264
Go after her if you want.

36
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:05,325
Never mind. She is Captain Xiao's sister. Her name is Xiao Ke.

37
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,800
She is always so reckless when she talks. But on the inside, she is actually kind and gentle.

38
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:14,372
I doubt she will be angry because of this.

39
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:18,845
Wuyu, you still don't understand what a girl really wants.

40
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:22,608
When she is truly in love with someone, but he never cares much for her,

41
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:25,460
she will surely be upset.

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,540
I remember the time when Qianyi had to travel far away,

43
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,233
so he ordered his men to send me a stem of plum blossoms.

44
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,866
I didn't understand at first.

45
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,057
But he explained to me when he returned.

46
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:42,633
"In the land full of wonders, these plum blossoms shall be my token for you."

47
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,031
This is a token of love and yearning.

48
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,199
And now she is giving you this as present.

49
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
Don't you see what she is trying to tell you?

50
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,757
She is not the same as other girls.

51
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,660
Grab onto the chance when it presents itself,

52
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,735
do not let regret take its place.

53
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,640
Wuyu, you missed your chance once.

54
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,510
Do not let her down this time.

55
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,693
Ke'er?

56
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,465
Brother.

57
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,582
- Did someone upset you?
- I am not upset.

58
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:43,117
You on the other hand have been gloomy lately.

59
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:46,650
You are always here and you don't talk to people.

60
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,600
How are you feeling?

61
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,360
Ke'er.

62
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,697
If something is bothering you, you can always let me know.

63
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:57,480
If you keep it inside your heart,

64
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,181
you might never get the chance to say it again.

65
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:05,039
Well, since you talked me into this, I don't mind letting you know.

66
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,838
Actually, it was you who has been keeping everything inside your heart.

67
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:13,807
I wanted to talk to you, but I don't where do I start.

68
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:18,850
Brother, Ling Yue is already...

69
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,479
She is gone; stop thinking about her.

70
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,240
Even you have learned to cheer me up.

71
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,472
It seems like you are no longer just a child.

72
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:38,519
Of course. I know a lot of things.

73
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,536
But all of you keep protecting me like I am a kid.

74
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:46,584
Can you tell me who upset you now?

75
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,699
It's all because of that stinking Wuyu!

76
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,468
I asked him to pick some flowers with me, but he chased me away.

77
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:56,139
What? He chased you out?

78
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,235
I can't allow that, I should teach him a lesson.

79
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,634
It's all right.

80
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:04,416
He has always been nice to me.

81
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,720
But a pretty lady was there, too.

82
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,480
He didn't want to leave her there by herself.

83
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,841
Ke'er, be honest with me, are you in love with Prince Chen?

84
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,664
No way!

85
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,163
So, why are you blushing?

86
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,172
Stop being so jealous.

87
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:24,819
The lady that talked to Prince Chen... was Princess Zhao Yun.

88
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,843
She is Princess Zhao Yun?

89
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,514
Princess Rong Le mentioned her before.

90
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:33,906
She was married to Chen for the sake of Northern Lin.

91
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:38,039
She is amazing. I have been wanting to know her.

92
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,742
I should have given her a proper welcome.

93
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,596
Are you still mad?

94
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:49,358
I was never mad at all.

95
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:51,258
It's all because of that stinking Wuyu!

96
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,870
Greetings, Prince Chen.

97
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,357
Your Highness,

98
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:05,305
this is the peace treaty signed by Prince Regent himself.

99
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:09,541
As a token of good will, our troops at the border have retreated.

100
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,759
I wonder where Prince Li is right now.

101
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,387
Prince Regent ordered me to hand it over to His Highness personally.

102
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,281
Sir Chang,

103
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:25,761
what rank do you hold as of this moment?

104
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,344
I am now the captain of Royal Guards.

105
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:31,917
You are only a captain.

106
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:35,097
Why should my brother be summoned by someone like you?

107
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:38,741
You should be glad that I am even here.

108
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:43,972
If Fu Chou is showing any good will, he should have come here personally.

109
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:46,405
Ever since His Highness came back from Chen,

110
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,997
he has been very tired and is now busy with national affairs.

111
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:51,597
He doesn't have the time to come here.

112
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:53,866
He doesn't have the time?

113
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:57,660
He hurt my brother and poisoned Rong Le.

114
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,310
And with this insignificant letter, he is trying to get our forgiveness?

115
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,806
My brother and Rong Le may have a generous heart,

116
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:08,244
but I won't let it pass so easily.

117
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:11,127
Wuyu, have some manners.

118
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,111
Brother.

119
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,214
I will be accepting this treaty letter.

120
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:28,521
My troops on the border will retreat as well.

121
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,378
Brother.

122
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:34,354
- You are letting him go?
- Pass a message for me.

123
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:36,331
Once I have everything in order,

124
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:41,103
Man Yao, Wuyu and I will... pay our father a visit in Zhongshan.

125
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:44,244
In that case, I take my leave.

126
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,039
- Brother!
- What is it now?

127
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,619
If you have nothing better to do, I do have a task for you.

128
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:59,635
I am sure you know Man Yao and I are going to have a wedding.

129
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:02,054
How are you going to prepare it?

130
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:03,385
Why are you asking my opinion?

131
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,600
Ask your beloved brother in Zhongshan.

132
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,040
What has he done to prepare for your wedding?

133
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,590
Wuyu.

134
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,199
"Both the north and the south are withdrawing their troops.

135
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:21,059
There will be no war at the border.

136
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,003
Prince Li will fix a date for his wedding...

137
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:28,039
with Consort Rong Le?

138
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,756
A double delight!

139
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,922
A day worth celebrating for the nation!"

140
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:34,715
Great!

141
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,880
- Great!
- Such good news!

142
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
Great!

143
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,937
Brother Wuyou. Princess Rong Le.

144
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,843
Forgive me for leaving without a proper farewell.

145
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:51,122
I appreciate your kindness for taking me in these few days.

146
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:53,850
You will always be my family.

147
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:57,071
You taught me how to be brave...

148
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:58,899
so I could be strong enough...

149
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,803
to leave the shelter you provide...

150
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,809
and live a life of my own.

151
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,640
Me and my child...

152
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,060
will send you our best wishes from a land far away.

[Thinking About Coming Home]

154
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,950
[Zhao Yun]

155
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,292
I am surprised,

156
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:49,054
Zhao Yun is much stronger than any of us thought.

157
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,730
I am worried because she is all alone.

158
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,400
And she is expecting a child.

159
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:59,940
Man Yao, this might be for the best.

160
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,788
Calm down.

161
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:05,152
I am sure Zhao Yun will take good care of the child.

162
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,673
She will give the child a normal yet happy life.

163
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:09,877
They won't follow the footsteps of Qianyi.

164
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,542
Don't be too worried about this.

165
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,516
Think about the child that you are carrying.

166
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,400
Wuyou, do you want our child to be a boy or a girl?

167
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,912
Either are good.

168
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:28,176
What matters is we need more children.

169
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:30,977
They will follow you like little flies.

170
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,135
They should be following you like little flies.

171
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:35,254
You will get your hands full with them,

172
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:37,161
they would be a great nuisance.

173
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:38,525
No way.

174
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:41,439
You are always so patient with the kids in School of Wisdom.

175
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:45,402
Besides, I have you by my side.

176
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,382
Man Yao, you have my word.

177
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:07,240
I will do all I can... to create a world of peace for our children.

178
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,458
I will not let them... suffer the same fate as those children in the School of Wisdom,

179
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:16,779
to be born into a world of chaos and not being able to decide their own fate.

180
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,133
Wuyou, I have faith in you.

181
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,148
All I hope for our children...

182
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:28,900
is for them to be born safely and watch them grow up.

183
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,702
I want them to have a happy life with their loved ones.

184
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:35,482
They can witness the peace of this land.

185
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:39,160
Your wish will come true.

186
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,679
- This is good news.
- Great!

187
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,819
The whole nation should celebrate this.

188
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,868
The south was once plagued by war, the people lived in suffering.

189
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,459
But the land is now prospering and people have a quality life.

190
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,224
The peace treaty is ratified. The civil war is over.

191
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:53,685
From now on, you don't need to live in hiding.

192
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,420
You are right. I blamed my father when I was little.

193
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,130
If he hadn't rushed to his death for his wishful pipe dream,

194
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,117
I wouldn't have lost my family...

195
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:09,520
and went through so much pain in the Creed.

196
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,698
But from what I see now, his dream might finally come true after all.

197

All thanks to Prince Li and Consort Rong Le for executing the People's Reformation.

Reformation?

199
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:26,384
You mean Rong Le?

200
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,202
You were cooped up inside the house.

201
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:32,090
You didn't know many of the policies were Rong Le's ideas.

202

I heard she once got her hands on "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

203
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:41,785
Indeed. She lost many things because of the book.

204
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:45,647
When she came back from Chen, she found the book once again.

205
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,635
That was truly fortunate.

Send this letter to Prince Li as soon as possible.

It was from a veteran.

He found this half of the tome by accident.

How old were you when the Creed took you in?

I was too young when they recruited me.

I was an orphan, I don't know my exact age.

How was your life in the Creed?

290
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:45,719
The children the Creed took in were either orphans or abandoned kids.

291
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,779
The training was harsh and cruel.

292

In each and every training,

293
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:52,525
we were divided into teams to kill each other.

That was how he survived.

There was even... more cruelty than we had.

302

There was a rule in the Creed.

303
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:25,679
Any, who were able to kill the Young Master, could regain their freedom and leave.

304
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,959
While the rule was in effect, he was the target of many assassination attempts.

305

Not only that, in order to fuse his mind with more hate,

I lost my name and my home.

Is there anything wrong with my child?

Ke'er? How is Man Yao?

332
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:59,957
It's nothing, both you and the child are fine.

333
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,558
Both of you are fine.

334
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:09,139
Princess Rong Le, I just remembered the tonics are still on the stove.

335
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:10,971
I have to go now.

336
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,299
She looks so distracted,

337
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,420
she must have quarreled with Wuyu again.

338
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,019
Should you check on him?

339
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,962
Enough about him, take your medicine.

340
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:32,428
Okay.

341
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:47,288
Ke'er? What's wrong?

342
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:49,418
Leave me alone.

It's all right.

00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,483
I won't ask.

346
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:20,832
Let it all out.

347
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:39,598
Wuyu, I have a question for you.

348
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,005
I have no idea how I am going to solve this.

349
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:44,495
What is it?

350
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:49,753
So, if a woman had to choose between saving herself...

351
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:52,673
and the life of her child,

352
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:54,921
what would be the right choice?

353
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:59,000
Silly girl, you are crying because of this?

354
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,574
You are still young, you are not married yet and have no child.

355
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:07,267
Thinking about this problem will only make you anxious.

- You don't understand at all!
- What?

- Your Highness.
- Brother.

[Destiny]

360
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,972
Your Highness, Princess Rong Le's health is getting worse by the day...

361
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:51,791
not because of any illness. She was poisoned.

362
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,296
She ordered us to keep you in the dark.

363
00:29:54,296 --> 00:29:56,323
I got this tome recently.

364
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:58,979
I realized the poison in her body is actually the Destined Poison.

365
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:03,456
The cure to this poison... is to use a golden needle

366
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:06,160
and transfuse it to the child during labor.

367
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,660
With that done, the poison can be completely cleansed.

368
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,540
But the child will have to use medical substances to prolong his life.

369
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,331
The vitals will become weak,

370
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:21,028
he might die at anytime.

371
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:33,560
Brother, don't be too upset.

372
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,430
At least we know there is a cure now.

373
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,379
As for whether we are using it or not, let Rong Le make the decision.

374
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:44,152
We cannot let Man Yao find out about this.

375
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,697
From now on, only the three of us will know this secret.

376

I recently received the things Fu Chou sent from Zhongshan.

I even asked the messenger he sent.

402
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:13,052
There was no letter for you.

403

We have no news on the emperor.

404
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,713
Maybe he is still frustrated.

405
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,768
He couldn't put those feelings into words.

406
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,809
That is why he didn't send us a letter.

407

Do you still... hate him?

408

I thought about all the plots against us.

409

I bet Fu Yuan is the mastermind.

But I fell for her trickery.

411
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:48,240
I accused him of all the blame without any evidence.

412
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,959
If I had stayed calm, if I had exposed Fu Yuan's scheme,

413
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,580
maybe all of us would have known the truth sooner.

I thought I was having another relapse from the poison.

So, you are willing to leave me behind...

460
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:41,946
and be so cruel to me?

461

I can't leave you.

♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

490
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,560
♫ We have been through so much ♫

491
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,860
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

492
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:58,190
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

493
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:05,230
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

494
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:11,730
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

495
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:19,590
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

496
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:25,060
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

497
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:32,380
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

498
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:39,330
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

499
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:45,740
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

500
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:52,480
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

501
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:00,270
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

502
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:35,690
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
