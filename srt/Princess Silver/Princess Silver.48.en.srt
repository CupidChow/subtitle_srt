[Episode 48]

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,850
[Man Yin Chamber]

3
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,240
Lady Rong Le, it's almost time for the morning session.

4
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,640
Your Highness, it's time to get changed.

5
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,580
Your Highness, you are awake.

6
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,460
Who are you? Why are you in my room?

7
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,359
If you are worried that Prince Li will blame you for this,

8
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,799
I will keep this secret for you.

9
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,799
Ever since I started to serve you, I have been deeply in love with you.

10
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,919
And now I am going to die for you,

11
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,980
I shall have no regrets.

12
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
Don't be ridiculous. I have no idea who you are.

13
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,020
Your Highness!

14
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,620
Your Highness!

15
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,679
Your Highness, you can't do this.

16
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,700
We are in the house of Prince Li.

17
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,340
Please, don't be so reckless.

18
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,340
You must not kill him.

19
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,759
Guards, lock him up and interrogate him.

20
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,919
Your Highness, you can't be so cruel to me!

21
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,900
Your Highness!

22
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,140
And the rest of you, get back to your work.

23
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,120
Miss Sun.

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,679
You betrayed Prince Li.

25
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,100
That man was not an assassin!

26
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,999
I was locked inside this side room.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,359
I peeped outside through a crevice in the door.

28
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,299
Ling Yue brought this man here... by sneaking him in from the garden during the night.

29
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,500
Enough of your madness!

30
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,279
If you don't love Prince Li, why won't you let me have him?

31
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,820
If you don't love him, why are you still holding onto him?

32
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,559
- She killed someone! Look!
- Let go!

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,959
- Your beloved Consort Rong Le...
- Guards!

34
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,200
...is going to kill someone!

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,320
Guards! Save Her Highness now!

36
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,239
Guards! Take her down, now!

37
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,079
- Yes.
- Look at her!

38
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,879
Let go of me!

39
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,759
- She is killing someone!
- Your Highness.

40
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,799
- Look! She is killing someone!
- Consort Rong Le has a lover...

41
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,799
and we all know that.

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,900
What a waste of Prince Li's love for her.

43
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,460
What are you looking at? Get back to your work now!

44
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,479
Your Highness, this must be a setup.

45
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,879
Chun Ni? Where is she now?

46
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,920
She was keeping watch last night. She must know something.

47
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,920
Prince Fanyang urges you to get ready for the morning session.

48
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,439
Tell them I'll be there in a moment.

49
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,940
- I will be there.
- Yes.

50
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,120
- What do we do now?
- Ling Yue.

51
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,500
Change my clothes for me.

52
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,960
Greeting, Your Highness.

53
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,780
What do the officers have to discuss today?

54
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,679
I heard Your Highness...

55
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,039
was found to be in bed with another man this morning.

56
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,439
While Prince Li is away for war, and you are committing adultery.

57
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,100
Consort Rong Le, what do you want to explain this?

58
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,639
The lover is just outside.

59
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,219
If we hadn't run into him just now, he might have been mistaken as an assassin...

60
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,199
and executed by Your Highness.

61
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Insolence!

62
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,719
Do not draw your own conclusions.

63
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,039
There are many questions to be answered.

64
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,119
We cannot draw our own conclusion and deem Princess Consort guilty.

65
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,159
Prince Li trusts Her Highness.

66
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,959
We still need to rely on her for national affairs.

67
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,499
Before we get any solid evidence, Princess Consort is still who she is.

68
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,960
Please, show your respect for her.

69
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,480
I think we should discuss this matter when Prince Li returns.

70
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,079
I disagree with you.

71
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,519
Princess Consort is the decision maker of the Imperial Court.

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,419
Her Highness' decency... is more than just a family matter.

73
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:05,539
If Her Highness is not loyal to Prince Li, then she might betray this land as well.

74
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,919
In that case, what right does she has...

75
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,019
to make decisions and bring order to the Imperial Court?

76
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,980
All of you are in high spirits...

77
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,039
out of your loyalty for His Highness,

78
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,400
that is a relief.

79
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,079
But I know better than anyone...

80
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,639
that I didn't do anything to betray Prince Li.

81
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,620
I am now being framed by people with vile intentions.

82
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,799
If I cannot prove my innocence,

83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,119
I am afraid Sir Cao is right.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,860
I cannot be the decision maker.

85
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,799
In that case, you are all trustworthy officers of His Highness,

86
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,460
I am willing to leave the investigation to you.

87
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,100
I hope you can bring me the justice I deserve.

88
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,300
I just came back from Chen not long ago.

89
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,559
I have no personal attachment for Your Highness.

90
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,700
Allow me to make the judgment for this matter.

91
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,599
Is there any objection?

92
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,119
You have always been righteous, honorable, and a valued officer.

93
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:08,439
I have heard from Prince Li about your wisdom and wise judgment.

94
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,199
I have no objection.

95
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,539
I assure you, Your Highness, while I am here,

96
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:17,820
I won't allow anyone to frame or disrespect you.

97
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
Pardon my frankness.

98
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,500
Bring the witness in.

99
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,620
Do you recognize the person sitting there?

100
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,399
Earlier this morning,

101
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,920
someone saw you coming out of her room.

102
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,780
It has nothing to do with her.

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,680
From the first moment I saw her,

104
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,959
I have been in love with her. It was me that seduced her.

105
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,790
She never gave me any promises.

106
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,600
He is spitting lies!

107
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,130
I have never met him before this morning.

108
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,679
I don't know him either.

109
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,359
But people saw him coming out from your room.

110
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,959
Princess Consort's room has always been heavily guarded.

111
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,120
How is it possible for this man to walk around so freely?

112
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,139
In that case, all who passed by Her Highness' room...

113
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,360
shall be brought in for questioning.

114
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,700
Bring them in.

115
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,119
While the two of you were in Princess Consort's room, did you see this man?

116
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:37,079
We were there only to help Her Highness get changed.

117
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,839
- We don't know anything.
- Yes.

118
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,359
Miss Ling Yue came in and chased all of us out.

119
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,920
We didn't see anything back there.

120
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,919
Take them away from here.

121
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
Bring in Ling Yue.

122
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,599
Officers, do not believe what this assassin is telling you.

123
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,719
He must be trying to harm Princess Consort.

124
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,759
Her Highness puts Prince Li even before her own life.

125
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,840
She would never do anything to hurt Prince Li.

126
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,319
Prince Fanyang, say something.

127
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,440
Ling Yue.

128
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,519
Simply tell us...

129
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,559
what you saw in Princess Consort's room just now.

130
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,639
I went into Her Highness' room, she was pointing a sword at this man.

131
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,239
He must be an assassin.

132
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,320
He was trying to kill her but he was compromised.

133
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,359
You said he is an assassin, what evidence do you have?

134
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:36,199
Princess Consort's room is heavily guarded.

135
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,239
How exactly did this killer sneak past the guards?

136
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,759
How did Her Highness find out about his motive?

137
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,399
How did she retaliate?

138
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,219
Was there any witness... at the scene?

139
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:49,239
Chun Ni the servant can be her witness.

140
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,639
Her Highness has had issues falling asleep since she got injured.

141
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,159
It was Chun Ni who has been keeping watch for Her Highness.

142
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,200
She was on duty last night.

143
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,139
Your Highness, was Chun Ni in your room last night?

144
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,100
Can you prove she was there?

145
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,940
Yes.

146
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,660
Bring her in.

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,039
Officers, someone from the house found a corpse in the well.

148
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,159
After examination, we can confirm she was killed... before being disposed into the well.

149
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,919
The servants recognize her.

150
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,040
It was Princess Consort's personal servant, Chun Ni.

151
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,279
- I killed her!
- Nonsense!

152
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
This has nothing to do with Her Highness.

153
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,919
Chun Ni was getting in my way.

154
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,640
I strangled her and tossed her into the well.

155
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,880
Her Highness didn't know.

156
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,199
According to the forensics, she wasn't strangled to death.

157
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,620
The cause of death was a blow to her skull.

158
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,020
She died from a skull fracture?

159
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,399
Your Highness, how do you explain this?

160
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,279
The servant must have found out about your affair,

161
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,719
that is why she was killed.

162
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,999
This man is even trying to defend Her Highness.

163
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,759
So this is why Her Highness looks so calm.

164
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,600
She killed the witness!

165
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,479
So he really is her lover.

166
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,239
She killed the witness.

167
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,100
Silence!

168
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,560
We only found the body.

169
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
This doesn't mean Chun Ni was killed by Her Highness.

170
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,159
Allow me... to conduct a search in your room to acquire more evidence.

171
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,780
Why?

172
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,519
The Man Yin Chamber is Her Highness' room.

173
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,560
No one can enter the room without an order from Prince Li.

174
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,919
Besides, there is no way she would kill Chun Ni.

175
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,360
Ling Yue, that's enough.

176
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,980
Sir Cao, I will allow you to conduct the search.

177
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,519
But it must be by someone I can trust.

178
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,519
After all, we are searching for evidence,

179
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,719
not a fabricated false proof.

180
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,619
Your Highness, I am willing to lead the search.

181
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,160
Do I have your permission?

182
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,120
Thank you, Prince Fanyang.

183
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,660
Prince Fanyang, we didn't find anything suspicious.

184
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,380
- If there is nothing here, then we can leave now.
- Yes.

185
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,340
I found something!

186
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,640
Your Highness, look.

187
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,600
A witness wishes to have an audience.

188
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,640
Bring her in.

189
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,800
Greetings, Consort Rong Le and fellow officers.

190
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,380
I am Sun Yali, the daughter of the fugitive Sun Jizhou.

191
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,279
I was a witness at Man Yin Chamber this morning.

192
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,799
I am willing to prove what happened just now.

193
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,740
I hope all of you... will let me explain.

194
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,120
No!

195
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,879
She is mad, you can't take her words as evidence!

196
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,439
Besides, she holds a grudge against Princess Consort.

197
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,780
Miss Sun is speaking clearly and with manners, she is perfectly normal.

198
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,679
You are just a mere servant,

199
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
how dare you show such insolence on the court!

200
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,579
Miss Sun, if you were there,

201
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,319
would you mind telling us what you saw?

202
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,879
When I was in Princess Consort's room,

203
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,520
she was holding a sword and trying to kill the man.

204
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,879
If you don't believe me,

205
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,680
you can check the cut on the man's neck.

206
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,399
But people came in before she had the time to end him.

207
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,440
A dozen of people can prove what I said.

208
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,980
Indeed.

209
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,079
After investigating, most of the people that were in your room...

210
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,679
saw you holding a sword against this man and trying to kill him.

211
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,340
Someone even heard Ling Yue...

212
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,879
telling you not to kill the man.

213
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,679
No, I was just reminding...

214
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,120
Silence!

215
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,380
Miss Sun, continue.

216
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,799
When I was locked up inside the manor,

217
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,620
I saw Ling Yue bring that man inside more than once.

218
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,940
This man disguises himself as a male servant to sneak in.

219
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,580
I didn't notice at first.

220
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,419
Now that I think of it, the side room I live in...

221
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,479
is right between the path to the back door and Man Yin Chamber.

222
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,759
This is why when Ling Yue brought him inside,

223
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,880
I was able to see them.

224
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,079
Miss Sun, you said you were locked inside the side room,

225
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,780
how did you notice Ling Yue and this man?

226
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,240
Sir, Ling Yue claimed that... I hold a grudge against Princess Consort.

227
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
She was telling the truth.

228
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,440
Both Ling Yue and Princess Consort were my close friends.

229
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,080
But I found out about her affair,

230
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,839
so she started to grow apart from me.

231
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,780
She even framed me.

232
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,220
In order to hide her secret,

233
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,860
She even locked me inside the manor.

234
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,199
I could only peep through the cracks of the door and window...

235
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,020
to see the world outside and ease my mind.

236
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,519
But who knew?

237
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,040
All I saw was Ling Yue and that man.

238
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,520
They came in at midnight and left at dawn.

239
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,319
Her Highness must be using that time to commit adultery.

240
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,080
You mad woman! What are you talking about?

241
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,480
You heard it all, she was trying to frame Her Highness.

242
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,100
Ling Yue.

243
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,280
I won't blame you for calling me a mad woman.

244
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,679
You are her servant, this is your duty.

245
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,679
But listen to me,

246
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,140
she will sacrifice anyone for her own gain.

247
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,800
You must protect yourself.

248
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,199
Let go of me! Do not fall for her lies!

249
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,240
Ling Yue! This is enough!

250
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,999
Miss Sun, you mentioned that...

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,140
Princess Consort locked you up to protect her secret?

252
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,880
Yes.

253
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,060
Fellow officers,

254
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,239
all you know about is the woman Prince Li married as his princess consort,

255
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,479
but you didn't know...

256
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,740
the same woman was once the wife of Fu Chou from Northern Lin!

257
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,820
While she was married to Fu Chou, she seduced Prince Li.

258
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,860
She is also Rong Le the Elder Princess of Western Qi.

259
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,519
The whole nation knows she was once General Fu's wife!

260
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,420
Shut it!

261
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,839
Don't fall for her lies!

262
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,640
She is clearly holding a grudge against Her Highness!

263
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,959
When we were in General Fu's manor, Miss Sun tried to seduce the general!

264
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,519
Now that she is in Qingzhou,

265
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,439
she climbed into Prince Li's bed instead!

266
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
- Enough!
- She is...

267
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,479
You mentioned the general's manor.

268
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,759
The manor of General of Defense?

269
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,860
She is Fu Chou's wife?

270
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,780
So, the rumors are true.

271
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,500
You vile woman!

272
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,239
You may have dark hair now,

273
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,020
and Prince Li believes you are no demon,

274
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,119
but if you are Fu Chou's wife,

275
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,240
you might also be a spy from Northern Lin.

276
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,300
Your Highness!

277
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,519
Why?

278
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,719
Why are you the one getting their love even when you betrayed them?

279
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,279
I was always righteous but I lost my whole family!

280
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,559
This is all your fault!

281
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,679
Let go of her! Let go!

282
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,580
Let it go!

283
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,980
Consort Rong Le!

284
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,280
How dare you kill a person in front of us all!

285
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,599
Do Prince Li and the laws...

286
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,799
mean nothing in your eyes?

287
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,359
- He is right!
- Sir.

288
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,839
This is not true, Her Highness didn't do it.

289
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,119
It was me, I killed Miss Sun.

290
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,519
- It was me that pushed her.
- Consort Rong Le!

291
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,020
What else do you have to say?

292
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,740
You committed adultery and murders!

293
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,559
All of these crimes...

294
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,080
are your doings!

295
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,680
Bring it in.

296
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,000
Inside the Man Yin Chamber,

297
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,180
we found a shard with a blood stain on it.

298
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,799
The servants confirmed this.

299
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,940
It was from the vase that was used in your room.

300
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,759
I bet after you hit Chun Ni with this vase,

301
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,479
you cleaned the crime scene.

302
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,639
That's why you allowed me to search your room.

303
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,759
But you never expected... or noticed that...

304
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,239
there was a shard left by the bed.

305
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,159
There were even blood stains under the bed.

306
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,060
You overlooked the details.

307
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,380
I have another question for Your Highness.

308
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,980
Prince Li sent several urgent requests...

309
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,680
and urged you to send reinforcement to the front line.

310
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,060
But you delayed the requests.

311
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,279
You secretly kept a lover and betrayed His Highness!

312
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,740
I have no choice but to suspect...

313
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,180
you are purposely sending Prince Li to danger.

314
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,580
You left him to die by the hands of the Northern Lin!

315
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,160
You want to take the throne for your own by killing your husband!

316
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,479
Prince Li trusted you,

317
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,080
but you are sending him to his death!

318
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,800
Prince Li arrives!

319
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,919
Wuyou!

320
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,000
I know you will believe me.

321
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,279
They didn't know about our past,

322
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,100
but you will believe me. Right?

323
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,719
About Yali,

324
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,759
I don't know why she would come up with so many lies.

325
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,580
I didn't kill her, it wasn't me!

326
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,420
Why?

327
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,280
Why are you doing this?

328
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Do you really think I can accept this?

329
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,060
Wuyou.

330
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,200
You don't believe me?

331
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,540
People can lose their trust in me,

332
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,000
but why will you not believe me either?

333
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,980
- Her Highness!
- The Consort is...

334
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,660
- Leng Yan!
- Yes!

335
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,900
Take this sinner... into the prison!

336
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,260
Yes!

337
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:54,720
♫ The fragrance of loneliness, the past is dense, pouring down in my heart ♫

338
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,500
♫ The rain is emptying out, a willing tumultuous surge, pouring out into old dreams ♫

339
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,340
♫ Select a pot and ask the autumn wind,
what are the use of vows? ♫

340
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,999
That is all for today. Get some rest.

341
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:22,440
Yes.

342
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,400
You wish to learn martial arts, too?

343
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,340
I can teach you a thing or two.

344
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
But you must remember.

345
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
Sometimes, not knowing any martial arts...

346
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,320
makes it easier to cover your identity and keep yourself hidden.

347
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,380
- Thank you, Master.
- Don't call me that.

348
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,520
Not even she is my student,

349
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,340
neither are you.

350
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,780
From now on, you will be Qing Hu.

351
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,460
Stay by her side, keep an eye on her.

352
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,439
If there is anything unusual,

353
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,680
report back to me.

354
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,460
Yes.

355
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,799
Our previous plan failed. Master is bringing this plan forward.

356
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,360
I understand.

357
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,900
Let go of me!

358
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,920
We are born under the same roof,

359
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,600
why are you the princess... and I am the lowly servant?

360
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,740
Xiao Sha!

361
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,200
Everything is set, bring Her Highness and come with me.

362
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,319
Brother, you look pale.

363
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,879
You stayed up all night?

364
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,719
Shouldn't you be in the camp? Why are you here?

365
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,620
I am worried about you.

366
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,160
They said she is locked up, is that true?

367
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,719
Brother, you can't honestly believe she is keeping a lover.

368
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,999
That is not who she is.

369
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,820
I know her better than anyone.

370
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,419
If there is nothing else, get back to the camp and prepare for the battle.

371
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,640
Your Highness!

372
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,959
Your Highness, a report from the prison guard.

373
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,719
Princess Consort went missing last night.

374
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,260
Xiao Sha and Ling Yue are gone as well.

375
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,959
Alert the guards, send out the wanted order!

376
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,799
- Yes.
- Leng Yan.

377
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,019
Lead your men on the search, you must find her at all costs.

378
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,340
Yes.

379
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,919
Brother, are you really going to kill her?

380
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,639
She is Man Yao!

381
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,239
She is the one you gave up your life to protect!

382
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,959
What is going on now?

383
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,580
I know, because of what happened to Lady Yun, you are very upset.

384
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,840
But this scandal about a lover and the rumors about Silver-Haired Demon...

385
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,079
are clearly lies to frame her.

386
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,280
Can't you see it?

387
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,140
Are you done?

388
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,580
Mind your own business.

389
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,600
Leave.

390
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,340
Shouldn't you be in the camp? Why are you here again?

391
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,039
Rong Le is going to get killed!

392
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,260
Why are you still messing around here?

393
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,940
What did you say?

394
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,919
Who is harming Princess Rong Le?

395
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,960
Explain everything!

396
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,639
Someone is framing Rong Le.

397
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,159
They said she is keeping a lover.

398
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,439
To make things worse, Wuyou believes the lies.

399
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,539
He sent her to prison. She is now a wanted fugitive!

400
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,960
I must help her!

401
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,959
- Where are you going?
- Let go of me!

402
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,639
- Where are you going?
- I need to find her!

403
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,119
How are you supposed to do that?

404
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,799
She is not in the manor or the prison.

405
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,879
The guards told me your brother was seen near the prison.

406
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:09,319
I bet he is the one that rescued Rong Le.

407
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,239
- My brother?
- Yes.

408
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,680
Where could they be now?

409
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,919
They couldn't have gone far. Rong Le is still wounded.

410
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,859
She is wounded? All the more reason to go to her now!

411
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,039
Calm down!

412
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,519
Listen to me!

413
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,199
From what I heard, her wound isn't too serious.

414
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,919
Your brother and Ling Yue are there to take care of her.

415
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,439
Don't worry about it.

416
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,680
She is safe.

417
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,720
Princess Rong Le and my brother are the only family I have.

418
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,060
If they are gone,

419
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,540
I have no reason to stay here.

420
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,340
It's all right, they will be fine.

421
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,660
Come here and have a seat.

422
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,079
Don't worry.

423
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,319
When my brother calms down,

424
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,980
he will bring Rong Le back after his mind is clear.

425
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,780
Trust me.

426
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,400
They will be fine.

427
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,800
Really?

428
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,439
I am sure of it.

429
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,159
You know how much my brother loves Rong Le.

430
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,319
When the rumors about the Silver-Haired Demon were spreading,

431
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,119
my brother risked his life just to keep her safe.

432
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,500
Isn't that right?

433
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,420
It's all right.

434
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,840
I should be on my way now.

435
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,980
There is a lot of work to be done back in the camp.

436
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,340
You need to take care of yourself.

437
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,179
When Rong Le comes back, she needs you to tend to her. Right?

438
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,260
What?

439
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,220
She was keeping a lover and escaped from prison?

440
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,980
This is impossible.

441
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,710
According to the scout,

442
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,919
Prince Li stabbed her in front of everyone and sent her to prison.

443
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,839
That was indeed the truth.

444
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,119
But Princess Consort went missing from the prison,

445
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,820
so Prince Li sent out an order to have her arrested.

446
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,900
Zongzheng Wuyou must be out of his mind!

447
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,199
With Rong Le's righteousness,

448
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,120
she would never do something so outrageous.

449
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,300
This is clearly a set-up.

450
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,559
Zongzheng Wuyou is no fool.

451
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,980
How could he fall for this trick?

452
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,719
According to my source, there are people...

453
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,280
that saw Princess Consort sleeping in a bed with another man.

454
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,239
They have both witnesses and evidence.

455
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,900
Perhaps this is why Prince Li lost his nerve.

456
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,779
Get to the bottom of this. Find Rong Le and report back to me.

457
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,220
Yes.

458
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,870
[Magnificent and Propitious Guest Inn]

459
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,700
Your Highness.

460
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,440
Quickly, have a seat.

461
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,600
Let me take this off.

462
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,380
Does it still hurt?

463
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,140
We have a search warrant!

464
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,039
Officers, how may I help you?

465
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,200
Have you seen this woman? She is badly wounded.

466
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,319
No.

467
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,319
Your Highness, the soldiers with search warrants are here.

468
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,239
I will distract them, use the opening to leave.

469
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,279
We have a search warrant! Everyone, come out from your rooms!

470
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,880
There is no time.

471
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,060
What do we do now? They are coming up here.

472
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,880
We will improvise as we move along.

473
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,420
In the worst case, we will show ourselves and fight them off.

474
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,060
Your Highness, this way.

475
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,799
Captain, are they the targets?

476
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,180
- Stop right there!
- After them!

477
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,760
Your Highness, someone disguised as us and distracted the guards.

478
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,560
They actually left.

479
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,359
Who could they be?

480
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,359
Who dressed as us and distracted the soldiers?

481
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,239
I was at the clinic to get some medicines,

482
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,559
a few men were asking around for your whereabouts.

483
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,660
I think they are from Northern Lin.

484
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,599
Your Highness, it must be General Fu Chou.

485
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,600
He knows you are in trouble so he sent help.

486
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,839
Whoever that was, the soldiers are gone now.

487
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:16,879
This place is safe for the time being.

488
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,459
We will stay here for the night... and leave at dawn tomorrow.

489
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,239
This is outrageous.

490
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,419
Someone framed you. But Prince Li actually believes their lies.

491
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,479
He even ordered to have you arrested.

492
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,079
That is cruel.

493
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,100
Your Highness, have some tea.

494
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,439
Her Highness is still wounded.

495
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,079
We can't keep running and hiding.

496
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,880
We need to find a place so she can get well.

497
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,840
The land is vast,

498
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,220
Prince Li's men are everywhere.

499
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,260
There is no safe place for me in the south.

500
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,720
As for Northern Lin, I will never step into that land again.

501
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,780
I am not going back to Western Qi either.

502
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,120
In this whole world,

503
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,740
there is no place for me to get shelter.

504
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,359
Your Highness, we can still head to Chen.

505
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,039
Prince Zhenbei is your good friend.

506
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,599
Besides, his wife is Princess Zhao Yun.

507
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,719
She is your close friend, too.

508
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,040
If you go there, I am sure they will get you a fine doctor.

509
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,479
Your Highness, are you afraid this might bring them trouble?

510
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:38,719
But I think Prince Zhenbei is not one that fears trouble.

511
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,759
He is friendly and helpful.

512
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,559
You even saved his life once.

513
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,360
He owes his life to you.

514
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,200
Furthermore, you haven't seen Princess Zhao Yun in over a year.

515
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,780
She would be really glad to see you again.

516
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,559
Very well. We will head to Chen.

517
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,820
I will ready the bed for you.

518
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,319
Your Highness, we passed the southern border.

519
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,420
Chen is straight ahead.

520
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,360
Your Highness, are you all right?

521
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,700
I am fine.

522
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,120
Pick up the pace and leave this place.

523
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,479
The Seven Asuras!

524
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,400
Your Highness, Prince Li is really trying to kill you!

525
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,280
Who are you? How dare you pick a fight at our border!

526
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,599
Princess Rong Le?

527
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,320
Li Wu?

528
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,679
Your Majesty, I have an urgent report.

529
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,220
Come in.

530
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,319
Your Majesty,

531
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Princess Rong Le was ambushed at the border of Chen.

532
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,740
Li Wu the bodyguard of Prince Zhenbei rescued her.

533
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,999
She suffers no injury from the ambush.

534
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,799
But she had a fallout with Prince Li.

535
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,520
Her previous wound has gotten worse.

536
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,720
Everyone in the whole nation knows about their fallout.

537
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,440
There are rumors it was Prince Li who sent the assassins.

538
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,660
- I found out...
- Enough.

539
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,460
I know who did this.

540
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
For the past year,

541
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,239
Zongzheng Wuyou executed the reformation in the south.

542
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,300
He earned the people's trust.

543
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,359
Someone is afraid he might grow more powerful by the day...

544
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,759
and has become harder to deal with.

545
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,800
So, they used Rong Le to create this mess.

546
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,919
The Silver-Haired Demon was their plan,

547
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,780
so was the scandal.

548
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,999
Little Xun.

549
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,599
Yes.

550
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,219
Ready the carriage. I am heading to Chen.

551
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:10,640
- But Your Majesty, your health... I am afraid...
- Their plan failed.

552
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,959
After luring Rong Le to Chen, they will come up with new plans.

553
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,820
The dessert I gave her could only subdue the poison for a year.

554
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,540
The effect would have worn off by now.

555
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,899
She may have consumed the Blood Raven Root and suppressed the poison,

556
00:42:24,899 --> 00:42:26,959
but she will have a relapse soon.

557
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,180
I must go to Chen.

558
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,460
Yes.

559
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,839
Any progress on the item I ordered you to search for?

560
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,080
This is why I came here.

561
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,980
This is half of the tome that I found on Mount Lone Frost.

562
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,220
The information you want is in this tome.

563
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,340
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

564
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,790
♫ We have been through so much ♫

565
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,270
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

566
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:22,490
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

567
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:30,550
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

568
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:36,010
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

569
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:43,880
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

570
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,360
♫ I cried when you leave and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

571
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:56,750
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

572
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:03,560
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

573
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:10,050
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

574
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:16,790
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

575
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:24,370
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

576
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:59,980
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
