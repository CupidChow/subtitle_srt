00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,531
[Episode 2]

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,100
I am Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

3
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,600
It's my honor to meet Your Majesty.

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,200
At ease, Princess.

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Rise.

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

7
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:56,796
- Xiao Sha.
- Yes, Princess.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Present the gift to His Majesty.

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
Yes, Princess.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Bring it in.

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,100
Your Majesty, in order to thank you for your generous gift,

12
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
my brother has prepared this returning gift.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,200
Please accept it.

14
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,400
White jade glaze cup.

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,100
Word is, this white jade glaze cup has been here for hundreds of years.

16
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,200
There is only a pair of these in this world and they are priceless.

17
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
If you use them to drink tea, the tea will be fragrant and refreshing.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
If you use them to drink water in summer,

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,600
they can cool you off, quench your thirst and you'll feel invigorated.

20
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
And your body will be revived.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
These cups are really intriguing.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,100
The Emperor of Qi has given me such a treasure.

23
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,400
Minister Yang, write a letter for me.

24
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,500
I want to express my thanks to the Emperor of Western Qi.

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,000
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,900
before our princess departed to come here,

27
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,500
my emperor had ordered me to pass on his words to you.

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,900
What is it that the Emperor of Qi has to say?

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,300
He said that...

30
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,400
the white jade glaze cups are indeed rare treasures.

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,000
But they are incomparable to Princess Rong Le...

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,100
who took a high place in his heart.

33
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,800
He hopes that your country can treat our princess well.

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,300
By doing so, the hundred-year deal between us two will be secured.

35
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,000
Of course.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Princess Rong Le is the peace ambassador between our two countries.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
She is undoubtedly an honored guest of our country.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
And she will be marrying my son.

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,400
We will give her the best treatment.

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,600
Your Majesty, Prince Li...

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,100
What is wrong with him?

42
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,700
I have already summoned him for more than two hours.

43
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,000
Where is he?

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,200
Servants in Prince Li's Manor said that Prince Li is resting.

45
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
So, he cannot attend the court.

46
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
- Wuyu.
- Yes, Father.

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,600
Go to Prince Li's Manor to summon him.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Bring him to the court no matter what you have to do.

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,300
Yes, Father.

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,900
Wuyou, come out!

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,200
Wuyou, I beg you.

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's attend the court, all right?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,400
[Simple and Unadorned]

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,400
Wuyou.

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,800
If you don't come out, I'll be sent to the royal tomb.

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Your Highness.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
We can't continue like this.

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,400
His Majesty is still waiting for us.

59
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't blame me then.

60
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,200
Father, Wuyou is here.

61
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,500
Prince Li has arrived.

62
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,200
Insolent! How dare he come here in this manner?

63
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,700
Father.

64
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,400
Just now, you told me to use any way I can...

65
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,300
to bring Wuyou to the court. Right?

66
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,200
Shut up!

67
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,400
Scoundrel, get up now!

68
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,900
Wuyou, don't be rude.

69
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,000
The princess is the peace ambassador between our two countries.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,100
I already prepared your wedding suit for you. Change into it quickly.

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,200
We'll seal this engagement in the great hall today,

72
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
and you'll get married as soon as possible.

73
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,700
When did I agree to getting married?

74
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Your marriage is already set.

75
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,500
Whether you agree or not, this marriage will go on.

76
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Guards!

77
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
- Change the clothes for Prince Li.
- Yes, Your Majesty!

78
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Your Majesty,

79
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,600
do you really want to use force?

80
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
If you really don't want to do it,

81
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
I can find another person to get married in your stead.

82
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,000
Wuyu.

83
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Father.

84
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Since you can find a stand-in for my marriage,

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,800
how about letting him consummate the marriage, too?

86
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Scoundrel, how dare you say that.

87
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,600
I won't marry her.

88
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,300
If you really want to forge an alliance with Western Qi through marriage,

89
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,700
please choose another person.

90
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I'm not sure about other things...

91
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,200
but in this Northern Lin,

92
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,000
we have a lot of princes.

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,100
You were chosen by the Emperor of Qi.

94
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,600
The marriage is already set.

95
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,800
How can you just change it?

96
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,300
Your Majesty.

97
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,800
Please allow me to speak my mind.

98
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
Please do, Princess.

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,800
When I was coming to Northern Lin, I was thinking...

100
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,500
about what my future husband would be like.

101
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,400
I was thinking that even though he might not be perfect,

102
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
at least he would not behave like this.

103
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
The Northern Lin's marriage proposal...

104
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,500
had described Prince Li highly.

105
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,200
It said that he was courteous,

106
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,400
brave, intelligent, and extremely resourceful.

107
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,600
But the Prince Li that I see is not courteous.

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
He is arrogant and rude.

109
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,000
He is not brave and intelligent. Just fallacious reasoning.

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,400
He is not resourceful. Instead, he is wilful and wild.

111
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Just like a kid that will never grow up.

112
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
He acts like a spoiled child in public.

113
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,800
I understand.

114
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Mutual consent is needed in a marriage.

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
I too, want to marry a husband of my choice.

116
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,700
And I want to have a happy and beautiful life.

117
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't want to move so far away from my country to get married.

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,800
But for the benefit of my country,

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600
I came to this country out of duty.

120
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,300
I as a woman can do that...

121
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,200
while a manly prince like you keeps on rejecting it.

122
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Can't you take this righteous cause for your country?

123
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,000
So all in all, you are set on me.

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,600
That might not be true.

125
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,400
I just hope that you can give us a chance to know each other.

126
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,900
But if you still haven't change your mind after half a year,

127
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,800
I'll do as you say.

128
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll marry another without complaint.

129
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,400
You sounded so righteous.

130
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,300
But in my opinion,

131
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,400
a strong country does not rely on alliance through marriage.

132
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Only the weak will cower behind the skirts of a lady...

133
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,700
to hide his own weaknesses.

134
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
Of course,

135
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,400
your self-sacrificing spirit today is very touching.

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,000
But I, Zongzheng Wuyou,

137
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,300
will not exchange my marriage for some benefits.

138
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,500
I'm not interested at all... in your half-a-year deal.

139
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,900
Do you have no interest or do you have no confidence?

140
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,800
You gave excuses and wanted to escape.

141
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,300
Are you afraid that you'll lose to me?

142
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,400
A taunt.

143
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
You said that you were strong.

144
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Are you afraid to take on this bet?

145
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Looks like the famous Prince Li...

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
is not that impressive after all.

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,800
We'll do as the princess has said. Half a year it is.

148
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,300
This court is adjourned.

149
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,000
Wuyou, I think your plan will fail this time.

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,500
Princess Rong Le is not an easy opponent.

151
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,300
What if she still forces you to marry her after half a year?

152
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,400
Nobody can force me against my will.

153
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,600
Although it's rumored that she is ugly, she has a nice voice.

154
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
She has a sharp tongue, too.

155
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,100
It'll be fun to bicker with her.

156
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Wuyou, how about just marrying her?

157
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
If you admire her so much,

158
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,000
you can marry her.

159
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
No. She is too capable.

160
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't handle her.

161
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:40,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

162
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,800
His Majesty has summoned Prince Li.

163
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
I don't have time for him.

164
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,300
If you don't have time to come to me, how about I come to you?

165
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:56,469
Father.

166
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
Father, I'll take my leave first.

167
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,500
Let's go.

168
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,900
I know.

169
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,100
You still bear a grudge towards me for the things that happened in the past.

170
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,800
All these years, you paid no attention to the country's affairs...

171
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,400
and you didn't attend court.

172
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,300
You don't even want to see me.

173
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,200
And I let you.

174
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,300
But today's matter holds great importance for our country.

175
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,400
You can't act recklessly about it.

176
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,800
During the war against Wei last time,

177
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,900
the crown prince had directed the armies with ill-ease.

178
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,600
In the end, they lost and fled from the war until they were...

179
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
forced by the Wei Army to strip off their armor. Such disgrace.

180
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
I have to bring back the honor of our country.

181
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,000
So, I have to declare war against Wei again.

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,500
And having an alliance with Western Qi can strengthen our hold.

183
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,600
It is of vital importance for our country.

184
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
Crown Prince is the one who made the mistake in the war with Wei.

185
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,500
What has it got to do with me?

186
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,200
I already made an exception by helping out with the issue in the south.

187
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,300
What else do you want?

188
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,700
I was very glad when you lent a helping hand...

189
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,400
with the issue in the south.

190
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,900
It shows that in your heart,

191
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,000
you still care for the country.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,800
Wuyou, if you can forget the past...

193
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,400
and let go of the prejudice and resentment towards me,

194
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,600
with your brilliance, you'll pioneer a great undertaking in the future.

195
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,500
You want me to forget the past?

196
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,200
Impossible.

197
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
And it's impossible that I'll marry...

198
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,200
that princess from Western Qi after half a year.

199
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
Your Majesty.

200
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,200
You are the one bent on using women to consolidate your power.

201
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
As for what I want,

202
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,600
I'll get it honorably with my own capability.

203
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
Wuyou.

204
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,500
Recently, my body is not as strong as before.

205
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,400
I'm already past my prime.

206
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,000
This country... needs a capable and reliable heir.

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,800
You are still in the prime of manhood.

208
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,400
You have so many women and sons.

209
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Your heir is the crown prince.

210
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
It has nothing to do with me.

211
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,200
This princess is as spoiled and wilful as the rumors said.

212
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,400
I never thought that this arrogant Prince Li would suffer too.

213
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,300
He always looked down on me because His Majesty dotes on him.

214
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,200
This princess...

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,400
has helped me to vent out my grievance towards him.

216
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,500
I think that this arranged marriage between Prince Li and the princess...

217
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,800
will be very unfavorable to you.

218
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,100
If Prince Li really marries the princess of Western Qi,

219
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,500
his might will be redoubled.

220
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,900
And sooner or later, he will threaten your position.

221
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,400
Minister Yu, you worry too much.

222
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,100
Before my father regained his lands back then,

223
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,600
as the eldest, I had gone into war by his side far and wide.

224
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm so much more popular than Wuyou...

225
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,600
who paid no attention to the country's affairs.

226
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Even though I lost in the war with Wei,

227
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,200
my father has never tried to demote me.

228
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,400
As for this Prince Li,

229
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,600
do you think they will really get married...

230
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,900
based on today's situation?

231
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,600
How wise of you.

232
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,800
You outmatch your opponent.

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,600
Your Majesty, Princess Rong Le has reached Northern Lin safely.

234
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
And she has entered the palace to meet the emperor of Northern Lin.

235
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Have you released the kite to search for a highly skilled doctor as I had ordered?
(Kite is the common name for certain birds of prey)

236
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,500
We had sent a team to Winter Mountain and other places the doctor went, to search for him.

237
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
Her Majesty has arrived!

238
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,600
- Step out first.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,300
Greetings, Mother.

240
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,800
- Rise.
- Thank you, Mother.

241
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,200
I had reminded you time after time.

242
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
Those who seek to be successful...

243
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,100
have to be ruthless and incisive.

244
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,900
Rather to bear brief, sharp pains than lasting ones.

245
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,000
Thank you for your teachings.

246
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,600
Have you investigated the assassination done to you by Chen...

247
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
when you went out from the palace?

248
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't you know that...

249
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,200
those people had already been silenced by death?

250
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Greetings, My Princess.

251
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,500
We have reached the Princess Manor.

252
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Please get off of the carriage.

253
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:02,216
[Princess Manor]

254
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
His Majesty had decreed.

255
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,800
Princess Rong Le is an honored guest of Northern Lin.

256
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,400
Make sure to serve her well. Give her the best treatment.

257
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,800
We'll do as his command.

258
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,500
This way please, Princess.

259
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
You are our honored guest.

260
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,800
We should be the one responsible for your safety.

261
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,100
Your entourage is new here.

262
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
They are not familiar with this place.

263
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,500
They need to get used to it slowly.

264
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,400
Your guard will be staying temporarily in a post-house.

265
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,500
No need to worry about them.

266
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,900
I don't mind with the others.

267
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,000
But my personal bodyguard, Xiao Sha, was sent by my brother.

268
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,300
Before I left, my brother especially reminded me that...

269
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,600
I can't let this guard leave my side.

270
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
If he even has to stay in a post-house,

271
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
I would not know how to explain to my brother.

272
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,400
All right.

273
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
Let him through.

274
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,300
This way please, Princess.

275
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,200
This manor was specially made for you, Princess.

276
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,400
The design in this place was made according to your likings.

277
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,200
We hope that you'll find this a home away from home.

278
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
His Majesty is deeply apologetic for the things that happened yesterday.

279
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
He has specially prepared some gifts as a way of expressing that.

280
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Thank His Majesty for his kindness.

281
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Madam Qiu Yi.

282
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,400
She is the housekeeper of this manor, Qiu Yi.

283
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,900
You can go to her if you need anything.

284
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,800
Greetings, Princess.

285
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Be at ease.

286
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,400
I won't keep you from resting then, Princess.

287
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,600
You may leave too.

288
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,700
Anything else?

289
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,000
You are still an unmarried lady.

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,600
Although Captain Xiao is with you,

291
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
he is still a man.

292
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
According to the rules, he can only stay in the outer courtyard.

293
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
I am the Princess of Western Qi.

294
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
As long as I'm still unmarried, I'll still be a Western Qi citizen.

295
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,400
This is none of your concern. You may leave.

296
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
Live in the same way as locals do.

297
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Please don't make it difficult for me.

298
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,700
I'm entrusted by His Majesty to take care of Princess Manor.

299
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm just following the rules.

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,400
What are the rules?

301
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,200
Since His Majesty has given me a manor with Western Qi design,

302
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,400
here, my words are the rules.

303
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,100
Leave.

304
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,600
Looks like you are not willing to obey my order as well.

305
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,800
If that's the case, I won't be staying in this Princess Manor.

306
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,300
Let's go.

307
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,496
Princess.

308
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,600
Princess.

309
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,400
Please calm down, Princess. I don't mean to disobey you.

310
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm just doing it for your own good.

311
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Xiao Sha.

312
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,800
Captain Xiao, what are you doing?

313
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,200
I should be the one asking you.

314
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,900
How dare you block the princess's path.

315
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,400
What are you trying to do?

316
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,200
I want to ask His Majesty.

317
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Are you treating me as an honored guest...

318
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,000
or are you trying to cage me?

319
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,700
You have overstated things.

320
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,200
I can do nothing when Prince Li rejected the marriage.

321
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
But if the servants in my manor dare to disobey me...

322
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,500
I think Prince Li wouldn't blame her...

323
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,400
for killing one or two of her servants to vent out her anger.

324
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,800
Please spare my life. I've learned my mistake.

325
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,500
You are the mistress in this manor.

326
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,000
If you insist that Captain Xiao should stay here,

327
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,700
I won't dare to stop you.

328
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,400
But if you want to leave the manor,

329
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
even if you kill me,

330
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll have to send some guards from the manor to go with you...

331
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,700
in order to protect you.

332
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,900
If something dangerous happens to you, even my death...

333
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
wouldn't be enough for me to atone for my sins.

334
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,000
Prince Li of Northern Lin, Zongzheng Wuyou,

335
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,200
is a very talented man,

336
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,300
the sole disciple of Qin Yong, ex-chief Minister of Northern Lin.

337
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,000
So, it's very possible that he has...

338
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,800
"The Book of Mountains and Rivers" written by Qin Yong.

339
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,600
- The Book of Mountains and Rivers?
- That's right.

340
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
The Book of Mountains and Rivers...

341
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,700
has recorded the rise and dip of the mountains,

342
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,400
the cities, the pools, and strategic places from all over the world.

343
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
It has detailed information about astronomy, geography, meteorology...

344
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,500
and the fastest way to win a war.

345
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,500
So, there is a rumor that...

346
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,000
those who possess the book will possess the world.

347
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,200
If I can get my hands on this book within half a year,

348
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,400
I can go back to Western Qi and stay by my brother's side.

349
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
- Princess.
- Do you have the information?

350
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes. It's in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

351
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
All right. I have to go out for a while.

352
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,400
You want to go out alone?

353
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,800
This Princess Manor is heavily guarded.

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
We need to find a way if I want to go out.

355
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,600
All right, Princess.

356
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Madam!

357
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Madam, such beautiful flowers.

358
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,200
You just plucked them for the princess, right?

359
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,300
How kind of you, Madam.

360
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,800
Miss Ling Yue, the princess is our mistress.

361
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
It's only right to serve her.

362
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
But you are not our mistress.

363
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
This pot of flowers is very expensive.

364
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
What if you break it?

365
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,600
Madam, let me bring it in for you.

366
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Have you no regard for the rules?

367
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Ever since the princess moved here,

368
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,500
as the housekeeper, I don't even have the chance to meet her.

369
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,000
It's all because of you and Lian Xin.

370
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,200
Princess gave the order to not let you in.

371
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,400
How dare you threaten me with the princess.

372
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,400
Captain Xiao.

373
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,800
This is just a misunderstanding.

374
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,800
It's just that I haven't been serving the princess lately.

375
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,600
Those who know...

376
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,900
will know that those two have served the princess well.

377
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,700
Those who don't will think that the princess is being petty...

378
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,400
and is still mad at me for the incident last time.

379
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,500
Madam, you think too much.

380
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,000
Our princess is very magnanimous.

381
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,400
She just complimented you just now.

382
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,000
She said that you are very meticulous.

383
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,200
And you ensured that everything in the manor runs smoothly.

384
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,000
By the way, the princess is going to award you.

385
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,300
She had asked you to gather everybody in the garden.

386
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,000
She wants to award everybody at once.

387
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll leave this to you then, Miss Lian Xin.

388
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
Thank you, Captain Xiao.

389
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,080
[Blessed With Latent Auspiciousness]

390
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,799
Please give these out to everybody.

391
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,300
Please ask the kitchen to prepare more food for tonight.

392
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,800
Tonight, there will be a feast for everybody.

393
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,300
- Thank you, Princess.
- Thank you, Princess.

394
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,000
There are enough for everybody.

395
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,800
Don't fight for them.

396
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:36,606
Take it. This is for you.

397
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,300
Wuyou, no need to strike out at father every time you see him.

398
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,000
Actually, he cares for you the most.

399
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,800
All right. I won't talk about it anymore.

400
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,300
Wuyou, look.

401
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,400
Look at what I've brought you.

402
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,800
Take a look.

403
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,800
- This is a good tea.
- Of course it is.

404
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
This tea set is not a normal tea set as well.

405
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
I got this treasure from the Rare Item Chest in Moon Embrace Teahouse.

406
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
I heard that this Rare Item Chest contains...

407
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,100
luxurious clothes and rare treasures from all over the world.

408
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I have to plead with the shopkeeper...

409
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,400
to sell me the tea and the tea set.

410
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,200
Wuyou, I know that you love tea.

411
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
If only we could go for tea tasting in the Moon Embrace Teahouse...

412
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,700
and take a look at their Rare Item Chest...

413
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,200
Moon Embrace Teahouse, right?

414
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
That's right. Come along with me.

415
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,400
This is indeed a good tea.

416
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,300
But I think it doesn't taste very pure.

417
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,400
It's not pure? Impossible.

418
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,500
I can't possibly lie to you, Wuyou.

419
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,000
Do you think you can lie to me?

420
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,300
- No.
- Fine.

421
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,900
On behalf of this tea,

422
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,200
I'll go with you this time.

423
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,400
[Moon Embrace Teahouse]

424
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,000
How rude. How can you just go away
after running into me?

425
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,600
Mistress, you are here.

426
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,000
We have been waiting for you.

427
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,600
Although it's far, I have arrived safely.

428
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,000
This teahouse is brimming with customers.

429
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
Looks like it's doing well.

430
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,100
Good soil to plant the tea tree in.

431
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,400
And the best water to steep the tea leaves in.

432
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
Our master has high aspirations.

433
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,200
Of course, we'll have good business.

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,400
You might be doing well.

435
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,300
But I heard that you are already carried away with your success.

436
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,500
Just like the kite that flies high above.

437
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,300
We are no longer of importance to you.

438
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,400
That is not true, Mistress.

439
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,000
No matter how high the kite flies, the master still holds the string.

440
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Since you are already here personally,

441
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
from now on, you'll be the decision-maker...

442
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,300
for every matter regarding this teahouse.

443
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Looks like you are the shopkeeper of Moon Embrace Teahouse.

444
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes, I am. Greetings, Mistress.

445
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
This way please, Mistress.

446
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Greetings, Princess.

447
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,900
Be at ease.

448
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,400
From now on, when I'm here, I won't be a princess.

449
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,900
You just need to address me as mistress.

450
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Yes, Mistress.

451
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:43,300
Before this, there were rumors about the princess of Western Qi being ugly.

452
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,600
Is that the work of Moon Embrace Teahouse and the kite?

453
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
You are indeed brilliant.

454
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,400
His Majesty knows that you didn't do it willingly.

455
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
So, he wants to buy you as much time as he can.

456
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,600
I understand the troubles he took.

457
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,800
We'll come back to this matter after half a year.

458
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,000
I think you know the purpose of me coming here.

459
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,400
We are still searching for "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

460
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,200
Can you tell me more about "The Book of Mountains and Rivers?"

461
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
Have a seat.

462
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Sixteen years ago,

463
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,500
there were a few major incidents in Northern Lin.

464
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,400
For example, Fu Yuan passed away in a fire.

465
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,800
Fu Yuan?

466
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,000
Fu Yuan is the youngest daughter of the previous Emperor of Chen.

467
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,600
Before Northern Lin reclaims their lands, they aligned with Chen.

468
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Fu Yuan was set for marriage.

469
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
In the end, Fu Yuan had to leave her home town...

470
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,300
to marry the Emperor of Northern Lin.

471
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,100
After the emperor reclaimed his lands, he appointed her as empress.

472
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,800
But after that, they turned against each other for reasons we don't know.

473
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
Fu Yuan was sent to the Cold Harem.

474
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,000
And she passed away in an accidental fire.

475
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So, this fire is related to "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

476
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,600
We are yet to be sure about the relations.

477
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,500
But there are a few other incidents that happened in the same year.

478
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,000
Emperor of Northern Lin's most favorite concubine passed away, too.

479
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
These two women were eyesores for each other.

480
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,800
But they died one after another in accidents.

481
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,400
Not long after, the ex-chief minister, Qin Yong, and his family were killed.

482
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,000
Word is, he was related to Lady Yun's death.

483
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,600
From then on, the Emperor of Northern Lin has imposed a ban.

484
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,400
Everything regarding Qin Yong, including the book, became taboo.

485
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Nobody has dared to mention it after that.

486
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
There is no word about it at all?

487
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Although Qin Yong is dead, many of his former subordinates are still alive.

488
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,200
I started my investigation from here.

Please inform the princess, Miss Lian Xin.

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,100
When are we going to start the feast?

495
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,000
The princess hasn't been sleeping well lately.

496
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,500
She is still napping.

497
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,600
When she wakes, I'll inform her.

498

I'll take my leave then.

- Ling Yue.
- She's gone?

Why is the princess still not here?

501
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
I'll go and bring the princess back.

If you want to drink tea in Zhongshan,

everybody will come to Moon Embrace Teahouse.

506
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,600
But if they want to listen to music and drink wine,

they will go to House of Fragrance.

508
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,800
The Flower Queen of the House of Fragrance, Miss Chen Yu...

509
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,400
is indeed a beauty that put the moon and flowers to shame.

But nobody knows her true identity.

511

So, Miss Chen Yu has news about "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

512
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm still not sure if she has...

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,200
any usable information.

She is an important lead.

You have to investigate more about her.

519

By the way, is there anyone looking out for her?

520
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,300
Miss Chen Yu is a beauty of her own.

521
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,200
Of course, she has a lot of admirers.

522
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,400
A lot of aristocrats from the capital want to get close to her.

523
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,000
Recently, I heard that Prince Chen has frequented that place.

Before this, you roamed the world doing business with your father.

But actually, we are using it as a cover to gather information...

and as a cover-up for the kite's activities.
(Kite is the common name for certain birds of prey)

533
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,600
So, this is the rendezvous point for the kite.

But this man holds the evidence against the higher authority in court...

that worked with local officers to sell posts and titles.

He doesn't trust anybody. He trusts only you.

Sir Zhao is just a minor local officer.

♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

651
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:28,000
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

652
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,200
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

653
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,900
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

654
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,400
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

655
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,900
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

656
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:04,200
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

657
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:11,700
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

658
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:28,000
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

659
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,600
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

660
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,800
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

661
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:48,200
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

662
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:59,000
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
