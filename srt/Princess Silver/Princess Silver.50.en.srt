[Episode 50]

2
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:35,455
Luo Yan.

3
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:38,074
Have you been outside for so long...

4
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:39,917
that you've forgotten about your aspiration?

5
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,500
I haven't forgotten about it.

6
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,017
You once asked me about my wish.

7
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:49,232
My parents died in the war.

8
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:51,422
I wish that there will be no more war in this world.

9
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:54,948
You said that you had the same wish that I have.

[The Books of Mountains and Rivers]

11
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:02,956
Now,

12
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,101
I choose to accept this alliance...

13
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,603
in order to fulfill that wish.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,014
But this is against the act of kindness and right conduct.

15
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:15,931
Kindness and right conduct?

16
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,812
What is kindness and right conduct?

17
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:21,888
Back then, when I had saved you, kept you,

18
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,130
let you stay in the manor, and taught you how to read and fight, that was kindness.

19
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,556
Because of me, you had stayed in Northern Lin for years,

20
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:31,604
you had endured humiliation until finally, you got the book.

21
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,204
That was right conduct.

22
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:36,605
Our original intention was to get "The Book of Mountains and Rivers..."

23
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:39,611
and take over the world honorably.

24
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:43,071
But until now, we still can't unearth the secret of the book...

25
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,722
although we already had it for one year.

26
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:49,301
We can't continue with this path anymore.

27
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:52,093
We can't be stubborn about it anymore.

28
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:55,325
Luo Yan, you are different from other women.

29
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,111
So, you should know better that...

30
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,897
discarding smaller righteousness for bigger righteousness...

31
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,988
is the best way for a person who is meant to do great things.

32
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:08,860
Now, someone has presented this shortcut to us.

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,730
We can achieve our aspiration with it...

34
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,518
while reducing the number of soldiers that we have to sacrifice.

35
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:16,631
Why not do it?

36
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,782
But if we can't be righteous on the smaller scale,

37
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,013
we can forget about bigger righteousness.

38
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:24,795
You can have no qualm about Prince Li and Rong Le's safety...

39
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,841
but you have to think about your consort's feelings.

40
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,162
As long as you don't tell her,

41
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,363
she won't know about it.

42
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:33,423
But if you tell her,

43
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,224
then our friendship for so many years...

44
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,653
will have to come to an end.

45
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,417
Your Highness, I have been hiding something from you.

46
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,163
Rong Le is the descendant of the Qin family.

47
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:58,749
And she is the only one who knows about the secret of the book.

48
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:01,025
So, you can't kill her.

49
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,965
That day, in the inn, you were the one who arranged for someone...

50
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:15,419
to disguise as me to lure away the soldiers?

51
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,123
If I can issue an arrest warrant,

52
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,264
I can make sure that you won't be caught for sure.

53
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:26,951
I wonder who the people are that had disguised as the Seven Asuras.

54
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,342
They looked exactly the same on the surface.

55
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,409
But their martial art skills were way off.

56
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,336
I had asked The Hidden Ones to investigate it.

57
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:37,771
If I'm not wrong, they were from the Creed of Vengeance.

58
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:40,983
By the way, in the letter that you had asked Xiao Sha to give me,

59
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:43,871
you said that something was not right with Ling Yue.

60
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,522
From the moment she approached Yali,

61
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:48,740
I already felt that something was not right.

62
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm not sure about it yet.

63
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:52,945
But when we were in the great hall back then,

64
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:55,210
it looked like she was defending me.

65
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,055
But actually, she was twisting the truth, her words were not persuasive at all.

66
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:02,740
And she had planned Yali's death as well.

67
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,537
She had made sure that it'd be impossible for me to justify myself.

68
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:08,886
Now, we are here in Chen together.

69
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:14,773
I want to see what other evil plans the instigator behind her has for me.

70
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:20,105
I found out that... that lover was sent into the manor by Ling Yue.

71
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,182
A day before, he had murdered Chun Ni.

72
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:25,499
And then, he disguised as Chun Ni to go into your room.

73
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,885
I'm right after all.

74
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,476
I treated her like my sister.

75
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:32,745
How could she snuff out a life...

76
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:34,881
in order to frame me?

77
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:38,179
She was sent here as your maidservant for the marriage alliance.

78
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:43,507
I'm afraid that since the very beginning, she has stayed with you with ulterior motives.

79
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:47,771
You have been together for two years, but she can still do such a cruel thing to you.

80
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:51,635
Looks like she doesn't treat you like a sister.

81
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,159
Man Yao,

82
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,783
once you have something to hold against her, don't be soft-hearted.

83
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,710
The medicine is done?

84
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:10,256
Yes, it is.

85
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:13,460
Look at you. You've slimmed down out of exhaustion for the past two days.

86
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:17,522
Give this to me. I'll send it to the princess.

87
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,882
Go back and rest up earlier.

88
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:21,658
You too.

89
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:01,969
- Who is it?
- It's me, Princess.

90
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,711
Come in.

91
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,904
Your Highness.

92
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:12,295
Princess, your medicine is done.

93
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,163
Continue to keep an eye on her tonight.

94
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,997
- Don't let her come near here.
- I understand.

95
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:39,755
Wuyou, actually, besides Ling Yue,

96
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:43,581
I saw the back of a person in Prince Zhenbei's manor that day.

97
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:46,037
It looked like a person that I knew in the past.

98
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:49,079
- Chen Yu?
- You knew?

99
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:54,181
After she took away the book, I had my suspicions.

100
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:57,697
Ning Qianyi came to Zhongshan in the name of the alliance.

101
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:00,387
And he had gone more than once to Moon Embrace Teahouse.

102
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:02,938
Before he came, Chen Yu was still acting normal.

103
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:07,592
As soon as he left, Chen Yu had kidnapped you and forced me to give her the book.

104
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:10,069
That was too much of a coincidence.

105
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,062
I had asked The Hidden Ones to track her as well.

106
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:17,990
And we found out that she was last seen at the border of Chen.

107
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,508
I see.

108
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:22,927
I came here to Chen this time...

109
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,109
for another thing actually.

110
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:29,531
It is about the warhorse that I had mentioned to you in the letter.

111
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,783
Chen is famous with their warhorse.

112
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,259
When Ning Qianyi took Zhao Yun as his wife back then,

113
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,173
he had given a thousand warhorses to Northern Lin.

114
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:39,189
Now, these warhorses have fallen into Fu Chou's hands.

115
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:41,381
He wants to build an elite calvary team.

116
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:44,230
We don't have enough warhorses. We'll be at a disadvantage.

117
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,995
If we can use this chance to buy a team of warhorses from them,

118
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,745
we will be able to solve our biggest problem.

119
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:56,461
Wuyou, I'm worried about Zhao Yun.

120
00:08:57,731 --> 00:09:01,564
She has fallen in love with Ning Qianyi and she is pregnant with his child.

121
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:06,267
If Ning Qianyi is really the one who had instructed Chen Yu to get the book,

122
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,792
tell me, what should we do then?

123
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,130
Let's be sure about it first.

124
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,608
Unless it's necessary, I won't do something that will upset Zhao Yun.

125
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,990
But if Ning Qianyi is someone with wild ambitions,

126
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,066
it won't be easy for us to get the warhorses.

127
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,767
Don't worry.

128
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,872
Although Ning Qianyi holds the military power of Chen,

129
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:29,458
he is not the emperor of this country.

130
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,197
I already asked Leng Yan to spy on the Emperor of Chen at the palace.

131
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,000
The Emperor of Chen?

132
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:38,841
He is the emperor who has just reached...

133
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:42,112
the age of 10 and who has just ascended the throne?

134
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:45,606
I heard that he just knows how to have fun

135
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,586
and knows nothing about public affairs.

136
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,406
- I wonder if it's true.
- Whether ifit's true or not,

137
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,642
we'll know when we meet him.

138
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,472
It's late already.

139
00:09:59,472 --> 00:10:01,309
I have to go.

140
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,233
You have to be careful when you stay here.

141
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,669
Don't do anything risky.

142
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,394
Be extra careful when you are outside.

143
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,397
- Small pendants and toys for sale.
- Fresh vegetables for sale.

144
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:47,726
Small pendants and toys for sale.

145
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:55,199
- Small pendants and toys for sale.
- Fresh vegetables for sale.

146
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,457
I heard that he ran to West Market Street after he left the palace.

147
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,282
He should be here soon.

148
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:06,254
Stop running!

149
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:08,713
Don't run!

150
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,611
Slow down!

151
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,750
- Don't run!
- Don't run, slow down!

152
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,832
Be careful! Slow down!

153
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,902
Catch me if you can.

154
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:48,641
A bunch of fools.

155
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:58,312
Move aside! Move aside!

156
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:04,826
Quick, move aside!

157
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,524
Quick, move aside!

158
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,154
Are you all right?

159
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:22,066
- Open the door!
- How dare you!

160
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,053
Follow me.

161
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:42,715
It's so painful!

162
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:45,222
Let go of me! I still want to look at their silly faces!

163
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,828
Let go of me first, all right?

164
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:50,449
You saved me. I can repay you.

165
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:53,600
Let go of me first, all right?

166
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,831
It's very painful.

167
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:59,672
If you don't let go of me now, I'll hit you!

168
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,980
Somebody help!

169
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:07,080
An adult is bullying a kid!

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,070
An adult is bullying a kid!

171
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,946
Somebody help!

172
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:12,734
If you have had enough, Your Majesty,

173
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:15,928
how about we use this chance to talk business?

174
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:22,972
All right, Prince Li.

175
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,609
You know me?

176
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,179
Prince Li, have a seat.

177
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:34,722
You are the one who sent someone to spy on my actions and whereabouts?

178
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,822
Not only do I know about your identity,

179
00:13:36,822 --> 00:13:40,450
I know about things that happened in Northern Lin for the past few years.

180
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,987
And I know why you and Prince Regent of Northern Lin are here.

181
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:48,171
First, it's because of Princess Rong Le of Western Qi.

182
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:50,249
Second, it's because of warhorses.

183
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,349
Am I right?

184
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:56,207
Word is, Emperor of Chen is young, clueless, and ignorant about public affairs.

185
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,705
It is indeed untrue.

186
00:13:57,705 --> 00:14:02,817
If I didn't do so, I wouldn't have the chance to experience your graceful bearing.

187
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:18,326
How could they let a ten-year-old take the throne?

188
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,534
What are they trying to do?

189
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,214
He is just a kid.

190
00:14:22,214 --> 00:14:25,451
Besides playing, he knows hide-and-seek only.

191
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,957
They let him handle public affairs.

192
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,237
Will he be able to do it well?

193
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:44,713
Who did His Majesty encounter today?

194
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,775
Just now, His Majesty almost got hit by a carriage.

195
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:53,436
Then, that carriage stopped dead in the middle of the road and blocked our sight on His Majesty.

196
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:56,699
We didn't get a clear look at who the person was that we encountered.

197
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:01,013
But we found out that the carriage belonged to the Emperor of Qi.

198
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:04,115
Rong Qi.

199
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:14,012
He didn't come here just for Rong Le?

200
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:20,093
Does he have... another reason to be here?

201
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,957
Do we need to send someone to keep an eye on him?

202
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:24,666
Send someone to check on him.

203
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,779
But don't touch him, I don't want any other complications.

204
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,474
Send someone to keep a close eye on Fu Chou.

205
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:35,346
By the way, Lin Shen told me that Zongzheng Wuyou...

206
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:37,696
has already left the southern border in secret.

207
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:40,729
Send more people to keep an eye on him in secret.

208
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:43,713
Report to me at once if you find anything.

209
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:45,764
That's it. You may leave now.

210
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,248
Yes, Your Highness.

211
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:26,229
[Written by Fu Yuan]

212
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:45,227
Zhao Yun,

213
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:48,950
what kind of a person do you think Qianyi is?

214
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,268
Him?

215
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:54,265
He is bold and righteous, open and aboveboard,

216
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:58,300
and is very attentive to me. He is a very good man.

217
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,339
If...

218
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,853
If one day, you realize that...

219
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:08,560
he is not what you think he is,

220
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,570
what will you do?

221
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,766
What do you mean?

222
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:18,208
Yun'er! Yun'er!

223
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,565
Come and take a look! Take a look at what I've prepared for our child.

224
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,010
Rong Le, come and take a look as well.

225
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:33,757
These are better than what I've sewn.

226
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:35,824
Of course, the ones you sew are better.

227
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:39,929
Yun'er, I just don't want it to be too hard on you.

228
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:47,047
This shirt is for a three-year-old, right?

229
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:49,719
You are even more impatient than Zhao Yun.

230
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,759
Of course, I'm impatient.

231
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,701
This is my first child with Yun'er.

232
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:56,919
I can't wait for him to come into this world earlier...

233
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,680
so that I can take a look at him earlier.

234
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,537
Yun'er, look at this.

235
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:06,191
Do you like it?

236
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,961
Here. Put them nicely into Lady Zhao Yun's closet.

237
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:14,632
Yes, Your Highness.

238
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,113
Let's have some tea.

239
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:37,596
Rong Le, when I was in Northern Lin,

240
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,840
I once gave you a jar of wine.

241
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,859
Have you drunk it?

242
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,626
I've already finished it. It tasted divine.

243
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,191
That's great.

244
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:50,714
We have many of the same wine here.

245
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:54,431
By the way, at noon tomorrow, I'm going to have a feast...

246
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:57,422
in Qianlin Garden to welcome Prince Regent and the Emperor of Qi.

247
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,757
How about you attend the feast with me...

248
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:02,608
to enjoy ourselves?

249
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:08,784
I'll pass. I haven't recovered from my wounds. I shouldn't take any alcohol.

250
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:12,540
That's right. Princess Rong Le is still unwell.

251
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,849
It's a feast for others, you can just go alone.

252
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,369
Why do you want to drag her in?

253
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:24,009
You have no idea.

254
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:27,734
Both of them came to Chen because they want to buy warhorses.

255
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,179
But this year, we have a limited number of warhorses.

256
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:33,708
I can only sell them to one party.

257
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:39,080
That's why I don't know how to choose between the two of them.

258
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,877
I hope that Rong Le can advise me on that.

259
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:46,203
After all, you know them better than I do.

260
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:49,319
- Fu Chou wants to buy horses as well?
- Yes.

261
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,661
Before this, I had given him one thousand horses as dowry.

262
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:56,365
I heard that he has trained up a strong calvary team.

263
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:59,540
If I sell my warhorses again to him this time,

264
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,716
I think his team will be able to send his enemies fleeing helter-skelter.

265
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:11,360
You have saved me and let me stay in your manor to recuperate.

266
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,490
You have asked for my help. If I don't help you,

267
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,503
I won't be a very good friend.

268
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:19,454
I'll attend the feast with you tomorrow then.

269
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,471
That's great. Here.

270
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,345
Let's have some tea.

271
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:26,702
Here.

272
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:08,810
- Little Xun.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

273
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,931
- Princess Rong Le is still not here?
- Your Majesty.

274
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:14,515
You still have time before your meeting with Prince Zhenbei.

275
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:17,637
Wait for a while more. She is going to be here soon.

276
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:29,040
I always thought that life was too short...

277
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,171
and time passed swiftly.

278
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,034
But today, I feel that it's passing very slowly.

279
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:38,961
Little Xun.

280
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:40,538
Go and wait outside.

281
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:43,374
Inform me at once when she reaches here.

282
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:44,845
Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:27,388
Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

284
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:29,860
Princess Rong Le is here.

285
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,448
She has entered Qianlin Garden and is heading towards Qingtian Chamber.

286
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,090
Let's go.

287
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,002
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- What is it?

288
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,356
Little Xun.

289
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:54,745
Tell Prince Zhenbei that...

290
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:57,935
I'm not feeling well today and I can't attend the feast.

291
00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:00,544
Yes, Your Majesty.

292
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:05,422
Keep a close eye on Qingtian Chamber.

293
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:08,062
Report to me at once if you find any traces of Lin Shen.

294
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:09,395
Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,895
Rong Le.

296
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,259
Although I really want to see you,

297
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:39,189
I'm more determined that I can bring you back safely.

298
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,879
This way, please.

299
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,986
Prince Regent really cares about Rong Le a lot.

300
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,916
You are here so early.

301
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:24,489
Prince Regent.

302
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:26,208
Have a seat.

303
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,556
After you.

304
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,187
Prince Zhenbei,

305
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:48,864
our Majesty won't be able to attend the feast because he is unwell today.

306
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,690
Please forgive him.

307
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,555
Emperor of Qi is ill?

308
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:54,458
Guards, bring the royal physician here.

309
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,206
Thank you for your hospitality.

310
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:58,616
This is just an attack of an old illness.

311
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:01,227
He just needs to rest quietly to recuperate.

312
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,098
Princess Rong Le, long time no see.

313
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:08,106
His Majesty misses you a lot.

314
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,837
He wishes you well.

315
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,241
Prince Zhenbei, I'll take my leave now.

316
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:21,474
He better be ill... and not plotting anything evil in the dark.

317
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,627
You think too much, Prince Regent.

318
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:25,879
This is not Western Qi.

319
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,145
These are the best wines in Chen.

320
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:35,297
We'll each choose a jar of wine. We'll drink till we drop today.

321
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:37,662
Rong Le, you can choose first.

322
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,683
Alcohol will harm the body.

323
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:44,839
Since we are here to talk business, we can skip the wine.

324
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,149
It's not easy for the three of us to gather here today.

325
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,182
It's such a happy day today. It's fine to drink some wine.

326
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,741
Moreover, Rong Le has been feeling down lately.

327
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:57,330
It will help her feel better if she drinks some wine.

328
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,378
Today, Rong Le...

329
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,109
This wine smells exactly the same as the wine you gave me back then.

330
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,822
You still haven't recovered. It's better if you don't drink.

331
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,129
It's none of your business.

332
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:51,399
Prince Regent is indeed a very good drinker.

333
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,522
I never thought that after so long, the three of us would be able to gather around again.

334
00:26:56,522 --> 00:26:59,527
Unfortunately, Prince Li is not here.

335
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:06,961
Is it really over... between the two of you?

336
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,825
Back in Zhongshan, I thought that Prince Li loved you wholeheartedly.

337
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:19,565
I never thought that he would treat you like this.

338
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:21,589
Rong Le, don't be too upset.

339
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:24,325
He doesn't trust you, but we do.

340
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:28,963
Qianyi, let's not talk about him anymore. All right?

341
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,561
Come, let's drink.

342
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:35,633
Whoever mentions him has to drink three cups as punishment.

343
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:39,981
Since you want to drink, then let's drink together.

344
00:27:39,981 --> 00:27:41,742
That's great.

345
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,735
Here.

346
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:55,121
Cheers.

347
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:07,663
Rong Le, before this,

348
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:10,723
I thought that you and Prince Li were each other's halves.

349
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,989
I never thought that Prince Li was not the one for you.

350
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:17,840
But this time, Prince Regent has made me look at him with new eyes.

351
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,473
He came to Chen in the name of rebuilding our past alliance.

352
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:25,997
But actually, he's only here because of you.

353
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,720
He came here despite the long distance.

354
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,831
Looks like he's really is infatuated with you.

355
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:35,983
How about you reconsider being with Prince Regent again?

356
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,916
Prince Li.

357
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:49,423
After more than a year, when have you become a matchmaker, Prince Zhenbei?

358
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,083
Prince Li.

359
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:54,997
Prince Li, you came at the right time.

360
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:57,932
We were just talking about you.

361
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,364
I never thought that I'd even see you in Chen.

362
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,208
Prince Li.

363
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,546
Prince Regent is here to buy warhorses.

364
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:13,830
He'll go back after the deal is done.

365
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,791
You had once sent me letters to form an alliance with me.

366
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,612
But now, you want to sell warhorses to my enemy.

367
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,170
Are you the only one who can buy warhorses?

368
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:35,286
Calm down.

369
00:29:35,286 --> 00:29:38,591
Prince Li, since you are genuinely here to buy warhorses,

370
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:42,823
how about we sit down and have a peaceful discussion about it?

371
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,122
I heard that Chen has bred a thousand fine horses this year.

372
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:05,531
I'm willing to exchange them for a year of my city's taxes.

373
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:07,411
What do you think?

374
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:10,306
The northern border is just a small area compared to Northern Lin.

375
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:12,627
A year of taxes from a city-sized country is worth nothing.

376
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:16,856
Prince Zhenbei, if you... are willing to cooperate with Northern Lin,

377
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:22,340
whether it's gold, silver, jade, food, or other goods, you can just name a price.

378
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,356
For the past year, after the transformation, the people...

379
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,784
of the southern border have lived in peace and we have a stable income.

380
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:31,517
As for you, for the past year, you went on punitive expeditions one after another.

381
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:34,355
Your national treasury is depleted. What do you have to offer?

382
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:35,981
No need to worry about it.

383
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:38,117
Northern Lin is a vast country with rich resources.

384
00:30:38,117 --> 00:30:41,874
Even if we went on punitive expeditions everywhere, the court can afford it.

385
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,340
But the southern border is just a tiny place.

386
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,276
Besides Qingzhou,

387
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:50,407
do you have any other cities that can be up to par with Zhongshan?

388
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,148
Stop fighting with each other.

389
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:59,189
I'm very satisfied with both of your conditions.

390
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,286
But...

391
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,084
Rong Le, how about you choose it for me.

392
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,910
She is the guilty consort of the southern border.

393
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,670
It's inappropriate to let her choose.

394
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:17,013
You are wrong, Prince Li.

395
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,231
Rong Le has already left the southern border.

396
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:21,783
And now, she is Prince Zhenbei's honored guest.

397
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:24,334
Why can't she choose?

398
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,585
That's right. Rong Le,

399
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,533
I'll let you make the decision.

400
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:31,193
Choose for me. I trust you.

401
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,049
You want me to choose?

402
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:38,232
You'll listen to me?

403
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,643
You don't have to choose either of them.

404
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:44,567
She is drunk already.

405
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:47,658
You let her make the decision in such an important military matter.

406
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:50,472
- She is treating it like a plaything.
- She hasn't finished her sentence yet.

407
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:53,317
How do you know she will treat it like a plaything?

408
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:56,663
That's right. You may continue, Rong Le.

409
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:05,028
These warhorses, don't sell them to either of them.

410
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:08,865
If you want to sell them, sell them to me.

411
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,806
Sell them to you?

412
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,671
Why do you need warhorses?

413
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:18,206
That's right.

414
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,437
Why do I need warhorses?

415
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,592
I don't know as well.

416
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:29,107
But I don't want to let them have the horses. Can I?

417
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,587
Rong Le, you are drunk.

418
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:36,162
Why can't I have my own warhorses?

419
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:41,167
You too, think that... a woman should stay quietly and obediently in the harem,

420
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,124
we can have neither aspiration nor our own troops...

421
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:46,899
and we can't hold power as great as men, right?

422
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:49,069
Rong Le, you are thinking too much.

423
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,580
Have a seat first.

424
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,070
Hey!

425
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,260
I was once an abandoned princess of Western Qi.

426
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,418
Then, I was the wife abandoned by Northern Lin's General of Defense.

427
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,390
Now, I am the guilty consort of the southern border.

428
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,823
In my life, I am abandoned again and again by man after man.

429
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,148
I have had enough.

430
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,194
I want to have power of my own.

431
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:19,656
From now on, I don't need to depend on anybody anymore.

432
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:21,439
Rong Le.

433
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,632
This is the jade pendant... you gave me when we were in Northern Lin.

434
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,640
Back then, in order to repay me for saving you,

435
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,574
you promised that... you'd agree to do me a favor.

436
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:42,116
Now, I'm going to use this jade pendant... in exchange for a warhorses deal.

437
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,574
But Prince Li has the same jade pendant, too.

438
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,397
If Prince Li uses it on me too,

439
00:33:55,397 --> 00:33:59,224
then I'll be a person who breaks my promise.

440
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,266
You can sell the warhorses to her.

441
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:09,032
I want to see how a woman with nothing will build her own army.

442
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:13,724
Then, what about you, Prince Regent?

443
00:34:19,735 --> 00:34:23,708
If that's the case, I'll withdraw from this fight for warhorses.

444
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:28,543
Besides, I'll bear all the costs needed for Rong Le warhorses.

445
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,479
No need.

446
00:34:32,598 --> 00:34:35,213
When I was married to Northern Lin from Western Qi,

447
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:39,189
the dowry that I had brought with me is more than equivalent to the taxes of a city.

448
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:41,778
You just need to give me back my dowry.

449
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:45,576
From now on, it'll be a clean cut between us.

450
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:56,346
Qianyi, it's a deal then.

451
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,800
Don't go back on your words.

452
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,540
Princess Rong Le is drunk. Take care of her.

453
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,720
She'll stay here tonight.

454
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,096
Rong Le. Rong Le!

455
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:23,706
Both of you. Can you not wage a tit-for-tat here?

456
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,279
Although I don't know what grudges you have between you,

457
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,485
we are in Chen now.

458
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:32,117
See it as a form of respect for me, all right?

459
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:35,188
If you have any grudges, please settle this in private.

460
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,370
Guards, bring Prince Li to his resting chamber.

461
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,730
Yes, Your Highness.

462
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:45,707
Farewell, Prince Regent.

463
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:03,914
What is wrong with you? Pay attention when you walk.

464
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:06,154
Are you all right, Princess?

465
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:08,689
Stop following me.

466
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:10,403
Yes, Your Highness.

467
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,084
It's me, Rong Le.

468
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,262
Rong Qi.

469
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:02,510
What are you trying to do this time?

470
00:37:04,197 --> 00:37:07,030
I already found a way to neutralize the poison in you once and for all.

471
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,781
Come back to Western Qi with me. Let me cure you.

472
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:12,275
I was hurt so badly because of you back then.

473
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,171
Why do you still want to lie to me now?

474
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:16,211
I'm not lying to you.

475
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:18,874
I have completed the three things that I had promised you.

476
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:21,416
If I knew that you were going to do it like that,

477
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,845
then I rather you did nothing.

478
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:25,400
Rong Le.

479
00:37:26,468 --> 00:37:28,700
Please trust me one more time.

480
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,425
I have been tricked by you again and again.

481
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:35,849
I have learned my lesson. I won't fall for your lies again.

482
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,423
Let go of me.

483
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,135
Let go of me!

484
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
[Hanqing Pavilion]

485
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:08,852
It's dangerous here.

486
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,669
Leave at once with Prince Li.

487
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:15,016
Chen Yu.

488
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:29,198
I never thought that after so long, you would still be able to recognize me in one glance.

489
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:33,459
That day in Prince Zhenbei's manor, I saw your back.

490
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:37,179
Back in Northern Lin, Ning Qianyi was the one who asked you to take away...

491
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:39,319
"The Book of Mountains and Rivers," right?

492
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,714
Why are you so impatient for me to leave?

493
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:47,307
Is he... going to do something that will harm me?

494
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:51,062
Stop asking. If you still trust me, leave now.

495
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,991
Do you think the problem will be solved if I leave?

496
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:57,197
In order to get the book back then,

497
00:38:57,198 --> 00:38:59,666
he had asked you to stay in Northern Lin for years.

498
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:01,757
If he really wants to harm me,

499
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,884
he will find me even if I leave Chen.

500
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:10,238
Maybe he is not as bad as you think he is.

501
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,843
You don't even dare to look me in the eyes.

502
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:16,183
It means that you know it very clearly.

503
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:20,113
If he didn't have any evil plans for me, you wouldn't urge me to leave.

504
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:26,474
He commands the court of Chen and keeps watch on the young Emperor of Chen.

505
00:39:26,474 --> 00:39:29,318
A person who craves power can't be a kind ruler.

506
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:34,156
You asked me to leave Chen.

507
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:36,754
And I want you to leave Ning Qianyi.

508
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:39,367
- I...
- Moreover, the book is in his hands.

509
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:43,510
We can't be sure what he'll do in the future even if I leave.

510
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,795
Why are you here, Your Highness?

511
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,551
I heard that Qianyi had drunk too much last night. And I heard that Brother Wuyou is here.

512
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,574
I want to meet them.

513
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,970
It's late already. There are many male guests in Qianlin Garden.

514
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,880
It's inappropriate for you to go in now.

515
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,349
Please come again tomorrow.

516
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:34,351
Princess Rong Le is inside as well. What's inappropriate about it?

517
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:37,553
His Highness put Princess Rong Le here because he wants to find a chance...

518
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:40,805
to restore Prince Li and Princess Rong Le's relationship.

519
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,835
If you insist on going inside to meet Prince Li now,

520
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:46,963
I'm afraid you'll ruin the plan that His Highness has meticulously planned.

521
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:48,793
I see.

522
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,918
Send this hangover soup to Qianyi. I'll visit them again tomorrow.

523
00:40:56,918 --> 00:41:00,663
Hopefully, all will be well between Brother Wuyou and Princess Rong Le tomorrow.

524
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:03,003
Farewell, Your Highness.

525
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,307
Gunpowder.

526
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,880
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

527
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,180
♫ We have been through so much ♫

528
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,800
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

529
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,860
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

530
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:13,950
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

531
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:19,370
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

532
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:27,400
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

533
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,760
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

534
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:40,110
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

535
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:46,980
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

536
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,490
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

537
00:43:53,490 --> 00:44:00,160
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

538
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:07,140
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

539
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:43,700
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
