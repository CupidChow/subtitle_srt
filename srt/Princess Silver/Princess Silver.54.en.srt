00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,135
This is why you carved this statue?

3
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:46,303
So that in the future... I could tell him...

4
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:49,894
his mother has died? Is that it?

5
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,399
Your Majesty, we are running out on the medicine.

6
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:34,060
If Her Majesty still doesn't come back,

7
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,349
- your body...
- This is not the first time.

8
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,200
When did my body... ever belong to me?

9
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:49,666
When it's time to come back, she will be back.

10
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,093
You may leave now.

11
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,780
I won't wait anymore.

12
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,949
Since you are so heartless and wouldn't let go of us,

13
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:41,796
when you come back, let's see...

14
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,498
who is the more ruthless one.

15
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,940
Impossible.

16
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,555
Impossible. He must be Wuyou.

17
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,386
He must be Wuyou.

18
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,020
Brother.

19
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,465
He treated me like that.

20
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,227
It's impossible that it would be him.

21
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,819
Impossible. Impossible.

No matter what danger we will face in the future,

25
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,758
I'm willing to bear it alone...

26
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,352

Ke'er.

29
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,016
This is weird. Where is she?

30
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,256
She's the one who asked me to come here, right?

31
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,680
- Wuyu.
- Ke'er.

32
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,612
I like you. I want to marry you.

33
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,993
I was supposed to die when I was five.

34
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:26,749
So, I've always had this theory that one more day in life is another gain for me.

35
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:31,899
And I've always felt that my life was fulfilled when I saw the morning sunlight of each and every day.

36
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:36,119
But ever since I knew about Princess Rong Le's situation,

37
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:40,523
only then did I know that fate in this world can come to an end just as easily.

38
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:42,800
Let me finish.

39
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,037
I know that Princess Rong Le will definitely sacrifice herself for her child.

40
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,320
Prince Li and Princess Rong Le love each other so much.

41
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,700
But they have to be separated by death.

42
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,304
Wuyu, I don't want to waste time anymore.

43
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:02,035
I want to tell you about my feelings. I want to be with you.

I... I...

45
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,919
It doesn't matter if you don't like me.

46
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:11,265
After all, I'm the one who fell in love with you.

47
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,195
I already feel better after my confession to you.

48

Where is Princess Consort Rong Le?

54
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,680
She left a while ago by herself.

55
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,290
She wouldn't let us follow her and she didn't tell us where she was going.

Can you follow me along to go and meet a person?

She asked me to give this to you and said that you'll understand when you see it.

Maybe this thing is the only chance I have to know about my real identity.

I can't miss this chance.

Yes, Your Highness.

Your Highness, I've already found her.

72
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,421
She is the maidservant who came with Empress Fu more than 20 years ago.

73
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:50,963
After Empress Fu was sent to the Cold Harem, everybody else was silenced with death.

74
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:53,771
She was kicked out before that because she made some mistakes.

75
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:56,621
And she has been living among the people with a fake name.

76
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:59,209
Yes, Your Highness.

77
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:06,073
Don't be scared. I just want to ask you some questions.

78
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,931
I am the son of Fu Yuan.

79
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,050
- You don't look like him.
- I don't look like him?

80
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,080
Do you mean that I don't look like His Majesty or Rong Yi?

81
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,111
Your Highness, please spare my life.

82
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:25,890
I don't know anything.

83
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:31,590
But I remember that more than 20 years ago, when Northern Lin was rebuilt,

84
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:35,479
His Majesty had invited the Emperor of Western Qi, Rong Yi...

85
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,626
to Zhongshan to form an alliance.

86
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:41,759
After the alliance meeting, His Majesty was so disgusted with Empress Fu Yuan suddenly...

87
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,049
and he sent her into the Cold Harem.

88
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:48,060
After that, Empress Fu Yuan gave birth to a son in Cold Harem. Am I right?

89
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,928
I...

90
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:52,245
Nobody should have known about it.

91
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,600
And Empress Fu should have forgotten about it as well.

92
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,720
His Majesty had killed off everybody that came with Empress Fu.

93
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,018
And he forced her to drink poison so that she would forget about everything.

94
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:04,184
He wiped off her memories with poison?

95
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,779
Starting now, tell me everything you know from the beginning to the end.

96
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,780
If I find out that you are lying, you won't be getting out alive.

97
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,880
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

98
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,194
I wouldn't dare to lie to you.

99
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,594
Tell me.

100
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:30,513
Empress Fu was once the Princess of Chen.

101
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:35,057
The father and brothers of His Majesty were too incompetent until Northern Lin was swallowed up by Chen.

102
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:39,319
So, His Majesty and the rest of the royals from Northern Lin had to serve under Chen instead.

103
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:44,190
After that, His Majesty met Empress Fu who was still a princess at that time.

104
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,964
She insisted marrying His Majesty.

105
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:52,019
And from then on, His Majesty gained the recognition of the Emperor of Chen...

106
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,764
and was entrusted with the military power of Chen.

107
00:12:57,418 --> 00:13:03,125
After that, His Majesty started a rebellion with Rong Yi and Chen was broke apart.

108
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,859
His Majesty got Northern Lin...

109
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,031
and Rong Yi got Western Qi.

110
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,400
As for the Fu family, after the family was annihilated,

111
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,717
it had been replaced by the Ning family we see now.

112
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:18,885
They plotted and managed to usurp the throne to Chen.

113
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,000
And because of that, His Majesty had invited the emperor of Western Qi,

114
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,916
Rong Yi, after that to Zhongshan to form an alliance.

115
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:35,039
But he never thought that something would happen during the alliance meeting. Am I right?

116
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,747
Yes.

117
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:39,949
Rong Yi saw the beauty of Lady Yun by chance...

118
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,839
and he asked His Majesty for her.

119
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,460
His Majesty and Lady Yun had loved each other since young.

120
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,438
And they managed to get back together only after the country was rebuilt.

121
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:48,533
Of course, he wouldn't let go of her.

122
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:52,259
But Northern Lin was too new. He didn't dare to turn down Western Qi just like that.

123
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,144
So, he fed Empress Fu poisoned and gave her to Rong Yi.

124
00:13:57,144 --> 00:14:00,160
His Majesty had always seen Empress Fu...

125
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,720
as the witness to his humiliation for surrendering to Chen.

126
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,200
He had never treated her wholeheartedly.

127
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
After she was abased by Rong Yi,

128
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,758
His Majesty sent her straight into the Cold Harem.

129
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,300
In order to conceal the ugly truth, His Majesty had killed off all the people that served her.

130
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,400
And he gave her a poison called the Destined Poison...

131
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,970
so that she would lose all of her memories.

132
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,949
It's all right. You can leave now.

133
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,740
It's him! Don't kill me, Zongzheng Yunhe!

134
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,259
Because of Lady Yun that wench, he's going to give me to the emperor of Western Qi to be humiliated!

135
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,320
You'd fooled us for more than 20 years in order to...

136
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,323
in order to take revenge on my real parents.

137
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,501
If I'm not your son,

138
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:02,319
then who is the child that you had given birth to in the Cold Harem?

139
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,785
Is he still alive or is he dead?

140
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:12,547
What other evil plots do you have that you haven't told me yet?

141
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,765
I really pity you.

142
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,686
Until now,

143
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:21,695
you still don't know who your real enemy is.

144
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:25,189
I feel really sad for you.

00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:36,275
Write a secret letter to the Emperor of Western Qi.

147
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:39,860
Now, Rong Qi might be the only one who knows the truth.

148
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,240
Yes, Your Highness.

149
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,560
Go.

150
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:59,364
Hen Xiang, you have some questions for Consort Rong Le. Right?

151
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:05,219
Xiang Ying, can you go out for a while?

152
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:08,634
I have something that I need to ask her in private.

153
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,978
Long time no see.

154
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:26,084
What is the purpose of you asking for me?

155
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:30,641
Nian!

156
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:35,653
Nian! Good girl, don't cry.

157
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:38,853
Don't cry, Nian. Be a good girl.

158
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:41,959
- Nian.
- Can you let me hold her?

159
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:46,368
Come.

160
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,180
There now, don't cry.

00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,960
Such a good girl.

162
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:02,120
She is very naughty.

163
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,919
Besides Xiang Ying, you are the second person who can handle her.

164
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,890
I heard that you are pregnant as well.

165
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,351
You'll be a good mother.

166
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:13,948
Unlike me.

167
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,587
I don't know.

168
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,742
I just hope that our children can grow up safely.

169
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:27,219
I don't want them to drift around the world like us without family and friends.

170
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
Can I ask you a question?

171
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,218
The old manor of Qin family,

172
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:55,794
that became Yu's family fort after that has a secret room.

173
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:57,883
You went into it before, right?

174
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,519
The woman who had fought with me back then... was you?

175
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,423
So, not only do you know the strategies for the People-Based Transformation,

176
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,043
you know about the secret of the Qin family's old manor.

177
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:21,413
How did you know?

178
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:28,005
This wind bell.

179
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:32,834
Somebody gave it to you, right?

180
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:36,186
Xiang!

181
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:37,587
What is it, Sister?

182
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:40,124
This is for you.

183
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:44,540
So pretty. Thank you, Sister Man. I like it a lot.

184
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,094
You are Qin Yong's daughter,

185
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,960
Qin Xiang?

186
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,617
Yes.

187
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:03,597
I am Qin Xiang.

188
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,813
The Qin family has another daughter.

189
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:09,309
Her name is Qin Man.

190
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,221
Although I've lost my memory,

191
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,307
ever since I reached Northern Lin,

192
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:22,776
I've always dreamed about two little girls in my dream,

193
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:27,187
playing on the swing together, sitting on a wooden horses...

194
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:29,483
and reciting a poem.

195
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,274
When I was young, Father always told me that...

196
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:35,440
daughters are not necessarily inferior to sons.

197
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,489
So, we should study books, music, and have our own aspirations.

198
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:43,339
So, others had learned about Guan Ju's poems first...

199
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:47,760
while we had studied about...

200
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,343
the Grace of Emperor Wen first.

201
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,480
"Emperor Wen watches from Heaven,

202
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,137
shining bright and bringing us light.

203
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,800
The Zhou kingdom has its age,

204
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,560
but the fate of the nation is yet to be known.

205
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,159
How glorious Zhou Kingdom is.

206
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,829
It has done as Heaven says.

207
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:14,900
Emperor Wen walks up to Heaven.

208
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,362
And how mighty he is, standing beside God.

209
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:21,961
The reputation of the diligent Emperor Wen spreads far and wide forever.

210
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:26,360
God awards him with the Zhou Kingdom and blesses all of his descendants.

211
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,403
All of Emperor Wen's descendants are blessed with unbreakable bloodlines.

212
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:35,191
And the ministers who work for Zhou are honored and respected forever.

213
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:39,626
They are honored, respected, and with great vision and farsightedness.

214
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:43,981
Many people with great talents are born in this kingdom.

215
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:48,392
The kingdom grows into power because of them as pillars.

216
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:52,715
With so many capable people around, Emperor Wen can finally be in peace."

217
00:20:59,463 --> 00:21:01,383
Sister.

218
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:07,123
Finally, I've found you.

219
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,380
Sister.

220
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,918
[Spirit Table of the Qin Family]

221
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,975
Father. Mother. Finally, I've brought back my sister.

222
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,920
[Spirit Table of the Qin Family]

223
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:32,018
Wuyou, I want to be alone...

224
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:36,138
to think about the future of our child.

225
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,618
I have to leave your side for a while...

226
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:44,086
to make a decision that only I can make.

227
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:47,761
I have someone with me who will protect me

228
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:50,616
Don't worry about me.

229
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,835
And don't look for me.

230
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:55,200
When it's time to come back,

231
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,145
we will meet each other again.

232
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:01,545
[To: Wuyou]

233
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:11,920
Wuyou, I just heard that Man Yao is gone.

234
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,919
- What is she...
- I'm worried that after this,

235
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,920
she is going to end her life alone in peace.

236
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,984
- What?
- Send someone to look for her at once then.

237
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:22,725
Wuyou, you always did as she said.

238
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:25,127
But this is a life and death matter.

239
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
- She can't be so willful about it.
- That's right.

240
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,125
I'll send someone to look for Man Yao.

241
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,705
Wuyu, look for Ke'er now.

242
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:34,661
If Man Yao's body can't take it anymore,

243
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,751
I'm afraid that she will ask Ke'er for her help.

244
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:39,334
We can't let Xiao Ke keep Man Yao's secret from us anymore.

245
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,340
Yes, Wuyou. Don't worry.

246
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,079
Ke'er has become more mature.

247
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,013
She knows what is serious and what is not.

248
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:15,040
How about... you stay here tonight?

249
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,765
Do you want me to ask Xiang Ying to send a message to the royal manor...

250
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,045
so that they won't worry about you?

251
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:30,807
I don't want to go back yet.

252
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:32,944
When I leave,

253
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:35,120
I'd already left him a letter.

254
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,924
I asked him not to look for me.

255
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:40,475
Sister, is something weighing you down?

256
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:42,386
Whenever you look at the child,

257
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:44,967
your eyes look so solemn.

258
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:49,535
That's not true.

259
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:51,460
I just feel bad that I can't...

260
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,520
remember everything from the past still.

261
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,185
How about you tell me something from our past...

262
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:02,845
and about how you survived all these years.

263
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,413
I...

264
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,940
In a nutshell,

265
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,034
I didn't fulfill any of the hopes that father...

266
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,454
had put on us back then.

267
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:16,752
The Creed of Vengeance has turned me into a scary person.

268
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:19,917
It even made me hurt you like that back then.

269
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:25,045
You've done very well already.

270
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,700
The world is not a kind place.

271
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,024
It's good that you can live well like this with your own family...

272
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:31,801
and your own child.

273
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:33,484
If our parents were still alive,

274
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:35,621
I'm sure that they would be happy for you.

275
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,461
But until now, I still haven't avenged our parents yet.

276
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:44,399
The royal family of Northern Lin annihilated our family and separated us.

277
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,900
I had the chance to kill that useless emperor while I was in the palace.

278
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,580
But I was too soft-hearted.

279
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,260
I never thought that he'd die in someone else's hands.

280
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,100
He has been let off lightly.

281
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,060
Luckily you didn't commit the crime of murder.

282
00:25:57,812 --> 00:26:02,500
Actually, although His Majesty is the master of the nation...

283
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,213
and in control of others' lives,

284
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:07,066
he never thought that...

285
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,135
he was actually the same as us.

286
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,246
All of us were fooled by destiny.

287
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:14,200
He is separated from his child as well.

288
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,480
His real son... was beside him.

289
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,791
But he had treated him like an enemy.

290
00:26:22,577 --> 00:26:25,170
I just heard that the north and south are going to negotiate for peace.

291
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:28,401
Are you saying that Fu Chou...

292
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,545
He and Wuyou...

293
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:37,860
are actually twins who belong to Lady Yun.

294
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,420
The Qin family was exterminated...

295
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,912
as a part of Fu Yuan's revenge as well.

296
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:50,404
His Majesty was the one who gave the order, but he was tricked as well.

297
00:26:50,404 --> 00:26:53,760
And even as to why we were separated...

298
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,960
and why I lost my memories,

299
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,137
I'm afraid that they were the doings of Fu Yuan and the Creed of Vengeance.

300
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:01,194
They are our real enemies.

301
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:06,445
What?

302
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:11,593
How could it be like this?

303
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:17,336
If I had targeted the wrong enemy for half of my life,

304
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:20,744
then I had been living in the biggest joke ever in this life.

305
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:23,496
Fu Chou as well.

306
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:27,577
He had suffered so many years of bone-piercing pain.

307
00:27:27,577 --> 00:27:29,362
If he knew about the truth,

308
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:31,511
how is he going to face it?

309
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:37,530
How could it be like this?

310
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,132
How could it be like this?

311
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:45,183
How could it be like this?

312
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,563
Xiang.

313
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:52,468
We should be grateful that...

314
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:55,748
we get to know the truth before it's really too late, right?

315
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:00,588
Come.

316
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:06,524
If you are worried about Fu Chou,

317
00:28:06,524 --> 00:28:08,950
have you ever thought about...

318
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,677
bringing your child to go and meet him?

319
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:14,027
No.

320
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,025
It's already the end between us.

321
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:18,694
I won't pester him anymore.

322
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:21,011
I can live very well by myself.

323
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,520
Now, I've found you again.

324
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,196
God has already been very kind to me.

325
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,239
Don't worry about me, Sister.

326
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:40,839
The most important thing now...

327
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,217
is for you to take care of yourself and the child in your womb.

328
00:28:43,217 --> 00:28:45,128
Rest earlier.

329
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:10,017
Suddenly, I remember the time when we were both drunk in General's Manor.

330
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:13,090
We had slept together without our guards up.

331
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:18,350
Maybe this is our destiny as sisters in the unseen world...

332
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,708
that has brought us together without us realizing about it.

333
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,601
Arrival of Her Majesty!

334
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,324
Greetings, Your Majesty.

335
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:02,340
Where is His Majesty?

336
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,940
I left the palace for one year already.

337
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,852
Is His Majesty still avoiding me?

338
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,535
Replying to Your Majesty.

339
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:15,525
His Majesty has a message to be passed on to you.

340
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:25,880
He said that he will no longer be a part of his parents' revenge.

341
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,524
He doesn't fear death. He just wishes for his freedom.

342
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:34,199
He won't allow you to create another half-dead person...

343
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,781
just like him anymore.

344
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:44,539
He is my son.

345
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:48,100
Nobody knows him better than I do.

346
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,200
[To: Wu You]

347
00:31:02,534 --> 00:31:04,634
Your Highness.

348
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:07,220
Still no news from Western Qi?

349
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,680
Yes, I had urged them a few times.

350
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,320
But the person we sent there heard some news.

351
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,446
Word is, the Emperor of Western Qi is not in the palace.

352
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:16,906
And nobody knows if he's still alive or dead.

353
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:22,480
Your Highness, about His Majesty and Fu Yuan's disappearance,

354
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,780
should we inform Qingzhou about it?

355
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,059
I understand.

356
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,880
I'll continue to search for His Majesty.

357
00:31:48,883 --> 00:31:53,927
Have you sent half of the medical book to the person who needed it?

358
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,900
Yes. I think Zongzheng Wuyou knows how to neutralize the poison now.

359
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,502
The most painful thing... in this world...

360
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:26,294
shouldn't be experienced by me alone.

361
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:30,234
I want to see what kind of choice...

362
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:32,119
Zongzheng Wuyou will make.

363
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:37,530
I'm afraid that this good show... will be ruined by Rong Qi.

364
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:41,144
He has left the palace. I'm sure it's because of that girl again.

365
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:45,055
It's your fault... for being so incompetent.

366
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:48,550
You let him destroy our plan in Chen.

367
00:32:50,162 --> 00:32:52,267
I already told you that...

368
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:55,235
there were a lot of things that we need to do behind his back.

369
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:57,869
Since our previous plans are not successful,

370
00:32:57,869 --> 00:33:00,001
how about we do something more straightforward?

371
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:03,780
Use a life to force Zongzheng Wuyou and Fu Chou to fight against each other.

372
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,227
We have more than one... bargaining chip in our hands.

373
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:12,770
I'm tired.

374
00:33:13,313 --> 00:33:17,871
You can go ahead... with your plan.

375
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:45,372
Miss Ke'er, it's me.

376
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,746
Why are you here, Xiang...

377
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,408
Miss Ke'er, you have to come with me.

378
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,422
Consort Rong Le has relapsed again. She has been unconscious for one day.

379
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:58,899
Please go and check on her in secret.

380
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,503
Don't alert His Highness.

381
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:02,073
- But...
- Say no more.

382
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,097
This is an emergency. Let's go.

383
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,150
Just now, I wanted to tell you that...

384
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,331
you won't be able to keep it a secret.

385
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:45,857
Xiang'er.

386
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:48,205
Sister.

387
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:49,801
You are awake, Sister.

388
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,450
Sister.

389
00:34:52,981 --> 00:34:54,308
Finally, you are awake.

390
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:55,890
You'd given me a fright.

391
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,810
You've been unconscious for a whole day.

392
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,860
I don't know what to do.

393
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,779
Xiang Ying has gone out to get a physician.

394
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:03,720
I'm fine.

395
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,552
I just have hypersomnia... because I'm pregnant.

396
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:12,335
Sister, don't lie to me.

397
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:13,576
I'm a mother, too.

398
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:16,034
Even pregnant women won't sleep so long like that.

399
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:18,392
Before this, I already heard that you have an old illness.

400
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,387
Now, you insist on not going back to the royal manor.

401
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:22,284
What actually happened?

402
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,266
Are you sick?

403
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:26,818
Or is there something wrong with the child in your womb?

404
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,700
Tell me. What happened?

405
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,152
I was in the Creed of Vengeance for so long.

406
00:35:38,152 --> 00:35:40,072
You won't be able to fool me.

407
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,540
All right. I'll tell you.

408
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:00,190
What did you say?

409
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,038
Why don't you proceed with that cure?

410
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:07,077
He is right. You can still have children later.

411
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,772
But your time has run out.

412
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:12,493
Xiang, you are a mother too.

413
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:14,576
If you were in my shoes,

414
00:36:14,576 --> 00:36:18,900
would you go and risk your child's health for your own survival?

415
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,694
- But...
- Enough.

416
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:23,570
Don't be sad.

417
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,123
I'm hungry. Go and get me something to eat.

418
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:28,690
Hurry.

419
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,660
Go. I'm hungry already.

420
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,280
Go now.

421
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,099
Hurry on. Go now, quick.

424
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:31,700
♫ I wait for the warmth of your gaze to melt it ♫

♫ I miss you but I can only gaze at you in silence ♫

427
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:43,239
I will send someone to guard this place.

428
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,238
- Take good care of her.
- Yes, Your Highness.

Princess Rong Le! I missed you so much.

432
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,980
I'm going to come in and read your pulse now.

♫ I'm willing to wipe away your blood and wounds for you ♫

434

Wuyou, because I'm scared that I will give in...

435
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,290
I don't dare to see you and do as you say...

436
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,751
and ruin the life of our child.

437
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,230
[Qingzhou Royal Mansion]

438
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,580
Is Rong Qi the one who put the poison into Man Yao?

439
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,008
I really don't know.

440
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:40,500
But the cure that she had taken before this...

441
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,960
was indeed found in Western Qi only.

442
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,375
There is another thing that I...

443
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,396
didn't dare to tell you and Consort Rong Le before this.

444
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:50,003
What is it?

445
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,949
When Princess Rong Le fainted in Chen...

446
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:54,044
and was diagnosed with pregnancy,

447
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:56,740
His Majesty had cut his own palm to feed Consort Rong Le...

448
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,879
with his blood when you were not looking.

449
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,098
- He gave her his blood?
- Yes.

450
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:03,040
Not long after that, she woke up.

451
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,764
And by then, you were already back.

452
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:06,589
At that time, I thought that it was just a coincidence.

453
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:08,722
Now that I think of it, I wonder if she woke up...

454
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:12,142
because she was fed with his blood.

455
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,859
- Don't be a nuisance. Of course, I want to bring her back to Western Qi to neutralize...
- Wuyou.

456
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,163
Man Yao! You are awake.

457
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:32,056
I'm glad that you are fine.

458
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:34,510
What is his purpose?

459
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,248
Now, it's confirmed that Man Yao is my late teacher's daughter, Qin Man.

460
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:42,047
So, how did she become Rong Le, the Elder Princess of Western Qi?

461
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,836
Wuyou.

462
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:45,338
If that's the case,

463
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:47,971
even if the Destined Poison in Miss Man Yao...

464
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,198
is not Rong Qi's doing,

465
00:39:50,198 --> 00:39:52,283
he is closely related to it for sure.

466
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:55,815
How about I bring a few members of The Hidden Ones to Western Qi...

467
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:58,622
to investigate this mysterious Emperor of Qi.

468
00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:02,655
Maybe we'll be able to find another way to neutralize the poison.

469
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:04,853
I'll have to trouble you then.

470
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:11,111
Teacher,

471
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:15,100
both of your daughters are living well in this world.

472
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,880
If you can hear me from the underworld,

473
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,170
you can be rest assured now.

474
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,380
I'll do my best to protect your daughter, Man.

475
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:26,200
No matter the cost.

476
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:42,826
Why are you careless. I asked you to get a physician.

477
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:45,190
But you get me a girl who has a loose tongue.

478
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,082
Finally, we managed to send her away.

479
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:49,235
But now, we've made my sister sad.

480
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,360
What are both of you talking about in secret?

481
00:40:56,107 --> 00:40:57,619
It's nothing, Sister.

482
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:00,215
We were discussing about how we were going to take care of you.

483
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:02,524
That's right. Miss Ke'er has given us a prescription.

484
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:06,186
She wants to remind you to take your medicine on time and not to sleep too much.

485
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:08,420
I'll go out and get some medicine.

486
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:11,552
Be careful, Hen Xiang!

487
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,356
You like my sister, right?

488
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,919
I...

489
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:24,240
If you like her, chase after her then.

490
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,880
Go now.

491
00:41:28,483 --> 00:41:31,399
Be careful then, Consort Rong Le.

492
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,891
If they are together for real,

493
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:45,212
I'm sure that you'd be happy too, right?

494
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,360
Why are both of you back again?

495
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:00,042
Why are you here?

496
00:42:02,363 --> 00:42:06,460
Rong Le, come with me.

497
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:08,916
I'm sure you already know that...

498
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:12,330
the poison you have contacted is the Destined Poison.

499
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,819
And you should already know that...

500
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:17,580
I'm the only one who can neutralize the poison in your body completely.

501
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:20,760
What are you trying to do this time?

502
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,308
I already told you.

503
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:27,240
I'm here to bring you away... to neutralize the poison for you.

504
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:50,050
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

505
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,450
♫ We have been through so much ♫

506
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,910
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

507
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:03,170
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

508
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:11,300
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

509
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:16,520
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

510
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:24,470
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

511
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:30,060
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

512
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:37,510
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

513
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,120
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

514
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,780
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

515
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:57,400
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

516
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,740
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

517
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:39,700
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
