00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,880
[Episode 40]

2
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,400
Who are you calling a bewitching woman?

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,200
Who are you?

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,400
How dare you talk back to your superior?

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,500
I am the captain of Lady Rong Le's bodyguards.

6
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,600
I belong to her alone.

7
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Talking back to my superior?

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
You are not my superior.

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
What rank does the bodyguard hold?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,600
Besides, she is not a real consort yet.

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Even if she does become one,

12
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
she has no right over the generals.

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
You...

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,400
have no right to speak to me.

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,500
You are slandering the name of Lady Rong Le.

16
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,000
I must defend Lady Rong Le's honor!

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,900
General Luo, show some respect.

18
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
You are quite the bold one.

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,000
To protect the succubus,

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,700
you openly challenge my patience on my feast.

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,400
That vile woman seduces His Highness with her charm.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,300
And you...

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
got promoted because of a woman.

24
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,000
We are holding a feast for Luo Zhi to welcome him.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,100
Now that you use this move,

26
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,200
I might have to break my promise with the officers.

27
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,900
This is just the first step.

28
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,400
I am trying to undermine his spirit.

29
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
Your Highness. Lady Rong Le,

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,800
General Luo and Captain Xiao are fighting at the feast.

31
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,600
Is this the second step of your plan?

32
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,200
It's not part of the plan,

33
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,700
but this could be in our favor.

34
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Prince Li and Lady Rong Le arrive!

35
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Greetings, Prince Li and Lady Rong Le!

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I heard rumors about her white hair.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
I thought it was just a rumor.

38
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,400
It's actually true.

39
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,000
So that is why she is hiding inside the manor...

40
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,400
and never shows herself to the people.

41
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,500
Greetings, Prince Li.

42
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,400
Lady Rong Le's hair is white.

43
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,300
This is amazing.

44
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,400
Even with her white hair, she won His Highness' heart.

45
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
She clearly has some skills up sleeves.

46
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
The food is getting cold.

47
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Let them get up now.

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,500
At ease.

49
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,800
Much obliged Prince Li and Lady Rong Le.

50
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
General Luo and Captain Xiao.

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,700
You are in the middle of a feast.

52
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,600
Why are you holding swords?

53
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,800
Don't you know?

54
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Except for the Royal Army,

55
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,000
none of the officers can bring weapons into this house.

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
I apologize.

57
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,000
I am willing to accept my punishment.

58
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,600
I was just itching for a challenge...

59
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,700
and wanted to test my skills against Captain Xiao.

60
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,000
You are having a fight on the feast His Highness holds for you.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,200
This is disrespectful to His Highness.

62
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,000
I do not care why you got into a fight.

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You made a mistake,

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
so you must be punished.

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Guards.

66
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Take General Luo and Captain Xiao out of here.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
They will have 20 hits each.

68
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,400
If you may, General Luo.

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,500
Please come with us, General Luo.

70
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
Your Highness, during the battle at the border,

71
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,000
General Luo showed his prowess and led the army to triumph.

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
This feast is supposed to celebrate his victory.

73
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
If you punish him, that would be humiliating.

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,400
Please, do not punish General Luo.

75
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,800
I know.

76
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
The Luo Army has strict discipline.

77
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Punishment and reward are given equally.

78
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
But just because the Luo Army won a battle,

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,100
doesn't mean all the mistakes he makes...

80
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,500
can be overlooked.

81
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,500
General Luo returned victorious.

82
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,800
That was a job well done.

83
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
His Highness will reward him for that.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,100
But if he ignores the laws because he won a battle,

85
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,200
no matter what feat you achieve,

86
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
it would be meaningless.

87
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,800
General Luo, will you accept your punishment?

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,200
Fine.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,600
I disrupted His Highness' feast.

90
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,400
I startled Lady Rong Le. I will accept my punishment.

91
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,800
But I will only accept punishment from His Highness.

92
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I will not be punished by any other people.

93
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
You won't accept the punishment from me?

94
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,300
- No!
- Why not?

95
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,700
I am a general. I don't speak with courtesy.

96
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,800
There are some things that might hurt your feelings.

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Please, do tell.

98
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I will listen with open ears.

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
You're just a woman.

100
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,500
You should do what a woman does.

101
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
You didn't carry out your duty to accompany your husband.

102
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,800
Instead, you walk around and interfere with national affairs.

103
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,200
And now, you stood me up on my feast for hours.

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
You came right in to punish me and crush my morale.

105
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,000
I am the mighty General Luo of the Luo Army.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,700
Yet I was fooled around by a mere woman!

107
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,600
Not to mention she is a demon with white hair!

108
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
General Lou,

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,300
in the end, you just won't admit your mistake

110
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,800
because you disagree with my place.

111
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,100
You think that I am a woman...

112
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,400
who is incapable and has no right to punish you?

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
In that case,

114
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
in order to convince you of your mistake,

115
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,800
I have to impress you with my capabilities.

116
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,900
What do you have to impress me with?

117
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
I heard you are great at archery on horseback.

118
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,400
But we can't have a horse running in here.

119
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,100
Archery shouldn't be a problem.

120
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,200
Please, show me what you have.

121
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Guards, bring us two sets of bow and arrows.

122
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,500
With all the officers and His Highness as witnesses,

123
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,800
I challenge General Luo.

124
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
You are challenging me on archery?

125
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,200
You are biting off more than you can chew.

126
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,300
I love a tough challenge.

127
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,100
Only by winning can I convince you.

128
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,000
I am the general of Luo Army.

129
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,600
Having an archery match with a lady...

130
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,000
will not bring me any glory even if I win.

131
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
If this is too boring for you,

132
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
let's put in a wager.

133
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,700
With the bullseye as the mark,

134
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,800
the person who shoots closer to the bullseye...

135
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,600
will win this match.

136
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,800
- If you win...
- If I win,

137
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,000
you will withdraw from the court and never interfere again.

138
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Then you will use the command emblem as a wager.

139
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,200
If you lose, the Luo Army...

140
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,600
will be mine to command.

141
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Fine, you have a deal.

142
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Don't be a crybaby when you lose.

143
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
It will be an awful sight.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Of course.

145
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,100
If I lose, I will admit my defeat.

146
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,300
You'll go first, General Luo.

147
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,600
Great! Remarkable!

148
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Great! That was amazing!

149
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,600
I am impressed by your prowess in archery.

150
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,500
Just as I said.

151
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,400
You overestimated yourself.

152
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
The match is not over yet.

153
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,800
It's too early to tell who will be the winner.

154
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,500
Guards!

155
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,400
What? Is she serious?

156
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Is she being serious?

157
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,999
Do you admit your defeat?

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Not a chance!

159
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,800
You lose, why won't you admit the defeat?

160
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
If you shot first,

161
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
I would have made a better shot.

162
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,600
I want a rematch!

163
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,400
General Luo, if this were the battlefield,

164
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,500
the enemy wouldn't give you another chance.

165
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,200
You are a general.

166
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
You should understand...

167
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,200
the duty on your shoulders.

168
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
What's cruel about the war...

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
is the difference between defeat and victory.

170
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,200
What's done cannot be undone.

171
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,300
You lost today.

172
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,400
But all you lost is your pride.

173
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
If we were on the battlefield and fighting against each other,

174
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,000
you would have lost the whole Luo Army!

175
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,200
Do you know why you lost?

176
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,600
You made the greatest mistake for a soldier.

177
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,700
You underestimated your opponent.

178
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,200
With my skill, there is no way I can win.

179
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,000
But you were too arrogant and confident.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,800
You only used a third of your strength for that shot.

181
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,200
As for me,

182
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,800
I used all my strength.

183
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,900
I lost.

184
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,400
I lost without any regret.

185
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,600
General Luo, you came back victorious.

186
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't get a chance to congratulate you.

187
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Let Madam Luo come in.

188
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
Mother!

189
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,600
Greetings, Your Highness and Lady Rong Le.

190
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,100
Please, stand up.

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
You raised General Luo into a fine warrior.

192
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
He did well in defending the border.

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,800
I am giving you this silk robe.

194
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
It carries my gratitude for you.

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I hope you will like it.

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Please, don't say that.

197
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,600
His Highness has rewarded the Luo family.

198
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,300
I am already grateful.

199
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,600
I will surely appreciate this gift.

200
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,800
You insolent child. Kneel down.

201
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,200
Mother, I let you down.

202
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,400
I lost the command emblem in a bet.

203
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,800
What?

204
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Lady Rong Le, you don't know

205
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,200
that Zhi'er's father hated gambling the most when he was alive.

206
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,400
And this insolent son used the emblem as a wager!

207
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
His action is such a disgrace to the family.

208
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,000
I feel so ashamed of his actions.

209
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
Seeing that General Luo had too many drinks,

210
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,400
I pulled a prank on him.

211
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,600
The Luo Army is a crucial part of our land.

212
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,600
And General Luo... is a fine commander that plays an important role.

213
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,200
The command emblem cannot be used so lightly as a wager.

214
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,200
Many thanks, Your Highness Lady Rong Le.

215
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Zhi'er, show your gratitude now.

216
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,200
I believe General Luo...

217
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,400
will not disappoint Prince Li and I.

218
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,000
I... thank you for your mercy and kindness.

219
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,400
From now on, the Luo Army is yours to command!

220
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,000
We will fight to our last breath and at all cost!

221
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,300
It was a long match. I am starving.

222
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let's start eating then.

223
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,700
Miss Sun.

224
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,400
Yali.

225
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Ling Yue, what's wrong?

226
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
Lady Rong Le was kind enough to let me stay here for the night.

227
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,500
You don't have to come here to see me off.

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,600
Come.

229
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,200
Ling Yue, what happened?

230
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
Bad news, Yali.

231
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,600
Xiao Sha just told me.

232
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
General Luo has had his eyes on you since the feast last night.

233
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,300
He made a proposal to His Highness to marry you!

234
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,600
A proposal?

235
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,700
You mean Luo Zhi did that?

236
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Yes, it's the General Luo.

237
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,500
My father will never agree.

238
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,600
The Sun family is a noble bloodline.

239
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,000
None of the daughters were married to a commoner.

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
But His Highness agreed.

241
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,000
Yali, wait for me!

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,600
[The Highest Place above the Clouds]

243
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,500
- Luo Zhi surprised me with his pick.
- Yali.

244
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,800
The army camp is his home.

245
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,700
He only ever saw Yali once.

246
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,000
And he came to me in private to make a proposal.

247
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
This is the key moment to execute our reformation plan.

248
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,500
Luo Zhi has command over the army.

249
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,000
If the Sun family becomes his in-laws,

250
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,500
our quest to undermine the noble's influence...

251
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,200
might run into some troubles.

252
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
Normally, I would disagree at once.

253
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,800
But Yali's marriage is at stake.

254
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,000
If she does has a love for Luo Zhi,

255
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,600
there is no need to be obsessed with our wild guess.

256
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,700
Perhaps... she might get a happy marriage after all.

257
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,600
Wuyou, the reformation is important.

258
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,200
But Yali's marriage is not expandable.

259
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,400
Rong Le is trying to marry me to General Luo?

260
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,300
I can tell something is off with Yali.

261
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,600
For the past year,

262
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,300
I am worried she might feel too lonely.

263
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,500
She might start to be paranoid after all the rumors.

264
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,600
Maybe Luo Zhi...

265
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,400
could bring some changes to her life.

266
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,400
Did she plan this all along?

267
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
How about this?

268
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,300
Let me talk to her.

269
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,600
If she agrees, there is no need to stop them.

270
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,400
If she disagrees,

271
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,600
we shouldn't worry too much.

272
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,800
Just turn Luo Zhi down.

273
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,300
A person's love... cannot be manipulated so easily.

274
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,000
This is what I realized the most...

275
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
after I met you.

276
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,400
I was so fortunate.

277
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,600
After all the mistakes I made,

278
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,200
you are still here with me.

279
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,100
Yali, don't blame Lady Rong Le.

280
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,400
- She is just...
- Ling Yue.

281
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,000
Look at this.

282
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,600
I am not like you.

283
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
I am not one of the lucky ones.

284
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
I don't even have a chance.

285
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
You know?

286
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,800
When I learned that you found your true love,

287
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,500
when I see Prince Li and Lady Rong Le,

288
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,700
my heart is so...

289
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,500
Why?

290
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,600
Why am I the only one who can't make a choice?

291
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,000
Yali, I understand how you feel.

292
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,300
It's not that you don't have a chance,

293
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,900
it's just that you missed it.

294
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,800
But remember,

295
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,200
when you meet someone you can rely on...

296
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,900
and you are willing to give him all your love,

297
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,700
you must hold onto the chance.

298
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,200
Love with all your courage.

299
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Do not let go of the chance.

300
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,400
Even if I hold onto him,

301
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,500
will he ever become mine?

302
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
Of course.

303
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,200
You are such a nice girl.

304
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
You have your hands around him,he can't get away.

305
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,500
Fine! Stop hesitating or worrying about it.

306
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,600
If you want something, you need to work hard to get it.

307
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,800
But in the process of fighting for it,

308
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,200
if you face some setback or anything unfair,

309
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
you must fight back.

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,300
Yali, listen to me.

311
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,000
As a weakling,

312
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
you are destined to have nothing.

313
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
You will always be hurt and be used.

314
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,300
Do you understand?

315
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,600
I thought this was about secrecy and learning the people's way of life.

316
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
It's hard enough to go out in disguise.

317
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,500
And now you are messing around.

318
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,900
Even the officers have seen you.

319
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,800
You need not fear the people.

320
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,300
I don't care what they say about you.

321
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,400
Don't be bothered by gossips.

322
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,500
Steamed cake for sale!

323
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,200
Steamed cake for sale!

324
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,300
Sir, have a cake for your wife.

325
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,100
- Sure.
- Here you go.

326
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,600
It has mashed dates and brown sugar as filling.

327
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
I wish you stay sweet and loving.

328
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
Sweet and loving.

329
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,600
Thank you.

330
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,600
Sir, you are paying too much.

331
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,400
Sir, we are buying all of your cakes.

332
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,800
Please, send these cakes to the refugee camp.

333
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
The wind is getting stronger and the weather has gotten cold.

334
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,400
Go home and get some rest.

335
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,100
Thank you, sir and madam.

336
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,800
You have such a kind heart.

337
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,300
I can go home earlier...

338
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,600
and listen to some stories at the Serene Hill Inn.

339
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,800
Have a nice day.

340
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,600
I heard a lot of people are going to the Serene Hill Inn.

341
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
Indeed, I go there every day.

342
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
The story is about the Silver-Haired Demon.

343
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,700
You mean the story about Silver-Haired Demon?

344
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,500
Right, the story went on for days, it's getting more exciting.

345
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,600
- Is there really such a demon?
- Let's go.

346
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,200
We need to be there before the seats run out.

347
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
- Have some tea.
- Thank you.
[Serene Hill Inn]

348
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
This way, please.

349
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,700
- Please.
- Waiter, get some hot water.

350
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,200
I heard this is the most famous teahouse in Qingzhou.

351
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,400
I never thought there would be so many people here.

352
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,500
It's quite different from the graceful Moon Embrace.

353
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Madam, are you from Zhongshan?

354
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
When I was on a business trip there,

355
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
I went to the teahouse because of its fame.

356
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,100
The premise may be there,

357
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,900
but no one was there to welcome us.

358
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,600
I heard the teahouse is owned by Prince Regent.

359
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,800
Now, he is the only person...

360
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,500
who goes there and sits in silence for hours.

361
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,900
What a waste of good tea.

362
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
Come, have some tea.

363
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,300
The bard is here.

364
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,000
He is here.

365
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,700
Gentlemen,

366
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
we will continue the story...

367
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,600
of the Silver-Haired Demon.

368
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,700
The Silver-Haired Demon is the incarnation of a white vixen after years of meditation.

369
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,400
It uses its charm to seduce the hearts of men.

370
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
It came out of nowhere and brings chaos to the land...

371
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,200
and spends its time around those with power.

372
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,200
This filthy creature is the bringer of disorder.

373
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,000
The nation will fall because of her and there will be pandemonium.

374
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,600
War will ravage the land, the people will live in flames.

375
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,000
I heard the wife of Prince Li is a lady with white hair.

376
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,800
You mean her?

377
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,200
Gentleman, something is better left unsaid.

378
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Otherwise, your head might end up being chopped.

379
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,000
I was right?

380
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,100
The Silver-Haired Demon is Consort Rong Le?

381
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,800
She is not a consort yet.

382
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Prince Li simply accepts her into the palace.

383
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,000
They are not married yet.

384
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,100
What is so odd about this?

385
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,600
What trouble could a lady cause?

386
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,400
You said she brings chaos, do you mind explaining that?

387
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Right, enlighten us!

388
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,200
- Come on, tell us.
- The Silver-Haired Demon...

389
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,400
is destined to be an evil entity...

390
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,900
and bring disaster to the world.

391
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,000
Maybe the earthquake at Zhuo...

392
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,200
was a disaster caused by the demon!

393
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,800
I heard that not only does it drink blood,

394
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,000
- it eats brains too!
- Mother, I am scared.

395
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
If you don't behave,

396
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,000
the demon will suck your blood, too.

397
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,400
Nonsense.

398
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,100
Prince Li is ever so benevolent.

399
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,000
He can't be seduced by a demon.

400
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
Right, I don't believe it either!

401
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Prince Li executed the reformation and improved our life.

402
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,000
And you are slandering him with rumors about a demon.

403
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,900
That is right!

404
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,300
If Prince Li is being charmed by a demon,

405
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,400
he would have spent his days in the arms of a demon.

406
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,200
He would have no time for the people.

407
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Prince Li is wise and brave,

408
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,400
there is no way he would fall in love with a demon.

409
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,600
This bard is clearly trying to stain His Highness' reputation.

410
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,400
- He is right!
- The bard is telling the truth.

411
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,200
You are just being ridiculous.

412
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,000
- Yes, you are being unbelievable!
- Miss, can I have this?

413
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,300
Of course.

414
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,000
Stop running around, go back to your mother.

415
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,400
You are clearly spreading lies!

416
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
The bard is telling the truth!

417
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,700
- Nonsense!
- Lies!

418
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,700
Silence, gentlemen.

419
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,400
The story of the Silver-Haired Demon is not over yet.

420
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,000
We will continue the story.

421
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,200
That Silver-Haired Demon...

422
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,800
She is...

423
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
She is the Silver-Haired Demon!

424
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,600
- Demon!
- Silver-Haired Demon!

425
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Silver-Haired Demon!

426
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,600
She is just a child, don't hurt her!

427
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,200
Man Yao, are you all right?

428
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Your Highness.

429
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,500
Xiang Ying?

430
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,900
Princess Rong Le.

431
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Your Highness, I should have come sooner.

432
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,000
Lock this man up and interrogate him.

433
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,600
Take him to the cell.

434
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,600
I shall leave now.

435
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,800
We cannot stay here.

436
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
We should leave.

437
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
Xiang Ying.

438
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It must have been a tough year for you.

439
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,400
Since you are in Qingzhou,

440
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,200
you can stay with us if you have no place to go.

441
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,600
You can still be my personal bodyguard.

442
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,000
I thank you for the offer.

443
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I got used to the easy life.

444
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I wander the land, free from all worries.

445
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,300
I don't wish to have my old life back.

446
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,200
Please, forgive me.

447
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,200
In that case,

448
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,800
I won't force you.

449
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,400
You were here for so long...

450
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
but you never came to me.

451
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,200
Perhaps that is the reason.

452
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,600
I am glad we have met again.

453
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,200
We meet because of fate.

454
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
But it is not a coincidence.

455
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,700
I went to the teahouse about two weeks ago,

456
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,600
I heard the nonsensical story of that bard.

457
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,200
I had my suspicion so I went there for the next few days.

458
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,800
But I couldn't get any solid evidence.

459
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,500
I was surprised... they actually waited for you to go there.

460
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,400
Your Highness.

461
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,300
I have searched the Serene Hill Inn.

462
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,100
We didn't find anything suspicious.

463
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
This is not your fault.

464
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,200
The mastermind must have planned this for a long time.

465
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
They won't leave any evidence behind.

466
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
That bard had a poison pill in his mouth.

467
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
His Highness reacted fast enough to stop him from killing himself.

468
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,000
That waiter even gave up his own life...

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
just to frame Princess Rong Le.

470
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I think this could be the doing of the Creed of Vengeance.

471
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,700
I don't think the Creed did this.

472
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,600
They have been hunting me since I left Princess Rong Le.

473
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,800
But three months ago, the Creed disappeared.

474
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,600
The Creed disappeared?

475
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,200
I took the risk and returned to Zhongshan.

476
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,400
The Eastern Suburb Inn is sealed off.

477
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,700
General Fu is now Prince Regent.

478
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,400
He has all the attention.

479
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Maybe he wishes to wipe away the past, just like me.

480
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,600
However, not only did the incident frame Man Yao into a murderer,

481
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
the true motive of the mastermind...

482
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,800
is to sway the people that don't know the truth...

483
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,100
into hating Man Yao and all who follow me.

484
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,200
If we lose the people's trust in us,

485
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,100
it might not bode well for the progress of our reformation.

486
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,400
Troops of Northern Lin were defeated by General Luo and his men.

487
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,800
They suffered a loss of morale.

488
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,300
Could they have infiltrated our land to strike from the dark?

489
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,300
The mastermind knows well about the South.

490
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,600
If they are really working with Northern Lin,

491
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,300
the consequences of the rumors...

492
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,700
will be even greater.

493
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,000
Leng Yan, you need to follow the tracks of the rumor.

494
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,900
Pay attention to the officers' contact with Northern Lin.

495
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,800
Consider it done.

496

[Lin Entrance]

497
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,900
Your Highness, let's return to the palace.

498
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,800
[General's Mansion]

499
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,800
Your Highness.

500
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,100
[General's Mansion]

501
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,400
Come, watch your steps.

502
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,400
Watch out.

503
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,900
We need to find the Blood Raven Root before sunset.

504
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,400
We've searched for days and this is a huge place.

505
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,000
There is no one around.

506
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,200
We don't even know if this is Youji Mountain.

507
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,700
There is a rock there.

508
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,800
Ke'er, have a break.

509
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
Come on, Uncle.

510
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,500
So,

511
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
could the Blood Raven Root be up there?

512
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,400
This cliff is barren.

513
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,600
Nothing grows here.

514
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,400
How could the divine herb grow here?

515
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
I will go anpd take a look.

516
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,100
Ke'er, slow down. Take it easy!

517
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,600
Don't worry, I am used to doing this.

518
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,400
It should be me that goes first.

519
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,200
Thanks.

520
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Are you all right?

521
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
I am fine.

522
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,600
Ke'er, are you all right?

523
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,300
I am fine.

524
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
It's you again.

525
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,400
Who are you?

526
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,100
I am a hunter from downhill.

527
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
You mean someone else came here before?

528
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,100
Yes, a bunch of people came here last month.

529
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,400
They searched the woods for days.

530
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
What were they searching for?

531
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,400
It's the precious herb that grows on the cliff.

532
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,200
Before this, we couldn't reach the herbs that grow there.

533
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,600
That man was amazing.

534
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
He somehow went up to the cliff.

535
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,000
He even plucked the herb himself.

536
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,200
What was the herb? Was it the Blood Raven Root?

537
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
I don't know what it was.

538
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Anyway, it was bright red in color...

539
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,600
and surrounded by thorns. It's right on the cliff.

540
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
It's the Blood Raven Root.

541
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,400
Do you remember what that man looked like?

542
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,500
I didn't get a good look.

543
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,000
I have work to do, so long.

544
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,300
We were too late.

545
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,400
We have to go home empty-handed.

546
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,200
This is strange.

547
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,300
Normal people don't need the Blood Raven Root.

548
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,000
We need human blood to feed the herb...

549
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
to make the hair dark again.

550
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
It will have a great impact on the feeder's health.

551
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,200
No normal people would want this herb.

552
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,800
Who could have taken it?

553
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,600
♫ I can't help but to ask after you ♫

554
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,900
♫ Our hearts are a lifetime apart ♫

555
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,500
♫ No one comes, also no one asks ♫

556
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,400
♫ How do we keep living this life? ♫

557
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,800
♫ Finally, I've learned how to trust ♫

558
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,200
♫ But I've underestimated love and hate ♫

559
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,000
This tastes good, eat all you want.

560
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,600
♫ I have to admit to my mistakes ♫

561
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,400
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

562
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,800
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

563
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,000
♫ I asked for too much, I hesitated for too long ♫

564
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,400
♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

565
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,600
♫ You are behind me ♫

566
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,000
♫ Mocking the promise that I made for you ♫

567
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,300
♫ I must give all I have ♫

568
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,400
♫ To accept the lies of affection ♫

569
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,000
♫ Our fate is intertwined and I can't let go ♫

570
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,200
♫ I must preserve the memories that are wonderful ♫

571
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,800
♫ I can't let you know how lonely I was ♫

572
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,600
♫ This brings us to this stalemate ♫

573
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:41,600
♫ I made this mistake because I was too selfish ♫

574
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,200
♫ I walk in a desert, but my heart is being flooded ♫

575
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,400
♫ My heart is beating senselessly ♫

576
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,600
♫ I regret the one mistake that I made so much ♫

577
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,000
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

578
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,400
♫ Blame being forced, blame being weak  ♫

579
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,700
♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

580
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,000
♫ You are behind me ♫

581
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,400
♫ Mocking the promise that I made for you ♫

582
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,600
♫ I must give all I have ♫

583
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,800
♫ To accept the lies of affection ♫

584
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,700
This really is the Blood Raven Root.

585
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,600
♫ It never ends, love will fade ♫

586
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,000
♫ The blossoms fall, and I wait in silence ♫

587
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,200
♫ I cling to the past despite the pains ♫

588
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,600
♫ I won't let our love be a regret ♫

589
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,400
Your Highness.

590
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,200
Come in.

591
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,600
Your Highness.

592
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,200
Empress Dowager has asked for you many times.

593
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,000
Your Highness should return to the palace.

594
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,200
You have been in the army for the past year.

595
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
Victory is finally yours today.

596
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
The officers are holding a feast in the royal palace.

597
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,200
They are waiting for your return.

598
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
You took good care of this place.

599
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,900
The Tranquil Garden hasn't changed at all.

600
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,800
I followed your order.

601
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
I sent my men to clean up the place every day.

602
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,600
Same goes for the Moon Embrace Teahouse.

603
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
However,

604
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
there is no one there.

605
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,500
Everything has changed.

606
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
Let's head back.

607
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,600
How is my mother?

608
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,000
Is she still suffering from the sickness?

609
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,300
She takes her medicine on time every day.

610
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,700
After the treatment, her condition has improved a lot.

611
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,600
She hasn't had any relapse recently.

612
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,400
It looks like her hysterical psychosis is cured.

613
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,200
But she refuses to live in the palace for recovery.

614
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,700
She insists to stay in the Cold Palace.

615
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,600
Was it Senyan Palace?

616
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Yes, I tried talking to her.

617
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,200
But she refuses to leave.

618
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,400
So I ordered my men to renovate Senyan Palace.

619
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,800
Right, any reports from the South?

620
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,200
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

621
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,620
♫ We have been through so much ♫

622
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,050
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

623
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,400
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

624
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,200
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

625
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,800
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

626
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:23,700
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

627
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:29,100
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

628
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:36,600
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

629
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:43,200
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

630
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,000
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

631
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,600
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

632
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:03,900
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

633
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:39,500
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
