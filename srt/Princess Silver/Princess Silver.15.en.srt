[Episode 15]

2
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
Here, have some water.

3
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Before the soldiers catch up to us,

4
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,700
we need to plan our next move.

5
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,100
Wherever you go, I will follow.

6
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,400
The same goes for us.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,200
The effect of the drug is fading.

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,700
Don't worry about me.

9
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,300
However, I think we should split up...

10
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,400
or we'll all be arrested.

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,100
Long Yue is right.

12
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,400
We are in the same boat, we are sisters in arms.

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Everyone needs to have their own goals.

14
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,100
You shouldn't follow me and give up on your future.

15
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,100
Princess, where are you going?

16
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,400
I don't know.

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,000
I am no longer a princess.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,700
I once thought...

19
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,800
Western Qi was where my home is...

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,600
and Northern Lin was where my duty calls.

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,600
But now, there is no place for me anywhere.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,600
The world is vast, there will be a safe harbor for us.

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,700
Miss Chen Yu, are you planning to travel the land and learn the way of the lute?

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,200
I am going to Chen.

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
I heard the music there is vigorous and passionate.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,300
It's much different from the music here.

27
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,200
What about you, Xiao Wei?

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,600
I am...

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,200
I am going to Western Qi.

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,600
I worked for Western Qi in the teahouse for years.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,900
But I never knew what the land was like.

32
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,600
Speaking of which,

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,200
Your Highness, it reminds me of Lian Xin.

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,100
I wonder how is her life with her husband.

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,700
I have no attachment for Western Qi.

36
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,600
However, while I am still young,

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I wish to see the places I have never been to before.

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,300
Not bad.

39
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,700
The horizon is endless.

40
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,500
We must not bind ourselves in this small land.

41
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
I pretended to be a merchant for so long,

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,400
but I never got the chance to visit any places, what a shame.

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Long Yue, will you come with me...

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and witness the wonders of the world?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
Certainly.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,400
In that case, I bid all of you farewell.

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,300
We will each go our separate ways.

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,600
Nothing will ever change, we will meet again one day.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,900
Come.

50
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,000
Brother, I'll lead the men and go after them.

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Not even the owl can sense them. This is our last bet.

52
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,800
You take the right and I take the middle.

53
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,100
- Make haste.
- Yes.

54
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
Man Yao!

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Run, they are catching up to us.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Run!

57
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
The assassins from Creed of Vengeance.

58
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,000
Get on the horses, keep searching.

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
- Long Yue.
- Hurry up.

60
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
Brother?

61
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,100
What's wrong?

62
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Did you think I was gone?

63
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,400
I should have seen this coming.

64
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,500
You lied to me again and again.

65
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,200
You will surely deceive me once more.

66
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,500
Trusting you was a mistake.

67
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,800
Not bad.

68
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,900
Before I get "The Book of Mountains and Rivers,"

69
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,700
I will never let you escape my grasp.

70
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,900
What do you want with the book?

71
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,500
You lied to me.

72
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
You said you wanted it to save Western Qi,

73
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,000
to strengthen the army, and help the people.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
But the truth is you conspired with Fu Chou...

75
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
and lied to both sides.

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You used the alliance as a cover for all of your evil plans.

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
Have you ever considered the outcomes? If the war breaks out,

78
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,400
the people of Western Qi will be ravaged by chaos.

79
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,600
None of these is your concern.

80
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,300
As long as you hand over the book,

81
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,200
return to Zhongshan and marry Fu Zhou.

82
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,600
A year from now, everything will be over.

83
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,700
I will create a distraction.

84
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,500
When the spy of Western Qi becomes a traitor,

85
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,000
I am sure you know what the outcome will be.

86
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Run, leave me!

87
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,200
Brother.

88
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Do you really want Long Yue to die for you?

89
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,400
Honor and loyalty can never coexist,

90
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Your Majesty. Your Highness. This shall be my last wish!

91
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,400
Long Yue!

92
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Long Yue!

93
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,200
- Long Yue!
- Run, run while you can.

94
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,800
- Long Yue!
- Run.

95
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,200
Long Yue!

96
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Long Yue!

97
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Long Yue!

98
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Rong Le.

99
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Stop resisting.

100
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,600
You will never get what you want.

101
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
I lied to you about the book.

102
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
I never found it.

103
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,100
You will get it over my dead body.

104
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,500
Even without the book,

105
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,800
you must return to Fu Chou...

106
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
and fulfil your duty.

107
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Then all he will ever get from me is a dead corpse.

108
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,100
Bring them in.

109
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
You...

110
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,300
Long Yue is already dead.

111
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,600
Do you honestly want these people...

112
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,400
to die for your sake?

113
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Your Majesty, I left the trace for...

114
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,100
Princess!

115
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,400
Princess, save me! Princess!

116
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,000
What are you waiting for? Keep it going!

117
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Princess!

118
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,300
Stop!

119
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,500
Please, spare their lives.

120
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,200
They have nothing to do with this.

121
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,800
They don't know any details.

122
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,100
I will go with you to Zhongshan.

123
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,800
I will marry Fu Chou.

124
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,300
Whatever you want of me,

125
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,600
I will do it.

126
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,200
Very well, let's go.

127
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Man Yao? What happened here?

128
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,400
By order of the empress,

129
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
from now on, we will be serving Your Highness.

130
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,600
We wish you all the joy for your wedding with General Fu.

131
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,300
We are grateful for Her Majesty's courtesy.

132
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
Leave the things here.

133
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,700
This wedding robe is so beautiful.

134
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,800
Nonsense, it's not the robe,

135
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,400
it's the princess that is beautiful.

136
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,600
General Fu has a dashing look.

137
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
You could make a perfect couple together.

138
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
Fine, enough of your chatter.

139
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,500
Leave us be. The princess needs to rest.

140
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,900
Go on, leave us be.

141
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,600
Princess Rong Le, I still think my brother Wuyou is better.

142
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,000
But if you choose General Fu over him, I will still support...

143
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Aren't you Miss Man Yao?

144
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,000
Princess,

145
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,500
you look just the same as Miss Man Yao from the teahouse.

146
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,200
Could it be...

147
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,400
No, I need to tell Brother Wuyou about this.

148
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
He is searching for you like a mad man.

149
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Princess.

150
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Princess Zhao Yun is just being ridiculous.

151
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
I hope you don't mind her.

152
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,500
Your Highness, I was a coward.

153
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,600
If I had let them kill me back there,

154
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
you wouldn't be trapped in here like a hostage.

155
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,700
It's all may fault.

156

170
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,000
After today, I will never let go of you.

171
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,400
There is no need to regret this.

172
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,580
♫ This brings us to this stalemate ♫​

173
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,200
♫ I made this mistake because I was too selfish ♫

174
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,600
♫ I made this mistake because I was too selfish ♫

175
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,200
♫ I walk in a desert, but my heart is being flooded ♫

176
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,600
♫ My heart is beating senselessly ♫

177
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,800
♫ I regret one mistake that I made so much ♫

178
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,200
♫ All hope is lost, how do I start over? ♫

179
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,400
♫ Blame being forced, blame being weak  ♫

180
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,800
♫ Blame the mistake that happened too soon ♫

181
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,000
♫ You are behind me ♫

182
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,400
♫ Mocking the promise that I made for you ♫

183
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,700
♫ I must give all I have ♫

184
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,700
♫ To accept the lies of affection ♫

185
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,600
♫ It never ends, love will fade ♫

186
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,000
♫ The blossoms fall, and I wait in silence ♫

187
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,200
♫ I cling to the past despite the pains ♫

188
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,600
♫ I won't let our love be a regret ♫

189
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,200
♫ Living without sorrow, dying without any hate ♫

190
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,400
♫ This is the leniency that you've shown to me ♫

191
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,800
♫ We are not holding hands, but you are holding my heart ♫

192
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,400
♫ Although this might not be forever ♫

193
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,600
♫ I've locked you in my heart and I've locked you in my dreams ♫

194
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:37,300
♫ Blaming myself for falling in love with you ♫

195
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,200
Brother, this is all my fault.

196
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,000
When I saw Man Yao on the street,

197
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
I should have taken her with me.

198
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,400
But the personal bodyguard of Princess Rong Le...

199
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,800
came out of nowhere and was looking for a fugitive.

200
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
We fought just like that.

201
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
- She got away.
- What did you say?

202
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
It's Man Yao...

203
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,300
You said when you met Man Yao,

204
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,700
you had a fight with someone?

205
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,200
Brother, I didn't mean it.

206
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,100
It's their fault. They took me for someone else.

207
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,700
But they are from Western Qi.

208
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,300
I can't argue with them.

209
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
When you met Man Yao,

210
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,100
you also ran into Xiao Sha, Princess Rong Le's bodyguard?

211
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,500
Yes, it was Xiao Sha.

212
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Princess Rong Le is unreasonable and insistent.

213
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,400
But Miss Mao Yao is sensible and a lady of wisdom.

214
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
There is no way they are the same person.

215
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Besides, Princess Rong Le is from the royal family.

216
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
She is used to a life of luxury.

217
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
She can't be the mistress of a teahouse.

218
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
But if she is the princess,

219
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,000
why did she make ripples in the bath water?

220
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,500
Unless, someone just dived into the water.

221
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
That stirred the water.

222
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
She was trying to cover it.

223
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,100
Brother, where are you going?

224
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,200
Brother!

225
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Brother Wuyou, I have something important for you.

226
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Princess Rong Le is Miss Man Yao from the teahouse.

227
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,300
What are you talking about?

228
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,000
Brother.

229
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,200
Rong Le and Man Yao are the same person?

230
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,000
- Yes!
- How is this possible?

231
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,900
Xiao Sha, Rong Le's bodyguard...

232
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,600
showed up at the same time as her.

233
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,200
My goodness, we have been fooled!

234
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
[Heaven and Earth]

235
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,800
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

236
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,200
Thank you.

237
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for the blessings.

238
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Thank you.

239
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,700
- Sir Yang.
- We wish you all the joy in this marriage.

240
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,800
Thank you, Sir Yang.

241
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Congratulation for marrying such a beautiful wife.

242
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,600
Thank you for the blessing.

243
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
General Fu, before the consummation,

244
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,500
you can at least show us...

245
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,500
what your wife actually looks like in person.

246
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,600
Yes, the princess has been in our country for months.

247
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,100
But no one has ever seen her face.

248
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,600
Before this, she said it's the custom of Western Qi.

249
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,600
The mask must be removed by the husband on her wedding day.

250
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,200
Now that you are marrying her,

251
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,700
why don't you take off the mask after the wedding ceremony?

252
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,400
Show us just how much of a beauty she is.

253
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
Indeed.

254
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,300
- Take the mask off.
- Yes.

255
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,500
Greetings, Crown Prince.

256
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,800
Don't you dare make a fuss here.

257
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,600
All of you backed off when the princess proposed.

258
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,800
Enough of your chatter.

259
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,000
Back off to where you came from.

260
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,000
Greetings, Crown Prince.

261
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,700
Greetings, Lady Xiang.

262
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,000
Congratulations.

263
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
You are devoted to serving the country,

264
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,500
a role model for all the officers here.

265
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,800
If Wuyou could see the big picture like you do,

266
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,000
my father wouldn't have been so worried for him.

267
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,300
It's bliss to marry Princess Rong Le.

268
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,200
General, it's time for the ceremony.

269
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,800
Very well.

270
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,900
The marrying couple, pay your respect.

271
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,700
To Heaven and Earth.

272
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
To the parents and ancestors.

273
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,800
To each other.

274
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,800
Hold on!

275
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Prince Li actually came to my wedding.

276
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,900
I appreciate this greatly.

277
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,500
Your Highness is right on time.

278
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,600
I hope you can calm down.

279
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,000
After the ceremony is done,

280
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,300
I will be there to serve you.

281
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,800
Prince Li, this way, please.

282
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,300
Good. This is great.

283
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,000
But I would like to see just how Princess Rong Le looks like...

284
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,100
and whether the rumors are true.

285
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,600
Prince Li, you are being too hasty.

286
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,300
I advise Your Highness to have more patience.

287
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
As for the wedding veil of my wife,

288
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,400
I think it's more adequate for me to take it off.

289
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,900
Your concerns are unnecessary.

290
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,100
General Fu, the ceremony is not complete yet,

291
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,300
you are not husband and wife.

292
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,400
So, how does it count...

293
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,000
to make us a married couple?

294
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,300
After the consummation.

295
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,500
I believe Princess Rong Le would agree with me as well.

296
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,000
How shallow your mind can be?

297
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,100
They judge a book by its cover.

298
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,700
Even Prince Li has the same habit.

299
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,600
You turned me down that day.

300
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
You were so determined.

301
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,800
And you came all the way here today to unveil me?

302
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,000
What do you want from me?

303
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,700
Is Prince Li trying to make a mess out of this wedding?

304
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Prince Li, stop it!

305
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
It was your fault for being so arrogant.

306
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,300
You refused to marry the princess.

307
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,100
General Fu sees the bigger picture...

308
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,500
and is marrying the princess for peace. You have no right to be so angry!

309
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,300
I was ordered by His Majesty to witness this wedding.

310
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,100
If you ruin the peace between the nations,

311
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,800
I will make a report to His Majesty right away!

312
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,500
Go ahead.

313
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
Even if His Majesty is here,

314
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,200
I am still going to see her face...

315
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,600
and find out what she looks like.

316
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
Guards!

317
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,800
Does Prince Li wish to start bloodshed in my manor today?

318
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,600
Xiang Ying.

319
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,700
I never wished to have a feud with anyone.

320
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,500
If Your Highness insists on forcing my hand,

321
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,700
then I shall not hold any punches.

322
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,400
Since you are married to me,

323
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
you are my wife.

324
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,000
Don't worry.

325
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,800
I won't let you suffer from any harm.

326
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,600
I thank you for your concern.

327
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
But there are some matters...

328
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,200
that only I can put an end to.

329
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,000
If I let Your Highness see my face,

330
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,400
will you finally give up on me?

331
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,300
♫ I think of you when the moon is full, when it's a crescent, ♫

332
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,200
♫ and when it's white ♫

333
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,200
♫ You who came to a strange land to build our lands together ♫

334
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,500
♫ I think of you when night has fallen... ♫

335
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,800
It's you?

336
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,100
♫ and when the fog has parted ♫

337
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,200
♫ My yearning for you has turned you into my reason ♫

338
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,200
It really is you.

339
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,800
You have been feeding me lies.

340
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,200
You have seen what you wanted.

341
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,300
Can you leave me be now?

342
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
Perhaps I should go with you.

343
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,400
Where are you going?

344
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,200
What do you think?

345
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,000
General Fu and I finished the ceremony.

346
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Where else would we go?

347
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,200
Are you really going to marry him and consummate it?

348
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,200
Don't you remember what happened that night?

349
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,400
♫ People, opportunities that have come unexpectedly, ambiguous places  ♫

350
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,200
♫ Can they be considered precious? ♫

351
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,400
♫ You are far away ♫

352
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,400
♫ I don't understand, I'm sad ♫

353
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,800
♫ Could it be those roundabouts? ♫

354
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,600
I don't care if it means anything to you.

355
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
You are mine now.

356
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,600
Other than me, you will marry no one!

357
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,300
Come with me!

358
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Your Highness.

359
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,600
Prince Li doesn't have the slightest respect for me.

360
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Today,

361
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,100
I am marrying Princess Rong Le.

362
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,700
You came here without any invitation.

363
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,700
I'll take it as you are sending your blessing.

364
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,400
But you insulted my wife.

365
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,000
And now you want to take her from me.

366
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,200
Do you even remember that...

367
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,800
this marriage was bestowed by the emperors.

368
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,100
The fate of the nations is at stake.

369
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,200
You are acting on arrogance.

370
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,600
Don't you have any loyalty to His Majesty?

371
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,800
Do you honestly think...

372
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,100
all the ladies in this land...

373
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,000
can be owned and ditched as you please?

374
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,300
You are no righteous man yourself.

375
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,800
You have no right to lecture me.

376
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,800
If I want to take her as mine,

377
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,400
I don't need to smear her honor.

378
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,100
Prince Li, mind your words!

379
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,600
- There is no way the princess...
- That is enough!

380
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,800
I thought you just wanted to use me.

381
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,700
But I was so wrong about you.

382
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,400
This marriage alliance is set.

383
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
If you do have some love left for me,

384
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,700
you wouldn't push me to such desperation...

385
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,800
and place us in this predicament!

386
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,100
I don't understand...

387
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,600
why you are doing all of these.

388
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,300
Do you really not know...

389
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,200
why I am doing this?

390
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,700
I don't.

391
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,000
I never understand your thoughts.

392
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,000
Brother!

393
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,400
Man Yao?

394
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
It really is you.

395
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,000
How could you do this?

396
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You were flirting with my brother...

397
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,400
while planning a wedding with someone else?

398
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,800
What about my brother?

399
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,300
What's done is done. I have nothing to say.

400
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,600
The marriage alliance was interrupted...

401
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,000
all because of me.

402
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,300
I will take on all the responsibility.

403
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,800
Your concern is not needed.

404
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,000
All you need is a divorce.

405
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,400
Now that we have paid our respects to Heaven and Earth,

406
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,600
we are a married couple.

407
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,200
No matter what happens next,

408
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,300
I...

409
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,400
will always be there to share your burden.

410
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,600
General Fu really is a person of great sentiment.

411
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,400
This is touching.

412
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,200
But if you want to spend the rest of your life with my woman,

413
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,700
you must go through me first.

414
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,800
I will take her with me!

415
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,700
Don't you dare stop me!

416
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,400
Brother, run!

417
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,500
What did you say?

418
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,400
How insolent can he possibly be?

419
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,500
He charged into the manor and took General Fu's wife!

420
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,400
He is out of his mind!

421
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,900
Father, calm down.

422
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,200
Maybe Wuyou was just acting on impulse.

423
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,800
He may have been blinded by Princess Rong Le.

424
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,000
How is Princess Rong Le the same person as Man Yao?

425
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
Good question.

426
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,000
The princess' plan was well thought and deliberate.

427
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,400
I wonder what kind of scheme Western Qi has in place.

428
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,500
How are we going to resolve this situation?

429
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,000
I sent my men after him; however...

430
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,800
however, the place he went into...

431
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,200
it's not where I dare to trespass.

432
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,200
Where is he now?

433
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,200
Why are you doing this?

434
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,500
Zongzheng Wuyou, what do you want from me?

435
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
What else could I want?

436
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
No matter how much I love you,

437
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,300
it's not worth it to take by force!

438
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,600
Yes, the mighty Prince Li is no ordinary person.

439
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,600
You used all sorts of tricks to make me fall for him.

440
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,800
Tricks?

441
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,200
Didn't you do the same to me?

442
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,800
You are the Princess of Western Qi.

443
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,600
But you disguised as an owner of a teahouse.

444
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
While we were writing down our wishes,

445
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,000
you were planning to marry another man!

446
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Who am I to you?

447
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,800
Yes, I was planning to marry General Fu.

448
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,200
What's wrong with that?

449
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,300
You plotted against me at every corner.

450
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,600
You used me to get "The Book of Mountains and Rivers."

451
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,000
You never had one bit of true love for me!

452
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,100
I had no love for you?

453
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,500
If I had none, what did you have?

454
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,200
You wouldn't tell me who you really were!

455
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,500
You planned every step and kept me in the dark!

456
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,200
Don't you dare lecture me!

457
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,800
Yes, I am in no place to lecture you.

458
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,600
We are both pawns for each other.

459
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
We fed lies to each other.

460
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,400
But I failed because you were one step ahead.

461
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
You took everything from me.

462
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,000
And what did I take from you?

463
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,000
I took you with me?

464
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Did I steal you heart?

465
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,500
Right.

466
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,000
Or is it you that took the book from me?

467
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,000
How is that book yours?

468
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,600
You said Qin Yong was your teacher.

469
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,100
Your father had him killed.

470
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,900
You killed the whole family.

471
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,800
And now you take his work and made it rightfully yours?

472
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,000
It's just like how you took my heart.

473
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,500
You think that people have no heart,

474
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,000
you see us as your property!

475
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,000
- This is madness!
- This is sacrilegious!

476
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,500
What is the general going to do now?

477
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,000
This is insane.

478
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,300
What do we do now?

479
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,400
We have had enough trouble.

480
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,800
Long live Your Majesty.

481
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,200
At ease.

482
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,500
Where is Wuyou?

483
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,200
Your Majesty, His Highness is inside the royal tomb.

484
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,500
Open the door!

485
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,700
His Highness sealed the entrance.

486
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,800
A contraption was installed when we designed the place.

487
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Once it's sealed, it can only be open on the inside.

488
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,800
Otherwise, the tomb would have been ruined.

489
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
He has been in there for so long.

490
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,700
What if he never comes out?

491
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,300
Brother!

492
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,600
Brother, just come out!

493
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,200
It's me, Wuyu!

494
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
Our father is waiting for you!

495
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
Brother!

496
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,600
Insolence! What does he want this time?

497
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,500
General Fu,

498
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,800
you knew the owner of Moon Embrace...

499
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,500
was Princess Rong Le all this time?

500
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,000
I was unaware of it.

501
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,200
You didn't know?

502
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
When she was making her choice,

503
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,400
all the men were afraid to be chosen.

504
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,800
But you stepped out and accepted her cup of tea.

505
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,400
Your Majesty.

506
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,300
This marriage concerns the peace of two nations.

507
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,600
Since both Prince Chen and Prince Li turned the Princess down,

508
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,900
I as the officer of Northern Lin...

509
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,100
was willing to share this burden.

510
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,600
Are you telling the truth?

511
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,700
If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,

512
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,200
I will hand in my armor and retire in order to earn your trust.

513
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Father, all of these happened because Wuyou turned her down.

514
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,000
General Fu is not at fault here.

515
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,700
Your Majesty.

516
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,600
General Fu has served the army for years and achieved countless feats.

517
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
He is trying to do what's best for Your Majesty.

518
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,400
If he retires now,

519
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,600
it might deal a significant blow to the army's morale.

520
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,000
Please, reconsider this decision.

521
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,300
Please, reconsider this decision.

522
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,000
When are you going to let me go?

523
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:18,200
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

524
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,800
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

525
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,600
♫ I'm still trying to be nice to myself ♫

526
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:37,600
♫ Just allow me to get you back to this date ♫

527
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,400
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

528
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,100
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

529
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:57,400
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

530
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,600
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

531
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,400
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

532
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,000
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

533
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,400
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

534
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,900
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

535
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,000
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

536
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,800
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

537
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,000
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

538
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,200
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

539
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:22,000
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
