00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,132
[Episode 11]

2
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,279
His Highness must be the famous Prince Li...

3
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,191
that won the battle of the South with tactics.

4
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:16,902
Yes, that is my son, Wuyou. I hope he is what you expected.

5
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Prince Li does have the outstanding figure of a royal, the look of a righteous prince.

6
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,959
He will indeed be a suitable husband for Princess Rong Le.

7
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,001
I came all the way to Northern Lin...

8
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,019
in order to hasten the progress of our marriage alliance.

9
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,420
It doesn't really matter who the Princess marries.

10
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,601
The goodwill of the two nations comes first.

11
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:41,241
There are other princes in Northern Lin.

12
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:44,443
Since you are here, why don't you have a look around?

13
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:47,697
Maybe there is a man that suits the princess better.

14
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:50,099
Your words do have a point.

15
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,690
After all, Rong Le is my only sister.

16
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:57,551
I should spend more time in considering the options.

17
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,619
Princess Rong Le has the quality of a good queen.

18
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:20,250
But unfortunately, the crown prince is already married.

19
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,360
A hunt is just the same as a battle.

20
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,700
Even if we face a powerful enemy, even if the opponent has the higher ground,

21
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,219
as soon as we find outwhat his weakness is, we can turn the tide of the battle.

22
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,174
I thank you for the advice.

23
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,599
See?

24
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,157
I think I know where the entrance of the secret chamber in the Qin Manor is.

25
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,228
So, "The Book of Mountains and Rivers" is within our reach?

26
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,429
No.

27
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,220
This is an emergency signal. It's an urgent message.

28
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,910
Someone wants to assassinate His Majesty.

29
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,451
What?

30
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,939
There is a faction that objects to the alliance and is using this opportunity for an assassination.

31
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,259
This is bad.

32
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:35,410
My brother is on a hunt with the Emperor of Northern Lin.

33
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,259
I will send my man to inform His Majesty.

34
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,119
No, there are others on the hunt.

35
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,459
If the soldiers find out about the mole from Qi,

36
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,159
we have nothing for our defense.

37
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,539
I should go.

38
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,319
No, this is too risky.

39
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,200
As a last resort, I can save my neck with my identity.

40
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,319
- But my lady, this is...
- I should go.

41
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,840
Don't worry, you can count on me.

42
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,250
Who is there?

43
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,959
I thank Crown Prince for joining our hunt.

44
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,015
You are welcome. It's my honor to join you.

45
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:38,045
It's also part of my duty.

46
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,387
Just now, I could tell Prince Li has remarkable wits and skills.

47
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,226
And now we are having this friendly conversation together.

48
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:49,107
Northern Lin is full of decent people.

49
00:05:50,002 --> 00:05:52,707
My brother, Wuyou, is an arrogant person.

50
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,719
If he offended Your Majesty, I apologize for him.

51
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,710
- It's okay.
- Your Majesty.

52
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,711
Your Highness.

53
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:01,443
Beasts lurk in the area ahead of us.

54
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:04,411
We need to be cautious if we move forward.

55
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:05,979
Your concern is unnecessary.

56
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:10,121
I may not possess your prowess in martial arts, but I am good with the bow.

57
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:13,199
It's not the beast that I fear.

58
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,782
I only fear there might be no game for our hunt.

59
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,234
Hold on.

60
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:28,550
What's wrong? Are Your Majesty afraid?

61
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:32,405
I shall accompany you to the main camp after I shoot this deer.

62
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:34,436
I have no fear for the game.

63
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,819
But this deer is walking with a slow pace.

64
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,299
There is sentiment in its eyes.

65
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:41,991
From what I see, it's already pregnant.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,379
Animals are sentient beings.

67
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,313
Such an act of killing is too much for me to bear.

68
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Your Majesty is right.

69
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,536
Emperor of Qi, you are a ruler of a nation, but ever so merciful.

70
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,419
I am surprised.

71
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,272
Since it's pregnant, I shall not kill it.

72
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,748
Wuyou, we have been looking for you.

73
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:11,459
You have been here all this time?

74
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,820
Greetings, Emperor of Qi.

75
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:16,859
Crown Prince.

76
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:20,826
Thanks to the Emperor of Qi, you finally get a chance to leave the Eastern Palace.

77
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:22,359
Wuyou,

78
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,099
didn't you see the deer is with child?

79
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:26,579
You are always so reckless.

80
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,839
If you really did hit the mark, that would be your sin.

81
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,039
Congratulations, Prince Li. He hit it at the seventh inch (vital point).

82
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,780
It's a python.

83
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,559
Prince Li really is remarkable.

84
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,118
Brave and adept with a bow. A man of sympathy, too.

85
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,219
Emperor of Qi, you should know that we need to kill the evil to save the good.

86
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,339
If we simply speak on paper, there is no difference from pretentious diligence.

87
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,223
Wuyou.

88
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:58,699
How could you be so rude to the emperor?

89
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,625
Your Majesty, I apologize for my brother.

90
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,619
Prince Li never minces word

91
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,599
Otherwise, he wouldn't have refused the engagement.

92
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,414
He rejected the kind offer from Your Majesty and the Princess.

93
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:14,999
I never run away from my responsibility.

94
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:18,537
Your pretentious concern is not needed here, Crown Prince.

95
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:21,037
I refused the engagement of my own free will.

96
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,900
If you need someone to be responsible for that, you may place the blame on me.

97
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,639
I, Zongzheng Wuyou, am no coward.

98
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,279
I don't need the other to defend my action.

99
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,215
Rumor has it Prince Li is a prideful person.

100
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:35,419
He thinks he is superior to everyone.

101
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,539
I get to see just how true the rumor is.

102
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,719
Rumor has it Emperor of Qi loves his sister more than anything.

103
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,755
I feel like that is just an exaggeration.

104
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:47,999
Your Majesty traded your sister's life for an alliance.

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,390
You used her as your pawn.

106
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,686
There is no love in this action.

107
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:55,188
That is hilarious.

108
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,042
In the world we live in, war has ravaged every corner.

109
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,068
Life is full of uncertainty.

110
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:03,427
I had no other choice.

111
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:04,914
I don't know about the others.

112
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:08,548
But I would never do the biddings of others.

113
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,643
That is only your accusation.

114
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:13,896
It is not my motive at all.

115
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:18,099
I simply feel that my sister is no ordinary lady.

116
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,568
You two could make the perfect couple.

117
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:24,960
I should do my best to persuade you so you would agree to this marriage.

118
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,319
If you miss this chance,

119
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,599
I hope you won't find yourself regretting it.

120
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,497
I have never known the taste of regret in my entire life.

121
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,460
So long.

122
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:54,999
Wuyou must have found a big game. I should help him out.

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,256
Brother, wait for me!

124
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,540
Young and arrogant.

125
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,613
I hope Your Majesty was not offended.

126
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,668
General Fu, you are close to Wuyou.

127
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,489
Go and check on him.

128
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:06,772
Yes.

129
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,420
Come.

130
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,019
What happened?

131
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,551
Someone sneaked in when I was on patrol. I was knocked out.

132
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:26,735
Did you see the person?

133
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:29,536
It happened too quickly.

134
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,939
Animals can tell the scent of human beings.

135
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,979
That eagle might have recognized my scent.

136
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:51,974
This is bad, I can't let it find me.

137
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,942
Let's split up. You lead the troop to the right,

138
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:28,240
I will go to the left.

139
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,990
Yes.

140
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,603
Prince Li.

141
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:03,785
What majestic game have you found here?

142
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:07,185
There is no game.

143
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,668
I simply wish to be away from vile men and take a break.

144
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,548
I am a little exhausted as well.

145
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:20,580
May I take a break with Your Highness here?

146
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,258
I said I wish to be away from vile men.

147
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,448
I shall be on my way now.

148
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,485
What will you do to me next?

149
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,790
What do you want of me?

150
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:27,499
I told you. We have different backgrounds.

151
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,784
We shouldn't be involved in any of these.

152
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:31,459
You lied to me.

153
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,360
And now you are blaming me for it?

154
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,650
I wish there was another way, but I had no other choice.

155
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:40,730
The duty I have on my shoulder...

156
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:43,815
is the task I must carry out.

157
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,339
You know I won't harm you.

158
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,170
That is why you are acting so bold.

159
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,038
That is not what it is.

160
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,824
For me, Your Highness is like the moon shrouded by the clouds,

161
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:03,100
a blossom hidden by the mist.

162
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,532
I can't seem to understand you.

163
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:09,293
I know.

164
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,931
Perhaps you already know I am from Western Qi.

165
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:16,898
You even brought me here to lure me into your trap.

166
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,140
You had everything planned,

167
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,099
you wouldn't let me get away so easily.

168
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,100
You are asking for the rhetorical.

169
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,698
Can't you see?

170
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:32,034
You would most likely be executed if the others had caught you.

171
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,459
But me,

172
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,159
I am the only one that can't bear to see you get hurt.

173
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,077
- I am placing a bet on this.
- What bet is it?

174
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:40,157
A bet on my life.

175
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:43,095
I want to know if you are truly in love with me.

176
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,029
I want you to know,

177
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,945
you won the bet.

178
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:05,496
I hope Your Highness hasn't forgotten.

179
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:08,328
The difference between us...

180
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:10,340
is more than just our status and background.

181
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,700
There are duties the both of us must carry out.

182
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,588
Man Yao, we are the same.

183
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,878
Your duty is mine, too.

184
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:27,819
Once, the burden was too much even for me.

185
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,300
I thought all hope was lost.

186
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,349
But, Man Yao,

187
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,297
fate brought us together.

188
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:45,202
Because of you, I learned to never give up.

189
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,900
I made up my mind.

190
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,714
Whatever it takes,

191
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:54,431
I will hold onto those that are right in front of me.

192
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,620
I will never give up.

193
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,920
But somehow,

194
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:05,220
there will always be something you must let go of.

195
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,451
No.

196
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:09,873
Man Yao, that is not true.

197
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:12,974
Do not despair so easily.

198
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:15,383
I care not about who you were.

199
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,264
I don't care what your motives are.

200
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,821
None of those matter to me.

201
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,140
I just want you by my side.

202
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,320
Your Highness.

203
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,130
Man Yao,

204
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:30,460
I love you.

205
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,760
♫ I'm envious of your shadow that follows you ♫

206
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,530
♫ Do you want to have a drink with me? ♫

207
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,290
♫ The useless tears that we are born with are for us to waste ♫

208
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,070
♫ The useless tears that we are born with are for us to waste ♫

209
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,180
♫ Rather than having no worries and having a dull life ♫

210
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,420
♫ I'd rather pursue you ♫

211
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,730
♫ Even though the flower might wilt and I might fail... ♫

212
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,280
♫ It can still be considered a success  ♫

213
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,804
"War is upon our nations. Catastrophe ravaged the land.

214
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,871
The alliance shall be formed to free the lands of suffering.

215
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:33,716
The marriage alliance shall last forever as the two nations join hands.

216
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:38,039
Together, we shall fend off the Wei forces so the land can finally know peace.

217
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,463
The treaty will be signed and with the world as a witness,

218
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:45,409
none shall betray this vow."

219
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,393
In celebration of the forming of this alliance,

220
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,527
for the next three nights, curfew will be lifted.

221
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:59,776
Everyone can enjoy the celebration with a lantern festival.

222
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,980
Long live the Emperor.

223
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,360
Your Majesty has my gratitude.

224
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,879
Man Yao, I care not about who you were.

225
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:24,158
I don't care what your motives are.

226
00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:27,214
I just want you to stay by my side.

227
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,398
Rong Le.

228
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,300
Brother.

229
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,152
I have a report from the kite.

230
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:42,890
I never expected a trap would be set up in the hunting ground.

231
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,626
Rong Le, you shouldn't have risked yourself for me.

232
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,070
What if you had gotten hurt?

233
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,580
With the jade amulet you gave me,

234
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,084
I can overcome any danger that is thrown at me.

235
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:01,375
But Wuyou...

236
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:07,070
I mean Prince Li... is almost certain that I am no commoner.

237
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,953
He thinks I am a spy from Qi.

238
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:12,911
It doesn't matter what he knows. I won't allow him to hurt you.

239
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,343
Zongzheng Wuyou has a sinister intention.

240
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:18,579
Refusal of the marriage, the taunting during the hunt,

241
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:23,073
and the set-up to test you, he doesn't plan to hide his hostility for us.

242
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,534
He has a bold ambition.

243
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:30,399
If he finds out who you really are, things won't end well for us.

244
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,328
Should I... request the emperor to cancel the engagement?

245
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:39,757
Brother, Prince Li is not an unreasonable person.

246
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,659
With the alliance formed, Western Qi is the inferior force.

247
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,420
We need Northern Lin to recover from the damage of war.

248
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,550
We cannot terminate the engagement now.

249
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:54,432
I don't want to be the cause... of your worries.

250
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:59,100
Rong Le, you don't need to shoulder everything on your own.

251
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,865
Because you are the person that cares for me the most.

252
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:07,245
You are also the person I trust the most.

253
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,421
My good sister.

254
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,760
I will not disappoint your trust in me.

255
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,260
I will live up to your expectations, too.

256
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,659
Once I get "The Book of Mountains and Rivers," the two of us can go home.

257
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,620
Man Yao, I love you.

258
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,705
What's the matter?

259
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:43,456
Rong Le?

260
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:48,569
I am fine. I am fine.

261
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,207
What are you laughing at?

262
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,060
I was just thinking that since His Majesty came here,

263
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,911
Princess Rong Le has been smiling a lot more.

264
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:17,360
She told me His Majesty might bring her back to Qi.

265
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,230
I am so happy for her.

266
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,644
Did she say anything about going back with her brother?

267
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:24,060
Yes.

268
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,699
Well, the princess is always in danger while she is here.

269
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:32,812
If she is back in Qi, no one would dare to harm her under His Majesty's protection.

270
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:35,472
Do you want to go back, too?

271
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:40,819
Honestly, for me, wherever the princess is, that is where my home is.

272
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,060
We rely on one another in this land.

273
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,560
There is the princess...

274
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,832
and there is you, Sir Xiao.

275
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:50,899
Sometimes, I don't feel like we are master and servants.

276
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,709
It's more like a bond of kinship.

277
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,878
I just want my loved ones...

278
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:58,420
to be happy, well, and have a good life.

279
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,874
No matter what happens, you must take good care of the princess.

280
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:06,436
I will give it my all to protect you.

281
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:30,539
The treaty may have been signed,

282
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,939
but the Emperor of Qi is persistent.

283
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:37,940
The marriage must be settled for good before he leaves.

284
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:44,884
Without the marriage as reassurance and keeping Princess Rong Le in our nation,

285
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:48,140
the alliance is as fragile as a piece of paper.

286
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,694
It can be broken at any moment.

287
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,086
Indeed. Both nations want the advantage.

288
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:57,258
Without any limiting factor, the treaty could break at any time.

289
00:23:57,258 --> 00:24:01,132
The matter with the marriage alliance must be dealt with.

290
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:03,419
The Emperor of Qi hinted to me several times.

291
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,671
He thinks Wuyou can be a great leader one day.

292
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,480
He is willing to help Wuyou with the strength of Qi.

293
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,500
But Wuyou is unbending.

294
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,780
No one can force him to do anything.

295
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,859
Your Majesty, how are you going to persuade him?

296
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:21,750
What happened to Concubine Yun was indeed my fault for letting him down.

297
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,439
All these years, this child of mine has never bowed down to anyone.

298
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,537
He has gone against me at every turn.

299
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:28,537
I let him do as he pleased.

300
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:32,134
But the future of Northern Lin is at stake.

301
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,918
I cannot allow him to act ruthlessly.

302
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:37,419
Your Majesty, you mean to...

303
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:39,339
I knew it all along.

304
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:44,179
For the past few months, Wuyou has grown intimate with that peasant girl.

305
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:46,649
Your Majesty?

306
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,276
My Lady, you are frowning and look absent-minded.

307
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:37,644
Is there anything I can do to share your burden?

308
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:40,625
Chen Yu, I appreciate this.

309
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:45,832
There is one matter that I'm still struggling to decide.

310
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,200
No, I do have a decision.

311
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,769
But I just can't be certain enough.

312
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:03,846
I wonder what the matter is that is bothering you.

313
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:09,203
Chen Yu, have you ever loved someone?

314
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,999
My Lady, someone like me...

315
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,821
doesn't have the right to speak about love.

316
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:22,920
I keep having this odd feeling lately.

317
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,383
I feel like my heart is being filled with something.

318
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:31,968
It's so warm and sweet.

319
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:34,834
It's taking my breath away.

320
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:40,442
I feel like he means more than anything in this world to me.

321
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:45,993
However, the feeling is also bitter at times.

322
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:48,727
It feels like a burden is weighing you down.

323
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:52,276
Which is why there are many other things...

324
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,737
that are more important than loving someone.

325
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,000
I will live up to your expectations.

326
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,700
Once I get "The Book of Mountains and Rivers," the two of us can go home.

327
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,627
My Lady!

328
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,417
What is this?

329
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:30,909
Prince Li ordered his man to send this here.

330
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:32,606
Open it.

331
00:27:36,943 --> 00:27:39,123
This is so beautiful.

332
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:43,219
My Lady, I think Prince Li made this especially for you.

333
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:45,859
His Highness is inviting you to the lantern festival.

334
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,580
It's the custom here.

335
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,620
As the lanterns are lit, lovers meet with each other.

336
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,197
They make the promise for life.

337
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:56,930
My Lady, whatever your decision is,

338
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,263
you will always have my support.

339
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,943
I was thinking...

340
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:04,808
I should just follow my heart.

341
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,787
I need to make the choice I think is right.

342
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:15,888
Brother, you are still not done with Man Yao yet?

343
00:28:15,888 --> 00:28:18,459
The lover in the dream of countless ladies in this country?

344
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,539
The all mighty Prince Li...

345
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:23,779
is being toyed by a mere lady.

346
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:25,659
You spent months on her and made no progress.

347
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:27,517
You got nothing on her either.

348
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:29,592
I need an opening.

349
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:31,559
Right, you need the right moment.

350
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,099
But you can't always send me to guard that old house.

351
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:37,193
While the Emperor of Qi is in Zhongshan, we need more security.

352
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:39,219
Especially during the lantern festival.

353
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,651
Crowds of people will be there.

354
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:43,276
It's easy for someone to sneak in.

355
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:45,718
Just stay put and guard the house.

356
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:47,276
Brother, let me take a break for once. Okay?

357
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,879
Our father hardly ever launches a celebration in the city.

358
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,439
I was hoping to meet some pretty ladies with this opportunity.

359
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,220
Thanks to you, I have to guard the old manor.

360
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,620
Maybe the old man was just lying to you. There is no vault, to begin with.

361
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,234
Don't be ridiculous.

362
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:08,577
Brother... Why don't you decorate the manor with some lanterns?

363
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:11,735
You can bring Man Yao with you there for the night.

364
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:16,246
In that quiet house, you two can do whatever you want.

365
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:19,398
Killing two birds with one stone.

366
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,058
I won't be available that night.

367
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,015
Fine, I get to be the expendable.

368
00:29:45,794 --> 00:29:49,394
Yali, are you going to the lantern festival with someone?

369
00:29:49,394 --> 00:29:50,899
I never like to be in the crowd.

370
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:52,734
I want to be at home and have some rest.

371
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:57,394
Besides, there is no one to invite me.

372
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:59,900
You are brilliant and gorgeous.

373
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,125
That is a fact known by all.

374
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:06,339
I heard there are tons of men waiting to propose to you.

375
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,717
But sadly, none of them is to your liking.

376
00:30:08,717 --> 00:30:11,939
Your Majesty, please don't make fun of me.

377
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:17,018
I know. Are you waiting for someone to meet with you?

378
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,353
I heard from someone earlier.

379
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:24,174
They say you were meeting Wuyou in the teahouse.

380
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,300
Yali, you have nothing to be worried about.

381
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,019
For the time being, Prince Li might not marry Princess Rong Le.

382
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:36,299
I was thinking about matchmaking you with Prince Li.

383
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,539
His Majesty can grant you the engagement with Prince Li.

384
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,901
Your Majesty, I don't wish to get married.

385
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:45,211
I don't deserve the love of Prince Li either.

386
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,252
Yali, please get up.

387
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:50,984
Why? Do you think Prince Li will mistreat you?

388
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:53,765
His Highness has never mistreated me.

389
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:56,020
- But I am just...
- Mother!

390
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,454
Greetings, Your Majesty.

391
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,420
Please don't make it hard for Miss Yali.

392
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,901
Miss Yali has her own reasons.

393
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:08,693
She had to keep it a secret for Wuyou.

394
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:11,160
What does that suppose to mean?

395
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,179
Mother, I shouldn't be the one that tells you.

396
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,069
But seeing how concerned you are with Wuyou's marriage,

397
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:20,902
I must bring it up to you.

398
00:31:20,902 --> 00:31:22,677
Be quick with it.

399
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:28,219
Wuyou is in love with someone.

400
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,228
- What?
- However,

401
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:32,760
the lady is a daughter of a merchant.

402
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,027
She meets clients and runs a teahouse alone.

403
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:39,138
What?

404
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:41,276
This is getting more outrageous.

405
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:42,659
This is not adequate at all.

406
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,899
No, Your Majesty. That girl is actually...

407
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:48,115
So, he was telling the truth?

408
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,074
Yali, I assure you, I won't leave you disappointed.

409
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:59,389
I must inform His Majesty now and get this problem solved.

410
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:02,430
Mother, calm down.

411
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,638
Did you hear what the crown prince said just now?

412
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:25,545
We didn't hear a word.

413
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:31,740
Good. If the rumors reach His Majesty's ear,

414
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,419
the consequences are more than any of you can handle.

415
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:37,420
We understand.

416
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:45,755
The arrival of the empress!

417
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:03,910
Your Majesty.

418
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,299
It's been a while since I am summoned here.

419
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,176
I heard from the physician that...

420
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:29,477
Your Majesty is a little under the weather.

421
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:31,682
The Emperor of Qi came to visit.

422
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:33,548
There are many affairs to work with.

423
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:36,929
Your Majesty must take care of yourself.

424
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,522
I thank you for the concern.

425
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:49,100
Your Majesty. I wonder if the Emperor of Qi came here...

426
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,835
to discuss the engagement of Prince Li and Princess Rong Le.

427
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:58,573
Lately, there seem to be some rumors...

428
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,400
about Prince Li's engagement.

429
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,569
Have you heard anything about it?

430
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,328
I don't have a clue about this matter.

431
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:16,247
Recently, the daughter of Secretary Sun entered the palace.

432
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:19,402
I do pity her...

433
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:23,794
and her bond with Prince Li as childhood friends.

434
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:25,699
This is nothing to be worried about.

435
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:29,069
Wuyou is a temperamental child.

436
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:31,942
Please keep an eye on him for me.

437
00:34:31,942 --> 00:34:35,003
Yes, Your Majesty.

438
00:35:27,486 --> 00:35:28,995
Brother.

439
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,981
Rong Le,

440
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:48,760
this is the scene I have been seeing in my dream.

441
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,818
It finally came true today.

442
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:55,693
I feel like we went back in time...

443
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:58,235
to the life we spent in the Qi royal palace,

444
00:35:58,235 --> 00:36:01,968
which was peaceful and quiet.

445
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:06,304
It would be great if there was no war to be fought.

446
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:09,797
I could stay by your side for the rest of my life.

447
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:15,399
Rong Le, do you feel unhappy with your life here?

448
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,920
No, not at all.

449
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,211
Why don't we have some fun at the feast in the palace tonight?

450
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:27,659
Every time I go to the palace, people question my motive.

451
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:29,059
I don't like that.

452
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:32,939
I can send Xiao Sha to take you to the lantern festival.

453
00:36:32,939 --> 00:36:34,819
Xiao Sha should be in the palace.

454
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:38,298
Your safety comes first. You need not be worried about me.

455
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:42,168
Tonight, I am not going anywhere.

456
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,880
Very well. Have a good rest tonight.

457
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,660
Rong Le, something seems to be bothering you.

458
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,737
Is there something you haven't told me?

459
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,778
I...

460
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:01,402
Nothing.

461
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:04,234
I'll go home once I get the book.

462
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:07,710
Then, I can stay by your side forever.

463
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,680
Sure. I should be on my way now.

464
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,611
Brother, are you all right?

465
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:22,954
Are you having a relapse? I'll get the medicine for you.

466
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:24,694
Little Xun!

467
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:26,564
- Little Xun!
- I am fine.

468
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,001
My dear sister, I have good news for you.

469
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:34,567
My men have found the whereabouts of the physician.

470
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:38,708
I believe your headache can finally be cured.

471
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,418
Rong Le, as long as you are well,

472
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:48,640
I'll be free from all sicknesses.

473
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,200
Thank you

474
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,086
I should go now.

475
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:55,736
Take care.

476
00:37:55,736 --> 00:37:57,836
The same goes for you.

477
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:17,054
Your Highness, is Prince Li really going to leave tonight?

478
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:19,450
I am not certain either.

479
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,599
Do you really plan to get "The Book of Mountains and Rivers"...

480
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,420
and leave this land for good?

481
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,308
Tonight is the best opportunity we have.

482
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:31,719
[The Minister's Manor]

483
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:34,059
- Leng Yan.
- Yes.

484
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:36,039
There are eyes and ears everywhere in the festival.

485
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,040
- Keep your eyes open.
- Yes.

486
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,152
Understood. All the entrances and exits are heavily guarded.

487
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,180
No one shall pass through here.

488
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,140
Brother, you can always count on Leng Yan.

489
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,940
I want you to stay put as well.

490
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,022
Me? I give you my word.

491
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:52,582
I won't even step out of this house.

492
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,700
I have other matters to see to.

493
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,985
Don't you dare sell me out.

494
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:13,185
Otherwise...

495
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,860
Brother, what are the odds? Why are you here?

496
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,419
Who said you can come out?

497
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:08,388
I talked to Leng Yan about this.

498
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:10,299
He will guard the house for me.

499
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:12,299
I can have some fun here.

500
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:15,800
You came out without my permission.

501
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,473
Here is something you don't know.

502
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:20,360
There is a tournament in the House of Fragrance.

503
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,335
Any who gets the right answers for the riddles...

504
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:25,316
can watch the new Flower Queen get elected.

505
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:27,760
You should come with me.

506
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:31,699
I am not interested. Go if you want.

507
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,590
You are not interested in riddles,

508
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,140
but what's so fun about watching the lanterns?

509
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,632
I am waiting for someone.

510
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:40,786
Man Yao?

511
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,659
You need to be careful not to fall for her.

512
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:46,692
- What if...
- What about your riddle games?

513
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:51,297
Right. Did you agree to let me go? I am really going now.

514
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:52,917
Just go.

515
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:09,059
Brothers on patrol, come in and get some warmth.

516
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:10,860
Let's have some wine.

517
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,799
- Come on.
- Let's go.

518
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,522
Come on.

519
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,559
Brother, to Master Leng's health.

520
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,220
- Sure.
- To Master Leng's health.

521
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,856
I'll get you some wine.

522
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:25,431
- Fill the cup.
- Come on and start eating.

523
00:41:25,431 --> 00:41:27,191
Dig in.

524
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,129
Man Yao, you must come here.

525
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:15,080
♫ I've been secretly missing you for several seasons already ♫

526
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:21,120
♫ Who was the first to talk about love? ♫

527
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:27,600

529
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:41,370
♫ The western wind dyes the flowering season
in thick gray color ♫

530
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:47,180
♫ And I am still standing here waiting for the rain to come ♫

531
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:54,410
♫ No matter how good or bad the season turns out ♫

532
00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:01,170
♫ I will still try with my upmost to make a home for us ♫

533
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:11,410
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

534
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:17,960

535
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,290
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

536
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:31,600
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

537
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:48,090
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

538

♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

540
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:08,100
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

541
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:19,100
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
