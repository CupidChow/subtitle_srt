00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,920
[Episode 45]

2
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,780
In your eyes, this is who I am?

3
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,679
Did you say this because you hate me too much?

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,720
Don't think too highly of yourself.

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,820
I thought I would hate you my whole life.

6
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,260
But for the past year, my life was happy.

7
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,780
I realized one can erase hate with love.

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,500
My heart is filled with my love for Wuyou.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,900
There is no room for hate.

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,500
I know there must be a place for me in your heart.

11
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,840
You won't give me the chance to be hated?

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,740
Don't come any closer.

13
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,600
We haven't met in a year.

14
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,719
I came all the way here and risked my life...

15
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,000
not because I wanted to hurt you.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,560
I just wanted to see you,

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,640
just like I would with an old friend.

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,160
I just wanted to talk.

19
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,740
In your eyes, am I really so terrifying?

20
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,640
Isn't that the fact?

21
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,500
You are just as vile as a snake to me.

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,340
Before I am certain you will die by my own hand,

23
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,440
I can only run away.

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,700
Rong Le!

25
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,100
Rong Le.

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,460
If my death... can wipe away your fear for me,

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,480
then I will die by your hand.

28
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,860
As everyone knows,

29
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,360
half of Northern Lin is now mine.

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,620
But what they never knew...

31
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,760
is that... death is the only relief I can ask for.

32
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,300
Run!

33
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,400
- Help!
- Save them!

34
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,320
Watch out!

35
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,740
Princess Rong Le, I am glad your vitals weren't hit.

36
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,339
You need to rest well for the time being. Stop going out again.

37
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
Very well. Ke'er, you have my thanks.

38
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,480
You may leave now, I need to talk to Wuyou.

39
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,960
Yes.

40
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,820
Wuyou, I didn't consider all the risks this time.

41
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,180
I didn't know it was him until I was already there.

42
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,740
He came here... because of the Blood Raven Root.

43
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,300
But I can't tell if he is lying.

44
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,660
Perhaps he has other motives.

45
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,099
But whatever he has in mind, I will have nothing to do with him.

46
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,699
I will never forget the harm and damage he did to us.

47
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,999
As for his Blood Raven Root, I won't accept it.

48
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,020
I won't accept his kindness.

49
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,480
I have work to do.

50
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,100
Rest well.

51
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,219
It was a woman that saved Fu Chou. Someone else was helping her.

52
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,879
The weapons they use are these rhombus darts.

53
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,780
They are both well trained and coordinated.

54
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,360
Is this the weapon used by the Creed of Vengeance?

55
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,239
I checked, the Creed never used such weapons.

56
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,520
But the way they operated is similar to the Creed.

57
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,259
Send in more guards. Track them down secretly, use a man-hunt as a cover.

58
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,639
Clinics, inns, residential areas, and all possible hideouts. Search every inch of the land.

59
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,620
Consider it done.

60
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,880
Your Majesty, Sir Chang is here.

61
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,640
At your service, Your Majesty.

62
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,200
Sir Chang. How long have you been serving Prince Regent?

63
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,740
About a year.

64
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,660
Do you think His Highness would see...

65
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,900
a servant that followed him for only a year more important...

66
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,559
than his own mother?

67
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,079
I dare not compare myself with Your Majesty. His Highness is my master.

68
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:01,260
Your Majesty is his mother.

69
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,719
Naturally, Your Majesty is my master as well.

70
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,020
Tell me something.

71
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,860
Ever since his reign started,

72
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,159
did he ever go to Lady Yun's tomb?

73
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,679
Never.

74
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,980
That place would remind him of his sad past.

75
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,839
I doubt he would want to be there.

76
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,280
But from what I heard,

77
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,260
His Highness ordered you to keep the tomb well taken care of,

78
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,799
just as how you take care of Tranquil Garden and Moon Embrace.

79
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,400
I was only following orders.

80
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,600
I have another question.

81
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,260
Is the woman inside the tomb...

82
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,899
still lying in there unscathed?

83
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,340
Yes, the body was never moved.

84
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,599
Zongzheng Wuyou actually left his own mother...

85
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:04,880
in Zhongshan all along?

86
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,180
Such a disgrace of a son.

87
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,380
Even Fu Chou is taking better care...

88
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,060
of a mere dead woman than he is.

89
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,680
Dismissed.

90
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,519
Tomorrow, accompany me to the tomb.

91
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,699
But His Highness gave us orders. None can enter the tomb.

92
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,919
Understood. I will make the arrangement.

93
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,260
I shall go now.

94
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,880
Yun'er,

95
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,240
he left me with no choice.

96
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,840
Yun'er,

97
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,220
do you know that Fu Chou went to the south?

98
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,400
Now that he is there,

99
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,200
I wonder what will happen?

100
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,120
Now, the children are all grown up.

101
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,040
It will be a great show to watch.

102
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,659
However, Yun'er,

103
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,280
you left this world too soon.

104
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,540
You won't get the chance to witness this great event.

105
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,179
Allow me... to watch it in your place.

106
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
After so many years,

107
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,140
you haven't changed one bit.

108
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,660
You look just the same as 16 years ago.

109
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,080
A living person like myself...

110
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,900
was even bested by a deceased like you.

111
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,599
You've been sleeping inside this coffin...

112
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,440
for so many years.

113
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,020
Why don't we... let you get some sunlight?

114
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,679
Have you seen this man?

115
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,040
- Have you seen this man?
- No.

116
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,920
Go.

117
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,740
Come on.

118
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,079
Stop, have you seen this man?

119
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,090
Hold on, I am dressing the wound.

120
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,960
Go.

121
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,159
- Madam.
- If you want to leave in one piece,

122
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,519
you must tend to his wounds.

123
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,860
- Yes, Madam.
- Go on.

124
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,200
We may not be born as one,

125
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,280
but I have made up my mind...

126
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,360
to die by your side.

127
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,599
You disguised as her and ruined my plan.

128
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,060
I simply gave you some punishment.

129
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,079
- And now you put on her face again...
- Young Master!

130
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,879
...just to set me up!

131
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,620
I wish I can just end your life here!

132
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,440
I almost thought...

133
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,960
I had left those memories behind.

134
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,180
For one year,

135
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,660
I never got any news about you.

136
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,160
I never mention the time we spent together.

137
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,620
I thought I could let it go.

138
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,440
But when you showed up right in front of me,

139
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,400
I realized all of my efforts...

140
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,440
are just a waste of time.

141
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,160
The last time you listened to my words so peacefully...

142
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,480
was over a decade ago.

143
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,940
When we trained under the Creed,

144
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,860
you were so nice to me.

145
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,100
Your kindness made me feel like...

146
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,880
we could spend the rest of our life together.

147
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,100
I worked hard to realize that dream.

148
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,880
But you slowly became more and more distant from me.

149
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,360
Even after we have had a child together,

150
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,840
I am not even sure if I should tell you.

151
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,140
This cuisine... are your usual favorites.

152
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,639
Try them out.

153
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
They all have a mild flavor.

154
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,360
What happened to your hand?

155
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,780
There is some work that I must see to.

156
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,820
- Enjoy your meal.
- Wuyou?

157
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,560
- Wuyou.
- Stay right there.

158
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,300
Don't go.

159
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,239
This is the herbal soup Princess Rong Le prepared.

160
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,440
Four of those herbs were hand-picked by Princess Rong Le herself.

161
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,599
There are sicklepods,

162
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,720
Cynanchum, Betula, and platycodon

163
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,279
Your Highness, the herbs are...

164
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,260
She wishes to apologize.

165
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,700
But what do I have to forgive?

166
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,280
Do you really have no idea what my concerns are?

167
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,519
Do you really think I would be jealous...

168
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,320
over his affection for you and have a tantrum?

169
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,700
Wuyou.

170
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,500
I will be at the School of Wisdom tomorrow afternoon.

171
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,380
You should come, too.

172
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,620
I will be waiting for you.

173
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,130
[School of Wisdom]
People at birth, are naturally good.

174
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:34,130
Their natures are similar, their habits make them different.
(The children are reciting from the Three Character Classic, called San Zi Jing)

175
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,520
If, negligently, not taught, their nature deteriorates.

176
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,270
The right way to teach, is with absolute concentration.

177
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:51,099
- Brother!
- Brother Wuyou!

178
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:54,239
Are you looking for Sister Rong Le?

179
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,279
She hid herself somewhere.

180
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,439
You must find her yourself.

181
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,919
Off we go!

182
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,100
Let's go!

183
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,199
From now on, you will never have to look for me.

184
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,039
Wherever you are, as soon as you open your eyes,

185
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,920
I will be right there in front of you.

186
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,079
Fine.

187
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,340
No matter what the future holds for us,

188
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,679
you will be the first that comes to my mind.

189
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,020
I will be even more cautious...

190
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,740
and stay away from danger.

191
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,380
Since you understand my concern,

192
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,100
it doesn't matter who you are meeting,

193
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,240
you can't take the risk alone. Understood?

194
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,380
So, will you forgive me now?

195
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,399
I was never mad at you.

196
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,640
There is nothing to forgive.

197
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,479
Man Yao, I am not mad.

198
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:07,280
I am afraid.

199
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,640
I know.

200
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,159
I know you don't wish to see me get hurt...

201
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,119
or be tricked by anyone.

202
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,599
You don't what the tragedy to happen again.

203
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,200
I understand all your concerns.

204
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,220
I assure you...

205
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,180
it won't happen again.

206
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,140
I will take good care of myself so you don't have to worry.

207
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,980
The same goes for you, don't make me worry again.

208
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,440
I won't.

209
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,380
Does it hurt?

210
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,220
When you set the kite flying for me,

211
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,660
you said it was a custom.

212
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,519
Then, I also heard that...

213
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,999
on the wedding day, the husband and wife...

214
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,980
will each cut off a strand of their hair...

215
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,959
and tie a knot with it.

216
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,220
It means the couple will live as one...

217
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,340
till death do they part.

218
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,340
Married as a couple,

219
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,000
faithful till the end of time.

220
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,240
The whole south is full of your wanted posters and soldiers are hunting you.

221
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,700
There are checkpoints at the city gates.

222
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,719
If you plan to leave this place on your own,

223
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,520
you are as good as dead.

224
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,700
This place is rather remote.

225
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,759
You can stay here and recover for a few days.

226
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,800
But you can't stay for too long.

227
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Now that you are the Prince Regent of Northern Lin,

228
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,280
someone will be here for your extraction.

229
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,780
I have to go now.

230
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,039
Madam, have mercy on me!

231
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,679
I tended to that man's wound!

232
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,780
Please, don't kill me!

233
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,239
My daughter just had her first birthday.

234
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,319
This is the present I bought for her.

235
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,660
I promised her I will bring this back to her.

236
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,199
She is too young,

237
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,740
she can't live without a father!

238
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,999
Madam, I swear on my life,

239
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,959
I won't tell anyone about this place.

240
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,079
Please have mercy on me!

241
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,380
Spare me my life!

242
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,760
Madam! Please, don't kill me!

243
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,120
If you tell anyone after you leave...

244
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,020
No, I won't say a word.

245
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,479
Get out of my sight.

246
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,340
Thank you, Madam!

247
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,780
For the first time, you actually spared someone.

248
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,400
People will change.

249
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,300
No one is born cruel and heartless.

250
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,780
Are you leaving?

251
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,199
We've been searching all day.

252
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,500
This should be the last house.

253
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,920
Come on.

254
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,120
Do not alert the enemy unless it's the last option.

255
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,460
Is anyone home? We have an order to search the house!

256
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,200
Follow my lead.

257
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,000
I must have been blind to marry this heartless wretch!

258
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,439
You heartless fiend!

259
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,420
I gave it my all to treat you well for all these years,

260
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,220
but you are loving someone else!

261
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,780
I never planned to marry you.

262
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,679
You asked for this.

263
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,460
What did you say?

264
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,719
Who else can you marry?

265
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,400
Even without her, I won't spend any time on you.

266
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,919
- You...
- Silence!

267
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,580
This is official business!

268
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,440
Have you seen this man?

269
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,399
What do you want? Can't you see we are fighting?

270
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,479
- Get out of my house!
- Insolent fool!

271
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,119
What are you trying to pull off?

272
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Turn around, show yourself!

273
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,300
Report!

274
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,640
Captain, we found this dart outside.

275
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,120
Go!

276
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,740
The dart that came in for your aid was Xiang Ying's plan.

277
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,440
Yes.

278
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,500
Since you saved me,

279
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,640
all the grudges we had are now water under the bridge.

280
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,380
You can go now.

281
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,519
Do you think that if I stay here,

282
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,680
I won't stop bothering you?

283
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,640
I am no longer the fool that lives just to please you.

284
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,699
As of now, I have another will that drives me.

285
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,820
I didn't save you out of love.

286
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,360
It's because we once fought alongside each other.

287
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,799
Xiang Ying.

288
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,579
I distracted the guards, but they might come back here again.

289
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,100
This place is not safe, Young Master...

290
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,399
I am no longer your master.

291
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,780
The Creed is gone as well.

292
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,339
There is a saying.

293
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:46,600
People left and only memories remain.

294
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,920
Xiang Ying,

295
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,380
if she saved you and you pledged your loyalty to her,

296
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,960
you shouldn't have betrayed her.

297
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,800
You knew?

298
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,140
When I punished you,

299
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,700
I never meant to kill you.

300
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,980
I punished you so severely...

301
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,159
not because of your failure.

302
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,040
It's because...

303
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,100
you did it on purpose for Hen Xiang.

304
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,839
You thought if Rong Le was killed,

305
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,260
Hen Xiang would get what she always wanted.

306
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,220
You disobeyed my order for your own selfishness.

307
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,199
But your conscience got the better of you.

308
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,620
So you started serving Rong Le.

309
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:38,360
Do you honestly think... I didn't see what was on your mind?

310
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,820
If you know everything,

311
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,660
why did you let me go?

312
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,020
That is because...

313
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,500
we were once brothers in arms.

314
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,420
This swords saved you.

315
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,880
You told me... that you pledged your loyalty to me,

316
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,740
that you would follow me to death without regret.

317
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,360
I trusted you.

318
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,460
In the ten years you served in the army,

319
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,200
we slew enemies together.

320
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,999
You had my back.

321
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,600
You never disappointed me or let me down.

322
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,520
But this time,

323
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,580
because of your love,

324
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,260
you almost got Rong Le killed.

325
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,160
Yes, I betrayed my promise.

326
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,560
Whether you believe it or not,

327
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,140
I never truly betrayed you.

328
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,660
I never told anyone a word about your past.

329
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,620
If you want me dead,

330
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,420
then my life...

331
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,660
is yours to take.

332
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,100
Xiang Ying!

333
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,600
Xiang Ying, you know me well.

334
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,300
When I deal with traitors,

335
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,200
I never showed any mercy.

336
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,500
You saved my life.

337
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,400
We are even now.

338
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,100
If we ever meet again,

339
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,400
the three of us... are no longer master and servants.

340
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,100
We don't owe each other anything.

341
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,200
You don't need to help me.

342
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,800
I won't spare any mercy for any of you.

343
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,600
You should go.

344
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,800
Before we leave,

345
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,600
I have some advice for you.

346
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,000
The greatest pain in life... is not getting what you want.

347
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,400
If it's beyond your reach,

348
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,800
you shouldn't be obsessed.

349
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,400
Why don't you let it all go...

350
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,500
and spare yourself the pain?

351
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
You made it sound so easy.

352
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
But only a few people can do it.

353
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,800
I wish people's feelings could be just the same as curtains.

354
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,400
A single word and a blade drawn...

355
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,500
are all it takes to severe it.

356
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,800
But in reality,

357
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
not having the desired...

358
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,400
is the reason we have obsessions.

359
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
There is something...

360
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,000
I should let you know.

361
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
- We actually have...
- Hen Xiang, we must talk.

362
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,800
Come with me.

363
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,200
Let go of me.

364
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,400
Have you thought this through before telling him?

365
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,300
Why shouldn't he know?

366
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,700
The daughter is ours.

367
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,000
It's a blood tie that can never be undone.

368
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,300
But you didn't get your daughter in a righteous way.

369
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,600
You disguised as Rong Le and fooled him.

370
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,400
He lost his wife because of this.

371
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,600
It's his greatest pain.

372
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,400
Do you think he would let you stay just because of the child?

373
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
He won't.

374
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,600
Even if he acknowledges this child,

375
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
he will only take her away from you.

376
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,000
Do you want to lose your daughter?

377
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,800
Hen Xiang, you lived a year of a peaceful life without him.

378
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,000
You were born a prideful person.

379
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,300
But you lost all your pride when it comes to love.

380
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,800
Let it go.

381
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,200
I will.

382
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,800
But I must make sure Fu Chou leaves safely.

383
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,400
When the time comes,

384
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,300
I will let everything go.

385
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,400
I will forget about him.

386
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,500
You still don't understand.

387
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,600
You are in danger. You will be exposed sooner or later.

388
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,400
He wants you to leave...

389
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,600
so you won't be risking your life for him.

390
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,900
He doesn't wish to owe you anything...

391
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,400
and he wants to severe all ties.

392
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,800
The longer you cling onto this relationship,

393
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
the harder it is to let go.

394
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,300
I know.

395
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,800
But I cannot leave him alone here.

396
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,400
Xiang Ying, you can't talk me out of this.

397
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,000
This is the last time.

398
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,900
I must make sure he reaches safety.

399
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It seems like we just can't escape the inevitable.

400
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,000
Ke'er,

401
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,400
you have always been honest with me.

402
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,800
This time, don't hide any details from me.

403
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
I keep feeling dizzy lately.

404
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,000
It's the same symptoms I had a year ago.

405
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Is it because... the poison inside of me is acting up again?

406
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Princess Rong Le,

407
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
I thought not having any relapse in a year...

408
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,600
means the poison is receding, that it was just not entirely cleansed.

409
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,800
But judging by your pulse,

410
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,000
there is indeed a sign of poisoning.

411
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,500
The only cure I know for this poisoning... is the Blood Raven Root.

412
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,600
But someone got ahead of me and took the herb.

413
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,900
Ke'er, you once told me we needed the favor of fate to find an herb.

414
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,200
Perhaps it was my fate not to have the Blood Raven Root.

415
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:42,000
In the past, being poisoned was actually not a bad thing.

416
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,400
I had too many obsessions in the past.

417
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I was obsessed with finding out who I was

418
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,200
and what was right when it came to love.

419
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,600
But I am a dying person.

420
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,200
None of these matters anymore.

421
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,700
I must cherish the present.

422
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,100
I must love with all I have...

423
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,400
and be with Wuyou.

424
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,600
Princess, I was told my life would end in a few years.

425
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,200
But then I met you.

426
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,800
You brought me the Leaf of Seven Locutions.

427
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,300
You haven't had any relapse for one whole year.

428
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,100
Maybe the ingredients I used in the remedies...

429
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,400
actually helped to subdue the poison.

430
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,200
I am going to flip through all of those prescriptions again.

431
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,700
Your Highness, why are you here?

432
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,700
Blood Raven Root.

433
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,600
Where did you find this?

434
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,800
Use this in the medicine.

435
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Do not let Man Yao know.

436
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,100
But getting this is good news.

437
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,600
- What is the secrecy for?
- Do not ask.

438
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Just do as I said.

439
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,100
But...

440
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,600
She doesn't want me to be worried.

441
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,000
She never told us about her condition. I am aware of that.

442
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,400
I am doing this for her own good.

443
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
Keeping this a secret is the only way to make her take the medicine.

444
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,600
Princess, you heard it all?

445
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Are you all right?

446
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
This herb feeds on human blood.

447
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,800
It takes a toll on the feeder and causes great pain.

448
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,600
You cannot touch it.

449
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,400
Go.

450
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,500
Just go on.

451
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,000
Wait.

452
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,500
Go on.

453
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,800
You, hold on.

454
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,000
Go.

455
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,800
- Hold on.
- Stop staring, keep moving.

456
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,000
Don't cry.

457
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,700
You, stop here.

458
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
- You may go.
- Hush.

459
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,800
Where did you see this man?

460
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,200
I...

461
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,300
Hen Xiang?

462
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,600
What happened?

463
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,400
The Hidden Ones found this place. Let's go!

464
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,700
You need to leave!

465
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,100
Sir!

466
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,300
Sir, we received reports.

467
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,800
Some riders broke through the checkpoint with a carriage.

468
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,200
- Inform Prince Li.
- Yes!

469
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,200
Your Highness.

470
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,600
Report from Agent Wu.

471
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,000
We found tracks of Fu Chou at the border.

472
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,600
♫ I don't think that we will be talking anymore after this ♫

473
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,870
♫ We have been through so much ♫

474
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,400
♫ Why didn't I realize it sooner? ♫

475
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,600
♫ My heart was bleeding when I saw you leaving me ♫

476
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:26,800
♫ There was once happiness as grand
as three thousand rivers and mountains ♫

477
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:33,200
♫ Although we haven't known each other for long,
I already miss you so ♫

478
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,200
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

479
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,400
♫ I cried when you leave and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

480
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:54,000

481

482

♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,

483
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:14,000
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

484
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,800

485
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:56,500
