You may take her with you today.

167
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,040
If you want her to live, it's simple.

168
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,869
Complete your wedding with Princess Rong Le.

169
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:38,839
With that said, I will let her become your second wife.

170
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,540
I don't need a second wife.

171
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,300
She is the only woman I'll ever marry.

172
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,589
I will marry no one other than her.

173
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:51,691
Besides, both Your Majesty and I had a deal.

174
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:55,279
If I am able to find "The Book of Mountains and Rivers" in six months,

175
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,319
Your Majesty will allow me to decide my own marriage and reinitiate the reformation.

176
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,579
The deadline is yet to come.

177
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,480
Is Your Majesty trying to back out on our agreement?

178
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,766
Fine. I will follow our agreement.

179
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:13,059
But before you find the book, I am keeping this girl as hostage.

180
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:18,299
If you complete your end of the deal, then everything shall go well.

181
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,046
Should you fail to do so, I'll make sure to take her life.

182
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:29,647
What if I insist on taking her with me?

183
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,535
I'll see you try.

184
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,356
- Wuyou.
- Fear not.

185
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,512
I am taking you with me.

186
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,318
You have one more chance.

187
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,710
Marry the Princess of Western Qi...

188
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,859
or she dies.

189
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,940
After all these years,

190
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,594
I thought you knew me well enough.

191
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,450
For my entire life, I hate being threatened.

192
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:20,658
I address you as my father...

193
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:23,602
because I still see you as such.

194
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:26,161
But if you choose to force my hand,

195
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,131
there will only be two outcomes.

196
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:32,457
One, she is leaving with me.

197
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:33,983
Two,

198
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,100
both she and I will die here.

199
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,561
You insolent child!

200
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:42,959
Is it worth it to lose your life over a mere peasant girl?

201
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,540
That is up to me to decide.

202
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,037
You...

203
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,520
Your Majesty.

204
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,638
Your Majesty, Princess Rong Le and the other officers have arrived at the main hall.

205
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:59,609
Princess Rong Le?

206
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,251
Did my brother...

207
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,219
Just in time. I shall stand out today...

208
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,293
and settle it once and for all with this Princess Rong Le.

209
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:10,670
Father, I want you to witness it.

210
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,519
Wuyu, what is going on here?

211
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,359
I have no idea either.

212
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,739
Father summoned me here.

213
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,117
His Majesty the Emperor of Qi arrives!

214
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,095
At ease, my officers.

215
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:06,196
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,574
Take your seats.

217
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,715
Princess Rong Le arrives.

218
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,380
Ling Yue?

219
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,098
No, she is not Ling Yue.

220
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:52,440
What is going on here?

221
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,837
Greetings, My Lords.

222
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,680
Not only is her figure the same as mine, but even her voice is also the same.

223
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,300
At ease.

224
00:23:15,301 --> 00:23:17,213
Yes, Your Majesty.

225
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:20,000
Princess, have a seat.

226
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:27,573
Why did you turn the princess down?

227
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,492
Is it because of the rumors...

228
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,131
that say she is ugly?

229
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:34,751
Man Yao, I made you a promise.

230
00:23:34,752 --> 00:23:37,244
I will only ever marry you.

231
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,543
I only know today...

232
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,039
that you have an agreement with His Majesty.

233
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,020
What if the time is up...

234
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,483
and you still can't find the book?

235
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:51,570
Do you need to follow the order to marry her...

236
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,793
and give up on reinitiating the reform?

237
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:58,474
I assure you, I will find the book.

238
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:00,399
I will marry you.

239
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,158
What if you can't find it?

240
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,860
Even if I fail,

241
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:08,081
I will do anything to make sure you are safe.

242
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:11,127
I will shield you from danger for the rest of my life.

243
00:24:11,128 --> 00:24:12,520
I give you my word.

244
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,165
Later, with everyone here as witnesses,

245
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:18,296
I will reject the princess.

246
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:22,687
Calm down.

247
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,277
Princess Rong Le.

248
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:35,639
Before this, I gave you six months to make your decision.

249
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,959
But Emperor of Qi hopes that before he leaves,

250
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,799
the matter with your marriage can be settled.

251
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,260
Which is why I summoned all of you here.

252
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,959
Princess, you may use this opportunity to pick your husband...

253
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,240
as both your brother and I wish to see you happy.

254
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,340
May our alliance last for generations to come.

255
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:57,890
Indeed.

256
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,026
I do wish to see my sister marry the love of her life.

257
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:07,204
Whoever that man may be, as long as he is the one she loves,

258
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,940
she will have my permission.

259
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,160
I give her my word.

260
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,879
Your Majesty is thoughtful.

261
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,483
I am grateful for the kind offer.

262
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,668
Princess Rong Le is a reasonable person.

263
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:23,946
A role model for all ladies.

264
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:26,912
Princess, you may start the selection now.

265
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,679
Listen closely.

266
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,438
Even if you marry me, I am still going to the public house.

267
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,876
I will never obey you.

268
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,599
I thank you for the tea.

269
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,772
I am surprised as I am grateful.

270
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,519
General Fu is a hero of our land,

271
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,094
a man with great devotion and contributions.

272
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:31,888
You and the princess would make the perfect couple.

273
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:35,414
Emperor of Qi, what do you think?

274
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,752
I shall respect the decision of my sister.

275
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,791
Thank you, Your Majesty.

276
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:53,830
General Fu, heed my order.

277
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,069
Yes, Your Majesty.

278
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:04,376
General Fu Chou of Northern Lin and Princess Rong Le of Qi...

279
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:07,317
will complete their wedding three days from now.

280
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:10,240
Order received, Your Majesty.

281
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,668
Hold on, General Fu.

282
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:28,122
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, General Fu.

283
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,839
We'll be sure to attend your wedding.

284
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,585
- Thank you, everyone.
- Congratulation.

285
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,105
Please.

286
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,479
I wonder where Miss Man Yao is right now.

287
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,337
I was a little preoccupied just now.

288
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:44,005
I didn't get a chance to greet her in person.

289
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:48,041
Do you wish to get her blessing?

290
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,879
She needs to return to the Moon Embrace.

291
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,140
I had Wuyu send her back.

292
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,479
General Fu, you have a fiancée.

293
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,403
I advise you to keep your distance with Miss Man Yao.

294
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,330
Indeed, Prince Li.

295
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,429
Does Your Highness not plan to give me your blessing?

296
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:07,379
Then I shall congratulate you.

297
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,116
You got what you want.

298
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,459
Thank you, Prince Li.

299
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,896
Prince Li.

300
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,928
His Majesty asked for Your Highness.

301
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,599
Now that the engagement with Qi has come to an end.

302
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,340
As for my love with Man Yao, say no more.

303
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,545
From tomorrow on, I will attend the Imperial Court every day.

304
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:49,399
Wuyou, you finally came to your senses.

305
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,998
I knew it.

306
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,358
I knew you would understand my effort.

307
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,291
Your ambition is for the country.

308
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,679
Mere love is simply insignificant.

309
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,639
I am going back to Imperial Court because of Man Yao.

310
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,159
If you insist on making it hard for her,

311
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,108
perhaps where my ambition lies...

312
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,550
is something you will never understand.

313
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,840
Wuyou, I have never doubted your talent.

314
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,264
If you want to reinitiate the reformation,

315
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:20,919
as long as it doesn't interrupt the campaign against Wei,

316
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,919
I give you the permission to execute your plan.

317
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,321
Do you really mean it?

318
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:28,376
I am a man of my word. You have my word.

319
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:29,919
Good.

320
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,519
I hope Your Majesty...

321
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,001
will never interfere with my personal life again.

322
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:36,919
You shall witness the change I bring with the reformation...

323
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,396
and realize a land of benevolence.

324
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:40,710
For the sake of Northern Lin's greatness,

325
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:44,445
I will give it my all to find "The Book of Mountains and Rivers"

326
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,690
We finally got this troublesome engagement over with.

327
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,774
My nightmare has come to an end.

328
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,559
If it wasn't for my brother,

329
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,940
I would rather just charge right to the House of Fragrance.

330
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,122

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:40,370
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

494
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:49,000
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

495
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:04,210
♫ In just one day, I've tasted the entire human world's warmth ♫

496
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:10,850
♫ Yet, you are always the one I'm longing for ♫

497
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:17,060
♫ Even with thousands of feelings, we'll have no regrets ♫

498
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:24,150
♫ Look at this love, because of you I have a sweet aftertaste ♫

499
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:35,480
♫ Nothing will... go away ♫
