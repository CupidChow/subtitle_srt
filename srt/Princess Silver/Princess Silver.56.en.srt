00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Greetings, Mother.

3
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,100
So, you do remember me as your mother.

4
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,300
Take His Majesty and Princess back to the palace.

5
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
Man Yao!

8
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,400
Your Highness.

9
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
We found this villager outside the house.

10
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Who are you?

11
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
What happened here just now?

12
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Why is there so much blood by the bed?

13
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
She just gave birth to a boy.

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The boy?

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,200
How are they now?

16
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,600
Both the mother and the son are fine.

17
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Calm down. Tell us what happened here.

18
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,600
A group of soldiers came into our village.

19
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,800
They took the child from me.

20
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
They even knocked me out.

21
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,300
I think they said something about...

22
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
going back to the palace.

23
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,700
My son?

24
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,900
My son? My son?

25
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
My son?

26
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Do you know what you did?

27
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Not at all.

28
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,100
No?

29
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,700
For so many years...

30
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,400
you never thought about having revenge.

31
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,800
You went against me at every corner.

32
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
If I hadn't found you earlier,

33
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
are you really going to leave this place for good?

34
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,500
Mother, calm down.

35
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,300
Deep down in your heart,

36
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,800
you never cared about my life.

37
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
You know better than anyone...

38
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,300
that my destiny was already decided by you...

39
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,200
before I was even born.

40
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,200
That is all thanks to those who hurt you!

41
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,600
Because of them,

42
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,200
you suffered years of pains from the illness.

43
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Because of them, you are unable...

44
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,400
to realize your vision of unifying the land.

45
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,000
You spent the last two decades...

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,100
to stage a tragedy for everyone.

47
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,600
But in the end,

48
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
is the hatred finally relieved?

49
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,400
You have to live in the trauma of your past.

50
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Only by reading scripture...

51
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,800
can you have a moment of serenity for your mind.

52
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,900
What you have done...

53
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,000
and what you made me do...

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,400
are basically pointless.

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
I must have my revenge.

56
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
But that is not what I want!

57
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
I just want her to live.

58
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,100
I don't want to defy you.

59
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,400
My only wish for this life...

60
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
is for Rong Le to find her happiness.

61
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,500
I wish she can live on healthy and well.

62
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,800
Please, stop getting into my way.

63
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Stop hurting Rong Le.

64
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Mother,

65
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,400
I want you to hand over Rong Le's son as soon as possible.

66
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Otherwise...

67
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,900
Even you...

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,600
have learned to make demands of me?

69
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,700
For years, you bowed down to me as you had no choice.

70
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,200
You never dared to defy my will...

71
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,200
simply because you wanted that little girl to live.

72
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,800
What gave you the courage to defy me now?

73
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
I have had enough of this!

74
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,100
I may be known as the ruler of this land,

75
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,900
but you control me like a puppet.

76
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,400
I couldn't have my own life.

77
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I couldn't have love.

78
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
You were in love with your enemy's daughter!

79
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Back then, Qin Yong... loathed me with vile words!

80
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
If he hadn't alienated my relationship with Zongzheng Yunhe...

81
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,600
all for the sake of that cursed Lady Yun,

82
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,300
I wouldn't have been sent to the Cold Harem.

83
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,000
I wouldn't have been violated by that cursed...

84
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,700
And I wouldn't have been born.

85
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,300
I know.

86
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,000
I am the living proof of your humiliation.

87
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But that was over twenty years ago.

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You killed Qin Yong.

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
Lady Yun is dead because of you.

90
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Zongzheng Yunhe lives in hell because of you.

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,100
Are these not enough for your revenge?

92
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,700
If Zongzheng Wuyou must pay for the sins of his parents,

93
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,400
what about the lives that were lost because of your plan for revenge?

94
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,000
How many times do I have to die just to pay for your sins?

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
In your heart,

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,400
was I ever truly a son to you?

97
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Do you remember...

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,800
how much I have... gone through and how much effort I put in...

99
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,100
just to make you the emperor?

100
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
You seized the throne for me,

101
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,900
but did you do it for me...

102
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,800
or was it for your own deceptions?

103
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,400
I am sure you know it better than anyone.

104
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,800
I think after over twenty years,

105
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,200
all that I have done for you...

106
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,400
are already enough.

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
I brought you into this world...

108
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,200
I would rather not be born into this world!

109
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Qi!

110
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
I am a dead man walking.

111
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
My only wish for this life...

112
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,600
is to spend... some quiet time with Rong Le that is not bothered by anyone.

113
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,400
But even this little wish of mine...

114
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,800
is too much for me to ask of you.

115
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,600
In that case,

116
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,600
why would I even care now?

117
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't be ridiculous.

118
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,300
You are not dying!

119
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,000
I will figure out a way to let you live.

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,900
My days were numbered long ago.

121
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,000
You should know that by now.

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,200
Why do you keeping lying to yourself?

123
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,000
Fine.

124
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Stay here and rest well.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Starting tomorrow,

126
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,400
all the matters of the Imperial Court...

127
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,000
will be taken care of for you.

128
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
You are dismissed.

129
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Yes.

130
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
You are still weak.

131
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,000
Why are you standing here in the cold breeze?

132
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I need to talk to you. Follow me to the house.

133
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,300
It was you.

134
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
You took my son from me.

135
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
You locked me up in here.

136
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Your son is safe.

137
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Don't worry.

138
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you have your own reason for this?

139
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,300
Don't be paranoid.

140
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,200
The most pressing matter now is your health.

141
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,900
Why?

142
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
Why must you lie to me again?

143
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,500
When we were in the hut, I trusted you.

144
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,000
I even defended your actions.

145
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,400
Perhaps all the lies you fed me and how you used me...

146
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
were because you had your own reasons.

147
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
That is why I believed you...

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,300
and left my son and myself in your care.

149
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,400
But you...

150
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,400
I can assure you that for now,

151
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,000
your son won't be harmed. He is safe.

152
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I won't lie to you.

153
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
Man'er, I will cure you of this poison!

154
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Stop calling me that!

155
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Drop the act, I won't believe another word from you.

156
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,000
You had me locked up because you wanted to cure me.

157
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,200
But when the child was born, you took him from me right away.

158
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,700
You were clearly trying to use the child as a hostage...

159
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,200
to control me and threaten Wuyou.

160
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,400
You said you informed him.

161
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
But he never came.

163
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,200
This is my last request for you, please believe me.

164
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,500
Return my son to me...

165
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,600
or you can stop showing up with your false kindness.

166
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,200
Your Majesty!

167
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Her Majesty asked for your return.

168
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
If Your Majesty refuses to go back,

169
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
she'll hold the princess responsible.

Do not expose your identity to anyone else.

You will be married to Northern Lin.

I will help you get your revenge.

Was it my goal to seek revenge...

187
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,600

As a prince, shouldn't you learn to rule the nation and help the people?

She doesn't even remember you now.

From what I know about Rong Qi, he would have taken precautions.

400
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
If we invade Western Qi now,

401
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,600
he will surely have us surrounded.

402
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,400
When the battle starts and turns into a long fight, Rong Le will be in greater danger.

403
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,100
Jiangdu can withstand seige.

404
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,800
If we charge in there recklessly,

405
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,600
there will be heavy casualties and innocents will die.

406

Man Yao is still the Princess of Western Qi.

407

There is nothing wrong for a brother to take her home.

408
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,400
If we openly call for war,

409
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
the reason may be unacceptable.

410
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
There is only one way to save Rong Le.

411
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,400
Divide the troops.

412

A stealthy infiltration.

413
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,400
Brother, I scouted the area ahead.

414
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,600
The northern gate is their weakest point.

415
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,000
They never had a strong army, to begin with.

416
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,600
With our strength, a focus attack on this area...

417
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,500
will force Rong Qi to hand over Rong Le.

418
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,000
This is the best viable option.

419
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,200
We will only need a hundred elite soldiers.

420
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,000
They will disguise as common folks and merchants,

421
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,200
entering from different gates at different times.

422
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,000
Agent Wu and the men from the Hidden Ones are there to aid us.

423
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,600
We will split up.

424

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,800
But I heard the palace is haunted by a ghost who hung herself.

00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,000
♫ Do you dare to face the possible truth? ♫

502
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,300
♫ I cried when you left, and I keep on reminiscing
about the happy times we had ♫

503
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:39,800
♫ The regrets that I have will last me a lifetime ♫

504
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:46,600
♫ After all of those hardships, we are no longer young ♫

505
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,000
♫ I'm doomed to live in loneliness forever,
It's bad but I can't help it ♫

506
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,800
♫ Are you suffering just like me? Are you in turmoil as well? ♫

507
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:06,600
♫ After all the boom and bust, I have lost all hope ♫

508
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:42,010
♫ Let's drink to forget our worries, and bottoms up...
for you who have turned grey ♫
