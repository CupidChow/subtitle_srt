00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,550
Hello, Grandpa.

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,470
Hello.

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,750
How are you? All's good?

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,990
Yes.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,590
Yes.

7
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,110
Yerdana.

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,870
Go that way!

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,630
Okay!

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,210
When will you grow up?

11
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,950
Kazakhs have a tradition.

12
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,750
The cows, sheep, horses, and camels they raise

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,870
are only food for themselves,

14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,590
friends, and guests.

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,470
They can't be sold as products.

16
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,600
In other words,

17
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,950
if a stranger suddenly

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,350
comes to the door,

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,280
he'd immediately kill a sheep

20
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,270
to treat him generously.

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,350
But they can't buy the animals

22
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,070
no matter how much they'd pay.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,110
Not many

24
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,340
of such customs are kept alive

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,789
in the modern times.

26
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:44,550
But the ancient spirit of suppressing desire

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,670
is still buried

28
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,229
in the people's souls without a trace.

29
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,400
One day,

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,910
Zhang Fengxia decided to buy a sheep.

31
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,520
I'm going out to buy a sheep.

32
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,950
Why?

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,150
We already have two camels.

34
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,670
We only have one.

35
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,760
Ma Chunhan lent us the other one.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,900
Think about it.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,310
I'll buy a sheep

38
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,950
for it to feed on the lush grass.

39
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,520
We don't have to bother with it.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,160
It'll grow well by itself.

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,790
We'll have fresh sheep milk

42
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,190
every morning.

43
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,350
After this summer,

44
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,390
in autumn,

45
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,350
we'll sell

46
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,190
the fat sheep.

47
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,230
We'll even make money.

48
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,050
Don't camels have milk?

49
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,829
That's a male camel.

50
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,110
It farted!

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,530
Serves you right

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,430
for staring at his private part.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,190
How rude.

[Episode 5]

55
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,590
[To the Wonder]

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,480
Why don't you play with me?

57
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,300
I'm bored.

58
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,790
I'll play with the cows.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Don't go far!

60
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,350
How far can I go? Gosh.

61
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,550
Fengxia searched two mountains

62
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,310
and found a herder.

63
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,030
She's smart.

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,870
She finally chose

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,430
a female sheep

66
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,790
and begun bargaining.

67
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,590
No one would back down.

68
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,829
They couldn't reach an agreement.

69
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,110
Bargaining from sunrise to sunset.

70
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,590
In the end, the herder told her to stay overnight

71
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,010
and go home the next day.

72
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,030
The passionate Kazakh herder

73
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,190
killed that sheep

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,750
they were arguing over

75
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,910
to greet her.

76
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,280
We have a proverb,

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,590
that

78
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,750
guests own a part

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,520
of a Kazakh's family assets.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,710
Yes.

81
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,350
On our way moving here,

82
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,230
someone also gave us yogurt.

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,560
Your mom asked me to tell you

84
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,840
she'll come back after she buys

85
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,990
a sheep she likes.

86
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,110
Okay, got it.

87
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,780
Isn't someone moving ranch passing by today?

88
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Someone moving ranch?

89
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,480
I met them on the way.

90
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,630
Go wait in the east.

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,510
Okay. Are they almost here?

92
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,120
Don't go yet.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,430
Watch Grandma for me.

94
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

95
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,190
Don't let her go far.

96
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,580
Okay.

97
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,230
Thank you.

98
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,110
Hello, Grandma.

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,659
How are you?

100
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,940
How old are you?

101
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,910
38.

102
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,390
Wow, you're young.

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,070
Uncle Yao!

104
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,910
Kulan!

105
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,030
Dad!

106
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,690
Did she call me a bear again?

107
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,070
No, Dad.

108
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,350
She didn't.

109
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,590
That's good.

110
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,430
Here.

111
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,070
Thank you.

112
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,870
You're moving here too?

113
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,710
Yes, our summer ranch is here.

114
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,430
Here.

115
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,110
Thank you.

116
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,310
Thank you, kid.

117
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,030
We live by the hill.

118
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,830
Come

119
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,180
for tea.

120
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,920
My mom said our home is downstream

121
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,710
by the river.

122
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,870
Wanna be our guest?

123
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,860
Sure.

124
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,430
When my mom returns,

125
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,830
she'll watch the store

126
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,990
and I'll go visit.

127
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,010
She'll come when her mom returns.

128
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,110
Good. You must come.

129
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,350
Okay.

130
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,110
In Kazakh culture,

131
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,070
friendship or love

132
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,550
between

133
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,670
humans

134
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,910
bloom from being seen.

135
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,030
So "I like you"

136
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,870
in Kazakh,

137
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,680
"Men seni zhaksy koremin",

138
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,190
means

139
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,950
"I see you clearly".

140
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,940
Snowshoe!

141
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,430
You're here.

142
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,150
Snowshoe!

143
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,750
Snowshoe!

144
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,350
Go home!

145
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,280
I'm lonely.

146
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,470
Xiu.

147
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,910
Aren't you bored?

148
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,840
No.

149
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,230
There's no trace of a shadow here.

150
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,230
Don't you wanna talk to someone?

151
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,030
I can talk to myself.

152
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,550
Are you mentally ill like me?

153
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,940
Not really.

154
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,830
I...

155
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,230
I have two worlds.

156
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,830
Besides living,

157
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,320
I have a world of writing.

158
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,410
What do you write?

159
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,950
I write...

160
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,630
just about our lives.

161
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,780
It's still the same. Boring.

162
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,930
It's different. You don't get it.

163
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,920
It's different.

164
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,510
My goodness.

165
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,110
The ranch's grass sure is rich.

166
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,030
You're growing fat by the day.

167
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,600
Sister-in-law.

168
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,190
Who's here?

169
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,710
Who's here?

170
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,750
Village Chief Aybek.

171
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,050
To ask about the gun.

172
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,150
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

173
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,660
Who would listen to what women say?

174
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,750
Don't tell Uncle Bek yet.

175
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,150
I know. I'm not your concern.

176
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,190
Worry about Zhang Fengxia.

177
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,390
She won't help you out, you know?

178
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,390
Have you forgotten how

179
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,150
she didn't speak up for me?

180
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,480
Where are you going?

181
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,310
I'm going to the store.

182
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,670
Fengxia's collecting casein.

183
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,030
I'll go.

184
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,600
You will?

185
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,910
Okay, 10 yuan per kg.

186
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,270
Batay.

187
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,350
Buy me a washboard from

188
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,110
the store.

189
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,510
I have no money.

190
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,070
Okay.

191
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,970
I have tons of unwashed clothes.

192
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,240
Okay, bye.

193
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,310
Nadyra!

194
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,990
Stay away from the stove.

195
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,040
Why do you keep going to the stove?

196
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,510
Go.

197
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,190
Come here, kid. Come to Grandpa.

198
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,630
Yerdana.

199
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,630
Come on.

200
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,910
It's been a few days, kid,

201
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,990
and you're taller.

202
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,740
Don't you

203
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,570
wanna join the horse race?

204
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,990
I'm not twelve yet.

205
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,310
But you're all grown up.

206
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,350
Go on, dear child.

207
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,350
Have some tea.

208
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,110
Bugassenden must've told you

209
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,190
about Tokan.

210
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,350
Yes.

211
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,550
They were together as a family.

212
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,070
It was like I was in the wrong.

213
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,590
It's not that you're wrong.

214
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,110
Times have changed.

215
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,270
Look at Yerdana.

216
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,910
He speaks fluent Mandarin

217
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,070
and even writes it.

218
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,430
What a smart kid.

219
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,950
He'll go to college in the future.

220
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,580
Will he return to herd

221
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,430
after graduation?

222
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,230
Herders or not,

223
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,190
they're still my family.

224
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,870
But can you take care of two kids?

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,470
They're still young.

226
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,110
One is eight and the other is five.

227
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,870
They need their mom.

228
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,790
What's so hard about caring for kids?

229
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,790
Don't you see?

230
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,310
Child.

231
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,310
Do you like Grandpa?

232
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,470
Yes.

233
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,110
Good girl.

234
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,910
It's like this.

235
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,230
After the summer vacation,

236
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,350
the kids will go back to school.

237
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,230
Can you teach Yerdana what he doesn't know?

238
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,440
Go ahead.

239
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,920
If you're here to talk about this,

240
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,470
you can leave.

241
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,940
All right.

242
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,310
I'll stop.

243
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,870
I heard

244
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,190
you killed a few wolves.

245
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,510
Yes.

246
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,510
Can't I kill them?

247
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,230
I saved those two people from the south.

248
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,430
Yes.

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,630
I can call you a hero

250
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,230
for saving them.

251
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,630
But what did you use to kill the wolves?

252
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,780
A bow and arrow.

253
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,060
Not a hunting gun?

254
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,110
I don't have one!

255
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,110
You took them all.

256
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,830
Give me your hand.

257
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,750
Swear you don't have a hunting gun.

258
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,710
How the hell would I get one?

259
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,030
Give me the gun.

260
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,330
You can't have it without a license.

261
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,280
I don't have it.

262
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,310
Leave me alone.

263
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,230
Sulitan!

264
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,790
Auntie.

265
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:26,830
Wenxiu.

266
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,150
What is this?

267
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,150
The tent is leaking.

268
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,470
We don't have enough bowls and basins.

269
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,640
Got a raincloth?

270
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,080
I'll put it on for you.

271
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,140
No.

272
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,790
Where's your mom?

273
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,590
She went out.

274
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,070
There's much rain here in the summer.

275
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,870
This won't do.

276
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,550
It's okay. We can make do with it.

277
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,710
Look.

278
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,510
The rain leaks in from above

279
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,030
into the plastic bags,

280
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,120
dripping down each level

281
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,250
before flowing down the waterway

282
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,340
when it's full.

283
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,590
Amazing.

284
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,790
What?

285
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,710
Amazing.

286
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,550
The rain seems to be stopping.

287
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,540
This will do for today.

288
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,830
It's nice.

289
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,750
Yeah.

290
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,590
I...

291
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,130
Wanna buy something?

292
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,070
No.

293
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,510
I'm here to tell you something.

294
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,830
Well, I...

295
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,160
What are you two doing?

296
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,870
It's nothing.

297
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,230
Here's the thing.

298
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,190
Don't tell the chief about the gun.

299
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,310
I'll persuade my dad.

300
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,400
Okay?

301
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,790
It's about this?

302
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,630
Yes, it's very important.

303
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,570
Why are you blushing?

304
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,830
I-I'm not good at lying.

305
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,070
I'm nervous.

306
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,380
You don't wanna lie.

307
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,910
I get it.

308
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,020
It's okay.

309
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,870
No, no, no.

310
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:43,990
Well...

311
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,670
Sulitan saved me and my mom with the gun.

312
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,590
I'll keep it from the chief.

313
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,430
Yes.

314
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,910
When your mom returns,

315
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,030
inform her too.

316
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,750
Thank you.

317
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,980
I didn't come to see you.

318
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,150
I took the wrong path.

319
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,310
See?

320
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,950
I seem quite sentimental.

321
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,310
I...

322
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,790
have been doing well lately.

323
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,270
I don't drink anymore.

324
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,560
I don't miss you anymore.

325
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,340
It's good.

326
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,750
Really? I'll give it to you again.

327
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,190
Okay.

328
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,790
Okay.

329
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,970
Then 8 kg?

330
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,590
Okay.

331
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,110
Miss.

332
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,110
What is this?

333
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,800
Welcome to Wenxiu's Water Station.

334
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,090
Yes, we were talking about this tent.

335
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,450
I didn't know

336
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,370
you're really so smart.

337
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,400
It's hidden deep in me.

338
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,110
Well, my mom said

339
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,870
it's 10 yuan per kg.

340
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,240
Okay, thanks.

341
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,990
We don't earn your money.

342
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,070
Then why is it

343
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,640
8 yuan per kg for me?

344
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,050
Because I wanna earn your money.

345
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,290
Where's your mom?

346
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,260
She went to the back mountain to buy sheep.

347
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,150
Buy sheep?

348
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,130
Why doesn't she buy our sheep?

349
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,270
It's close to you.

350
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,430
I don't want you to earn our money yet.

351
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,350
Is money

352
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,240
that important?

353
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,830
I'm your friend.

354
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,190
But you abandoned us when moving ranch!

355
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,710
We were helpless.

356
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,990
We only made it here

357
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,640
thanks to Batay's family.

358
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,410
Nonsense.

359
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,230
I am a rare admirable leader

360
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,350
in a hundred miles.

361
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,440
You're the only leader in a hundred miles.

362
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,990
Here.

363
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,110
Uncle, I'm leaving.

364
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,070
Grandma.

365
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,350
Grandma!

366
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,790
I'm leaving!

367
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,310
I love you!

368
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,990
I couldn't tell.

369
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,230
Goodbye, Wenxiu.

370
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,680
-A pack of tobacco...
-No!

371
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,550
Oh yeah, tobacco.

372
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,550
We have it.

373
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,030
1.2 yuan.

374
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,830
Just date

375
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,470
openly.

376
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,610
We aren't.

377
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,030
Don't lie.

378
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,630
You'll be punished.

379
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,070
Nonsense.

380
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,790
Gosh, this rain...

381
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,070
Where's my washboard?

382
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,270
You forgot?

383
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,350
No...

384
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,350
It's out of stock.

385
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,510
Didn't I tell you to buy a washboard?

386
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,030
It's out of stock.

387
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,440
Just wash it with your hands.

388
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,270
Bye.

389
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,870
It's been a year!

390
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,670
No one cares!

391
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,430
What is this!

392
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,880
Let's see who'll do your laundry when I'm gone!

393
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,740
No one cares.

394
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,150
It's been a year.

395
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,270
Stop barking!

396
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,350
What is this for?

397
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,950
Just in case.

398
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,630
Sleep, Grandma.

399
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,350
See? I told you.

400
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,750
You saved me.

401
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,490
I was just passing by and helped out.

402
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,670
Thank you.

403
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,330
You're a mainlander?

404
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,830
What?

405
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,540
I don't look like one?

406
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,670
Do you live here?

407
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,270
I run a small business in the ranch.

408
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,910
From Guangdong?

409
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,010
Is the motorcycle outside yours?

410
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,830
Yes.

411
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,210
Don't abandon it.

412
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,390
When a car passes by, buy some gas and it'll work.

413
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,100
I've been waiting the whole day.

414
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,030
Wait a bit more.

415
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,850
Don't go out at night. There are wolves.

416
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,470
Don't leave the fire even if you need to pee.

417
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,400
What are you looking at?

418
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,510
I just think

419
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,270
you resemble someone I knew.

420
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,510
Cut it out.

421
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,390
Thank you.

422
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,230
You saved my life.

423
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,150
I don't have money now

424
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,430
to repay you.

425
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,790
No need.

426
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,400
Just help someone in need

427
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,550
in the future.

428
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,090
Sir, where are you going?

429
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,620
To the substation to deliver supplies.

430
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,670
Don't you have to

431
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,550
climb several mountains?

432
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,180
It's a few hours away from here,

433
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,310
on the mountain.

434
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,400
It'll take hours by car to and fro.

435
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,150
Yeah?

436
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,920
I also do business in the ranch.

437
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,510
Traveling's tiring.

438
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,030
Where are you two going?

439
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,100
It's hard for everyone.

440
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,590
When you've refueled,

441
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,250
I'll take you out of Gobi.

442
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,980
This place is in the opposite direction.

443
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,510
I don't plan to go back.

444
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,480
Where will you go?

445
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,030
The summer ranch.

446
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,130
Which summer ranch?

447
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,750
The one you mentioned.

448
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,470
No.

449
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,640
I made some money working

450
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,590
in Ürümqi.

451
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,350
I risked it to find gemstones here.

452
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,380
I was cheated of all my money.

453
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,390
I'm going there to earn a living.

454
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,110
There are no jobs for you there.

455
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,430
Let's make money together.

456
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,910
Or I can work for you.

457
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,910
Do I look rich to you?

458
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,090
Batay.

459
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,770
Girl from the store?

460
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,170
Wanna do laundry together?

461
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,550
Okay.

462
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,200
Let's go.

463
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,160
Tokan!

464
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,830
Kulan! Wenxiu!

465
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,030
Wenxiu, my buddy!

466
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,430
Hello!

467
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,350
Hello.

468
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,550
I love you.

469
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,190
I love you too.

470
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,870
Grandma, don't go.

471
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,030
Okay? Grandma?

472
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,510
Okay.

473
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,550
Hello.

474
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,390
Hello.

475
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,750
I just...

476
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,270
Can I borrow this washboard?

477
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,220
Sure, have mine.

478
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,200
Great.

479
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,590
I always wanted one,

480
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,490
but they wouldn't buy it for me.

481
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,630
This is great.

482
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,690
I'll give you something good.

483
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,390
What is it?

484
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,910
Take this sheep tallow soap.

485
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,550
It's great.

486
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,790
My mom made it.

487
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,270
It'll make your skin so smooth.

488
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,780
You can use it.

489
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,960
Gemstone! Emerald!

490
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,150
What?

491
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,910
Emerald's very precious.

492
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,150
Jangber found one in the river

493
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,570
and made it into a ring.

494
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,520
It's very precious?

495
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,120
Yes.

496
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,400
It's very valuable?

497
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,830
Yes.

498
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,070
I'll return it.

499
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,500
Okay.

500
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,070
After I wash my bedsheets.

501
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,870
No hurry.

502
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,990
This is tiring.

503
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,830
I always told them to buy me a washboard.

504
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,770
No one in my family listens to me.

505
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,630
So annoying.

506
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,670
It's been a year!

507
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,310
It's great.

508
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,830
Such a useful thing.

509
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,150
Is this meat?

510
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,350
Yes. Mutton.

511
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,030
The soap's made of sheep tallow,

512
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,310
which is from mutton.

513
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,470
My mom is old and blind.

514
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,230
She didn't remove all the meat

515
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,280
from the tallow.

516
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,430
Throw it away.

517
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,190
Yes, throw it away.

518
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,910
Use it. It's okay.

519
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,640
My mom's brother's daughter.

520
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,230
Get it?

521
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,470
I know, she's your uncle's daughter,

522
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,350
your cousin.

523
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,790
Kulan's...

524
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,270
husband-to-be is Kulan's dad's brother's son.

525
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,060
So he is Kulan's cousin.

526
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,510
Yes, that's right.

527
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,830
So you are

528
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,270
attending the wedding of your cousin

529
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,610
marrying her cousin.

530
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,480
Yes, are you coming?

531
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,670
Tuoyis are great.

532
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,160
We dance all day.

533
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,070
It's a ball?

534
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,030
Yes, a ball.

535
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,310
After dancing,

536
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,540
we'll have a buzkashi game.

537
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,090
Batay's suffering at home.

538
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,450
All the boys are going.

539
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,380
Batay's going?

540
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,310
Yes, all the boys will go.

541
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,910
They meet girls

542
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,840
during Tuoyi.

543
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,830
Their feelings grow as they dance

544
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,750
and they will

545
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,310
get married in the autumn.

546
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,630
There's another ball for the wedding.

547
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,740
People will fall in love again

548
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,230
while dancing

549
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,510
and get married.

550
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,970
And there will be another ball.

551
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,030
Wanna come

552
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,750
with us?

553
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,510
Okay. Once my mom returns,

554
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,670
I'll go with you.

555
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,989
Comrade.

556
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,310
Are you from the south?

557
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,030
What’s wrong, comrade?

558
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,790
Are you a Xinjiang local?

559
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:56,520
[Provision Store]

560
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,790
Let me show you something good.

561
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,190
What is it?

562
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,320
Nephrite jade.

563
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,470
It's not in the mainland.

564
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,590
I picked it up.

565
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,230
Since you're beautiful and kind,

566
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,470
I'll sell it to you for 10,000 yuan.

567
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,900
[Provision Store]

568
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,070
You can sell it

569
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,910
for 50,000 in the south.

570
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,150
Gosh, did something good

571
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,350
land in my lap?

572
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,070
You're lucky.

573
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,150
Let me see.

574
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,790
Great, right?

575
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,270
Gemstone.

576
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,300
By its transparency, it's at least a glass type.

577
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,310
But the color...

578
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,670
looks like

579
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,270
a Wusu beer bottle.

580
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,630
No wonder it looks so familiar.

581
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,910
I always drink it.

582
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,710
Buy it.

583
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,240
No thanks. Keep it as a family heirloom.

584
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,030
You're good at driving.

585
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,470
Not bad, right?

586
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,630
How do I call you?

587
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,950
Yao?

588
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,470
Yao.

589
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,210
I'm Gao Xiaoliang.

590
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,880
Let me ask you about someone.

591
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,870
Is there a woman in your ranch

592
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,110
who rides a camel?

593
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,470
She's shorter than you

594
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,910
and does business here.

595
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,420
A woman

596
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,870
riding a camel.

597
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,670
A bit shorter than you.

598
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,310
She does business in the ranch.

599
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,030
A store.

600
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,710
Exchange things. A woman...

601
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,350
Zhang Fengxia?

602
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,070
Zhang Fengxia.

603
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,310
Mom.

604
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,110
Is my mom back?

605
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,630
Yes.

606
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,190
Kulan is here!

607
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,310
How are your parents?

608
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,590
They're fine.

609
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,510
Auntie, it's great

610
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,280
you're back.

611
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,180
We have a Tuoyi tomorrow.

612
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,620
Me too.

613
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,590
Tuoyi?

614
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,190
A ball!

615
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,910
You two need to dress up

616
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,310
and get to know more young men.

617
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,990
Introduce a boy

618
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,910
who speaks Mandarin to Wenxiu.

619
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,070
You can get a boyfriend too.

620
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,100
I can't.

621
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,400
I have someone I like.

622
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,190
You like someone?

623
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,270
Who?

624
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,270
Auntie.

625
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,590
Look. Is it pretty?

626
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,910
Yes.

627
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,590
Kulan lent me this dress.

628
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,430
Really?

629
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,830
So pretty.

630
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,790
But it's a bit torn here.

631
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,630
Can you sew it for her?

632
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,710
Let me see.

633
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,230
It's a huge tear.

634
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,370
I can't find the sewing kit.

635
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,270
No need for that.

636
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,540
Hold it for me.

637
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,830
Straighten this part.

638
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,310
Look, it's perfect.

639
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,760
At most, they'll say it's like grass.

640
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,570
The grassland's full of grass.

641
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,750
It doesn't matter.

642
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,550
Right?

643
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,790
Sure.

644
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,390
Let's go.

645
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,390
Put it on you.

646
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,350
What should I wear it with?

647
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,950
Let's see.

648
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,110
Okay?

649
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,390
Show me.

650
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,950
Pretty?

651
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,670
Yes.

652
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,630
Comrade.

653
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,230
No!

654
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,430
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

655
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,110
After dinner...

656
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,790
Go to bed.

657
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,670
Lay out the quilt yourself. Head to toe.

658
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,590
Don't flip it.

659
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,390
That's great.

660
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,270
Dad, can you take care of the kids?

661
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,500
Why not?

662
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,710
If you can't take care of them,

663
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,110
I can skip the wedding.

664
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,280
What's so hard about taking care of kids?

665
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,390
Didn't I raise Batay?

666
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,270
Great.

667
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,350
Here.

668
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,480
Here.

669
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,470
Kiss me goodbye.

670
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,250
I'll listen to Grandpa.

671
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,590
I'll be back early.

672
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,350
You look gorgeous in this dress.

673
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,400
Thank you, Kulan.

674
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,670
The bride looks better in her wedding outfit.

675
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,370
Really?

676
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,390
Is Batay there?

677
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,020
Batay?

678
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,190
Batay and the men went there long ago.

679
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,920
For the buzkashi game.

680
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,990
They just play it

681
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,990
all day.

682
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,960
That's right.

683
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,510
How can they play all day fighting over

684
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,830
a piece of sheep skin?

685
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,910
The wedding

686
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,950
is for the old in the day.

687
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,990
At night, it's for us young folk.

688
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,870
We'll keep dancing all night

689
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,880
and have fun.

690
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,870
I haven't been to a ball in so long.

691
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,550
Let's go.

692
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,870
Wenxiu.

693
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,390
Look what I've got.

694
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,510
Look.

695
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:28,950
Look.

696
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,070
What is this?

697
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,130
It's like gum. Good for your teeth.

698
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,750
Pine resin gum. Eat it.

699
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,990
Use your back teeth.

700
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,020
Eat it. Bite it.

701
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,070
Like this.

702
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,310
There's also one there.

703
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:49,950
This one?

704
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,530
It's the same.

705
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,790
It makes your teeth white.

706
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,630
Give it to me. I'll help you.

707
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,590
Put it behind your glasses.

708
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,450
I'll help you.

709
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,350
Is this it?

710
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,030
Yes, wild strawberries. Take it.

711
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,040
It's delicious.

712
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:16,830
Come here.

713
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,280
Wood ear?

714
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,510
Come here!

715
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,510
Look! So many plump ones.

716
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,290
Let's get some to gift it at the wedding.

717
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,870
Wedding?

718
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,630
No thanks.

719
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,750
We don't eat that.

720
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,110
You don't?

721
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:51,870
No.

722
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,000
What about oyster mushrooms?

723
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,610
We don't eat any mushrooms.

724
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,670
Beef and mutton are delicious.

725
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,670
Who'd eat this?

726
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,110
I've seen foreigners

727
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,550
eat it in the county seat.

728
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,350
Yes, it's delicious.

729
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,310
Right, I have a knife. Here.

730
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,710
Help yourself.

731
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,830
Don't give us any.

732
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,710
It's so fresh.

733
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,070
Slow down.

734
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,230
Let's take a rest.

735
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,910
Gosh, yes, I'm exhausted.

736
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,030
Let's take a break. Sit.

737
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,390
What are they doing?

738
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,390
Playing the buzkashi game I mentioned!

739
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,830
They are still at it?

740
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,740
That's Batay!

741
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,590
Where?

742
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,110
There.

743
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,110
Over there.

744
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,470
He's next to my uncle.

745
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,720
Where's your dad?

746
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,810
He's not here yet.

747
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,720
He has a motorcycle, not a horse.

748
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,350
Where's Batay?

749
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,630
The one in front.

750
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,680
Dressed in white?

751
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,410
Yes, the most handsome one.

752
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,410
Get him, Batay!

753
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,070
See Batay? Over there.

754
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,590
Dressed in white.

755
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,030
Give it to me!

756
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,190
Come on!

757
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,050
Give it to me!

758
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,030
Charge, Batay!

759
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:43,290
