Batay!

352
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,130
Your dad is here!

353
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,010
Okay.

354
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,810
I spent a lot of money training him.

355
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:56,120
[Office]

356
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,820
He's just back from his studies in Qingdao.

357
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,890
How could you just take him away?

358
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,450
What studies?

359
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,850
We Kazakh

360
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,210
are naturally friends with horses.

361
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:05,730
[Office]

362
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,990
I've never heard of needing to study

363
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,530
horse psychology.

364
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,770
Nonsense!

365
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,420
Batay can raise horses well without that!

366
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,650
You're being unreasonable.

367
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,500
We signed a contract.

368
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,270
He gets free training here

369
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,250
if he works for five years.

370
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,370
Five years!

371
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,850
How much do you want? I'll compensate you!

372
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,570
It's not about money.

373
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,380
This spot is very precious.

374
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,450
Batay passed the exam himself.

375
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,780
It has nothing to do with your money!

376
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,210
Be reasonable, Sulitan.

377
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm the most reasonable.

378
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,210
Dad.

379
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,380
You decide.

380
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,380
Does your brother's death

381
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,730
mean nothing to you?

382
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,430
Let me see.

383
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,180
It's even swollen.

384
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,450
That old lady sure was ruthless.

385
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,330
Is your brain okay?

386
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,800
You've never been clever.

387
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,120
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

388
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,000
I could've picked you up

389
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,520
at the village entrance.

390
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,300
Are you doing well

391
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,290
as a writer

392
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,290
in Ürümqi?

393
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,730
Yes.

394
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,700
Can you support yourself?

395
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,260
Yes.

396
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,810
That's good.

397
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,330
Stop eating.

398
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,540
Or you'll choke.

399
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,200
It makes you fart all day.

400
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,620
The house will stink.

401
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,780
Stop eating. Go wash your face.

402
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,790
Your granddaughter Wenxiu's back.

403
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,170
You remember Wenxiu?

404
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:15,760
Grandma.

405
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,000
Xiu, wash her face.

406
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,650
No more

407
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,880
potatoes for her.

408
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,330
Here.

409
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,500
Why did you take my potato?

410
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,560
Tell me, who are you?

411
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,140
Are you Zhang Fengxia?

412
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,520
I'm not Zhang Fengxia.

413
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,880
I'm a pushover.

414
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,680
Grandma, let's wash up.

415
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,820
I'm not full yet.

416
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,660
Eat later.

417
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,010
At home, we have nearly 300 sheep,

418
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,590
7 camels, and 20 horses.

419
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,710
My dad can't take care of them alone.

420
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,170
Don't go head-to-head with him.

421
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,130
I'll go back and help him for a while first.

422
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,050
It's right to be filial,

423
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,770
but you have to keep your word.

424
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,180
You're the best groom I've trained.

425
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,690
You promised me

426
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,580
to train the Yili horse

427
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,570
into the best horse in the world.

428
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,210
If you leave,

429
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,150
what'd become of it?

430
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,880
Who else can take care

431
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,050
of Snowshoe?

432
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,250
How about I take it back to the ranch?

433
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,940
My family's summer ranch in Naren

434
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,810
has lusher grass and beautiful scenery.

435
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,370
It'll even have companions.

436
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,720
It might be better for its recovery.

437
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,250
I learnt that in horse psychology.

438
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,510
Bro, I didn't forget.

439
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,460
Snowshoe's our best horse.

440
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,980
My gut tells me

441
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,080
it'll recover fully once it gets to the ranch.

442
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,970
I'll bring it back to you after summer.

443
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,290
By then, maybe

444
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,290
my dad would allow me to come back to the stable.

445
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,290
I'll fall for your trick just this once.

446
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,570
Thank you, bro.

447
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,170
Count it.

448
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,130
Are you really quitting?

449
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,940
Yeah.

450
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,500
What are your plans for the future?

451
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,290
Plans?

452
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,530
I'll rely on women.

453
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,330
You?

454
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,090
Find jade in the northwest.

455
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,050
Take care!

456
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,380
Mom, this bed isn't sturdy.

457
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,930
Mom?

458
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,730
Mom!

459
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,370
Mom.

460
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,890
Thinking about my dad?

461
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,280
About your mom.

462
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,210
How narcissistic.

463
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,690
Aren't you my mom?

464
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,180
Mom, don't drink so much.

465
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,460
It helps me fall asleep.

466
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,370
Why did you move here?

467
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,490
You were in the county seat of Fuyun.

468
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,130
You're moving to more remote places.

469
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,220
Look around. Nothing.

470
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,700
In the middle of nowhere.

471
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,690
That is what's good about it.

472
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,340
We're the only store in 50 km.

473
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,700
Everyone comes here to shop.

474
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,810
There's nothing I can't sell.

475
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,210
It's still too remote.

476
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,850
It's a hassle to restock goods.

477
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,270
I like remote places.

478
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,290
I sell everything

479
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,340
and have nowhere to use my money.

480
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,090
Recently, I've been considering...

481
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,450
moving my store to the summer ranch in a few days.

482
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,490
Why the summer ranch?

483
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,860
It's even more remote.

484
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,380
Where'd you live

485
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,350
when there are no houses there?

486
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,170
In tents.

487
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,500
What about this place

488
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,510
and its rent?

489
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,950
How long's your lease?

490
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,540
Who said I'm paying rent?

491
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,090
This is Semahul's old house.

492
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,730
Their family went to live in the city.

493
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,409
No one lives here.

494
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,679
I'm watching their house for free.

495
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,989
Why'd he charge me?

496
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,610
What about Grandma?

497
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,330
She can't live in a tent.

498
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,440
Don't underestimate this old lady.

499
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,330
She can't see, hear,

500
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,600
remember, or forget,

501
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,159
but she's always active.

502
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,330
She's healthier than you and me.

503
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,449
Mom, let's not go to the summer ranch, okay?

504
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,860
I think this place is decent.

505
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,710
At least it won't take me days to get to the city.

506
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,810
I've decided.

507
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,060
Zhang Fengxia.

508
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,190
Are you going so far away to escape?

509
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,210
Escape what?

510
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,800
You've been odd since Dad passed away.

511
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,850
You keep moving.

512
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,040
I feel so insecure.

513
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,290
We're practically

514
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,690
living like vagrants!

515
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,450
If you don't wanna live with me,

516
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,730
go back to your city.

517
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,500
I won't keep you.

518
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,240
Your insecurity is your business.

519
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,470
Don't make it hard for me.

520
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,900
I know you.

521
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,220
You're a weakling outside.

522
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,090
You're only aggressive to me.

523
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,820
Mom.

524
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,910
Mom, the bed collapsed.

525
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:04,970
Mom?

526
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,150
The sky didn't collapse. Don't disturb my sleep.

527
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,690
Mom.

528
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,370
The bed...

529
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,740
Good buddy.

530
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,770
I'll take you home.
