2
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,480
Lonely.

3
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,390
Why did you sigh?

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,820
I feel a bit lonely too.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,740
You have a boyfriend.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,270
You shouldn't feel lonely.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,870
I find it strange as well.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,800
Actually,

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,890
before I knew how he felt about me,

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,660
I felt fulfilled every day.

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,600
I was always guessing

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,340
what his movements and expressions meant.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,780
My mood swung up and down

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,150
like a roller coaster.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,220
He's my boyfriend now,

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,060
but I feel

17
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,230
he's not that good,

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,140
even a bit childish.

19
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,550
Anyway, I feel

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,420
he's not as good as I thought.

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,140
I don't know.

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,670
What do you think, Grandma?

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,500
What is a roller coaster?

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,150
Forget it.

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,080
Are you done washing dishes?

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,010
Go back and roast some potatoes for me if you're done.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
But we've just finished dinner.

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,090
A well-fed person can't understand hunger.

31
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,040
Who did it?

32
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,350
Who did it?

33
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,060
Batay.

34
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,690
Batay!

35
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,370
Bakhetbek!

36
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,060
You stepped on sheep dung again?

37
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,070
Did you do this?

38
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,260
You tied my shoelaces together

39
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,500
and made me fall.

40
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,720
What makes you think I did it?

41
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,640
How do you know?

42
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,510
This is a shepherd's knot, a shepherd's knot!

43
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,370
Who else could be so obnoxious?

44
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,040
People riding horses all know this kind of knot.

45
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,440
I didn't tie this knot,

46
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,630
but I can untie it for you.

47
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,520
Watch and learn.

48
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,430
What happened to your face?

49
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,050
Mohebit beat me yesterday.

50
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,060
Later,

51
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,600
let me take you somewhere.

52
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,380
I have things to do.

53
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm going back to the pine forest.

54
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,850
Come on.

55
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,460
I'll show you something great.

56
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,570
What's it?

57
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,590
Something great.

58
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,250
Lift your leg.

59
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,490
One, two, here you go.

60
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,060
Why are we here?

61
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,350
Come.

62
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,230
Let me show you something.

63
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,550
I have things to do.

64
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,840
You've run out of paper, right?

65
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,290
Birch bark contains a lot of oil.

66
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,590
You can fold it as you please

67
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
without breaking it.

68
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,800
Many people write on it.

69
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,530
You don't have to fight with Yerdana for exercise books.

70
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,620
You heard it?

71
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,140
Yeah.

72
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,540
I saw it too.

73
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,100
You're very popular.

74
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,920
What do you mean?

75
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,460
The Daur guy from Tacheng,

76
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
he likes you too, doesn't he?

77
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,580
We just exchanged a few words.

78
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,340
It's not surprising that he likes you.

79
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,970
I like you too.

80
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,060
I know how good you are.

81
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,010
Do you like me?

82
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,070
But

83
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,380
if I can't live the life you want with you,

84
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,410
will you still like me?

85
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,790
The life I want?

86
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,380
You want to be a writer

87
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,520
and go to Beijing.

88
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,540
You want a life like that.

89
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,419
I don't think I can go to Beijing.

90
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,140
If we…

91
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,190
If I can't go with you,

92
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,590
can we still be together?

93
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,140
If

94
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,030
I don't go, will you still like me?

95
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,350
Your dad is against it, isn't he?

96
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,660
Yes.

97
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,500
He doesn't approve of us being together.

98
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,260
He doesn't approve of me working in the stable.

99
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,360
Do you have to go back to the stable?

100
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,880
I want to go back.

101
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,860
That's the life I want.

102
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,260
I thought

103
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,330
after Yerdana grew up,

104
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,200
he could graze the herds with Dad.

105
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,440
But Tokan has gotten remarried.

106
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,510
If she takes her children with her,

107
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,460
no one will be left to graze the herds.

108
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,240
So I have to

109
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,010
stay.

110
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,780
Wenxiu.

111
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,120
I don't know what to do.

112
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,430
I can stay on the ranch.

113
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,500
You're not going to Beijing?

114
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,910
I've got over that idea.

115
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,920
I thought

116
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,190
I must go to Beijing to be a good writer.

117
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,710
But now I feel

118
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,340
there are many things I want to write about,

119
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,470
and I'm better at writing than before.

120
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,730
Yesterday, I thought

121
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,670
I couldn't write without paper.

122
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,710
But I have birch bark now.

123
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,570
We're only 20 years old.

124
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,020
I don't even know

125
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,340
what kind of life I really like.

126
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,640
Batay.

127
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,420
I like this place,

128
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,270
not just because of you

129
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,710
but also for myself.

130
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,330
So why don't I stay and give it a try?

131
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you really going to stay on the ranch?

132
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,270
Let's be together.

133
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,820
Okay.

134
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
Sorry.

135
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,560
You look very happy.

136
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,470
Are you dating someone?

137
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,130
Are you in a relationship?

138
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,980
Are you done?

139
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,960
Let's go.

140
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,650
I need to talk to you about something.

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
Can you not get in the way

142
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,120
of me dating your mom?

143
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,500
You can date someone.

144
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,740
Why can't I date your mom?

145
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,990
I really like her.

146
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,710
We want to start a family.

147
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,770
What's wrong with me living with her?

148
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,010
That's different.

149
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,800
How is it different?

150
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,990
You're in love.

151
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,160
We're in love too.

152
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,870
How is that different?

153
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,690
We're all just in love.

154
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,910
If you're worried that I won't treat your mom well,

155
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,850
you can tell me. I'll…

156
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,310
Hurry up.

157
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,970
I can prove…

158
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,230
I can prove to you that I really care for her.

159
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,020
You're done?

160
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,940
I didn't know collecting wood ears was so tiring.

161
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,500
It's just a small business.

162
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,430
Don't expect to make a fortune from it.

163
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,220
I wasn't expecting a fortune.

164
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,770
I was expecting you.

165
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,660
I suddenly can't understand Kazakh.

166
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,120
You used to understand it?

167
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,050
Yes.

168
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,440
You don't believe me?

169
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,630
I do.

170
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,680
As long as you stay at a place for long enough

171
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,670
and know the environment and people's relationships,

172
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,140
you can guess what's going on

173
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,000
by looking at their expressions.

174
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,750
But this afternoon,

175
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,680
when I was making soaps at the village chief's house,

176
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,330
I suddenly couldn't understand anything.

177
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,470
I didn't know what they were talking about in Kazakh.

178
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,780
Sulitan was angry with me,

179
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,240
but I didn't even know why.

180
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,330
I'm thinking

181
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,990
maybe I'm really different from them.

182
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,330
You're indeed different from them.

183
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,290
Why don't you leave with me in a while?

184
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,530
Where should we go?

185
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,670
Think about it.

186
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,850
We're not locals.

187
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,750
Neither are we herders.

188
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,720
How long do you think

189
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,020
we can live like this?

190
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,800
Am I right?

191
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,070
Either you'll go to Guangdong with me,

192
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,740
or we'll go back to your hometown.

193
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,540
We can collect some money and start a business.

194
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Isn't that great?

195
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,230
Besides,

196
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,500
Grandma is old,

197
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,000
isn't she?

198
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,520
To be frank,

199
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,340
if she falls ill one day,

200
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,850
it'll be easier to find a doctor for her

201
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,060
in a big city, right?

202
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,460
What about Wenxiu?

203
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,370
Wenxiu?

204
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,860
Every bird has to leave the nest.

205
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,120
Right?

206
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,580
That's a Cantonese saying.

207
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,710
She's grown up. Don't worry about her.

208
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,000
Go to sleep.

209
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,100
I've never thought about what you said before.

210
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,130
Take your time to think about it.

211
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,300
What's wrong?

212
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,340
I want to show you something.

213
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,180
What's it?

214
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,060
That day, I somehow went the wrong way

215
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,340
and got to the lane leading to Fairy Cove.

216
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,060
Fairy Cove is a very important place to me.

217
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,720
I thought since I was already there,

218
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,850
I should take something as a souvenir.

219
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,240
So I pried out the bullets Sulitan used to kill wolves

220
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,440
with a knife.

221
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,490
On my way back, I met you.

222
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,000
That night,

223
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,640
you saved my life.

224
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,790
I was so scared.

225
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,069
Later, I'll drill two holes

226
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,400
in them

227
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,339
so that we can hang them

228
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,579
around our necks with strings.

229
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,760
One for each of us

230
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,680
as love tokens, okay?

231
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,359
Sure.

232
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,970
They're just makeshift love tokens.

233
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,200
After I earn money, I'll replace them with jade stones.

234
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,560
Trust me.

235
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm a man who can earn a lot of money.

236
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,390
After I earn a lot of money,

237
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,720
I'll put it in a separate bank card for you.

238
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,470
Then you'll sew a pocket

239
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,470
into your pants,

240
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,070
and I'll stitch it up for you.

241
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,100
Do you want black wood ears?

242
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,020
So many of them.

243
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,120
Okay. I'll give you one yuan.

244
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,520
Plus two pieces of candy.

245
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,570
I'll give you one more.

246
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,560
Thank you.

247
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,850
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

248
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,230
Sir, have you seen this before?

249
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,770
Black wood ears.

250
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,710
Kara.

251
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,540
Kara.

252
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,130
Kara.

253
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,540
Kara, black.

254
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,530
Kara. Kara mushrooms.

255
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,690
What is a mushroom?

256
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,040
What is a mushroom?

257
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,930
Sir, do you want to buy something?

258
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,890
I need that.

259
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,490
Kara mushrooms.

260
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,290
Wait a moment.

261
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,150
Thank you.

262
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,470
Take it.

263
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,020
No.

264
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,640
No.

265
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,340
Where did you find those kara mushrooms?

266
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,530
Over there. There are a lot of them.

267
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,230
Where?

268
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:10,920
Over there.

269
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,070
Where?

270
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,500
8 kg of wood ears

271
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,880
become only 1 kg after being dried.

272
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
What are you looking for?

273
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,650
Grandma's green pendant is missing.

274
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,050
It's just glass. She'll forget it in a few days.

275
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,760
Have you really sent Gao Xiaoliang to do deliveries for you?

276
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,990
Can you do it instead?

277
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,460
Sure. I'm good at riding horses now.

278
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,530
The whole journey takes days,

279
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,730
and you have to eat and sleep in the open.

280
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,010
Mom, I need to tell you something.

281
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,650
When I worked in Ürümqi,

282
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,690
I got fired.

283
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,820
The severance pay was 300 yuan.

284
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,290
Gao Xiaoliang only gave me 100 yuan.

285
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,730
What are you trying to say?

286
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,060
He kept 200 yuan to himself.

287
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,530
He asked the manager for 300 yuan.

288
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,320
I heard it outside the door.

289
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,390
If he hadn't asked the manager for the money,

290
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,590
you wouldn't have gotten that 100 yuan.

291
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,410
Anyway, he's not a good guy.

292
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,580
Maybe he's not a bag guy either,

293
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,610
but he's definitely not a good guy.

294
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,190
Listen, Wenxiu.

295
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,740
You were too thin-skinned to ask for the money.

296
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,940
Gao Xiaoliang did it for you.

297
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,800
So he deserved a cut.

298
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,700
If you're right,

299
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,420
agencies should all close down.

300
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,100
They take a cut of every deal.

301
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,320
It's the same for my store.

302
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,040
I buy low and sell high.

303
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,820
In your opinion,

304
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,420
am I not a good person either?

305
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,680
It's just business.

306
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,710
We all need to make a living.

307
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,920
Don't be so serious.

308
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,160
Just keep letting him do deliveries for you.

309
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,620
Maybe he'll run away with your goods one day.

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,230
The black soap is five yuan each.

311
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,220
The wood ears are 80 yuan per kilo.

312
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,280
What's so valuable he can cheat me out of

313
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,260
that it's worth him staying undercover here for a month,

314
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,920
sleeping in that shabby tent?

315
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,540
Mom.

316
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,380
You've changed.

317
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,080
You're different now.

318
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,660
I'm already in my forties.

319
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,000
There's not much room for me to grow.

320
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,270
My green gem is gone.

321
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,990
I need to find another green gem.

322
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,810
Wenxiu.

323
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,720
My green gem is gone.

324
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,400
Go and find a green gem with her.

325
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,790
And wash those clothes.

326
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,940
They're at the door.

327
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,320
Wenxiu.

328
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,810
Let's go find another one.

329
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,020
Let's go looking for a green gem.

330
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,380
Wenxiu.

331
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,630
Chaoge.

332
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,030
Chaoge.

333
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,060
Wenxiu.

334
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,350
Where is the man your mother brought back?

335
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,010
He's out gathering wood ears.

336
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Where's your mom?

337
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Over there, behind the tent.

338
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,100
Zhang Fengxia.

339
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,390
Hello.

340
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,550
Hello.

341
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,700
I need to tell you something.

342
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,310
Look.

343
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,300
I saw it when I was patrolling.

344
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,180
Someone dug holes in the grass.

345
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,180
So despicable.

346
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,200
It's horrible.

347
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,980
Look.

348
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,660
Look at this. Look.

349
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,420
Smell it.

350
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,330
It's the caterpillar fungus.

351
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,430
Winter worm, summer grass?

352
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,340
No.

353
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,030
This is Xinjiang's caterpillar fungus.

354
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,710
Look.

355
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,710
It's different from the caterpillar fungus

356
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,900
found in Tibet.

357
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,330
It doesn't have a stroma.

358
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,120
And its medical value

359
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,080
is not that high.

360
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,430
But the rest looks exactly the same.

361
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,610
So some unscrupulous people

362
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,990
pass off this caterpillar fungus

363
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,830
as that found in Tibet.

364
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,640
So these little holes

365
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,410
were left by people who were looking for

366
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,450
the caterpillar fungus?

367
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,300
They made this mess?

368
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,020
Yes.

369
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,440
I saw it while patrolling

370
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,910
and was shocked.

371
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,620
Let me tell you.

372
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,530
At this place,

373
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,750
cattle and sheep mean everything to the herders.

374
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,080
The grass

375
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,990
means everything to cattle and sheep.

376
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,620
Look. We cherish this pasture very much.

377
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,190
The herders will definitely be angry if they find out.

378
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,950
Who did this?

379
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,500
Zhang Fengxia.

380
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,380
You

381
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,300
are an old friend of the village chief.

382
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,770
You're my friend as well.

383
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,530
We trust you without any doubt.

384
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,510
But the man you brought back

385
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,460
has been collecting wood ears around this ranch.

386
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,760
Gao Xiaoliang? It can't be him.

387
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,310
It can't be Gao Xiaoliang.

388
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,980
He's just here collecting wood ears.

389
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,640
You know wood ears. They'll grow back next year.

390
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,550
Right?

391
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,090
Gosh.

392
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,840
Have you seen him?

393
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,580
Have you been with him?

394
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,310
Does he only collect wood ears?

395
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,800
Have you seen him dig for the caterpillar fungus?

396
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,850
It just can't be him.

397
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,150
He's from the city.

398
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,330
He's a city guy.

399
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,340
He doesn't even know how to dig for the caterpillar fungus.

400
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,920
How could it be him?

401
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,980
He's just here collecting wood ears.

402
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,760
You don't understand.

403
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,660
Look at the grass.

404
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,290
There are holes everywhere!

405
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,870
Goodbye, Zhang Fengxia.

406
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,960
See you, Chief.

407
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,850
Did you bring mosquito repellent with you?

408
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,670
No.

409
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,400
I almost got eaten alive by mosquitoes.

410
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,300
Turpan has great grapes. Hami has sweet melons.

411
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,960
The Haba River has a lot of mosquitoes.

412
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,090
A lot of mosquitoes.

413
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,910
It's not funny at all.

414
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,270
Look at your hands.

415
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,840
They're covered with red bumps.

416
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,300
Why did they come to you?

417
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,910
For something in the county.

418
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,320
Listen. The packaging.

419
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,560
Don't do packaging like that.

420
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,730
The roads are bumpy.

421
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,440
They'll break

422
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,900
and become less valuable.

423
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,330
I don't have polystyrene foam.

424
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,300
You don't have polystyrene foam,

425
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,920
but you have dried grass here.

426
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,250
I got dried grass for you

427
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,130
in this box.

428
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,750
Lay it on the bottom.

429
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,230
Okay.

430
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,530
Don't…

431
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,350
Can't you be gentler?

432
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,790
Let's go, Gao Xiaoliang. Leave them here.

433
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,690
Where are we going?

434
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,860
Let's go drink by the river.

435
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,110
I haven't finished this.

436
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,930
I've had beers chilling in the river.

437
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,800
I need to get it done first.

438
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,750
They need to be dried again.

439
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,500
Let's go.

440
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,940
There's a rainbow by the river.

441
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,610
What should I do with you?

442
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,800
We can go after finishing the work.

443
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,360
No.

444
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,580
No.

445
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,390
Is this horse dung?

446
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,880
It's sheep dung.

447
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:59,330
[Provision Store]

448
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,870
She drank again?

449
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,110
They're nice boots.

450
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,220
I waded into the water and completely ruined them.

451
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,110
These are designer shoes.

452
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,410
I'm thinking that

453
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,980
you don't have to go to the county seat.

454
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,910
Eid al-Adha is coming next month.

455
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,050
There will be many horse race meetings

456
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,250
and concerts.

457
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,030
You can bring them there

458
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,750
and sell them then.

459
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,900
You don't have to go to the county seat.

460
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,050
What do you mean?

461
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,510
You don't want me to go now?

462
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,130
I'll stay there for a few days and sell goods,

463
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,850
finding a bed to sleep on

464
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,710
to make my lower back feel better.

465
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,660
I'll be back before the festival.

466
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,040
Okay?

467
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Give me your answer when I come back.

468
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,390
I'm leaving.

469
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,430
Whether you come back or not,

470
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,870
don't hang out with those who sell

471
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,530
the fake caterpillar fungus.

472
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,370
Make money in an honorable way.

473
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,810
What's wrong with you?

474
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,340
You're thinking too much.

475
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,450
Go back. It's cold outside.

476
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,630
Be good. Go back.

477
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,270
Dried wood ears from a summer ranch.

478
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,389
Sir, do you want dried wood ears from a summer ranch?

479
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,120
No, no.

480
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,000
They're delicious and crunchy.

481
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,739
Sir.

482
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,639
Would you like some dried wood ears from a summer ranch?

483
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,580
No, no, no.

484
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,330
Dried wood ears from a summer ranch.

485
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,340
Crunchy dried wood ears.

486
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,340
No, no.

487
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,110
No.

488
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,730
80 is too expensive?

489
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,659
Not interested.

490
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,480
I'll give you a discount. How about 70?

491
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,719
I sell fruits. I don't want that.

492
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,230
You can eat them yourself.

493
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,270
No, no, no.

494
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,330
They're good for your lungs.

495
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,060
You smoke. They're good for your lungs, you know?

496
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,080
They're from a summer ranch.

497
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,650
Who knows if you're lying.

498
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,710
I can soak some in water for you.

499
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,750
-Then you'll know.
-No, no, no.

500
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,880
Go away. I don't have time for that. Go.

501
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You want black herbal soaps, right?

502
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,570
This is an embroidery shop. We don't sell anything else.

503
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,080
5-1, 45.

504
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,520
The shop owner is a woman. It should be here.

505
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,920
Did you ask Zhang Fengxia to buy black herbal soaps for you?

506
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,780
Zhang Fengxia sent you here? You should've said so.

507
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,870
Count them.

508
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,180
100 pieces.

509
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,940
Four, six.

510
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,450
Is there anyone nearby who will buy wood ears?

511
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,710
Go straight. There's another market ahead.

512
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,640
Okay. Thank you.

513
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,070
Hey, bro, what do you need?

514
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,120
I have dried wild wood ears. Are you interested?

515
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,030
How much?

516
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
100 yuan per kilo.

517
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,370
Too expensive. These are only 40 yuan per kilo.

518
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,050
Take a look at mine first.

519
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,870
These are farmed. They don't taste good.

520
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,620
How about 40?

521
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,620
Take a look. Compare them.

522
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,030
No, no, no.

523
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,510
Do you know Zhang Fengxia?

524
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,990
Why?

525
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,260
These are her wood ears.

526
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,530
Does Zhang Fengxia sell wood ears?

527
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,830
We live on a ranch in Naren,

528
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,790
running a store.

529
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,240
I went into the pine forest

530
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,100
and cut these wood ears one by one.

531
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,180
Zhang Fengxia's wood ears?

532
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,090
Let me take a look.

533
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,850
Take a look.

534
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,170
We just dried them.

535
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,560
They're very crunchy.

536
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,530
They'll definitely sell better than yours.

537
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,860
Trust me. I'm sure of it.

538
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,270
Not bad.

539
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,210
How many do you have?

540
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,430
How's the sale of wood ears going?

541
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,830
Not bad.

542
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,360
How much are they?

543
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,910
100 yuan per kilo.

544
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,310
I've been out for many days.

545
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,520
If you're interested, I can give you a discount.

546
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,450
How about 80?

547
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,520
80?

548
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,390
You collected them on a summer ranch?

549
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,830
Which summer ranch?

550
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,870
One in Naren,

551
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,740
near the Altay Mountains.

552
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,960
High altitude.

553
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,610
That's why they're crunchy.

554
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,160
They taste great.

555
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,180
Do you know this?

556
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,620
What's that?

557
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,960
Caterpillar fungus. You can find it in Naren.

558
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,090
I've never seen it before.

559
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,430
If you can get this,

560
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,220
I'll buy as many as you have.

561
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,870
You don't want wood ears? They're really crunchy.

562
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,620
If you buy all of them,

563
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,420
I can give you a bigger discount.

564
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,680
They're worthless.

565
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,850
How much will you pay for caterpillar fungi?

566
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,070
10,000 yuan per kilo.

567
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,780
Let's talk.

568
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,790
Darn it.

569
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,730
[One month later]

570
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,130
Jangber.

571
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,250
Zhang Fengxia.

572
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,010
Happy Eid Day.

573
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,470
Happy Eid Day.

574
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,360
Well, I'm here to settle the bill.

575
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,100
Here's your money. Take it.

576
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,180
For kara soaps.

577
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,330
Black herbal soaps?

578
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,220
Where did you get the money?

579
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,190
Didn't your man run away with your goods?

580
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,640
Yeah. This is your money. Take it.

581
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,980
Take it.

582
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,040
Zhang Fengxia, don't pretend that you can't understand me.

583
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,420
You were cheated by that man. Just keep the money.

584
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,780
I don't want it.

585
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,160
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,000
There's a horse race meeting today.

587
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,160
I'll make a lot of money.

588
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,180
Don't worry about me.

589
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,840
Take your money. Don't worry.

590
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,800
Zhang Fengxia.

591
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,660
Zhang Fengxia.

592
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,500
Zhang Fengxia.

593
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,590
I heard that your man ran away.

594
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,830
Chief, why is there pity in your voice?

595
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,880
That man ran away.

596
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,910
So what?

597
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,890
We outsiders

598
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
are different from you locals.

599
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,550
It's not embarrassing for us to get divorced.

600
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,020
I can just find another man.

601
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,040
Am I right, Jangber?

602
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,770
I'm leaving.

603
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,910
She's the last woman

604
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,310
you need to worry about in the world.
