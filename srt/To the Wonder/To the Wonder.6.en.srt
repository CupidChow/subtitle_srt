[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,310
Look at this one.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,480
Quite transparent.

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,110
Right?

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,540
It's just an ordinary stone.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,659
I'll show you the ropes.

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,990
This is called golden silk jade.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,270
It's not expensive.

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,720
Just one yuan per gram.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,270
It'll take forever to make money.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,190
This is Aquamarine.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,830
It's worth half a year's salary of other jobs.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,380
That's all?

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,520
Yes.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,950
Remember

16
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,950
how it looks and pick it up.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,140
Give a newbie like me one.

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,780
No way.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,630
I was introduced by a friend.

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,780
Share one with me.

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,860
If it weren't for your friend,

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,850
I wouldn't have brought you here.

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,180
You won't get anywhere like this.

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,670
What's the big deal?

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,460
Hello.

28
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,230
Hello.

29
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,570
Tursenhan, come here.

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,180
How are you?

31
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,700
Hello, Madam.

32
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,950
Have you given the candy? Sit.

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,950
Come on, eat.

34
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,230
Someone got it.

35
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,350
Who won the buzkashi game?

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,560
Must be Batay. He rides so well.

37
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,140
Batay?

38
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,060
Is Batay coming?

39
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,740
Batay was here

40
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,829
in the morning.

41
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,230
As a relative,

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,900
he's busy helping out.

43
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,450
Will the players outside

44
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,110
come here for dinner?

45
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,620
Yes, all of them.

46
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,900
Look. Great photos.

47
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,350
Great photos.

48
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,910
Yes.

49
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,950
Look. Great photos. Nice clothes.

50
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,110
Hello.

51
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,180
Hello, everyone.

52
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,060
Have you seen Batay?

53
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,550
Batay.

54
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,910
Batay.

55
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,990
Where's Batay?

56
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:21,500
Hello.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,420
Hello.

Thank you.

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,380
Thank you.

60
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,500
Thank you.

61
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,910
Slow down.

62
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,060
Am I right, Uncle?

63
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,060
Wenxiu!

64
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,110
Why are you here? Let's go.

65
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,710
Where to?

66
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,920
To see something nice.

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,610
What are you looking at? Come!

68
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,990
Hurry. Come on.

69
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,380
Come on, take a look.

70
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,070
Narabi.

71
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,130
Where's the bride?

72
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,110
Let me check.

73
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,380
Narabi!

74
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,170
Where did she go?

75
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,310
Nevermind. Let's look.

76
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,060
Come here.

77
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,100
It's just like mine.

78
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,790
I rented mine from the county

79
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,950
when I got married.

80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,590
It's pretty.

81
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,180
This is pretty.

82
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,920
Is this the bride's hat?

83
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,960
A high hat.

84
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,230
So nice.

85
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,790
Let me put it on for you.

86
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,350
It's okay. Come on.

87
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,620
There's a mirror. Go.

88
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,710
No one's here.

89
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,590
Hurry up.

90
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,470
Beautiful.

91
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,230
Yeah?

92
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,940
Like this.

93
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,860
I'll get you this.

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,620
Pin it on, yeah?

95
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,230
When girls here get married,

96
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,380
the dads

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,180
prepare a lot of

98
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,990
nice stuff for them.

99
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,270
What's this called?

100
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,030
Is this a gem?

101
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,300
Yes! Gem!

102
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,980
Look. All of these are gems.

103
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,230
Do you like it?

104
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,670
Tursenhan!

105
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,990
Tursenhan!

106
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,890
Someone's here for you.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,330
Over there.

108
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,420
Come here.

109
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,590
Why are you here?

110
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,990
Why are you here?

111
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,820
Why are you here?

112
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
It's a wedding.

113
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,790
Learning the ropes.

114
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,590
Dream on.

115
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,510
It hasn't even begun taking shape.

116
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,190
Begin taking shape?

117
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,230
Your Mandarin's good.

118
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,820
I'm so fluent now.

119
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,280
My buddy Wenxiu

120
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,030
said it's good enough

121
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,800
to run a rest-stop

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,730
in the county.

123
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,690
Rest-stop? You mean a restaurant?

124
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,470
A restaurant?

125
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:28,790
Yes.

126
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,050
Run a restaurant?

127
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,850
Aren't we getting married?

128
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,640
Hush. Others will hear you.

129
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,710
You have to make my father-in-law

130
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,500
agree.

131
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,300
What should I say?

132
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,550
My grandma, parents, and I

133
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,340
have tried.

134
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,570
Should I get my motorcycle to try?

135
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,180
Why don't you talk to him?

136
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,590
I did.

137
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,060
Even my parents talked to him, but he said no,

138
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,000
that it's embarrassing to get married

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,240
during Murat's first death anniversary.

140
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,840
Embarrassing?

141
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,360
So embarrassing?

142
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,670
Even a lad like me isn't embarrassed

143
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,710
to be with you,

144
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,790
who has two kids.

145
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,420
They...

146
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,590
Are you embarrassed to marry me?

147
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,130
No.

148
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,350
Why marry me then?

149
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,300
That's not it.

150
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,180
Don't deny it.

151
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,790
Listen, goodness.

152
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,060
If I don't marry you,

153
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,050
I'll take my kids

154
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,060
to work in a rest-stop in the county.

155
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,500
No.

156
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,710
Marriage's off. Happy?

157
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,150
No.

158
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,790
The end.

159
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,350
No.

160
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,300
You didn't understand my Mandarin.

161
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,700
My Mandarin's brilliant. I understand it.

162
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,600
I'll go to him now!

163
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,350
I'll kill myself if he disagrees!

164
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,500
Stop it.

165
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,070
Go away!

166
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,020
The bride is here. Bride!

167
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,740
Narabi, you're right.

168
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,620
Batay won.

169
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,780
Where's Batay?

170
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,310
Uncle Yao took him away.

171
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,070
The elders are discussing the marriage

172
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,230
of Batay and Kulan.

173
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,950
No wonder.

174
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,780
He was grinning from ear to ear.

175
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,660
He followed Kulan

176
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,950
to her school

177
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,590
and to work in

178
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,830
the county seat.

179
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,830
Narabi, you know that too.

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,020
Narabi.

181
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,950
Are you crying?

182
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,810
Where's her family?

183
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,990
It's fine.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,620
It's good

185
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,680
for the bride to cry at the wedding.

186
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,700
She can't bear to leave her parents.

187
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,570
She's filial.

188
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,950
Haisar!

189
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,950
What's up?

190
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
Let's go. The ball's begun.

191
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,140
Kulan and Batay are singing a duet.

192
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,540
Okay.

193
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,200
We're leaving.

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,540
Bye, Narabi.

195
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,510
I...

196
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,740
My friend put it on me just now.

197
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,980
Are you the Han girl from the provision store?

198
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
How do you know?

199
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,660
Everyone in the ranch knows

200
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,330
about the Han girl

201
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,740
good at writing.

202
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,860
Don't tell anyone, okay?

203
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,470
Okay.

204
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,950
Thank you.

This song?

232
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,800
It's about love.

233
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,830
"I fell in love with a lad.

234

Love this, love that.

What does it mean?

240
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,980
It means,

241
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,140
"I like you.

242
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,340
If you don't like me,

243
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,350
I'll die."

244
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,480
I'll die!

245
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,540
Annoying!

246
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,790
Annoying!

247
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,260
Annoying!

248
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,570
You're here too?

249
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,620
Yes.

250
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,660
What dance was that?

251
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,660
Why weren't you dancing?

252
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,960
Where have you been?

253
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,070
I went to lasso a horse.

254
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,230
Why are you at a Tuoyi?

255
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,220
Tokan brought me.

256
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,530
Just in time.

257
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,190
I have something big

258
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,710
to tell you.

259
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,710
Let's go.

260
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,710
Can I not hear it?

261
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,380
No, it's a big deal. Let's go.

262
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,480
I don't want to.

263
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,780
Where are we going?

264
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,560
You'll know when we're there.

265
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,070
Snowshoe?

266
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,060
Why did you bring it out?

267
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,830
For some fresh air.

268
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,320
To adapt to crowded environments.

269
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,540
Here.

270
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,430
What's wrong, Baby?

271
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,380
Here.

272
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,380
Do you want some, Baby?

273
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,260
Have a bite.

274
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,020
Good job.

275
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,440
Remember?

276
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,950
Don't be scared.

277
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,780
We made a promise.

278
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,300
Look, it's the girl I like.

279
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,020
Don't embarrass me. Let me ride you.

280
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,910
Well done.

281
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,820
Well done!

282
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,820
Well done, Snowshoe!

283
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,740
Well done, Snowshoe.

284
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,780
Wow!

285
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,990
Snowshoe lets you ride it?

286
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,780
Yes.

287
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,710
It's slowly recovering.

288
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,470
You're amazing.

289
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,540
What did you say to make it

290
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,500
listen to you?

291
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,760
It's a secret.

292
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,200
Don't you have something to tell me?

293
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,740
Yes, it'll be Eid al-Adha soon.

294
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,850
It's an important festival,

295
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,420
you know?

296
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,920
Just like

297
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,820
the New Year.

298
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,720
There will be a horse race meeting.

299
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,860
I'm taking Snowshoe to join

300
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,550
the archery competition.

301
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,100
If it's fine then,

302
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,990
it'll mean

303
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,340
it's recovered.

304
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,740
Will you go?

305
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,340
Is that it?

306
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,910
Yes.

307
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,390
Nothing else to tell me?

308
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,060
About what?

309
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,820
I heard you're getting engaged to Kulan.

310
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,990
Uncle Yao talked to me.

311
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,740
Aren't you gonna tell me?

312
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,470
Is it necessary?

313
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,230
I'm not the one

314
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,670
Kulan likes.

315
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,480
I don't like Kulan either.

316
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,630
Yes.

317
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,670
Who do you...

318
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,950
like?

319
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,970
Who I like?

320
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,190
Isn't it obvious?

321
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,980
How?

322
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,430
It's...

323
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:21,930
Look.

324
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,920
Who's the first to see Snowshoe's progress?

325
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,390
I showed it to you.

326
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,100
Don't you get it?

327
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,680
Not really.

328
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,580
Why not?

329
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,840
That's what it means!

330
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,870
Snowshoe!

331
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,230
Come back!

332
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,670
Come back, Snowshoe!

333
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,530
Come back!

334
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,160
Snowshoe!

335
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,630
You can't go there!

336
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,710
Snowshoe!

337
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,390
You can't go there!

338
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,870
Snowshoe!

339
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,480
Wenxiu!

340
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,300
Batay, what kind of a friend are you?

341
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,080
You know I like Kulan, but you still want to marry her.

342
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,580
Is it not enough to beat me in buzkashi?

343
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,020
Marrying her?

344
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,020
Pull them apart!

345
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,970
Are you bitter about losing to me in buzkashi?

346
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,120
Who wants to marry Kulan?

347
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,080
-Don't hit Batay's face.
-You're marrying Kulan?

348
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,870
Batay, explain to them.

349
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,420
Hurry, talk them out of it!

350
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,360
How dare you steal Mohebit's girl?

351
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,570
Brothers, attack!

352
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,020
No, you misunderstood!

353
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,820
Admit defeat!

354
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,470
No!

355
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,500
Explain it!

356
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,390
Explain it to them!

357
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,910
Uncle Yao, explain to them

358
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,340
it's a mix-up!

359
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,200
I can't believe Dad.

360
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,990
Why didn't he ask me?

361
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,880
Mohebit's the one I'm dating.

362
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,470
Mohebit really likes you.

363
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,670
Look, he's still fighting.

364
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,670
Come on. He just wants to win.

365
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,990
He's bitter he lost to Batay

366
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,500
in buzkashi.

367
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,220
Are you bitter about losing to me in buzkashi?

368
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,910
Stop it, Batay.

369
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,310
Admit defeat!

370
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,910
No!

371
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,670
Admit defeat!

372
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,330
Batay!

373
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,350
Gosh!

374
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,430
Stop it!

375
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,780
Enough!

376
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,480
That's enough.

377
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,100
Kulan isn't marrying Batay.

378
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,120
It's a mix-up.

379
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,920
I think they're tired.

380
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,400
Admit defeat!

381
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,350
Enough!

382
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,300
Enough.

383
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,670
I'll love him forever.

384
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,910
Let me kiss you.

385
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,740
No!

386
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,870
Batay, buddy.

387
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,630
Wenxiu.

388
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,950
Kulan.

389
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,870
Wenxiu.

390
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,960
Let's go.

391
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,070
It's 3 a.m.

392
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,220
I have to milk the sheep at 5 a.m.

393
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,740
Let's go.

394
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,110
Let's go back.

395
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:07,260
You're the only friend who beat me in a horse race.

396
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,060
He's a real man.

397
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,750
He beat me in buzkashi.

398
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,300
Awesome.

399
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,290
Batay.

400
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,710
It's all in the wine.

401
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,260
Bye.

402
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,300
-We’re leaving. Bye.
-Bye.

403
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,200
I'll go to your house next time.

404
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,030
Wenxiu.

405
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,470
W-Wenxiu.

406
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,340
Are you leaving?

407
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,950
We're going back to Naren.

408
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,100
Naren?

409
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,580
It's far.

410
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,300
It'll take two hours on foot.

411
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,180
They have work to do in the day.

412
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,190
Do you know there's a horse race meeting soon?

413
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,910
I know.

414
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,500
Won't everyone be there?

415
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,150
See you then.

416
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,910
Okay.

417
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,430
Bye.

418
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,260
Bye.

419
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,340
Wenxiu.

420
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,320
Who was that?

421
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,670
He came with friends.

422
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,390
They're Daurs.

423
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,670
He is Haisar's friend from Tacheng.

424
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,700
He works at the water plant.

425
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,500
Wenxiu!

426
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,740
Wenxiu.

427
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,060
We grew up together,

428
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
riding horses.

429
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,170
Grew up together.

430
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,100
Right.

431
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,740
My dad can't herd sheep today.

432
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,910
I have to do it.

433
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,540
Yes.

434
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,950
Tokan.

435
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,990
Do you have any spare workbooks?

436
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,670
Yerdana should have some.

437
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,150
Yerdana?

438
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,490
He's eight years old,

439
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,730
but I've never seen him do homework.

440
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,470
Really.

441
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,000
What should I do?

442
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,740
I'm out of paper.

443
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,370
I can't buy it on the ranch.

444
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,910
Your family owns the only store around.

445
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,270
Where can you buy it?

446
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,990
Oh no.

447
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,760
Wenxiu!

448
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,950
Wenxiu!

449
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,590
Wenxiu!

450
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,470
Wenxiu!

451
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,260
Grandpa, the quilt was upside down last night.

452
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,570
This side's for your foot, not your head.

453
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,550
Really?

454
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,230
Yes.

455
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,730
It's okay.

456
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,550
Don't tell your mom, okay?

457
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,200
Okay.

458
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,460
Child.

459
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,220
Make tea after folding the quilt.

460
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,960
Okay.

461
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,950
Nadyra, go make tea.

462
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:31,820
Okay.

463
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,030
I'll find you when I'm free.

464
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,870
Bye.

465
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,630
I've never been apart from

466
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,540
Nadyra and Yerdana.

467
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,480
Is Dad taking good care of them?

468
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,780
Close your mouth.

469
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,180
I can see your tonsils.

470
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,520
I didn't expect you to be

471
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,190
her daughter.

472
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,840
I didn't expect you to be lovers either.

473
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,740
It's the power of love.

474
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,340
We've agreed we're free to love.

475
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,060
If you don't eat,

476
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,780
I won't dare to eat.

477
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,740
It's delicious. Wild ones?

478
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,000
Did you get it from the ranch?

479
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,060
Say something.

480
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,100
Wild ones.

481
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,560
All picked from the ranch?

482
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,490
What else?

483
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,720
From the mountain's pine forest.

484
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,160
No wonder it tastes so different.

485
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,500
This is the green pollution-free food

486
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,480
they're advocating

487
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,080
in the city.

488
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,900
Grandma, eat more. It's good for your lungs.

489
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,800
Then get some more.

490
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,440
The locals don't eat this.

491
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,460
Dry them

492
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,120
to sell at the county

493
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,880
with the black herbal soap.

494
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,670
Sure.

495
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,390
I'll pick some after eating.

496
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,800
Okay.

497
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,880
But you don't know the way.

498
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,740
Eat quickly.

499
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,910
Then lead the way.

500
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,670
What's going on?

501
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,870
What's with him?

502
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,950
Didn't you go out to buy sheep?

503
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,650
Why did you bring a man back?

504
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,980
He's just a sheep.

505
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,060
Explain yourself.

506
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,630
On the way,

507
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,950
I went further and further...

508
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,510
until I got to Gobi.

509
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,740
So I went to Fairy Cove to see your dad.

510
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,060
I found him on the way.

511
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,020
Listen.

512
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,100
I feel like

513
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,270
your dad's spirit

514
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,060
made this happen.

515
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,500
You're blaming my dad?

516
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,770
Let's set off!

517
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,980
Go on.

518
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,340
I'm sleepy.

519
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,260
I stayed up all night.

520
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,910
Where did you go that you didn't sleep?

521
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,010
It's hot. Drink more water.

522
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,780
Go rest. I'll wash that later.

523
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,820
It's okay.

524
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,680
Come out!

525
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,430
Slow down. I have altitude sickness.

526
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,460
But it's just over 2,000 m.

527
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,910
I'm serious. It's still high.

528
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,950
You look skinny,

529
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,670
but...

530
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,190
you're quite fit.

531
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,460
Don't you think you've changed?

532
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,500
Do you recall

533
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
our chat on the rooftop?

534
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,460
You said you wanted to be a writer in Beijing.

535
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,530
I said I'd work hard to get rich.

536
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,150
Remember?

537
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,340
Money's all you know.

538
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,670
How else can we get food?

539
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,870
How else can we live?

540
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,200
A good life requires money.

541
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,950
It depends.

542
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,430
Some good lives don't cost much.

543
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,430
So many.

544
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,090
Can you cut them off?

545
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,470
Why not?

546
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,020
I quit high school and started working.

547
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,230
I did everything.

548
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,870
Listen, whenever I see wood ear,

549
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,820
I wanna laugh.

550
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,410
My dad had gastric perforation from drinking.

551
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,260
We were poor back then.

552
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,740
We couldn't afford meat.

553
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,260
My mom bought it that day.

554
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,300
I recall it was

555
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,470
five-yuan ribs.

556
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,500
With wood ear and ginseng,

557
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,400
she made soup

558
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,950
to heal my dad's stomach.

559
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,950
My sister and I took that jar.

560
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,340
We walked to the hospital.

561
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,230
I kept wondering

562
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,710
why it smelled so good.

563
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,880
I couldn't resist.

564
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,080
I drank it all outside the hospital.

565
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,720
My sister started to bawl.

566
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
She was scared.

567
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,100
"Dad will kill us when he finds out!"

568
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,500
So I looked around the hospital

569
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,100
for the hot water kettle.

570
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,560
I added half a kettle

571
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,270
and gave it to him.

572
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,350
When I left home at 18,

573
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,500
he stopped me.

574
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,750
He said,

575
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,360
"If you dare leave,

576
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,310
come back only when you're successful."

577
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,469
I haven't seen him for years.

578
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,020
I wanna earn a fortune

579
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:35,810
to go back

580
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,449
and throw the money at him.

581
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,949
And I'll tell him this,

582
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,370
"I've made it.

583
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,870
Have you?"

584
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,989
That'd feel great.

585
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,500
Cut them off yourself.

586
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,620
I'll find a place to nap.

587
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,389
Be back in 40 minutes.

588
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,050
Get me a bottle of water later.

589
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,150
There's a stream there.

590
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,870
And press this.

591
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,310
Let go.

592
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,580
Go.

593
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,620
This is...

594
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,270
This...

595
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,310
This thing...

596
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,360
Don't give up.

597
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,720
Didn't you fall when learning to ride horses?

598
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,780
We are born to ride horses.

599
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,570
Gosh.

600
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,560
You're exaggerating.

601
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,420
You'd still have fallen down at least once.

602
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,310
Is it nice?

603
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,780
What's nice about a shard of glass?

604
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,300
My emerald.

605
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,550
Hello.

606
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,250
Hello.

607
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,390
-Hello.
-Hello.

608
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,990
How's Nadyra?

609
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,060
She's much better.

610
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,530
Her mom applied some ointment for her.

611
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,220
She's much better.

612
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,310
Nadyra's still young.

613
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,500
I hope she doesn't get a scar.

614
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,700
Men are careless.

615
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,390
How can you let a child make tea?

616
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,510
I didn't ask her to make tea.

617
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,590
I asked Yerdana, but he...

618
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,710
Forget it. It's my fault in the end.

619
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,940
It's women's business to take care of children.

620
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,750
Now it's women's business?

621
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,420
Then why won't you let the kids follow Tokan?

622
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,800
Sulitan.

623
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,310
What are you doing here?

624
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,830
I wasn't finished.

625
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,910
I'm here to get some herbs for Nadyra's burn wound.

626
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,430
We have it.

627
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,860
Take a rest here. I'll get it.

628
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,530
Okay.

629
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,700
Sit over there.

630
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,940
Why's he here? To get soap?

631
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,020
Sulitan.

632
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,450
Sulitan.

633
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,800
Keep this.

634
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,370
It's you.

635
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,930
I saved you,

636
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,910
but you told Aybek?

637
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,970
What do you want?

638
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,700
Sulitan.

639
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,110
Are you threatening me?

640
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,120
Sulitan, stop.

641
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,960
Sulitan, Fengxia didn't say anything.

642
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,560
Then how did you know?

643
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,700
Look.

644
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,390
She secretly kept evidence

645
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,440
to expose me.

646
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,520
So you admit you're hiding a gun?

647
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,720
How ungrateful!

648
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,620
Enough.

649
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,070
Sulitan.

650
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,750
No one told me.

651
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,330
When you didn't dare swear to it,

652
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,750
I knew you must've hidden one.

653
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,910
Since you admit it,

654
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,560
give it to me.

655
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,670
I can go to your house to get it.

656
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:30,990
Sulitan!

657
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,980
What's wrong with him?

658
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,050
So stubborn.

659
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,500
Seriously.

660
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,680
She's a girl.

661
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,720
What if there's a scar on her face?

662
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,550
You said you'd take good care of them.

663
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,840
Is this it?

664
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,910
You wouldn't let me take my kids with me.

665
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,720
Don't you care about them?

666
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,310
Of course I do.

667
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,220
You think what you do is for everyone's sake.

668
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,950
But have you asked them what they want?

669
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,660
You must keep the kids.

670
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,720
Batay must herd.

671
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,820
Batay doesn't even dare confess to the girl he likes.

672
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,490
I didn't stop Batay from finding a partner.

673
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,620
That's because he likes the girl from the store.

674
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,000
Will you agree to it?

675
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,220
No!

676
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,480
No.

677
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,860
No.

678
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,160
♫Moonlight swaying on the ground♫

679
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,270
♫Blurry light begins to surround me♫

680
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,770
Dad!

681
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,990
Are you dating the girl from the store?

682
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,750
Listen.

683
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,740
You can marry anyone but her.

684
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,770
Will she herd with you?

685
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,890
Will she wash, cook, and care for your family?

686
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,540
She'll go back to the city

687
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,970
like Tokan!

688
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,200
I'm not staying in the ranch.

689
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,660
I told you

690
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,810
I'm returning to the stable.

691
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,690
You...

692
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,890
Let's see how...

693
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,140
Dad!

694
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,010
You only care about that horse.

695
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,780
I sent you to raise horses.

696
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,700
Snowshoe!

697
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,770
