00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,470
Can you slice it?

177
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,850
Like this.

178
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,630
Thank you.

179
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,310
Let me do it.

180
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,110
It's okay. You had a tough day.

181
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,440
You're hindering me from eating.

182
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,470
You guys eat.

183
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm going out...

184
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,620
for a walk to aid digestion.

185
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,150
Don't go too far.

186
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,850
There are wolves nearby.

187
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,330
Be careful.

188
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,480
Okay.

189
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,040
I'll go with you.

190
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:50,800
Sure.

191
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,270
If I get bitten by a wolf,

192
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,250
someone can return to report it.

193
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,390
We won't go far, right?

194
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,420
Go along the river and it's the Fairy Cove trail.

195
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,440
I've been here.

196
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,670
What exactly is Fairy Cove?

197
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,730
In ancient legend,

198
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,630
Fairy Cove is a lake

199
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,760
like a crescent moon.

200
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,400
If someone walks in the Gobi Desert

201
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,560
and was dehydrated and close to fainting,

202
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,270
they'll recover instantly

203
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,080
by drinking the lake's water.

204
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,070
So when moving ranch, many herders

205
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,710
deliberately detour through Fairy Cove

206
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,710
to pray for good luck.

207
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,870
As more people came here,

208
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,120
an indistinct sheep track

209
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,630
gradually formed.

210
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,020
So

211
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,250
according to legend,

212
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,800
Fairy Cove represents survival in a desperate situation

213
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,790
and brings good luck.

214
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,540
What good luck?

215
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,220
It's just a legend.

216
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,680
Don't you know about romance?

217
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,640
You've to be well fed and clothed for that. Mom.

218
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,300
What is it?

219
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,830
It's cold. Let's go back or we'll get hungry.

220
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,360
It wasn't easy to come out.

221
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,530
We're almost there.

222
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,280
It's so far.

223
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,920
Let's go.

224
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,630
Really...

225
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,350
Xiu!

226
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,580
Listen.

227
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,090
What?

228
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,160
I wanted to tell you just now.

229
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,800
I didn't wanna scare you.

230
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,930
Don't move.

231
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,950
Don't move.

232
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,300
There's a spider!

233
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,510
Are you okay?

234
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,170
My biscuit box?

235
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,170
My biscuit box!

236
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,810
What are you doing?

237
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,780
My biscuit box!

238
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,190
Mom.

239
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,560
The water's cold, Mom.

240
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,880
Don't go in. The water's cold. Come back!

241
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,160
Stop it. Don't bother.

242
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,220
The water's cold!

243
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,250
-Let go!
-Stop!

244
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,670
It's just detergent! Go back up!

245
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,750
It's baking soda!

246
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,120
Fine, it's not that either. It's your dad!

247
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,490
He just left like that?

248
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,980
I'm not ready yet.

249
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,020
I haven't properly said goodbye to him.

250
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,780
You heartless man!

251
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,200
Your dad and I

252
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
met at Fairy Cove.

253
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,720
Right here.

254
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,100
Your dad said...

255
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,460
Fairy Cove

256
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,370
is the most beautiful place in the world.

257
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,070
You asked me why I wanna go to the summer ranch.

258
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,290
Because I thought

259
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,110
I should find

260
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,490
the most beautiful place in the world

261
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,950
for your dad to stay at.

262
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,310
Mom.

263
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,870
Isn't this Fairy Cove?

264
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,150
My dad was happy.

265
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,609
He jumped in himself.

266
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,220
This is fate.

267
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,390
You wanted to put him here anyway.

268
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,599
Nonsense.

269
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,079
I wanted to

270
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,460
find a tree near the lake

271
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,470
to bury him.

272
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,910
Then when I miss him,

273
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,190
I can visit him here.

274
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,740
This is great.

275
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,850
He fell into the lake.

276
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,820
How can I find him in the future?

277
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,060
He doesn't want you to find him.

278
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,390
Mom.

279
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,220
It's been five years. You have to move on.

280
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,050
Let him go too.

281
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,150
I don't want to.

282
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,180
I don't want to.

283
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,850
Mom.

284
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,840
Mom, I'm gonna say something. Don't be scared.

285
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,080
Is there a spider on my face?

286
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,980
What is it?

287
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,750
Look at what's over there.

288
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,770
Is that your dad?

289
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,450
Does my dad have green eyes?

290
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,850
That's a wolf.

291
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,590
Can you climb trees?

292
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,820
Yes. And you?

293
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,430
I just learned it two days ago.

294
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,990
Let's go! Hurry! Run!

295
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,280
Do you think

296
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,350
your dad's trying to visit me in this manner?

297
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,120
Stop being so lovesick or I'll abandon you!

298
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,130
Go up!

299
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,910
Hurry!

300
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,910
No!

301
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,730
Don't bite me!

302
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,910
Sulitan?

303
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,590
Sulitan!

304
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,390
Help!

305
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,990
Help us! Help!

306
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,300
Sulitan!

307
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,580
Why didn't you turn the gun in?

308
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,350
I did.

309
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,570
You saved one for yourself.

310
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,070
He didn't say we had to turn all of them in.

311
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,670
You're being unreasonable.

312
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,880
There are wolves in Fairy Cove.

313
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,740
Without the gun,

314
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,760
those two from the south would've been dead.

315
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,750
If we used the highway,

316
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,660
there wouldn't be wolves.

317
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,270
I'm going by the well-trodden path

318
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,450
our family's used for generations.

319
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,540
If you don't wanna be a herder, go back to the city.

320
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,880
No one's forcing you.

321
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,160
A son shouldn't lecture his father.

322
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
Don't teach me what to do!

323
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,580
Sulitan.

324
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,310
Thank you.

325
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,950
Thank you.

326
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,860
Thank you.

327
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,330
When I was on the branch,

328
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,470
the wolves jumped

329
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,860
and my mom's shoes...

330
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,600
I saw her...

331
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,520
It was so scary.

332
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,630
If it weren't for my father-in-law,

333
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,390
you'd be sleeping on the tree.

334
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,070
Or even in the wolf's belly.

335
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,970
I was scared to death.

336
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,030
You're right.

337
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,920
We owe it to your father-in-law.

338
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,190
Well, Sulitan,

339
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,350
I wanna give you 25 kg of black salt.

340
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,310
Okay.

341
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,590
I'll go check on the sheep.

342
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,670
Okay.

343
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,210
What did he say?

344
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,220
He's gonna check on the sheep.

345
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,210
What's the thing between your mom and dad?

346
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,730
What thing?

347
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,060
The thing between a man and a woman.

348
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,500
What's it called?

349
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,750
When a man and a woman

350
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,510
do that...

351
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,160
What's it called?

352
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,240
The thing between a man and a woman.

353
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,220
What?

354
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,310
The thing between a man and a woman.

355
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,710
What's it called?

356
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,110
Enough talking. Go to sleep.

357
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,130
What is it?

358
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,830
It's love.

359
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,620
Her mom loves her dad.

360
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,510
Yes, love.

361
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,860
Mom loves Dad.

362
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,180
Yes, that's it.

363
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,470
She has love,

364
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,190
so she can't be too bad.

365
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,350
Mom loves Dad.

366
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,300
Let's sleep, Tokan.

367
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:53,950
Wenxiu.

368
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,000
I love you.

369
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,740
Nadyra.

370
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,690
I love you.

371
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,450
Yerdana.

372
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,570
I love you.

373
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,910
Sleep well, my baby.

374
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,520
Morning, little lamb.

375
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,660
You're so cute.

376
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,740
Little lamb, you're so cute.

377
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,930
A cutie that's worth ten yuan per kg.

378
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,610
May we have a smooth transition to a new ranch

379
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,040
and a safe trip.

380
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,880
Let's go.

381
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,990
Batay, my buddy!

382
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,190
Hello!

383
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,120
Hello!

384
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,830
Batay, my buddy!

385
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,390
Hello!

386
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,750
This is Chaoge,

387
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,340
our Mongolian friend.

388
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,960
He's going to the ranch with us today.

389
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,230
Do you guys run the provision store?

390
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,350
Yes!

391
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,470
In the morning, Aybek said

392
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,670
Han women are coming to open a store.

393
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,360
Is that so?

394
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,670
Just call me Chaoge.

395
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,550
Okay, Chaoge.

396
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,910
I'm a border guard!

397
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,960
The ranch is along the border!

398
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,910
My border station

399
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,800
is at the edge of this ranch!

400
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,530
Be careful with your business!

401
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,030
If you cross the border,

402
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,340
it'd be Kazakhstan.

403
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,060
That's an international trade incident!

404
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,920
Uncle.

405
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,550
Hello.

406
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,530
Hello.

407
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,840
This is Bugassenden,

408
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,440
Chaoge's grandma.

409
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,060
A prestigious female chief

410
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,200
on this grassland.

411
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,930
You can all understand them?

412
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,410
Yes, a little.

413
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,780
Mongolian and Kazakh

414
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,430
share some similar words.

415
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,730
Mongolians in Altay

416
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,230
all know some Kazakh.

417
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,940
Why's she dressed like this?

418
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,220
Grandma's asking

419
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,740
why the Han people

420
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,140
are shabbily dressed.

421
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,570
Well, it's like this.

422
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,940
Since this journey is arduous

423
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,740
and bumpy,

424
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,010
we didn't wanna ruin our good clothes.

425
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,750
No matter how bumpy life is,

426
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,890
you mustn't lose your spark.

427
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,180
Grandma said

428
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,540
no matter how bumpy life is, you mustn't lose your spark.

429
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,170
I'll change my shoes later.

430
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,990
I'll be sparkling.

431
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,620
Let's go.

432
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,390
Go in first. I'll change my shoes.

433
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,470
What is this stone?

434
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,310
Jade.

435
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,950
Such a big piece of jade?

436
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,100
I'll sell it to you for 10,000 yuan.

437
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,430
You can sell this in the city

438
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,070
for one million.

439
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,630
Really?

440
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,370
Just kidding.

441
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,390
These are just worthless stones on the mountain.

442
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,470
Since the highway was built,

443
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,550
many outsiders came to the mountain to pick up jade.

444
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,150
Chaoge placed a few useless stones.

445
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,760
It looks attractive

446
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,580
but it's just a facade to fool people.

447
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,900
Luckily, I'm poor.

448
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,870
You can't fool the poor

449
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,930
or down-to-earth people.

450
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,150
Right?

451
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,970
Yes.

452
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,750
Please.

453
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,920
Your sheep are very fat.

454
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,790
Fatter than Sulitan's sheep.

455
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,500
We moved to a new ranch early.

456
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,100
Our sheep have been eating grass for a month.

457
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,820
Batay's sheep are skinny

458
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,100
because they've starved for a winter.

459
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,470
These sheep have milk, right?

460
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,470
When we get to the summer ranch,

461
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,850
we'll have sheep milk.

462
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,710
The sheep will grow even fatter in autumn.

463
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,770
You can also sell them for money.

464
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,230
Right?

465
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,350
Yes.

466
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,190
That one has milk.

467
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,130
That one?

468
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,470
Yes.

469
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,320
The fat one?

470
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:06,700
Yes.

471
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,610
A female sheep?

472
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:07,900
Yes.

473
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,810
It has milk.

474
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,750
How much is it?

475
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,230
20 yuan per kg.

476
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,210
20 yuan?

477
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,150
It's too expensive. 10 yuan.

478
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,620
I won't sell it then.

479
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,600
That sheep

480
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,170
will grow fatter in autumn

481
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,820
and sell for more.

482
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,510
10 yuan.

483
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:21,830
No.

484
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,310
Deal?

485
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,790
No.

486
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,770
No?

487
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm leaving then.

488
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,910
Where to?

489
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,640
Come to my house.

490
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay. Let's have milk tea at your place.

491
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,940
Let's have milk tea at my place.

492
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,030
Hurry up.

493
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,430
This old lady sure has good teeth.

494
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,350
She can even eat such hard stuff.

495
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,190
In my life...

496
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,200
There's nothing I can't do on my own.

497
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,440
The last time we went to the county seat to restock goods,

498
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,660
someone called looking for Tokan.

499
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,550
It was Chaoge.

500
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,630
So how is everything at home?

501
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,030
It's been good.

502
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,440
Milk tea.

503
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,750
Thank you.

504
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,270
Chaoge’s brother is a singer.

505
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,550
He lives in Beijing.

506
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,230
He even married a local.

507
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,870
Is your brother in Beijing?

508
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:04,910
Yes.

509
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,130
Don't mention it.

510
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,790
Last Chinese New Year,

511
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,780
my brother came home, remember?

512
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,700
He despised my sister-in-law

513
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,420
for washing bottoms and tops together.

514
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,310
And then?

515
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,090
My sister-in-law disagreed.

516
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,950
They always

517
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,340
quarrel over laundry.

518
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,060
Can't you wash them separately?

519
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,550
We do it separately.

520
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,490
By colors.

521
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,860
Whites and blacks separately.

522
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,500
No.

523
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,650
Tops and bottoms separately.

524
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,110
Right.

525
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,540
Right?

526
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,590
Whites and blacks

527
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,420
separately.

528
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,550
No, no, no.

529
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,670
More Mongolians and people from the south

530
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,030
are getting married.

531
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,230
Your children are all outside.

532
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,180
You're the only ones left on the grasslands.

533
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,910
One's environment is crucial

534
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,040
for personal growth.

535
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,790
It's a good thing that the kids

536
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,490
are exploring outside.

537
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,530
Am I right?

538
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,870
You're right.

539
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,190
More Mongolians and Kazakhs

540
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,750
are getting married too.

541
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,630
Really? I've never heard of it.

542
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,710
He's never heard of it.

543
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,270
Sulitan.

544
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,830
Murat's death anniversary has passed.

545
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,000
It's time for us to talk about

546
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,140
Chaoge and Tokan.

547
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,850
Chaoge likes Tokan.

548
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,500
What do you think?

549
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,750
What?

550
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,240
What did they say?

551
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,460
What's wrong?

552
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,610
Have some naan.

553
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,750
Where did you buy it?

554
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,580
The county seat.

555
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,940
You went to the city?

556
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,440
Yes.

557
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,510
Eat up. It's your favorite.

558
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,350
I'll catch you now.

559
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,410
The kids are here.

560
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,750
Here.

561
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,950
What?

562
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,470
Hand cream.

563
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,990
I apply it on my hands?

564
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,710
Yes.

565
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,190
I'll do it myself.

566
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,630
My grandma's talking to your father-in-law about it.

567
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,860
I know.

568
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,480
Do you know?

569
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,250
Father-in-law asked Batay to marry me.

570
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,190
Who?

571
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,290
Batay.

572
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,500
My friend Batay?

573
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,920
Yes, your friend.

574
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,480
That punk.

575
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,290
The kids are here.

576
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,410
You all know?

577
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,820
We don’t.

578
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,620
I didn’t know Chaoge called

579
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,950
your sister-in-law.

580
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,050
I was the only one in agony?

581
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,330
After Murat passed away,

582
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,410
she took her two kids to move to another ranch alone.

583
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,640
Life was hard.

584
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,290
Chaoge fell for Tokan and wants to marry her.

585
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,530
After my brother died,

586
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,240
my sister-in-law was alone.

587
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,470
Her grandson Chaoge

588
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,800
wants to marry her.

589
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,350
I see.

590
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,300
Murat's death anniversary has passed.

591
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,139
The living must live well.

592
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,969
What you're saying is reasonable.

593
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,940
If Tokan's parents agree, it's fine with me.

594
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,370
But the kids must stay with us.

595
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,050
Okay.

596
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,320
Have some meat.

597
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,540
You must be tired from the journey.

598
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,960
The kids must stay with us.

599
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,830
She said to eat meat.

600
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,020
Good luck.

601
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,310
If...

602
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,750
Tokan marries into our family,

603
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,430
your family will

604
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,380
only have you and Batay left.

605
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,500
What did she say?

606
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,590
She said

607
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,780
if Tokan remarries,

608
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,400
the kids must stay with us.

609
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,430
It'll be a bad environment

610
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,870
for Yerdana and Nadira.

611
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,240
I think the two kids should be raised

612
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,120
in our home.

613
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,280
Isn't that good?

614
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,280
We have many women

615
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,430
to help take care of the kids.

616
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,140
When the kids grow up,

617
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
you can take them back if you want.

618
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,700
No.

619
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,080
If you raise the kids,

620
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,990
we'll grow apart.

621
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Isn't it natural for kids

622
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,620
to follow their mom?

623
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,690
No, I disagree.

624
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,740
Our tradition isn't like this.

625
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,060
I'm not against

626
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,090
Tokan's remarriage.

627
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,780
But the kids have to stay with us.

628
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,080
They belong to our family.

629
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,450
I respect you.

630
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,600
But if you keep talking like this, I'm leaving.

631
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,910
Sulitan!

632
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,220
Sulitan!

633
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,340
Uncle.

634
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,630
Uncle.

635
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,030
Uncle, don't be angry. Don't go.

636
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,120
Let's solve the conflict bit by bit.

637
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,640
My brother and sister-in-law

638
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,280
are in conflict even about laundry.

639
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,020
But they're very close,

640
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,880
so they get along well.

641
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,830
Uncle, thanks for accepting Tokan's and my relationship.

642
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,860
But traditions

643
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,110
haven't always been the way they are.

644
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,810
You insist on upholding tradition,

645
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,240
traveling by the Fairy Cove trail,

646
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,550
and being a hunter.

647
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,130
But 100 years ago,

648
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,970
there was no Fairy Cove trail.

649
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,420
200 years ago, there were no hunting guns.

650
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,810
All traditions and civilizations

651
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,790
were slowly uncovered by humans

652
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,620
as the world changed.

653
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,270
Nothing is constant.

654
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,800
-Enough.
-Let me finish.

655
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,470
The only constant is change.

656
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,190
The current era

657
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,530
is another change.

658
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,110
It's proper

659
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,630
to adapt to a new era.

660
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,700
Upholding old traditions isn't always right.

661
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,750
I-I read it in a book.

662
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,620
Did I do something wrong?

663
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,800
Sulitan.

664
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,240
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,420
I apologize on behalf of my daughter.

666
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,070
She's young and immature.

667
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,020
Don't be mad at her.

668
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,490
Please be magnanimous.

669
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,390
Please be magnanimous.

670
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,380
Have a big appetite.

671
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,470
Eat more meat.

672
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,910
Stay healthy.

673
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,720
Well,

674
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,640
since you like change so much,

675
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,960
we'll make some changes too.

676
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,190
After the meal,

677
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,590
go to the summer ranch by yourselves.

678
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,030
What did he say?

679
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,160
My good friend, I'll take this.

680
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,810
Go towards the snowy mountain. It's near.

681
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,460
I wish you a safe journey

682
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,250
and happiness.

683
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,710
Well,

684
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,550
you can go to the summer ranch by yourselves.

685
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,700
What did she say?

686
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,560
I don't know.

687
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,810
In any case, it didn't seem cordial.

688
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,630
She's chasing us away.

689
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,760
Then... are we leaving?

690
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,550
Yes.

691
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,540
We can't stay in this atmosphere anyway.

692
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,200
Let's go.

693
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,710
Mom.

694
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,190
I'm scared without them.

695
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,190
What's there to be afraid of?

696
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,600
Be brave and smile.

697
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,070
Don't be a coward.

698
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,020
Have a safe journey.

699
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,160
Have a safe journey.

700
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,020
Wish you happiness.

701
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,570
Wish you abundant happiness.

702
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,960
Tie it tighter this time.

703
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,860
I'm so tired, Mom.

704
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,150
How much more do we have to go?

705
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,450
I don't know.

706
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,530
Being a herder is really tiring.

707
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,690
Mom.

708
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:46,800
[Naren summer ranch]

709
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,730
This phone number seems familiar.

710
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,910
Isn't this our number?

711
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,390
Uncle Bek sure is thick-skinned.

712
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,630
Let's go.

713
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,450
The summer ranch is so beautiful.

714
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,550
Finally! My legs are about to break.

715
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,980
I'm exhausted.

716
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,490
Isn't this what you want?

717
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,760
You want to make more money

718
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,720
and live a better life.

719
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,250
So you had to go further away for a more tiring life.

720
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,430
I'm such a fool.

721
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,370
If I have a harder life now

722
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,160
for a better life in the future,

723
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,710
wouldn't it be even?

724
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,160
Why did I come here?

725
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,450
It'd be better to

726
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,720
live a moderate life in the village.

727
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,500
I'm really craving some alcohol.

728
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,910
I think this place is nice.

729
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,050
At least you can't drink here.

730
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,720
You were the one who rejected it for being tiring

731
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,530
and remote.

732
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,640
Now you like it.

733
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,210
You've said everything.

734
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,980
People change after all.

735
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,840
But look, Mom.

736
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,960
The highway will be built to the summer ranch soon.

737
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,970
When we make money,

738
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,780
let's buy a small pickup truck

739
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,340
to make our lives easier.

740
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
How long will that take?

741
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,410
It might take you lesser time

742
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,650
to find a boyfriend.

743
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,130
Find one for yourself.

744
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,300
I'll encourage you in my dad's stead.

745
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,220
Thank you then.

746
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,690
Zhang Fengxia!

747
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,400
How are you?

748
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:00,110
Jangber!

749
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,170
Batay, my child.

750
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,760
Auntie!

751
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,410
Wenxiu.

752
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,570
How are you?

753
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,190
Did the chief tell you

754
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,730
he abandoned us on the way?

755
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,870
He's ridiculous.

756
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,720
Is your dad still mad at me?

757
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,460
Will he be mad that you came out?

758
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:16,890
Don’t worry.

759
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,750
Chaoge's herding the sheep for me.

760
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,390
They are busy tidying up.

761
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,220
They don't have time for me.

762
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,830
I'll apologize to him when he calms down.

763
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,060
I didn't mean it.

764
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,590
But your dad is a good man.

765
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,520
He saved me and my mom.

766
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,850
It's okay.

767
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,530
It's ridiculous.

768
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,260
Scold him when you go back.

769
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,990
Bye.

770
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,060
Bye.

771
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:49,970
Thank you.

772
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,920
Let's go.

773
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,020
Where's your horse?

774
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,530
In the forest.

775
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,990
Go and give him a hand.

776
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,350
Okay.

777
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,450
Thank you, Batay.

778
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,430
You're welcome.

779
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,180
Thank you.

780
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,460
The Pleiades is gone.

781
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,300
Look.

782
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,590
Summer is coming.

783
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,820
Li Wenxiu.

784
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,770
There are many local men on the ranch,

785
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,710
you know?

786
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,250
When they go to the store,

787
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,190
don't be too friendly, okay?

788
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,980
You have to be fierce.

789
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,800
Don't smile.

790
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,660
Or you'll end up with many boyfriends.
