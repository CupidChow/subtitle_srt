175
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,780
What?

176
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,340
My green gem!

177
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,130
What are you doing?

178
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,470
Come here.

179
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,350
What are you doing?

180
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,510
I'll get even with him.

181
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,040
What are you talking about?

182
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,140
You're a girl. What can you do?

183
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,240
Can you beat him in a fight?

184
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,840
Come here.

185
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,070
He's bullying you.

186
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,620
He disappeared for a month.

187
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,640
He cheated your money, your goods, and your feelings.

188
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't want my money anymore.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,240
Sure, forget about your money.

190
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
but I want Grandma's pendant back.

191
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,470
Yes, I can't beat him.

192
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,810
But if we let him bully us,

193
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,270
that becomes our problem.

194
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,070
Mom,

195
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,760
I always thought you were the bravest person.

196
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,820
But now I look down on you.

197
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,580
What are you doing?

198
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,230
Stop!

199
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,360
How dare you run off?

200
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,650
Ma'am, look after the stall for me.

201
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,220
Okay.

202
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,290
Stay here!

203
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,070
Let's begin.

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,790
On your marks.

205
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,460
Snowshoe, it's okay.

206
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,590
Batay.

207
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,630
Let's talk.

208
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,550
Let's go.

209
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,810
Okay.

210
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:04,960
Let's go.

211
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,470
Can you give this to Aybek for me?

212
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,230
Dad.

213
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,140
I was wrong to hit you that day.

214
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,250
I felt bad.

215
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,710
The life I like is disappearing.

216
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,480
I can't keep eagles anymore.

217
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,300
I can't hunt anymore.

218
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,560
They even confiscated my guns.

219
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,970
People no longer take the

220
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,530
Fairy Cove trail when moving ranches.

221
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,910
They all drive and take the highway.

222
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,030
You don't want to be a herder either.

223
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,860
Must this world develop like this?

224
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,750
I don't understand.

225
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,550
Dad.

226
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,430
It's my fault too.

227
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,470
Kid.

228
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,350
You did nothing wrong.

229
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,720
You're a good kid.

230
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,540
You are the best among

231
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,510
all my children.

232
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,890
I won't object to anyone you like.

233
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,480
I just want you to stay in the grassland.

234
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,030
At least let me live my life as a herder.

235
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,300
I've figured it out.

236
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,160
After summer,

237
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,870
you'll go back to working at the stable,

238
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,840
and Tokan will lead a new life with the kids.

239
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,740
Dad.

240
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,010
I'll sell half of the sheep and horses.

241
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,380
Then, I can manage on my own.

242
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,790
I can live the life I want.

243
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,960
Thank you, Dad.

244
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,690
The archery competition is about to begin.

245
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,900
Please go to the venue.

246
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,070
Go, kid.

247
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,110
Please go to the venue.

248
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,120
Do your best.

249
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,270
You're the son of a hunter.

250
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,950
Okay.

251
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,980
Batay, have you seen Wenxiu?

252
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,750
I saw her near the racecourse.

253
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,630
Is she missing?

254
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,010
By the way, did you see Chief Aybek?

255
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,800
He's with Chaoge at the market.

256
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,110
Perfect.

257
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,030
Give this to him for me.

258
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,110
I have a competition to attend.

259
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,840
What's this?

260
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,950
A hunting gun.

261
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,790
My dad said he'd give it to him.

262
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,830
The competition is about to start. I have to go.

263
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,800
Thank you.

264
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,230
The archery competition has begun.

265
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,800
Are you sure this is jade?

266
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,070
Isn't this quartz jade?

267
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,300
It's not valuable.

268
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,630
Oh, knock it off.

269
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,160
Yours is a five-color jade.

270
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,510
It's quartz, I tell you.

271
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,510
No way!

272
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:40,950
Let me tell you.

273
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,610
This is authentic Hotan Jade.

274
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,390
It's worth at least 100,000 yuan in the mainland.

275
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,990
You...

276
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,870
You're here.

277
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,730
One kg. Ten thousand.

278
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,390
One kg.

279
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,630
No, this can't be right.

280
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,690
It's less than a kg.

281
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,430
What do you mean?

282
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,170
How about this?

283
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,790
I'll give you a discount.

284
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,990
1,000 yuan per kg.

285
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,290
Are you kidding me?

286
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,230
Are you kidding me?

287
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,110
No.

288
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,300
Didn't we agree on 10,000 yuan per kg?

289
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,470
I left in a hurry that day. I didn't make it clear.

290
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,350
Here's the thing.

291
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,990
You dug them out from the ground.

292
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,120
I have to process them several times

293
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,670
to get caterpillar fungus,

294
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,370
which is 10,000 yuan per kg.

295
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,010
-Give it to me. -No, bro.

296
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,660
Are you kidding me?

297
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,300
No, bro.

298
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,110
Do you want trouble?

299
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,590
Harmony brings wealth.

300
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,910
Harmony... Don't move.

301
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,350
You...

302
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,110
This is quite transparent.

303
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,550
Isn't it good?

304
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,550
Transparency is good.

305
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,730
But it might be fake if it's too transparent.

306
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,870
This can't be fake.

307
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,080
I bought it from a granny.

308
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,830
I bet it's worth at least 40 to 50 thousand in the mainland.

309
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,910
40 to 50 thousand?

310
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,670
Are you joking?

311
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,640
No one's joking with you.

312
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,240
It's just a piece of glass.

313
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,630
Give it back. That's my grandma's.

314
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,760
So it's a love debt.

315
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,490
Give me the money and leave immediately.

316
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,089
Love debt? He doesn't deserve it.

317
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:17,940
Shut up.

318
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,030
My mom said

319
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,050
she doesn't want the goods and money anymore.

320
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,950
Give me the money!

321
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,819
You worked day and night in our house.

322
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,900
Shut up!

323
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,869
Take it as a reward for your hard work.

324
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,430
You're just a freeloader.

325
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,150
What did you say?

326
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,830
Give it to me.

327
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,470
What did you say?

328
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,110
You're just a freeloader!

329
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,510
Give me back the pendant.

330
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,440
What did you say?

331
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,000
A freeloader.

332
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,740
Give it back!

333
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,920
Give it back!

334
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,830
Let go of me!

335
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,030
Didn't I do any work while I was there?

336
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,650
How dare you call me a freeloader.

337
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,410
Tell me. How am I a freeloader?

338
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,830
You were just a coward.

339
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,430
Who got the severance pay back for you?

340
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,700
I used to be a coward,

341
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,000
but I'm not afraid of anything now.

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,470
I'm not afraid of you at all!

343
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,770
The more you fear, the more the despicable will cling to you!

344
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,960
Why are you yelling at me?

345
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,920
Let go of me!

346
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,150
Tell me! What do you mean by freeloader?

347
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,060
Did I take advantage

348
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,950
of your family or your mother?

349
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,150
Let go of my daughter!

350
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,870
Wenxiu, get on the horse!

351
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,070
Shoot.

352
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,120
You think I dare not?

353
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,630
This is an old gun.

354
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,510
If it misfires,

355
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,430
I won't be held responsible.

356
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,790
I was going to sell your mother's jade

357
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,000
and take you away from here with the money.

358
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,190
You know I was cheated

359
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,750
of all my money, right?

360
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,510
That was what I thought, really.

361
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,430
After staying in the city for a few days,

362
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,720
I still find the bed easier to sleep in.

363
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,190
That's it.

364
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,790
I kept thinking

365
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,910
there was meaning to be found.

366
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,880
I really wanted to fall in love.

367
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,200
Didn't I tell you

368
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,250
not to meddle with the cordyceps?

369
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,630
You ruined the grassland

370
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,670
for those fake cordyceps.

371
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,040
How will the herders live now?

372
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,030
Why is everyone accusing me of digging for cordyceps?

373
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,340
I didn't do it.

374
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,430
I'm only selling it to willing buyers

375
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,110
so I can afford to feed myself.

376
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,810
What's the problem with that?

377
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,170
We're really from different worlds.

378
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,360
This is for Aybek

379
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,550
and for all my herder friends.

380
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,950
If I find out you're up to no good again,

381
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,190
I'll shoot you.

382

And you guys!

383
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,830
Mom, you're so handsome.

384

Let's go.

385
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,250
There are police on the hill across the road.

386
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,880
Huh.

387
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,680
It seems like both mother and daughter hate you.

388
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,270
Something happened.

389
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,460

The world is bright.

The land is vast.

415

Autumn is here.

416
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,730
Tokan took her kids to school in the county seat.

417
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,640
Sulitan sold half of his sheep and horses.

418

He's moving to the mountain ranch alone.

419
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,780

back to Rainbow Bulake.

And Batay

went to the stable in Burqin.

423
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,950
I never saw him again.

424
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,930
Can you go back by yourself?

425
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,250
Why not?

426
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,070
I normally manage the store on my own.

427
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,990
Don't worry.

428
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,850
Grandma and the goods have returned to the village.

429

I'm more worried about you.

430
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,250
Your arms and legs are still weak.

It's nothing serious.

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,030
I just want to apologize to him.

If it weren't for me,

Snowshoe wouldn't have died.

Nonsense.

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,990
What happened to Snowshoe was an accident.

438
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,130
It's not your fault.

439
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,320
Understand?

440
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,380
Then why won't Batay come back?

441
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,540
Why won't he see me?

442
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,510
He needs to go back to the stable

443
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,790
and account for Snowshow's matter,

444
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,050
doesn't he?

445
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,060
Boss.

446
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,290
This girl is looking for Batay.

447
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,990
Go.

00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,680

449
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,830
Come with me.

450
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,840
This is Batay's dormitory.

451
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,940
Sulitan has paid off the money.

452
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,220
But the contract between Batay and me

453
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,650
is not over yet.

454
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,650
He went to Qingdao to study.

455
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,490
When he comes back,

456
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,860
I'll tell you.

457
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,000
How much did Snowshoe cost?

458
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,630
I also have the responsibility to work and pay.

459
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,870
You know it's not about money.

460
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,890
It's about Batay's feelings.

461
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,920
Snowshoe was not

462
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,990
just any horse to him.

463
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,800
Xiu.

464
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,820
Do you know why

465
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,610
herders must move ranches

466
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,070
even though Naren summer ranch is so good?

467
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,890
Because they have to give the summer ranch

468
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,420
time to rest,

469
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,710
so that the water and grass in the ranch

470
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,430
can flourish again.

471
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,660
This way, when next summer comes,

472
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,710
the herders can bring their livestock

473
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,290
back to a better ranch.

474
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,240
Give him some time.

I traveled around.
