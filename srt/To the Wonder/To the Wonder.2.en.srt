00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,020
Are you going home or not?

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,370
No. Give me money. I want to buy eggs.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,110
If you sign the divorce agreement with me,

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,610
I'll give you the money. Let's go.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,300
Why do you want a divorce?

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,900
I didn't beat you or scold you.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,660
I want a divorce, and I'm taking the kids with me.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,670
Let's go!

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,790
Why are you taking the kids with you?

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,640
I didn't scold or beat them.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,110
Zhang Fengxia, tell him

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,350
to go home with me.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,280
Your eggs. I don't want your money.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,710
Stop drinking. I'm closing.

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,950
Let's go back.

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,510
Zhang Fengxia, Don't close yet.

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,190
Just put it on my tab.

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,790
Give me another crate of wine.

20
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,420
You have too many unpaid tabs. I can't accept any more.

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,230
I'm going to bed.

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,630
Let's go.

23
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,950
Go.

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,610
Murat, stop drinking. I'm closing the door.

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,580
Zhang Fengxia.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,620
You might not be able to come back later.
There's a snowstorm today.

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,940
When I come back,

28
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,070
I might drive my

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,750
motorcycle over.

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,030
You'd better ride a horse.

31
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,110
If you drive now, it'd be considered drunk driving.

32
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,240
They'll arrest you.

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,340
I'm the king of the snowfield. I'm not afraid.

34
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,840
You might as well freeze to death outside.

35
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,220
I can live without you anyway.

It's 9 o'clock! Wake up!

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,980
This one?

40
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,620
A bird cigarette! A bird.

41
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,670
This one?

42
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,770
How about this?

43
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,990
Bird cigarette.

44
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,900
Red cigarette, blue cigarette.

45
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,360
Bird cigarette.

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,660

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,870

This one?

49
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,550
This one?

50
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,670
No firecrackers.

51
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,530
We don't have firecrackers here.

52
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,510
Hello.

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,350
Hello.

6.50 yuan, put it on her tab.

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,470
This is Boom Boom?

57
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,810
6.50 yuan.

58
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,120
What's her name? Mom, what's her name?

59
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,209
Well, what's your name?

60
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,640
Come and catch me.

61
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,230
80 cents for instant noodles, and 1.20 yuan for a lighter.

62
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,200
Gao Yong.

63
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,070
Gao Yong, aren't you going to school?

64
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,580
It hurts!

65
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,950
The midterm exam is coming.

66
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,830
I'll teach you a lesson if you don't do well.

67
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,790
That school is not good anyway.

68
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,870
That's a top-ranked middle school. What's not good about it?

69
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,750
But I don't understand

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,990
what the teacher is saying at all.

71
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,270
Can't I go to another school?

72
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,910
No.

73
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,920
We have our own principles.

74
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,550
We must attend a top-ranked middle school.

75
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,760
Are you Zhang Fengxia's daughter?

76
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,080
What kind of fabric is your jacket made of?

77
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,270
It's so soft.

78
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,650
This is polyester fiber.

79
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,030
What is it?

80
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,710
It's polyester fiber and artificial cotton.

81
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,660
It's plastic, basically.

82
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,390
Plastic?

83
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,830
Yes, plastic.

84
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,380
I know plastic.

85
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,610
How many eggs are there today?

86
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,430
Grandpa. Uncle.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,050
Grandpa! Uncle!

88
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,420
Kid.

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,210
Why aren't you going to school?

90
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,900
Look at the time.

91
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,390
Let's go to school.

92
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,100
We're going to school.

93
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,870
Be careful.

94
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,820
Okay.

95
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,260
I'm going!

96
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,130
Sulitan, you're back.

97
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,950
Remember to take me with you to the summer ranch.

98
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,670
Okay.

99
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,770
You even understand that?

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,420
Why not?

101
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,780
That's Batay,

102
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,790
the youngest son of Sulitan.

103
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,460
I saw him at his brother's funeral.

104
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,980
You're shifting camp with Sulitan?

105
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,150
Aren't you afraid?

106
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,300
What's there to be afraid of?

107
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,570
Sulitan once killed five wolves by himself.

108
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,040
I also heard that...

109
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,420
he killed someone before.

110
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,470
Really?

111
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,020
That's what they all say.

112
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,670
Sulitan has a gun.

113
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,460
If anyone pisses him off,

114
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,550
bang!

115
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,750
But Sulitan is the only one who takes

116
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,670
the Fairy Cove trail to the ranch.

117
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,800
The Fairy Cove trail is on the Gobi Desert.

118
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,360
People usually take the long way around.

119
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,460
Only he dares to take that trail.

120
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,750
Then why must you take the Fairy Cove trail?

121
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,270
Can't you take the highway?

122
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,870
Five bottles of beer, right?

123
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm not telling you.

124
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,570
Oh, come on.

125
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,550
Let me give you an idea.

126
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,580
The village chief hasn't left yet.

127
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,440
Let the village chief go with you.

128
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,980
The village chief is a cadre, a civil servant.

129
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,700
If the three families leave together,

130
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,130
Sulitan can't kill you.

131
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,300
I'm such a kind and beautiful woman.

132
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,430
Why would he kill me?

133
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,580
It's not about your kindness,

134
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,220
you know?

135
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,550
Be careful with the eggs. Don't break them.

136
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,230
I'm leaving.

137
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,660
Go.

138
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,190
Mom.

139
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,150
You are so rich.

140
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,070
I calculated it for you.

141
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,540
If you get all your debts back,

142
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,520
you'll get at least 3 to 4,000 yuan.

143
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,340
But no one is paying me back.

144
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,360
Let's discuss something.

145
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,620
Go ahead.

146
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,590
I'll help you collect the debt.

147
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,510
If I get 1,000 back, lend me 500.

148
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,510
If I get 2,000 back, lend me 1,000.

149
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,980
Then, I won't go to the summer ranch with you.

150
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,710
I'll find a place in the county to do some writing.

151
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,110
Don't talk about lending or borrowing.

152
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,750
It's not like you'll really pay me back.

153
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,380
Would I refuse if you asked me for money?

154
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,300
That won't do. I'm very independent now.

155
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
I want to earn and spend my own money.

156
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,150
You'll go house-to-house to collect the debt?

157
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,070
Now?

158
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,470
Not today.

159
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,350
The 5th Husbandry Brigade is coming today.

160
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm looking forward to this deal today.

161
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,270
I can't leave today.

162
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,500
I'll go.

163
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,300
I'll work for you.

164
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,030
You'll go?

165
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,670
Let's discuss something.

166
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,380
Go ahead.

167
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,750
Don't cry if you can't get any money back.

168
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,070
I won't cry.

169
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,220
I must work hard

170
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,559
and be a useful person.

171
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,669
Okay, go ahead.

172
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,670
Hello.

173
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,100
Hello.

174
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,980
Hello.

175
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,410
I'm here for the payment.

176
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,470
I...

177
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,430
I'm here to collect money.

178
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,530
Hello, I'm here to collect the payment.

179
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,550
Didn't you buy a bottle of wine this morning?

180
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,310
Boom Boom.

181
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,920
From that provision store.

182
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,350
The provision store?

183
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,070
I'm here for the payment.

184
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,990
Here, have a milk curd.

185
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,550
So sour.

186
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,710
Here. Take it.

187
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,310
Ask somewhere else.

188
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,880
It wasn't me. Go over there.

189
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,230
Hello.

190
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,660
Sir.

191
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,100
Do you know where Bear lives?

192
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,140
Kulan.

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,420
Kulan!

194
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,350
Dad!

195
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,140
Daughter, what is she saying?

196
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,190
Hello.

197
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,450
Hello.

198
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,680
Do you know someone called Bear?

199
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,550
Who?

200
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,310
Bear, Ayu.

201
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,380
Dad, she called you a bear.

202
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,060
Ayu.

203
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,870
Did you just call me a bear?

204
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,670
Ayu.

205
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,420
This person called me a bear!

206
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,910
Are you Ayu?

207
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,310
Go.

208
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,740
Go!

209
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,540
I'm Ayao, not Ayu!

210
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,270
Go.

211
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,230
Go!

212
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,240
It's biting me!

213
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,490
Come on, Snowshoe.

214
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,750
How about this?

215
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,230
Look. What's wrong with her?

216
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,670
Take both. Two yuan.

217
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,720
What? Did you fall into a ditch?

218
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,620
I told you. Forget it if you can't get the money.

219
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,790
I can do it.

220
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,510
Fine.

221
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,390
Give me another 1.50 yuan.

222
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,790
Okay.

223
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,630
Where did you go?

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,470
I went to collect payments.

225
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,510
125.

226
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,480
And this, and this.

227
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,150
This is the government's rule.

228
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,670
You need a license to own a gun.

229
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,870
Enough.

230
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,230
I haven't used it in years.

231
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,590
First, we can't raise eagles anymore,

232
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,760
and now they're confiscating our hunting rifles.

233
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,590
What kind of hunter am I?

234
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,750
There are no hunters now.

235
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,190
Times have changed.

236
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,110
The wild animals are all under protection now.

237
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,310
Don't break the law and just herd your livestock.

238
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,910
What if I run into a wolf when I'm herding them?

239
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,390
Uncle.

240
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,050
Uncle, let's talk.

241
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,460
Can't we raise horses on the ranch?

242
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,620
Why must we keep them in a stable?

243
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,360
Our horses are for professional competitions.

244
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,470
They are specially bred, fed, and trained.

245
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,620
It's a breed produced by mating Yili horses with British horses.

246
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,870
They can win top prizes at competitions.

247
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,080
They are very promising.

248
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,540
Your name, Bakhetbek,

249
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,950
was my idea.

250
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,360
Yes, Uncle Bek. You're a poet.

251
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,950
Bakhetbek means a happy person.

252
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,300
Batay.

253
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,110
We may be the last group of

254
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,830
authentic herders in the world.

255
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,710
The nomadic life will likely

256
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,030
disappear in the next generation.

257
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,790
To me and your dad,

258
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,870
whether being a nomad

259
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,620
or staying in a city is happier,

260
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,990
it depends on the person.

261
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,870
Uncle Bek.

262
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,030
I'm not afraid of hardships.

263
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,470
I like being a nomad.

264
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,190
But I have to keep my word.

265
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,650
My contract with the stable is not over yet.

266
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,550
I just think my dad

267
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,010
can't take care of so many cows and sheep now.

268
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,660
But the cows and sheep

269
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,380
are too thin to be sold.

270
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,490
That's why I came back to help.

271
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,350
Please talk to my dad for me.

272
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,590
You're right, Batay.

273
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,180
Let me think about it.

274
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,710
Let's talk after summer.

275
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,620
Fine.

276
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,800
Aren't you eating?

277
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,340
I won't eat unless I get the money.

278
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,510
You're quite ambitious.

279
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,420
Very good, Li Wenxiu.

280
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,630
This means you'll be in for some dogshit...

281
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,830
horseshit luck soon.

282
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,020
Ma'am.

283
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,760
Don't call me that. You may not be younger than me.

284
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,260
Oh, then. Miss, I have a question.

285
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,790
Do you know where the villagers are?

286
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,400
Everyone went to the ranch.

287
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,550
Ma'am, Kazakhs are herders.

288
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,950
During this season,

289
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,630
most people will move to the ranch.

290
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,890
This fixed camp is for spring and autumn.

291
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,490
Now,

292
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,230
aside from Sulitan's family which is holding an anniversary ceremony,

293
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,750
and Aybek's family which is expecting a foal,

294
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,880
only two widowed shopowners are left.

295
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,270
Your mother and me.

296
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,790
Then, Miss,

297
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,359
please take a look.

298
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,890
Is Sulitan's name here?

299
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
Or any of his family members' names?

300
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,420
Murat owed so much money?

301
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,750
He was Sulitan's son.

302
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,150
Sulitan

303
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,750
used to be a very powerful old hunter in this area.

304
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,930
I heard he killed people and went to jail before.

305
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,740
Really?

306
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,540
I'm just kidding. You should have seen your face.

307
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,020
Their house is just across the river.

308
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,260
You'll see it once you cross the river.

309
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,030
Okay.

310
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,770
Ma Chunhan.

311
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,790
What's wrong?

312
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,780
I don't owe her money.

313
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,390
She can't frame me like this.

314
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,420
I don't drink or owe her money.

315
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,370
She said she doesn't owe you money.

316
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,530
You can't say that about her.

317
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,830
I didn't buy wine. I don't owe you.

318
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,590
All right.

319
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,980
It's okay. Forget it.

320
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,590
Forget it. It's not much.

321
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,190
I didn't buy any wine. I don't owe her anything.

322
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,950
May the dead rest in peace.

323
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:23,670
May the living live a good life.

324
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,390
I get angry when I see his hair.

325
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,190
I really want to cut it.

326
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,860
Go, kid.

327
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,060
It's been a year since Murat passed away.

328
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,400
Batay is back too.

329
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,800
After today, I want to find a time

330
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,060
to invite you two to my house as witnesses

331
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,480
and take care of some family matters.

332
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,560
I heard

333
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,580
Murat's wife has some thoughts on her mind.

334
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,560
You have to deal with it properly.

335
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,940
Is she still angry?

336
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,340
It happened so suddenly.

337
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,840
I still can't accept it right now.

338
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,630
I heard he died from drinking at the provision store.

339
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,730
Zhang Fengxia is selling wine.

340
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,810
I can't kick her out either.

341
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,800
Excuse me.

342
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,690
Can you speak Mandarin?

343
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,460
What's wrong?

344
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,470
You can speak Mandarin?

345
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,930
I'm the village chief.

346
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,950
I'm a cadre.

347
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,230
Hello, Chief.

348
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,780
I'm looking for Murat.

349
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,820
You're looking for Murat?

350
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,380
Why are you looking for him?

351
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,130
I’m from the provision store.

352
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,960
You're Zhang Fengxia's daughter?

353
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,700
You're Zhang Fengxia and Li San's daughter.

354
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,700
You know my father?

355
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,320
Your father and mother used to work here.

356
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,480
Later, they moved to Fuyun County.

357
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,700
You were born in Fuyun County, right?

358
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,830
Here, child.

359
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,390
Come in.

360
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,510
Come in.

361
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,030
Come in.

362
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,110
Come in. Have a seat.

363
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,740
You should call him.

364
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,740
The phone bill is expensive.

365
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,510
Milk tea.

366
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,460
100 yuan for milk tea.

367
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,880
20 yuan for the belt.

368
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,990
1.30 yuan for this white thing.

369
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,740
Condoms, 5.5 yuan.

370
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Owed by Tokan.

371
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,720
What?

372
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,270
What are you talking about? Go out.

373
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,870
Go to that room.

374
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,620
Let's go.

375
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,350
Tokan.

376
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,500
Come in.

377
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,310
This is embarrassing.

378
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,790
You're still young. Why did you use that?

379
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,790
A child created when drunk will be a fool.

380
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,230
You're here to ask Murat for payment?

381
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,350
Yes. Murat owed us a lot of money.

382
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,620
Murat owed the provision store a lot of money.

383
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,710
What?

384
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,310
How much did he owe you?

385
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,150
He owed us

386
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,710
2,319.60 yuan in total.

387
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,470
He owed more than 2,000 yuan, Sulitan.

388
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,310
So much?

389
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,840
How did he owe so much money?

390
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,950
He owed so much money.

391
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,480
How did he owe so much money?

392
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,910
He drank and didn't pay.

393
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,450
Sulitan, what's the meaning of this?

394
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,830
It's been a year.

395
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,110
Why didn't you pay the debt and let the deceased rest in peace?

396
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,510
I didn't know about this.

397
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,470
Tokan.

398
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,040
How can you not know that he owed so much money?

399
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,150
Why didn't you pay the debt before the funeral?

400
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,700
It's been a year, and he couldn't rest in peace because of this.

401
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,070
I don't have the money.

402
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,970
Where will I get the money?

403
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,870
Give it to me. Look.

404
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,630
Look.

405
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,070
Look at it.

406
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,190
Look at how much he drank.

407
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,720
It's alright, let's talk it over peacefully.

408
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,990
Look at the ledger. Pay the money.

409
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,470
You owe so much.

410
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,430
It's okay. It's fine.

411
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,390
You should've paid it back last year.

412
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,990
It's been a year. If you don't pay, he can't rest in peace.

413
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,700
It's my fault.

414
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,230
I shouldn't have come to ask for payment now.

415
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,790
Stop arguing.

416
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,150
Come here.

417
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,950
This is Janar.

418
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,270
This is Jangber.

419
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,320
Janar didn't owe any money.

420
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,260
You told the whole village that Janar owed money.

421
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,700
It was very embarrassing for her.

422
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,030
Janar is very sad.

423
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,070
Besides, Jangber doesn't owe us money either.

424
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,750
I'm selling Jangber's embroidery in the county seat.

425
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,990
That's why Jangber's purchases

426
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,190
are always on the tab.

427
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,790
We settle the payment once a month,

428
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,500
right?

429
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,910
Yes.

430
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,540
Come on, apologize to Janar. Hurry up.

431
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,310
Bow.

432
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,740
I'm sorry, Janar.

433
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,750
I mistook you for someone else.

434
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,030
Sorry for the trouble.

435
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,630
So, it's practically impossible to ask the villagers for payment.

436
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,410
Your records are just for show.

437
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,610
Zhang Fengxia!

438
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,670
Did you call me a bear?

439
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,260
I'm sorry.

440
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,900
Ayao, it was a joke.

441
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,750
My daughter and I will apologize to you. Come here.

442
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,830
Dear Comrade Ayao,

443
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,950
we apologize. Sorry.

444
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,470
We didn't mean it.

445
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,430
It was a joke.

446
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,550
Dad, they are apologizing to you.

447
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,310
There's no use apologizing.

448
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,670
I can't pay you back now.

449
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,030
Didn't I tell you?

450
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,810
I'll pay you back when I sell sheep in the autumn.

451
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,870
I'll listen to you.

452
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,310
You are the creditor. You have the final say.

453
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,790
Fine.

454
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,070
Fine.

455
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,620
Zhang Fengxia.

456
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,390
Chief.

457
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,220
I heard you're going to the summer ranch.

458
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,510
The ground there is difficult to walk on.

459
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,760
I've bought a tent.

460
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,920
The summer ranch has its perks.

461
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,210
But cars can't enter the area.

462
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,910
Do you have a horse?

463
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,550
No.

464
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,540
How about camels?

465
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,390
We don't ride that.

466
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,560
Zhang Fengxia, come here.

467
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,340
Tell me the truth.

468
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,750
Did Murat drink at your place

469
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,030
and die from drinking?

470
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,580
There was something wrong with the way Sulitan looked at me.

471
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,830
You're in big trouble.

472
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,240
Listen, Chief.

473
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,800
It's not easy for me to do some small business.

474
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,990
I dared not ask him for money

475
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,470
after Murat's death.

476
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,920
You should have asked for it earlier.

477
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,670
Forget it.

478
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,470
By the way, Chief, let me ask you something.

479
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,060
Do you take the Fairy Cove trail to the summer ranch?

480
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,340
Only Sulitan

481
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,540
still takes such an old path.

482
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,350
We offended Sulitan.

483
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,080
You can't leave us behind.

484
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,220
Okay? Keep your promise.

485
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,350
Bye.

486
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,190
Bye.

487
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,150
Mom, that old man is so scary.

488
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,350
Don't look at him.

489
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,500
Hello.

490
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,260
Don't let them go. Stop them.

491
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,580
Okay.

492
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,750
Hurry!

493
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,630
Run!

494
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,910
He's coming! Run!

495
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,550
He's coming!

496
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,950
Hurry up!

497
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,460
Run over there!

498
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,070
What are you doing?

499
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,740
Can't you talk nicely?

500
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,990
It's just a few thousand yuan.

501
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,950
You plan to kill someone for that?

502
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,550
It's not the child's fault

503
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,500
for asking for payment.

504
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,030
She didn't do it on purpose.

505
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,910
Murat was your brother, right?

506
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,820
He always owed me money.

507
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,110
I refused to sell him wine so many times.

508
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,870
He asked Tokan to pay on credit.

509
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,330
He was drunk and froze to death on the street.

510
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,380
Why are you blaming others?

511
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,960
Let me tell you.

512
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,700
About your brother,

513
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,220
we're very upset too.

514
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,810
I felt too bad to ask for the money in the past year.

515
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,620
Right?

516
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,040
It's all my fault.

517
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,950
I ruined it.

518
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,800
I made you lose face.

519
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,460
But I didn't know the kid

520
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,470
knew how to read the words for "condoms."

521
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,400
What did you say?

522
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,140
That little boy can read.

523
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,100
You're really good

524
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,710
at embarrassing yourself.

525
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,400
Let me tell you...

526
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,670
There's no point talking to him.

527
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,750
Look at his simple-minded

528
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,210
and muscular appearance.

529
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,280
Let's go to the village chief.

530
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,410
He can understand Mandarin. Let's go.

531
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,390
I understand.

532
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,190
I stopped you because

533
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,940
we don't have that much cash at home right now.

534
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,010
My dad said

535
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,240
we'll pay with this camel instead.

536
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,470
It's only right to pay the debt.

537
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,140
We don't have cash.

538
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,150
We'll use this camel to pay the debt.

539
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,230
This camel

540
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,090
is worth way more than 2,000 yuan.

541
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,740
How about this?

542
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,120
Lend us the camel for now.

543
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,590
We'll return the camel when

544
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,120
you have the money to pay us.

545
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,230
Let's go.

546
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,330
Okay.

547
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,870
Bye.

548
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,460
Those arrows almost scared me to death.

549
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,140
My legs were shaking.

550
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,230
That scared me. They said he had killed someone before.

551
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,850
But let me tell you,

552
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,880
he may look fierce,

553
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,010
but he seems to be a decent guy.

554
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,890
Mom.

555
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,380
Does this count as getting payment for you?

556
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,750
Of course.

557
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,350
Great.

558
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,510
See? Although I'm clumsy,

559
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,520
I'm still useful, right?

560
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,020
Li Wenxiu, what do you mean by "useful"?

561
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,190
Did I give birth to you so you can serve others?

562
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,110
Look at the trees and grass on the grassland.

563
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,500
They are called useful if people eat and use them.

564
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,730
But if no one uses them,

565
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,790
it's perfectly fine for them to simply exist in the grassland.

566
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,070
They are free, aren't they?

567
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,350
It's great that we have a camel now.

568
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,420
We can use it to carry goods to the summer ranch.

569
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,540
Come on.

570
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,420
Let's go.

571
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,590
Let's go.

572
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,470
Let's go.

573
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,350
The sparse community in the remote mountains

574
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,530
may seem far from the modern order of civilization,

575
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,960
but it actually has its own spiritual constraints.

576
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,340
The constraints imposed

577
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,260
by the instinctive mutual needs

578
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,150
between individuals

579
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,830
and between humans and nature

580
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,120
are limited, but sufficient.

581
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,790
Granddaughter.

582
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,680
Granddaughter.

583
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,860
Here.

584
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,110
Grandma.

585
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,190
You can recognize me?

586
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,560
Grandma.

587
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,490
You're my granddaughter.

588
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,620
Of course I recognize you.

589
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,610
Where did you get this?

590
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,950
I saved it myself.

591
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,420
Do you need money?

592
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,020
Take it.

593
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,720
Your mom doesn't know.

594
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,940
My mom might confiscate it from you.

595
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,550
You can't let your mom know.

596
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,980
Then hide it.

597
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,870
Grandma, I don't need money.

598
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,670
I'm not going anywhere.

599
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,600
I'm going to the summer ranch with my mom.

600
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,770
Why?

601
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,580
I think

602
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,410
this place is pretty good too.

603
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,010
Although I'm tired today,

604
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,920
it's tiring working in the city every day too.

605
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,710
But I've never been as happy as today.

606
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,300
Grandma,

607
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,310
I think I can write good essays.

608
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,630
Okay, as long as you like it.

609
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,580
Don't let your mom scare you.

610
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,540
Your mother is just harsh with her words.

611
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,110
But she has a very kind heart.

612
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,070
Why are there so many cracks in the ceiling?

613
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,350
You're right.

614
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,350
Look at that one with chipped layers.

615
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,949
That one?

616
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,389
Doesn't it look like

617
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,900
the small river in front of our hometown?

618
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,190
I've never been to my hometown.

619
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,470
Neither have I seen the small river in my hometown.

620
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,090
Grandma, where do you think I'm from?

621
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,260
Well, I'm from Shenyang.

622
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,070
Your mother is from Jiangsu.

623
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,700
As for you...

624
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,190
Am I from Xinjiang?

625
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,170
Have a foot bath.

626
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,580
You're cuddling?

627
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,700
We are close.

628
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,930
Your mind's not muddled now?

629
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,870
It's not muddled when my granddaughter is here.

630
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,860
I want to cuddle too!

631
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,220
Mom, the bed is collapsing!
