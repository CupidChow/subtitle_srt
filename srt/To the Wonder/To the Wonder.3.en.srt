This is a public phone.

I brought it out. It's mobile.

It's a Kazakh black soap made of herbs.

Tell me about the village.

173
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,630
I heard that

174
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,340
Tokan is discussing her remarriage with Murat's family.

175
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,300
You guys

176
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
It's the spirit of Hatong;

177
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,720
we communicate and look out for each other.

178
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,570
Greetings, Mr. Liu.

179
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,070
Not long ago,

180
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,450
I attended your lecture in Ürümqi.

181
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,690
I learned a lot.

182
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,850
According to your suggestion,

183
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,210
which is to record my daily life,

184
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,480
I tried writing some essays.

185
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,890
After thinking about it,

186
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:20,610
[Gaoyuan Publishing House]

187
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,290
I picked the two best entries

188
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,440
and sent them to you.

189
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,190
I hope to receive your feedback.

190
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,720
[Recycling]

191
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,060
I look forward to your reply.

192
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,160
Here. Your wastepaper sold for 5 yuan.

193
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,710
Don't call it wastepaper.

194
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,990
That was all the newspaper pages

195
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,720
I've published over the years.

196
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,330
There were 7 headlines.

197
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,950
How could you call them wastepaper?

198
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,550
One yuan per kg.

199
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,600
I sold 4.8 kg.

He gave me 20 cents more.

201
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,530
5 yuan in total.

202
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,760
Look at you.

203
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,530
Don't get carried away.

204
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,300
Our weekly magazine did worse.

205
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,610
Coated paper only sells for 30 cents per kg.

206
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,980
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,560
I promised to start over after I quit.

208
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,380
I'll reflect on myself.

209
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,660
I'm still extremely bothered.

210
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,580
I know.

211
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,710
I'm insignificant.

212
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,220
I'm worthless.

213
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,990
I've wasted my life in this world.

214
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,070
I'm nothing.

215
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,210
But I feel awful.

216
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,690
I have to frame this five-yuan note.

217
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,060
This is proof of my years of experience.

218
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
What are you looking at, Liu?

219
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,240
A young lady

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,470
attended my lecture.

221
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,460
She sent me some essays she wrote.

222
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,670
How is it?

223
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,230
I'll send it to you.

224
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,770
Uncle, where's my grandma?

225
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,140
She was here just now. Where did she go?

226
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,720
How do I get to Shenyang?

227
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,180
I want to go to Shenyang.

228
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,250
How do I get to Shenyang?

229
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,870
I want to go to Shenyang.

230
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,250
Grandma.

231
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,850
Grandma.

232
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,490
Have you seen an old lady?

233
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,370
I want to go back to Shenyang.

234
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,140
I want to go home.

235
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,090
Grandma.

236
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,500
Mom!

237
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,680
Grandma is missing.

238
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,970
Grandma is missing.

239
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,390
She was sitting here just now.

240
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,310
I went to the internet cafe, and she disappeared when I came back.

241
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,340
How long has she been missing?

242
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,290
Around 20 to 30 minutes.

243
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,810
Let me sober up first.

244
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,300
What should I do?

245
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Your grandma is so old. She can't go far.

246
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,730
Find her now.

247
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,720
Grandma.

248
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,310
Grandma.

249
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,650
Comrade,

250
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,700
How do I get to Shenyang?

251
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,410
Grandma!

252
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,950
Grandma!

253
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,110
Who are you?

254
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,070
Who are you?

255
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,750
Stay away from me!

256
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,470
-Who are you?
-I'm Wenxiu.

257
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,010
I'm your granddaughter.

258
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,460
Stay away from me!

259
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,360
Let go of me!

260
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,020
Don't...

261
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,640
Give it to me.

262
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,160
Mom.

263
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,910
Give it to me.

264
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,550
Mom!

265
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,520
I'll hit you.

266
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,740
We're leaving for Shenyang.

267
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,080
The car is leaving for Shenyang.

268
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,890
Is anyone boarding the car?

269
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,240
Anyone going to Shenyang?

270
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
Comrade,

271
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,420
are you going to Shenyang?

272
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,330
Yes, to Shenyang. Are you going?

273
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,190
Is the ticket expensive?

274
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,070
The ticket is usually quite expensive.

275
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,150
But it's free for the elderly.

276
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,460
Are you 70?

277
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm not 70.

278
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm only 35.

279
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,100
You're only 35?

280
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,660
I'll apply for half price for you. Are you coming?

281
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,220
Yes, yes.

282
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,180
Let's go. Get in.

283
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,220
Okay.

284
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,620
Hurry up. We're leaving soon.

285
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,650
Thank you.

286
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,090
We're heading to Shenyang.

287
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,880
We'll depart soon. Let's go.

288
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,200
I don't need your help.

289
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,190
I'm going back to Shenyang.

290
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,320
The writing is simple,

291
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,870
and she's naturally good at wording and phrasing.

292
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,300
She's a genius.

293
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,180
I want to find this person

294
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,760
and meet her.

295
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,030
Let's reply to the email first.

296
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,830
There's a contact number here.

297
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,830
Let me make a call.

298
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,680
Shenyang, my hometown.

299
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,050
Comrade, how much is the half-price ticket?

300
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,600
50 yuan.

301
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,960
Here.

302
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,870
I should have asked for more.

303
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,810
Mom.

304
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,750
Mom.

305
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,710
I didn't take good care of Grandma.

307
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,640
No need to apologize for that.

308
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,240
I always lose her somewhere.

309
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,430
It's fine as long as we find her again.

310
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,220
What were you doing at the internet cafe?

311
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,840
I went to submit my work.

312
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,730
Did your work get selected?

313
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,260
The result is not that fast.

314
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,640
They'll call me if my work gets selected.

315
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,340
Is this usable at the summer ranch?

316
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,520
It needs to be charged regularly.

317
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,500
The summer ranch has no electricity. How can we use it there?

318
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,740
Zhang Fengxia.

319
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,310
Zhang Fengxia.

320
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,110
Moving to another ranch, Bater?

321
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,000
I heard Tokan is going to remarry.

322
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,970
Is that true?

323
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,870
Don't ask me. I don't know.

324
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,310
Where's your spirit of Hatong?
We communicate and look out for each other.

325
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,430
Tell me, did he die in your shop?

326
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,470
Who said that?

327
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,620
But she is demanding a remarriage.

328
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,480
You're quite sober now.

329
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,100
Murat should have inherited the family business,

330
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,120
but he passed away.

331
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,830
He left his wife and two children.

332
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,070
There is also Batay, Sulitan's younger son.

333
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,560
I called you all here today

334
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,839
because there are things we need to discuss

335
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,210
after the death anniversary.

336
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,270
I said before that I didn't want the ranch.

337
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,760
My stance hasn't changed.

338
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,619
I'm just here to help for the summer.

339
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:31,290
I'll go back to the stable after summer.

340
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,490
In-law.

341
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,920
What's the matter? Tell me.

342
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,790
Let's talk about it later.

343
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,990
No, tell me now.

344
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,650
Shall we go?

345
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,270
Yes.

346
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,930
Then...

347
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,840
If you won't say it, I'll say it.

348
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,960
Tokan has two children.

349
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,200
Life is hard for her.

350
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,730
According to tradition,

351
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,160
I want Batay to marry Tokan.

352
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,950
No.

353
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,030
This can't be done.

354
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,400
Why not?

355
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,550
Aren't Yerdana and Nadyra

356
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,950
this family's children?

357
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,550
This is different from marriage.

358
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,570
Would you rather Tokan take the kids

359
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,380
and go to someone else's house?

360
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,750
Can't you take care of them?

361
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:41,930
If you keep talking about this, I'll go back to the stable tonight.

362
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,930
In-law,

363
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,440
this depends on the two kids.

364
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,230
If Batay doesn't want to,

365
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,480
you can't force him.

366
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:56,060
Besides, we need to ask what Tokan thinks.

367
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,540
Couldn't you have talked about it later?

368
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,590
Last time, you told me to wait until the death anniversary was over.

369
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,170
But it's over now.

370
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,390
Any later,

371
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,280
I might never get to remarry.

372
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,050
Don't say it out loud. It's so embarrassing.

373
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,170
Sister, look at her. Look at her.

374
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,140
No one in our family has ever remarried.

375
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,860
You're embarrassing us.

376
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,700
It's so embarrassing.

377
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,840
This is more embarrassing

378
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,860
than having a beggar in the family.

379
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,060
No, I want to remarry.

380
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,630
It's embarrassing for others to hear it.

381
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,850
I want to take my kids with me and remarry.

382
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,610
Murat had long agreed to divorce me.

383
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,780
I've been waiting for a long time.

384
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,800
What's wrong with you?

385
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,340
You can ask Zhang Fengxia if you don't believe me.

386
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,410
She can remarry,

387
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,240
but the kids have to stay.

388
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,590
The kids belong to this family.

389
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,280
What a disgrace.

390
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,630
Talk to her.

391
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,890
She won't listen to us.

392
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,600
Sister-in-law.

393
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,900
What is it?

394
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,610
No one in this family can convince me to leave my kids behind.

395
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,930
Got it?

396
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,120
How about this?

397
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,150
If my brother really said that,

398
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,750
our family would keep his word.

399
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
Is it up to you?

400
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,880
Father-in-law has the final say.

401
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,680
As long as my brother had said it,

402
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,250
I'll convince my dad for you.

403
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,050
Go if you want.

404
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,920
Men can go wherever they want.

405
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,870
We women need to cook, wash clothes,

406
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,240
and take care of the kids.

407
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,890
I don't even have time to go out.

408
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,350
Mom, Mom, don't cry.

409
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,300
I told your brother many times,

410
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,610
to go to the provision store

411
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,860
and buy me a washboard.

412
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,160
He never brought it back up till he died.

413
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,900
Get out. I'm going to cook.

414
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,430
Take these away.

415
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,430
Hello?

416
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,510
[Take things yourself. Put the money here.]

417
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,050
Batay! Batay!

418
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:53,180
My horse is having a hard time giving birth. Help!

419
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,970
Push harder. It's stuck.

420
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,620
Harder.

421
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,550
Hold its head in place.

422
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,550
Okay, okay. Harder.

423
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,620
That's it.

424
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,270
You're finally out, baby.

425
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,790
Great!

426
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,430
Batay.

427
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,040
Let's go inside and have some tea.

428
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,600
Okay.

429
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,630
Uncle Bek.

430
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,530
Didn't the auntie at the provision store leave early in the morning?

431
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,070
Why isn't she back yet?

432
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,960
You want to ask Zhang Fengxia about your brother?

433
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,140
Yes.

434
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,720
Are people from the south always so slow when they shop?

435
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,810
Maybe it has nothing to do with that,

436
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,360
and more to do with the fact that they are women.

437
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,010
Oh, uncle.

438
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,030
[Slow down]

439
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,050
It's my turn.

440
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,880
Bomb!

441
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,990
Anymore?

442
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Come on.

443
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,750
Young lady, please pay up.

444
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,480
1 yuan.

445
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,360
Hurry.

446
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,780
My money!

447
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,430
There are cards here.

448
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,230
Sister Ma, how are you?

449
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,270
Bater!

450
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,950
Didn't you move to the other ranch already?

451
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,010
I'll go after a bowl of laghman.

452
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,160
Who is that?

453
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,440
Sulitan's younger son, Batay.

454
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,300
How much?

455
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,220
20 yuan in total.

456
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,760
Here, 20.

457
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,800
Okay.

458
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,070
Mom.

459
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,720
Can we buy a hamster?

460
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
Don't we have enough rats at home? You want to buy more?

461
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,420
How about this one?

462
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,800
How long will this take to grow up?

463
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,450
This is a dwarf rabbit.

464
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,780
It won't grow up, so it's always this cute.

465
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,420
That means it won't be enough for a dish even after 1 year.

466
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,080
Mom, this is a pet.

467
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,910
It's for being cute.

468
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,670
Our camel is cute too.

469
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,330
Let's go.

470
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,680
Gao Yong, is that a cigarette behind your ear?

471
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,160
At least I didn't light it.

472
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,640
What else are you planning to do?

473
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,740
I'll tell your mom. She'll punish you for sure.

474
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,470
Who is Gao Yong?

475
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,020
Listen.

476
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,730
I'm Gao Yong Bek from now on.

477
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,300
These are my Kazakh brothers.

478
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,970
If anyone bullies me,

479
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,000
I'll ask my brothers to teach him a lesson.

480
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,120
He became so arrogant after two days in school.

481
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,060
Look at him.

482
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,300
Walk on your writing-hand side.

483
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,900
Walk on your eating-hand side.

484
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,000
Sir, are you left-handed?

485
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,070
How much are instant noodles?

486
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,680
1 yuan.

487
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:06,980
80 cents.

488
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,590
I'll tell your mom later.

489
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,260
Take it.

490
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,060
Get out of the way.

491
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,710
Grandma, here.

492
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,660
How much is the lighter?

493
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,300
80 cents.

494
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,210
Say it again.

495
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,100
Take your grandma inside.

496
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,530
Okay.

497
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,750
80 cents. 80 cents.

498
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,030
Lady Bai wine.

499
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,510
Lady Bai wine.

500
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,920
Bill, please. 120 right?

501
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,990
Lady Bai wine.

502
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,270
How much is the lighter?

503
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,960
Lady Bai wine.

504
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,120
Are you buying?

505
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,080
Auntie, what's this?

506
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,670
Lady Bai wine.

507
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,230
What food did you bring?

508
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,150
Aren't you the young man with the bow last time?

509
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,740
Take whatever you need.

510
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,500
Which young man?

511
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,970
Why are you looking at him?

512
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,320
Is he edible?

513
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,280
Why don't you cook something?

514
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,600
It's been a day. I'm starving.

515
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,430
Stop looking.

516
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,650
Mom, where is the salt?

517
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,570
The salt is in the sugar jar and the sugar is in the soda ash jar.

518
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,690
Don't touch the salt jar.

519
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,490
There's laundry powder inside.

520
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,760
What is this?

521
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,930
Don't touch this one.

522
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,920
It's not food.

523
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,990
What's inside?

524
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,490
Baking soda.

525
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,930
Ahbozat.

526
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,680
Who?

527
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,670
This is a horse skull, not a human skull.

528
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,430
Of course it's not human.

529
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,850
It was the horse I rode when I was a kid.

530
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,640
It's already like this.

531
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,230
How did you recognize it?

532
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,590
It was a Mongolian horse.

533
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,510
I can tell from its forehead.

534
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,070
It should be hanging on a tree. Why is it at your house instead?

535
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,710
Because I was under the tree that day with a lot of sheep.

536
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,390
It fell into my arms on its own.

537
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,910
I thought it was a human skull.

538
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,770
I was so scared.

539
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,270
What's so scary about it?

540
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,210
Because it's like witchcraft.

541
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,440
What is witchcraft?

542
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,880
Witchcraft is a kind of sorcery.

543
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,500
Do you have any iron wires?

544
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,840
Iron wires...

545
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,910
Yes.

546
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,390
Get the pliers too.

547
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,770
Thank you.

548
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,740
Your pliers.

549
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,640
Don't scare her.

550
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,260
It's okay. I'm not scared.

551
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,790
I mean, don't scare my horse.

552
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,220
Do you want to come up?

553
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,170
Can I come up?

554
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,590
Why not?

555
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,150
Come on.

556
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,540
Here.

557
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,550
Hush.

558
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,200
Keep your voice down.

559
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,330
You'll really scare my horse this way.

560
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,840
This horse is unrideable and cowardly.

561
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,170
How strange.

562
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,010
To the Kazakhs, horses are our best friends.

563
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,270
If a horse dies,

564
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,950
we will miss it.

565
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,880
So we cut its head off

566
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,650
and hang it somewhere we pass by every day.

567
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,660
Some villages put the skulls

568
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,830
in the cracks of rocks.

569
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,750
There are no mountains in our village.

570
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,230
So we hang it here

571
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,510
on the largest tree around.

572
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,120
We can see it when we miss it.

573
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,830
There's no witchcraft,

574
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,530
only nostalgia.

575
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,480
Be careful.

576
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,970
Look, a rainbow.

577
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,470
That's the direction of the river.

578
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,510
There's water vapor in the air.

579
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,190
By the way,

580
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,920
our village is called Saykhan Bulake.

581
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,650
You know that, right?

582
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,930
I know, Rainbow Bulake.

583
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
Saykhan Bulake.

584
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,530
Rainbow?

585
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,400
Saykhan.

586
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,860
Oh, it's not rainbow?

587
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,110
They sound similar, but Saykhan is Mongolian.

588
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,920
It means splendid.

589
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,200
It's not "rainbow" in Mandarin.

590
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,620
What about Bulake?

591
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,930
Bulake means spring water.

592
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,030
I thought

593
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,780
this was a village

594
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,870
where one could always see rainbows.

595
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,580
We do always see rainbows here.

596
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,130
Rainbow

597
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,040
has a nice ring to it.

598
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,690
It's a beautiful misunderstanding.

599
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,800
Well,

600
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,580
what does Ahbozat mean?

601
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,220
Ahbozat

602
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,790
was a white horse.

603
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,210
It was

604
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,390
white like the moon.

605
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,720
What about it?

606
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,550
It's called Snowshoe.

607
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,080
What does it mean?

608
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,230
Look, all four of its hoofs are white.

609
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,030
It's like it just walked out of the snow.

610
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,730
So Snowshoe means exactly that.

611
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,020
Yes.

612
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,310
But

613
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,620
Snowshoe got injured during the previous race.

614
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,780
It wasn't just an injury to its hind leg.

615
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,940
Psychologically, it cannot

616
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,880
handle another shock anymore.

617
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,920
It also hates being ridden.

618
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,440
I hope that by the time summer ends,

619
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,950
it can get better

620
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,130
and return to the arena.

621
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,580
Let's go.

622
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,210
Let's go.

623
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,270
It's so high.

624
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,440
It's okay. Get down.

625
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,430
What's your name?

626
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,760
I'm Bakhetbek.

627
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Call me Batay if you think it's long.

628
00:32:59,210 --> 00:32:59,970
Batay.

629
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,660
What about you?

630
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,160
I'm Li Wenxiu.

631
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,220
They all call me "the girl from the provision store."

632
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,220
I know.

633
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,430
You do?

634
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,450
Yes.

635
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,150
You're famous now.

636
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,360
Aren't you the girl

637
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,440
who lost her grandma?

638
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,670
Is this the spirit of Hatong again?

639
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,870
Yes.

640
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,820
A young man called Bater

641
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,080
ate a bowl of laghman at Ma Chunhan's house.

642
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,790
He told Ma Chunhan about it.

643
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,190
Ma Chunhan told the whole village.

644
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,630
Now everyone in the village knows

645
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,480
that a Han girl

646
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,790
lost her grandma

647
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,670
in the county seat today.

648
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,040
Can't you guys spread some good words instead?

649
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,030
This is our Kazakh tradition.

650
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,220
If Tursenhan wants to remarry,

651
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,840
the kids must stay with the father's family.

652
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,590
But if my brother promised her,

653
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,930
we have to keep our promise.

654
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,150
I'll try to convince my father.

655
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,730
No.

656
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,270
I've never heard such a thing.

657
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,860
Tokan is lying.

658
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,620
What's going on?

659
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,719
Mom.

660
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,739
Murat and Tokan must have spoken in Kazakh.

661
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,989
Maybe they did mention it,

662
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,080
but you didn't understand.

663
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,880
That's right.

664
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,370
Don't you know your brother?

665
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,610
Would he agree to such a thing?

666
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,030
He wouldn't even buy a washboard for your sister-in-law.

667
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,250
Got it.

668
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,650
I'll go back and talk to Tursenhan.

669
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,980
Why is there only one?

670
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,980
Come on, fold the blanket with me.

671
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:55,550
Well,

672
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,200
will Tokan be separated from her kids?

673
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,310
If she doesn't remarry, she won't be separated.

674
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,310
A widow can take care of her kids too.

675
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,580
She's so pitiful. Her kids are so young.

676
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,190
Besides, don't kids always follow their mothers?

677
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,620
They are different.

678
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,440
They have their own way of living

679
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,950
and getting along with the world.

680
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,260
You don't have to agree with them,

681
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,600
but you can't be arrogant

682
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,860
and try to change them.

683
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,220
Aren't you staying here to go to the summer ranch?

684
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,840
If you want to stay here,

685
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,940
don't think you're smarter

686
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,900
just because you're from the city.

687
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,310
So...

688
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,060
I'm really sorry.

689
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,560
After attending your lecture,

690
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,460
I only wrote those essays

691
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,140
on a whim.

692
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,200
My husband found out when I went home.

693
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,400
He was very upset.

694
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,580
Because I promised him

695
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,710
to take care of our family.

696
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,470
We have three children.

697
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,170
My daily life is very busy

698
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,810
and I don't have time for myself.

699
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,490
So, I don't want to affect my children's lives

700
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,020
because of these things.

701
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,580
So...

702
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,950
I stopped writing.

703
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,500
Please reconsider.

704
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,000
You're really talented.

705
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,940
And I know you don't live on writing...

706
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,240
I understand.

707
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,340
Madam.

708
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,440
Virginia Woolf once said,

709
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,750
"A woman must have

710
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,850
a room of her own."

711
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,030
It's time.

712
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,630
I should pick up my kids from school.

713
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,150
You...

714
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,830
Thank you.

715
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,430
You...

716
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,230
Why would someone

717
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,790
not cherish their talent?

718
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,110
Forget it.

719
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,350
Don't force it.

720
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,870
She has made her choice.

721
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,780
Who will pay the bill?

722
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,370
Me.

723
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,180
In the past glory of the headlines I basked.

724
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,050
Not knowing it was now worth 5 yuan when asked.

725
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,000
Liu.

726
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,630
Although I can't write well,

727
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,880
I feel terrible seeing someone

728
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,160
who writes so well

729
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,050
but doesn't cherish it.

730
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,910
Don't be upset.

731
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,430
We're just getting started.

732
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,770
In the future,

733
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,070
there will be more emails

734
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,620
and letters coming our way.

735
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,010
I believe

736
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,090
there must be someone who writes well among them.

737
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,110
Liu.

738
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,510
Cheers!

739
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,210
Okay!

740
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,150
I'm only lending it to you. Remember to return it to me.

741
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,030
Okay.

742
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,290
Here.

743
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,790
Mom.

744
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,150
How's the packing going?
