1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,500
Did you or did you not say that I'd go to my previous husband's company to demand shares and make a commotion?!

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,810
I did! So what?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,540
But why is it you, Ahjumma?

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,160
Are you the previous wife of that company's CEO or something?

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,400
Are you even the previous wife?!

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,330
That's right!

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,440
I am the previous wife of that CEO. What do you want
to do about it?

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,250
Jeong Woo.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,700
You came?
Episode 2

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,480
Over there.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,630
Ae Ra.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,200
Over here.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,700
He's here.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm called Cha Jeong Woo.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,100
Ok, then...

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,730
You've both resolved your misunderstandings.

17
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,790
The treatment cost,

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,460
Na Ae Ra's side has agreed to pay them.

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,540
You've all agreed, right?

20
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,030
Know that your luck is good.

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,810
I'm only enduring this because I'm an intellectual.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,870
Who should be saying that.

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,760
Aigoo, really!

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,130
Shall we start again?

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,010
Since it's all finished now,

26
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,760
you can all return (home).

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,910
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo, too.

28
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,280
Yes.

29
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,030
President.

30
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,400
You divorced well.

31
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,430
Is that really the CEO of D&T Soft Ventures?

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,960
How should I know?

33
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,020
But why didn't he give her alimony?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
Hey.

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,920
(Thanks for) coming, even though you were busy...

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,700
I hope that I never see you again

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,340
for this kind of matter.

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,190
That's the same for me.

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,950
Be careful so that some strange rumor doesn't make the rounds.

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,860
Why?!

41
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,190
Fine.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,800
Let's agree to being cautious of each others' lives.

43
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,420
I should have just gone to jail.

44
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,980
What?

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
It's nothing.

46
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,810
What is it?!

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,370
I...thought she'd be very pretty.

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,410
Your previous wife.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,100
She was pretty.

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,820
Back then, she was considered the Madonna of the Exam Village.

51
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,400
Oppa, why do you eat kimchi stew every day?

52
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,530
Huh?

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,270
You always come alone and eat.

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,620
You must not have any friends.

55
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,210
Because I don't have any friends studying for the
examinations.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,540
You don't even go to law school, do you?

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,370
No.

58
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,040
Science and Engineering.

59
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,150
You came out of a school for Science and Engineering and

60
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,380
are preparing for the bar exam?
(she's confused about the different types of government exams)

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,160
Can you take the examinations even if you graduate for Science and Engineering?

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm preparing for technical examinations.

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,120
Is there something like that?

64
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,380
Well, study diligently.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Then not only was her face pretty, but her heart was pretty, too.

66
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,390
She believed in me more than anyone else, too.

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,310
But after I failed at business, that person completely changed.

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,900
Hey, Honey.

69
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,120
Honey, I am cold.

70
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,200
Your husband will freeze to death.

71
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,700
Honey! (Informal speech)

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,750
Hun~!

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Honey.

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,500
Honey! (using respectful speech)

75
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,840
Hon...

76
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,260
Hon...

77
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,780
That's what happened.

78
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,840
Is that why

79
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,510
you didn't give her any alimony?

80
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,400
What do you mean I didn't?

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,530
She is the one who refused to accept it!

82
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,980
You don't know what she did at the end.

83
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,850
What do you want me to do about the alimony?

84
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,480
Do you even have the money to give?

85
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,450
I put my office out (on the market).

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,200
If I move to the outskirts (of Seoul),
it still won't be much money, but...

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,450
It's fine.

88
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,080
How many cents are you trying to give me?

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,890
I won't take that kind of thing,

90
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,220
so don't contact me using alimony as an excuse.

91
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,280
Just quietly

92
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,290
disappear from my life.

93
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,610
"Quietly disappear from my life."

94
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,700
I should have said that earlier.

95
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,590
Now that I hear your story,

96
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,690
I'm really becoming afraid to get married.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Oh, but your previous wife,

98
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,750
she saw how you looked today,

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,100
so about right now, she'll probably be striking the
ground and regretting it.

100
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,340
Not at all.

101
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,670
He wasn't sorry at all.

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,940
You saw it, too, right?

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,470
If he went around spreading those false rumors, at the very least, "I'm sorry. It's a misunderstanding."

104
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,030
Shouldn't he have said such sincere apologies?

105
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,620
Hey.

106
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,590
There's no proof that Jeong Woo went around
saying those things.

107
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,420
I mean, Jeong Woo isn't even the type of person to
say that sort of thing.

108
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm sure the rumor got distorted as it spread.

109
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,870
Did you ever see smoke where there's no fire?

110
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,810
He must have gone around letting words slip out for that kind of rumor to spread.

111
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,950
Hey,

112
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,400
but how did you know Jeong Woo's phone number and call it?

113
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,340
I called his old number and he just answered it.

114
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,260
He didn't change his number.

115
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,900
I went around looking like this?

116
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,570
Oh, I must be crazy.

117
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,010
Oh, you should have told me.

118
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,810
Maybe...

119
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,010
he was waiting for your phone call?!

120
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,790
Are you crazy?

121
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,460
I haven't even committed a crime,
so why change my phone number?

122
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,130
Alright. Why are you getting so upset? I was just asking.

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,030
You seem like a person who has feelings left...

124
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,020
Feelings left?

125
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,670
Earlier when she called, I didn't even know who it
was and answered it.

126
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,260
If I'd known, would I have answered it?!

127
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,950
Alright. Alright.

128
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,360
I erased her from my memory a long time ago.

129
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,090
She is the ERROR in my life, the MISTAKE.

130
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,010
The worst mistake in my life!

131
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,570
Who should be saying that.

132
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,700
Let's be careful of each other as we live.

133
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,890
Who is warning whom?

134
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,100
But still, if you see how he came running in the middle of the night because of his ex-wife's matters,

135
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,420
Jeong Woo is a person that has loyalty.

136
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,540
Loyalty, my a**.

137
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
Then should he not have come? Of course, he should have come.

138
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,930
He would die (if he didn't).

139
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,220
If he made up his mind not to come,
then he didn't have to come.

140
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,090
He really didn't have any obligations to come.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,330
Do you by chance...

142
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,340
You don't still think that Jeong Woo can't move a muscle without your approval, do you? Huh?

143
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,030
When Jeong Woo was coming into the police station earlier,

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,500
his aura was just ...

145
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,050
Oh, he became a person that we can't even hope to look at.

146
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,800
Hey.

147
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,210
Why are you taking Cha Jeong Woo's side?

148
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,670
Are you Cha Jeong Woo's friend or are you my friend?

149
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,970
No, I just...

150
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,810
When I saw Jeong Woo, I thought it was so unfortunate...

151
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,230
There's nothing unfortunate about it.

152
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm going to become 'more, more , more, more,' better than him.

153
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,730
With what?

154
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,250
How are you going to become 'more, more, more, more, more' better than him?

155
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,900
That seems difficult, realistically.

156
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,020
Truthfully, what do you and I have to look at?

157
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,310
As we get older, men are more cunning. They calculate things you see and don't see so carefully,

158
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,980
and they never "do a business that loses money."

159
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,540
Even when that doctor said that he liked you,

160
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,480
something seemed a little sticky (off).

161
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,050
Your words have thorns in them.

162
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,400
What?

163
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,680
That's what you're saying. "A seemingly perfect man
that has everything,

164
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,400
why should he look at you?" That's what you're saying.

165
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,620
No, I just wanted for you to realistically...

166
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,800
That's enough, wench.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,210
Where are you going?

168
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,800
That punk's temper.

169
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,770
Bad wench.

170
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,620
While she can't even comfort me, she's turning on the air conditioning in a heart with a hole in it. (Rubbing salt in the wound)

171
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,830
What is it?

172
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,580
She's not even following me out.

173
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,700
Oh, that bad wench.

174
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,730
But where do I go?

175
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,540
I heard that the dry cleaner ahjussi is getting remarried?

176
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,810
He's not getting remarried, but

177
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,320
he's getting back together with his previous wife.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,220
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.

179
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,780
After meeting a lot of different women,

180
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,130
he realized that his previous wife was better
than any of the women he met.

181
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,430
The woman, too, realized that it was
hard to live alone after getting a divorce.

182
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,760
That's true... It's better to have a husband,
even if he's bad, than not having one at all.

183
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,530
A bad husband?

184
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,260
Hey, the dry cleaner ahjussi is richer than you think.

185
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,680
And after they divorced, the multi-unit housing he'd bought got
redeveloped, and the land value jumped up ten times.

186
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,460
Despite how he looks on the outside, he's cash-rich!

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,420
It could've been a really big deal.

188
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,790
She might have lost that kind of husband.

189
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,790
And on top of that, just like things are better after it rains,

190
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,550
their marital relationship ("sex-life") apparently got so much better!

191
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,350
These days they close the shutters at the drop of a hat.

192
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,500
Shutters!

193
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,270
It's not easy for people to end all their feelings for each other.

194
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,820
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't?

195
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,990
Come to your senses. You're not in your right mind right now.

196
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,220
CEO Cha Jeong Woo of D&T Soft Ventures was
selected as this year's "Businessman of the Year."

197
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,440
At this time, D&T Soft Ventures' stock
value is estimated to be over 1 trillion won.

198
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
The number of users who have subscribed to the
mobile messenger service have exceeded 30 million.

199
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,940
And the fact that the numbers are
increasing played a big role in the award selection.

200
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,560
CEO Cha, who has caused a whirlwind in a
saturated mobile messenger market... 
"The Devil I know??"

201
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,210
What is this?

202
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,330
So why did you break up when he was poor?

203
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,170
You should have split up when he got rich.

204
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,580
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.

205
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,500
He's cash-rich!

206
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,500
I'm called Cha Jeong Woo.

207
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,910
I hope we'll never meet in these circumstances, ever.

208
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,330
But he acted so cold.

209
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,410
At the police station, he was definitely cold.

210
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,280
They say that Tiger Woods gave his ex-wife
$920 million in alimony.

211
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,500
Well, that was because it was Tiger Woods' fault.

212
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,600
Anyway, the length of the marriage, cause for the divorce,
contribution to household income, and so forth...

213
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,300
Well, it changes according to those things, but...

214
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,500
I wasn't at fault.

215
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,400
She hasn't contributed in any way [financially].

216
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,360
Hey, a man can't say two things with one mouth.

217
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,760
Didn't you say so at your last interview?

218
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,790
The person who made you grit your teeth, determined to succeed.

219
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
If it wasn't for that person,

220
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,020
you wouldn't be as successful as you are today.

221
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,630
You said that.

222
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,340
That person was the ex-wife from yesterday.

223
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
It's true, isn't it.

224
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,320
Ah, really.

225
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,800
Every word that I say is just right.

226
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,100
I'm definitely capable.

227
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,090
I have something to say.

228
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,460
Make some time.

229
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,640
Cha Jeong Woo.

230
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,960
Perfect timing. I'm okay today (to meet).

231
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,190
No, then it seems like I was waiting for him to call all this time.

232
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,690
What do you want to tell me?

233
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,390
See me today.

234
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,910
Where shall we meet?

235
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,840
I'll go to your company.

236
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,800
I just "happen" to have an errand to run in Gangnam.

237
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,300
I'll go to your company.

238
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,820
Okay.

239
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,660
Wait...

240
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,200
Then this is not the time to be like this...

241
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,830
Hey!

242
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,200
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Yes.

244
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,900
Be careful of catching a cold too, Manager.

245
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh wow. Unnie, your acting is the best.

246
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,440
How can you act so well?

247
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,230
Your face is pretty, too.

248
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,140
You should have become a talent (actress).

249
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,760
When I was very pretty (younger), I couldn't go about Gangnam properly.

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Every time I took a step forward, I received a business
card from an entertainment management company.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,110
It was so annoying that I couldn't even walk around.

252
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,900
If went to the city once, I could play cards with the business cards (I collected).

253
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,700
Unnie, you must have totally been so popular.

254
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,120
But it looks like you have an important meeting today

255
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,400
to even lie to your company like this and go.

256
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,830
Yes.

257
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,080
It's a very important appointment.

258
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Where is the nearest department store?

259
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,700
CEO, you have a guest.

260
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,370
Call them in.

261
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,930
Have a seat.

262
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,940
Is this your office?

263
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,100
It's nice.

264
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,970
This way.

265
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,930
Oh, what time did you say the lecture was for Seoul University?

266
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,010
This afternoon at 4 o'clock, sir.

267
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,100
Tell Driver Kim to ready the car by 3pm.

268
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,790
Okay.

269
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,420
They say that I got chosen as the CEO that
Seoul National University students respect the most.

270
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,710
They're asking me to lecture,

271
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,200
a person who's not much of a talker.

272
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,360
That's good.

273
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,230
I'm sure the students at your alma mater will be proud of you.

274
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,810
Well, I can't say that isn't so.

275
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,480
Thank you for yesterday at the police station.

276
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,000
For coming when you would've been busy.

277
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,890
It's fine.

278
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,890
That could happen.

279
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,300
However...

280
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,110
what is it you wanted to tell me?

281
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,270
I was surprised at the text.

282
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,700
Surprised?

283
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,430
After the ruckus you caused, you didn't expect it?

284
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,300
The reason I asked you to come see me...

285
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Here's the alimony.

286
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,200
Anyways, it bothered me.

287
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,630
I should have given you this before we ended things.

288
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,930
As you know, at that time I didn't have the luxury

289
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,110
or the means.

290
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,110
After speaking to a lawyer, I put in what is the generally accepted amount.

291
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,490
Of course, there's no reason to give you this
since you already refused to accept it.

292
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,980
But as the woman that you are,

293
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,050
I don't know when you might make another
commotion like you caused last night.

294
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,950
Rather, I thought that giving it to you would set my mind at ease.

295
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,020
You called me to say that?

296
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,520
Yes.

297
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,050
Ah, and this.

298
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,580
Consider it as an agreement contract.
Contract

299
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,980
It says that you won't contact me again
or threaten me using alimony as an excuse.

300
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,910
I thought it would be good to write one.

301
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,720
Cha Jeong Woo, you've really grown.

302
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
A contract?

303
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,780
Why? Why don't you ask me to write you an
apology/repentance letter?

304
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,240
Am I some kind of gold digger?

305
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,470
To write this kind of contract and rip off your money?

306
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,870
You...I don't know how much you put in this envelope, but

307
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,810
no matter how much money you put in, it's not enough.

308
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,270
If I think of my life that went wrong because of you,

309
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,040
even a billion isn't enough. Do you know?

310
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,350
So, don't look down on a person laughably with a few bucks.

311
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,100
And also, I was thankful to you for yesterday.

312
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,540
That's why I came.

313
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,100
Not because I had a different reason.

314
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,820
A contract?

315
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,300
This bastard.

316
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,110
Ae Ra, have you heard the news about Husband Cha?

317
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,350
Oppa?

318
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,460
I came in yesterday. Anyway, that isn't important.

319
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,430
Do you know your ex has become really big?

320
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,630
Hey, don't be surprised.

321
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,770
Cha Jeong Woo's become totally rich.

322
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,820
D&T Soft Ventures...

323
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,470
WHY?! Oppa, what trouble are you trying to get into? Why, why, why?

324
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,170
-This temper of hers.
-Why are you asking that? What does his getting rich have to do with you?!

325
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,140
Ah, really!

326
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,090
Why did you call her?

327
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,350
You didn't expect her to say nice things, did you?

328
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,760
While Husband Cha was becoming a chaebol
(wealthy conglomerate family), what were we doing?

329
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,140
This is why I can't leave the house for a minute.

330
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,510
While I was in Vietnam, you didn't call Husband Cha once, did you?

331
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,480
Why should I call a person that's already split off from us?

332
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,640
Only heartache would come of it.

333
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,340
This is why it's a problem.

334
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,800
You should check extinguished fires to see if they could be rekindled, and if broken couples could be put back together.

335
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,180
Aiyoo, do I have to step in and take charge?

336
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,540
You take care of yourself.

337
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,790
You said that the business in Vietnam was going well,
but why did you suddenly come back?

338
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,950
That's a top secret for the business.

339
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,410
Anyway, I'll tell you about it later.

340
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,550
Don't ask.

341
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,590
Why do you kill a boy's spirit?

342
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,020
Did you come back from the health club?

343
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,350
Your body looks good!

344
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:51,280
The women of this neighborhood go around saying
that they want to touch my muscles...

345
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,980
I had to cut them right off and tell them that
I was Sook Ja's man.

346
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,880
You're funny.

347
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,570
But Father,

348
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,760
you've really aged while I wasn't here.

349
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,430
You've lost a lot of your hair.

350
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,510
Sit down.

351
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,290
Because of that these days,

352
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,850
I've lost my confidence so much that
I don't feel like living anymore.

353
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,020
I wonder why I'm living like this.

354
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,080
I don't know if I'm going through menopause.

355
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,480
Only tears just keep coming out.

356
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,500
Ah, it's fine.

357
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,830
If you do a hair transplant, you won't even notice.

358
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,800
Father, it's going to be your 60th birthday very soon,

359
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,890
you can do it as a commemoration.

360
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,080
I should, right?

361
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,020
Of course.

362
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,630
Even so, I looked into a place that does it cheaply.

363
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,760
I have no money.

364
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,560
Soo Cheol.

365
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,060
Really...

366
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,930
It's clothes I haven't seen before.

367
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,010
I went to meet someone.

368
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,800
Who?

369
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,270
Cha Jeong Woo.

370
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,950
Jeong Woo?

371
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,660
Yes.

372
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,420
When? Today?

373
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,730
Yes. I just met him.

374
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,790
Why, why?

375
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,180
Did he by chance call you to ask you about the
police station matter?

376
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,380
What did he say?

377
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,730
A lot of words went back and forth.

378
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,410
If I tell you, it's a long story.

379
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,630
Can I sit down and tell you about it?

380
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,420
Yes, of course! Let's sit down and talk.

381
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,890
You didn't accept that money?

382
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,320
I have my pride.

383
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,230
I can't accept it while even writing a contract.

384
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,760
If he begged on his hands and knees apologizing and politely
asked me to accept it, then I may have considered it.

385
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,080
Isn't that so?

386
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,980
That is true...

387
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,280
Even so, you should have seen how much it was.

388
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,620
I thought I'd waver if I saw it, so I didn't look.

389
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,910
You know it, too.

390
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,330
That I'm weak when it comes to money.

391
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,420
That is true...

392
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,280
What?

393
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,460
Why the disappointed face?

394
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,770
No. I'm not disappointed...

395
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,930
Is your friend's pride important, or is the money important?

396
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,010
Did I say anything?

397
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,150
Then don't make that face.

398
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,270
I'm regretting it anyway.

399
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,750
You did well, girl!

400
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,920
A contract, what contract?

401
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,080
My insides are all relieved.

402
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,940
Really?

403
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,670
Hey, you eat, too, instead of just peeling the (apple) skin.

404
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,060
This girl...

405
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,560
You eat!

406
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,930
The apple is delicious. Where did you buy it?

407
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,190
How have you been? (Informal)

408
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,920
Yo. (Formal ending)

409
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,710
Talk comfortably.

410
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,960
Shall I?

411
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,670
Seeing you here, you look completely different.

412
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,360
The pathetic look that you had in the past...

413
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,880
I mean, that look of anguish you had is no longer there, and...

414
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,500
you've become very bright.

415
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,710
How have you been doing?

416
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,140
Me? Well, I've been busy...

417
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,760
I was outside (the country) doing business.

418
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,300
That's why I only found out about your success.

419
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,050
If I had found out earlier, I would've come running in my socks!

420
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,870
Sorry for the late congratulations.

421
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,700
You understand, right?

422
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,440
Yes.

423
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,180
I was going to call you anyway.

424
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,140
Call?

425
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,570
Me?

426
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,120
Yes.

427
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,640
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, a million, ten million!

428
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,560
Hallelujah.

429
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,870
Hallelu...

430
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,510
Oh my.

431
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,210
Are you okay?

432
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,270
Let go.

433
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,400
Get up please.

434
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,380
I said to let go of me.

435
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,060
You never bet on a losing game.

436
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,470
You won.

437
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,400
Like you said, Representative Cha isn't an ordinary man.

438
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,680
I almost actually came on to him.

439
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,170
Anyway, a bet is a bet so

440
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,730
Zeus is yours now.

441
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,440
Are you going back to America tomorrow?

442
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,070
If I go I'm not going to come back for a little while.

443
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,590
Let's stay in touch.

444
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,520
I'm not sure.

445
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,270
Were we that close?
- Hey!

446
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,840
But still, we were college roommates in our day.

447
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,050
How can you disappear so suddenly like that?

448
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,640
Undersecretary of State [for Economic Affairs]...

449
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,220
I heard he's running for election.

450
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,470
To assist in his election,

451
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,340
I sent him something.

452
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,260
Thank you.

453
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,510
And also,

454
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,050
I don't need the horse.

455
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,070
You don't have to give him to me.

456
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,700
Seeing how President Cha would respond...

457
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,300
I was really quite curious.

458
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,960
I got the answer that I wanted.

459
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,060
Bitch...

460
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,680
Did you have to change your major like that?

461
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,690
Couldn't you have just done it as a hobby?

462
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,250
Well,

463
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,010
I must take after Mom.

464
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,690
Is my father really angry at me?

465
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,310
He wouldn't kill his only son, right?

466
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,050
He might not kill you,

467
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,330
but you may get hit almost until to the point of death.

468
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,640
If it weren't for you,

469
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,100
there was no problem.

470
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,770
You know.

471
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,360
If he found out through some other route then I...

472
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,660
Hey! Where are you going?

473
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,760
When Noona gets off work, I'll come home with her.

474
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,520
Any way I look at it, it seems like it'll go better if Noona is there.

475
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,150
I won't run away,

476
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,170
so don't worry!

477
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,870
Hey punk! Then I'm going to be the one who gets beaten to death!

478
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,610
Don't you think of me?

479
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,150
Aish, this brat.

480
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,550
Noona, when are you getting off work?

481
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,430
It's fine. I'll wait.

482
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,320
Me?

483
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,710
I have a lot of things to do.

484
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,230
Hello.

485
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,140
Take this back, right now.

486
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,100
Is Na Ae Ra here?

487
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,720
Not long ago, you went to Cheongpyeong, right?

488
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,520
Sorry?

489
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,110
It's not that.
-You...

490
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,330
I heard you're divorced.

491
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,790
Why? Did you get divorced after being caught

492
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,150
"wagging your tail" at ("hitting on") other men?

493
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,430
No! Look here!

494
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,740
Wag my tail?

495
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,880
You're right, I did go there, but...

496
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,650
I really didn't know anything-

497
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,620
You, get your head on straight and live.

498
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,760
Sure, you're young, but don't use your body and

499
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,690
don't play around.

500
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,740
The amount I included covers your pay till the end of this month.

501
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
There's nothing good if rumors start,

502
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,670
so I'd appreciate it if you left right away.

503
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,990
Manager, it's unfair.

504
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,300
I got a call from the President.

505
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,700
That woman from earlier is the President's friend.

506
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,120
Manager!

507
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,760
Hey, why won't you answer your phone?

508
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,600
Why?
- You get finished at 7pm, right?

509
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,620
I'll go to the front of your shop now...

510
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,710
No, don't come.

511
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,390
It's something good.

512
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,440
Anyway, don't come. I'm out of the office right now.

513
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,290
Okay.

514
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,510
Hey, at that time you said you'd like to quit your job

515
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,800
and run a store, right?

516
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,390
This Oppa will make it happen.

517
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,480
I'm fine, but thank you.

518
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,270
Father!

519
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,930
You punk!

520
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,440
Ah, ah, Father. Father!

521
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,560
Okay, hit me all you like till you're satisfied.

522
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,900
Just not my face.

523
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,330
If I get hurt in the face, Mom will worry.

524
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,800
I have to video call with Mom.

525
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,060
Hey, you punk!
- I admit that I did something to deserve a beating.

526
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,230
I admit it, so hit me anywhere but my face.

527
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,940
How dare you not listen to me and run around!

528
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,600
How can I live?!

529
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,230
You have to at least leave a hole for this father

530
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,910
to breathe through?!

531
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,910
Wow, was I the hole that you breathed through?

532
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,990
I feel emotional but at the same time suddenly burdened....Noona!
- You damn punk!

533
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,110
Did you come together?

534
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,400
Anyway, you take responsibility for this,

535
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,860
and make your brother a person!

536
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,920
Have him frequent the company, too,

537
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,460
and keep your eye on him!

538
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,850
Even if I turn him into a person,

539
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,840
will you be satisfied with the results?

540
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,300
Noona, I toured around Central and South America.

541
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,190
She's a girl I dated in Cuba.

542
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,710
And she's a girl I met at the Samba Festival in Brazil named Priscilla.

543
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,630
And this is my friend from college,

544
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,270
they got married in Mexico.

545
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,970
They married within one week of meeting.

546
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,780
These two, while I was taking their pictures, the kids there...

547
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,270
Mom is well, right?

548
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,510
Yes.

549
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,130
I think she's gotten a lot better since she went to Paris.

550
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,190
But, Sis, call Mom.

551
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,380
Would she be happy to hear from me?

552
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,210
How's our master (tutor)? Is he doing well?

553
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,760
You couldn't refuse the request of the company's investor,

554
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,630
and you picked that son as a Nakasan.
(Nakhasan, meaning parachute ~Nepotism)

555
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,980
It's a disappointment, Hyung.

556
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,900
Even if Father said something, you should have cut him off.

557
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,570
You're the only one I depended on.

558
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,000
It's not because I received the request.

559
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,420
I okay'd it because you had potential.

560
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,170
Aiyoo, if you say it like that then...

561
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,530
That's true. I did have some smarts since I was young.

562
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,580
Because I taught you well.

563
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,090
Who was the tutor that taught a naive middle schooler
about alcohol?

564
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,370
Who was the cocky and absurd middle schooler
who rebelled against a naive college student?

565
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,350
At that time, soju was an anesthetic to you.

566
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,130
You calmed down a little after you learned soju from me.

567
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,060
I admit it. At that time, I was a little immature.

568
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,940
It's a relief that I met you then, Hyung.

569
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,700
Cheers.

570
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,560
But Hyung, over there that woman,

571
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,640
she keeps looking at me since earlier. What do I do?

572
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,870
She's looking at me.

573
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,310
It's me.
- I'm telling you, it's me.

574
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,920
She was looking at me all along since I got here and
was waiting for you.

575
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,750
Ai, really.

576
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,110
There's no basis for this argument!

577
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,660
Do you want to make a bet?

578
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,460
Deal.

579
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,060
Why?

580
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,830
You're nervous because it's the first time
you've seen a celebrity, huh?

581
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,480
Omo, so cute.

582
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,920
Oh, I...

583
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,100
The thing is...

584
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,450
The gentleman over there says he wants to have a drink with you.

585
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,190
Who?

586
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,690
Picking up women this way,

587
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,580
it's childish.

588
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,970
Don't do something like that. DON'T DO THAT.

589
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,210
DON'T DO THAT.

590
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,620
First, sit down. Oh, really.

591
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,210
Aiyoo, sit still.

592
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,170
You're so shy for a man.

593
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,170
Oh, seriously.

594
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,050
Why is your skin so soft?

595
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,210
Oh hey, you're good looking.

596
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,890
It's been a long time.!

597
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,820
Wait, Hyungnims!

598
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,630
Hyungnim.

599
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,650
Why do you keep asking me to dig the ground?

600
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,360
Kimchi-making season is over.
(Kimchi used to be stored underground)

601
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,210
That's enough. Stop.

602
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,900
Ah. Ah, yes.

603
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,870
He's going to sleep. Cover him.

604
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,980
Oh wait. Please.

605
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,010
Hyungnim! Why do you do this, Hyungnim?

606
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,400
You took our money.

607
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,170
Did you think that if you ran away from Vietnam that
we couldn't follow you?

608
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,580
It's the global age.

609
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,500
Our branches are embedded all over the world.

610
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,240
No matter where you go,

611
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,260
you'll get caught.

612
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,550
What should we do?

613
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,950
This is the list of politicians and businessmen who will be in
attendance at the anniversary celebration.

614
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,880
Once the reception is finished, we're planning to go
right into the dinner.

615
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:46,260
But... there's something I'm curious about.

616
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,510
Why did you change the date of the founding of our company?

617
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,290
It originally wasn't this day.

618
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,850
This day...
- That day was

619
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,160
the day when my Heaven and Hell crossed paths.

620
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,800
Mother.

621
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,210
Dad!

622
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,870
I'm sorry.

623
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,400
Cha Jeong Woo, don't!

624
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,350
Your life is a precious thing!

625
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,550
Cha Jeong Woo, Cha Jeong Woo, don't!

626
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,360
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo! Calm down!

627
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,740
Mr. Cha Jeong, don't!

628
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,300
M-Mr. Cha Jeong, don't.

629
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,820
Mr. Cha-

630
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,840
Oh, of all things.

631
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:41,310
How could a man not have a strong will?

632
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,900
Is this the tutor that Seung Hyeon requested?

633
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:06,490
Yeo Jin,

634
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,400
how long has it been?

635
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,670
How much money did you say this boy needed?

636
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,880
If you're going to invest money in exchange
for management rights,

637
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,480
I won't accept it.

638
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,800
A guy who was on the brink of death is now
being nitpicky with the terms, huh?

639
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,160
I had no intention of dying.

640
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,690
It's because I was so completely surprised.

641
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,890
At that time, the company and I were both reborn.

642
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,330
That's why I changed it to this day.

643
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,370
It's also the day we first met.

644
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,270
What is it all of a sudden?

645
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,030
What happened to your face?

646
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,580
Because you don't come home often,

647
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,390
Oppa came to see you.

648
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,670
I don't have time, so just get to the point.

649
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,220
Could it be...

650
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,180
the rent deposit for my studio apartment that
you stole before you left for Vietnam,

651
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,560
did you come here to cough it up?

652
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,630
What is this?

653
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,730
Obviously, it's money.

654
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:21,930
Really?

655
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,880
Is it really money?

656
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,890
It's $5000.

657
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,790
What is it? Where did you get this?

658
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,760
What is it? Say it quickly.

659
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,410
Brother-in-law gave it to me.

660
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,740
What?
- He said that it was alimony.

661
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,960
He said you left it there.

662
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,580
For real.

663
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,500
I only went because he called me there.

664
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,110
Sis, please trust me.

665
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,180
And so, did you ask for money when you got there?

666
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,610
No!

667
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,360
I swear, if I had asked him for something, I'll be struck by lightning!

668
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,760
When I got there, he put an envelope out as if he had been waiting to.

669
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,960
He said that you wouldn't take it.

670
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,950
After thinking about it, I figured you needed the money,

671
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,070
but it seemed like (you refused) because of your pride.

672
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,510
What good is family for?

673
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,790
To help you out in times like this . . .

674
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:33,160
Who asked you to do that?!

675
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,680
In any case, I'm just the messenger.

676
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,840
And . . .

677
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,300
And what?

678
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,340
What! What! What more is there?

679
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,200
That's, well, a handling fee.

680
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,520
A handling fee?

681
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,340
I took a slight amount from it.

682
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,430
After all, I did do some work in getting it.

683
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,600
Oppa, tell me clearly.

684
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,590
How much did you get?

685
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,940
Three thousand won ($30,000)?

686
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,160
Three hundred million won ($300,000).

687
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,150
What? Three hundred million?

688
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,990
Wait, so you got $300,000 and put $5000 in here?

689
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:30,100
Don't say anything more and just give it here.
I'm going to return it to him.

690
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,880
Quit messing around.
-I don't have it.

691
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,570
What do you mean you don't have it?
Where is it? Give it to me now.

692
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,430
No matter how desperate I am,
I can't take that money.

693
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,510
I'll give it back to him,
so hurry up and give it, where is it?

694
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,580
I don't have the money, honestly.

695
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,690
What do you mean, you don't have it?

696
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,470
Ae Ra,

697
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,430
please forgive me just this once.

698
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,220
While I was in Vietnam running my business,
I borrowed a huge amount of money, and...

699
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,720
those guys wanted to kill me!

700
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,080
I'm telling you that I almost died!

701
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,420
My heart was pounding so much!
I just couldn't live like that!

702
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,360
Ae Ra,

703
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,170
since it's already happened,
let's look on the bright side.

704
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,840
To someone like him, this three hundred million won ($300,000)?

705
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,190
It's not even money to him.

706
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,060
Can you really not shut your mouth?

707
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,230
Get lost! Get lost, you!

708
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,470
Just get out of my life!

709
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,560
This is why I don't like the men in our family!

710
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,970
Dad constantly sucks Mom dry,

711
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,710
and Oppa, you always try to take whatever you can from me!

712
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,370
Do you know what kind of money that is?

713
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:50,150
That punk promised me that he'd
never make me work in my life.

714
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,600
That turned out to be a lie, and he felt sorry for it.

715
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,440
Saying that he was sorry for making
such an empty promise,

716
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,550
he gave that money to make me get lost!
Do you get it?!

717
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,930
Not just that,

718
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,950
he said I'd have to sign an agreement
before he'd give me that money...

719
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,920
He said he'd give me the money only if I signed the agreement!

720
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,600
That's why I didn't take it,
because he was so dirty and petty!

721
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,720
But you took that money! That money!

722
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,580
Should I go up or do you want to come down?

723
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,530
There's a park in front of the office. I'll see you there.

724
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,310
Okay.

725
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,400
D&T Soft Ventures. 3 year Establishment Anniversary.

726
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,170
Friday February 14, 2014. Golden Tree Hotel Garden Square.

727
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,330
I don't have time.

728
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,270
What is it you wanted to say.

729
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,830
I won't talk long.

730
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:28,330
You gave money to my brother.

731
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:29,650
So it was that after all.

732
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,630
I told you that I wouldn't accept it.

733
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:35,380
Why did you uselessly give it to my brother and
make a person the fool?

734
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,960
Protecting your pride once is enough.

735
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,380
I thought that you had sent him, because you were embarrassed to accept it yourself.

736
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:47,500
Fine.

737
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,170
Whether I took it, or my Oppa took it...

738
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:54,870
anyway, okay, I accepted it.

739
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:59,140
I didn't want to take it and let your mind be comfortable,
so I wasn't going to accept it,

740
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,070
but I took it.

741
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:04,960
When I think about it, there's no reason not to take it.

742
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,580
I'll graciously accept it and spend it well.

743
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:15,270
With this everything between us truly ends.

744
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,630
There won't be any reason to see you again, so

745
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:22,320
you live your life, and I'll live my life. Alright?

746
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,130
I came here to say this to you:

747
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,860
Eat well and live well.

748
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,170
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo!

749
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,080
Let me ask you one last thing.

750
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,800
Is the anniversary of your company's
establishment really February 14?

751
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:56,570
That date from three years ago is the day we divorced.

752
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,870
Did you really set up this company on that date?

753
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,000
Ah, so you didn't know.

754
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:08,310
As soon as I divorced you, that very day a
large investment came in.

755
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,780
What?

756
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,970
Isn't it amazing?

757
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,820
As soon as you got out of my life,

758
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,110
things started working out.

759
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:24,330
Even then, you didn't contact me all this time?

760
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,540
Why should I have called you?

761
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,930
Do you have no loyalty?

762
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,540
Loyalty?

763
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,960
All I did was to carry out your request.

764
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,720
What?

765
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:49,350
Don't you remember?

766
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,320
Valentine's day.

767
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,340
The day we broke up.

768
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,400
"Don't use alimony as an excuse to call me."

769
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,760
"Just quietly get out of my life."

770
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,090
Don't use alimony as an excuse to call me.

771
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,240
Just quietly,

772
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,100
get out of my life.

773
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,040
I'll make that request

774
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,160
this time.

775
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,530
Quietly get out of my life,

776
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,130
Na Ae Ra.

777
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,080
Even if you had come back because of the money,

778
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,650
it probably wasn't love.

779
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,990
Cha Jeong Woo, you son of a bi***.

780
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,630
I'm going to crush you.

781
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,870
I said that I'm going to crush you.
