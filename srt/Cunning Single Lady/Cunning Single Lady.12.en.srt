00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,490
Episode 12

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,760
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,010
I'm thinking...

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,430
whether to tell you this story or not.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,150
What story?

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,040
Why my dad got rid of my mom's art gallery.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,150
Ae Ra, do you want to hear an interesting story?

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,340
The Seventh Princess

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,550
A long time ago, an emperor took in

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,320
a woman gypsy, who danced and sang,

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,750
as a queen.

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,800
But that emperor loved the queen so much,

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,280
that he didn't let her take one step outside the palace.

14
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,060
Your Majesty, congratulations.

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,820
After the queen had the first daughter,

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,360
the emperor was overjoyed so he wanted to give her a gift.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,390
What is your wish?

18
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,220
I want to have Spring.

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,800
Spring is here.

20
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,950
The emperor called all the gardeners.

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,970
Although he made Spring inside the palace, the queen was not happy.

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,140
Your Majesty, congratulations.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,320
Congratulations.

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,090
Thank you.

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:00,610
Every time the queen had a child, she would say she wanted a river or a bird.

26
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,040
Each time, the emperor made a river inside the palace,

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,670
and brought her birds, but the queen was not happy.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,210
What the queen wanted was to feel Spring and to walk along the river,

29
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,200
and live a life free like a bird's.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,590
Time passed, and after the seven princesses matured,

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,890
this is what the emperor said:

32
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,460
"I will give the kingdom to the princess with the longest hair."

33
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,510
Everyone was busy growing their hair,

34
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,790
with the nannies helping them.

35
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,380
But the Queen took care of the last princess's hair.

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,130
You resemble me.

37
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,240
After the queen died, a neighboring prince came,

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,820
and said that he would marry the princess who would inherit the kingdom.

39
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,890
All the princesses had grown their hair to the same length,
so they couldn't tell the difference ,

40
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,810
but only the last princess was different.

41
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,590
After the youngest princess took off her hat, her hair was short.

42
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,790
The queen had been continuously cutting her hair.

43
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,310
Aigoo.

44
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,100
Because of that, the youngest princess could not inherit the kingdom,

45
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,140
and lost the eligibility to be the prince's wife but gained freedom.

46
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,470
The happiness of her life was living with

47
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,740
the river that the queen longed for, Spring, and the chirps of the birds.

48
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,010
The youngest princess left the palace with the prince's servant,

49
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,460
and lived happily.

50
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,110
Good house, good clothes, good food.

51
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,900
Although Father thought that if he provided those things for Mother, she would be happy,

52
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,750
but Mother was able to become happy only after leaving my father's side.

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,390
My mother is in Paris, living towards her dreams of being happy.

54
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,160
And my father is still waiting for her, even through his anger.

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,380
But being able to paint while traveling the world

56
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,550
was all because of Mom.

57
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,510
Like your family, I want to fight, resent one another,

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,040
and reconcile again ...

59
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,650
I want to live like that.

60
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,700
It feels like people are living there.

61
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,230
As the youngest princess found happiness outside of the palace,

62
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,340
I want to do that, too.

63
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,090
I didn't know you were in that kind of situation.

64
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,340
I didn't know because you always laugh senselessly.

65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,220
I wanted to just keep on laughing.

66
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,820
I didn't laugh because I wanted to laugh,

67
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,610
but thinking that if I keep laughing, something will happen that will make me laugh.

68
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't want to burden anyone else either.

69
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,270
We've talked too long on a boring topic.

70
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,740
How do I change the atmosphere?

71
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,500
Don't try so hard.

72
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,080
I know a little bit of how you feel.

73
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,170
Pretending like you're okay when it's hard.

74
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,780
Wanting to cry, but laughing instead.

75
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,130
Because it feels like if I keep laughing, something will happen that will make me laugh.

76
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,330
I was like that, too.

77
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,620
♪ You're still there.

78
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,180
♪ You wouldn't know.

79
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,500
You know, Ae Ra?

80
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,090
I would like it if it wasn't just me doing the liking.

81
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,240
♪ I don't know, I really don't know.

82
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,530
♪ If we are really breaking up like this.

83
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,260
♪ What should I do?

84
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:43,890
♪ I love you. I love you.

85
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:50,500
♪ I guess you can't hear me even though I call out.

86
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,870
♪ I love you, I love you.

87
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:07,060
♪ You're coming back like another day.

88
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,260
I don't want to leave.

89
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,420
Why are you being like this?

90
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,620
Isn't it cute?

91
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,030
Not at all.

92
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,100
I thought that you're suppose to appeal with cuteness when the man is younger.

93
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,340
Forget it.

94
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,790
Personally, I don't like cute guys.

95
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,810
With a smooth face saying, "Noona!"
It's a "No, thank you."

96
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,440
Even if he's rich?

97
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,390
Then, "thank you?"

98
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,560
I can see right through you!
You're so materialistic.

99
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm honest!

100
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,310
I like you because of that.

101
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,590
Because I can totally see right through you.

102
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,210
Hurry and go!

103
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,450
If you go to the front, there's a place you can ride a neighborhood bus.

104
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,340
Ride that to the subway station.

105
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,980
This is my workplace. I know!

106
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,580
Anyway, thank you for allowing me to be indebted to you.

107
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,590
I'll buy you a meal for the money I'm saving!

108
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,810
You always say you're going to buy food.

109
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,130
You have a good memory.

110
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,740
I'm leaving!

111
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,130
When is CEO Cha coming?

112
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,060
I was going to eat dinner with him.

113
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,260
He's really busy lately, so it seems like he's been spending the nights at the development center often.

114
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,020
Is that so?

115
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,590
It's good that he is blessed with lots of work.

116
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,650
I'm back.

117
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,890
You came? Come here and sit.

118
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,030
CEO Cha will be here soon.

119
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,200
CEO Cha?

120
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,570
Yes. I have something urgent to talk to him about, so

121
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,830
I told him to come.

122
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,500
What are you going to say ... to a busy person?

123
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,740
There's a saying that "a monk can't shave his own hair."

124
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,200
I called him,

125
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,190
so that I can clear up your marriage problem.

126
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,530
It's my problem. I will take care of it,

127
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,910
so don't worry about it.

128
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,600
Is it because of your legs?

129
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,930
Don't worry about it.

130
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,070
When I see CEO Cha, I'll tell him in a good way.

131
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,930
What did you say?

132
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,150
It's something CEO Cha has to know anyway, if you're going to marry him.

133
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,210
CEO Cha has been hurt

134
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,240
and he's past the age to be attracted to pretty women.

135
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,060
His mouth is heavy (doesn't spread rumors) and he's considerate,

136
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,990
so he won't act recklessly about your scar.

137
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,850
I won't let him do it either.

138
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,270
Stop it! Stop!

139
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,690
How much do you have to make me miserable

140
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,200
for your heart to feel resolved?

141
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Are you going to say "since my daughter has a disability, I will give you more money."

142
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,300
Or are you going to say "since I helped you succeed,

143
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,380
by marrying my daughter, pay your debt?"

144
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,770
What did you say right now!

145
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:27,050
Father, you ... always used despicable ways to gain people.

146
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,920
You forced my mom to get pregnant

147
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,840
and held onto her.

148
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,120
Because of you, I...

149
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,720
was a child who never got to sleep in Mom's warm embrace.

150
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,720
Isn't it time you know that, although you can have the outer layer of a person,

151
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,370
you can't have their heart?

152
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,560
Shut your mouth!

153
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,630
No!

154
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,830
Really ... I am so sick and tired of this.

155
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,320
Everything in this house,

156
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,060
was earned by causing others to suffer in pain.

157
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,410
"Since I gave you a good life, be quiet and live your life."

158
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,970
Then did you think your family would be happy?

159
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,780
Never!

160
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,310
It makes me nauseated!

161
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,540
Every time I enter this house, I feel nauseated!

162
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,320
Do you know what I fear the most in this world?

163
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,470
That I might become like you.

164
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,100
That I might become like you.

165
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,210
That I might become like you!

166
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,650
That's what it is.

167
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,860
Your appearance, of worrying about when the people around you will leave your side as you age and get old,

168
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,340
is really pitiful!

169
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,680
You!

170
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,360
Chairman.

171
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
Try to sleep.

172
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,880
If you sleep, you will feel better.

173
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,440
I...

174
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,820
Please stay here until I fall asleep.

175
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,470
Yes, I will.

176
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,750
What are you doing?

177
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,020
You punk.

178
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,080
I will go now.

179
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,970
Jung Woo hyung,

180
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,020
thank you.

181
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,820
Fire?

182
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,170
Okay, I will go right away.

183
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,160
There's a fire at your house? (informal)

184
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,180
There's a fire at your house?

185
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,800
Hello.

186
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,370
It's me.

187
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,320
Yes.

188
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,550
Where are you right now?

189
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,890
Didn't you say something about a fire at your house?

190
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,490
Yes. I think I'll have to stay some place else for a while.

191
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,100
Does your stomach feel better?

192
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,880
Where are you?

193
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,520
I'm some place else.

194
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,730
Does your stomach feel better?

195
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,340
Is my stomach the problem? Where are you?

196
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,630
Forget it. Let's hang up.

197
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,400
Hello...he...

198
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,190
Oh Byeong Soo, Ahn Ji Hyun

199
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,050
They're finally getting married.

200
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,430
I will do it.

201
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,100
I will do it.

202
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,540
Here it is.

203
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,180
Aigo, wow.

204
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,590
It's the first time in my life that I see Soo Cheol working so hard.

205
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,720
That's the power of love.

206
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,490
Madame Jang, if all goes well, you might become a grandma next year.

207
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,850
I don't want to be a grandma.

208
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,970
Why do you think I like it?

209
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,860
Byeong Soo, congratulations on passing the National Examination.

210
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,410
You really suffered a lot.

211
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,640
Aigo, what are you saying?

212
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,980
Ji Hyun suffered a lot because of me.

213
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,340
That's right.

214
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,810
I couldn't pass my National Examination
because I had to support him.

215
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,040
I suffered a lot more.

216
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,270
Hey, since you're getting married,

217
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,570
as much as you've suffered, you can leach off of him now.

218
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,190
Because she's pregnant, she treats me like a servant.

219
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,000
Really?

220
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,780
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

221
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,010
Congratulations!

222
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,970
That's great news. How long has it been?

223
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,730
It's been two months.

224
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,040
Two months?

225
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,070
But Ae Ra, you still don't have a child?

226
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,630
You've been married for a long time.

227
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,030
She got a divorce.

228
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,850
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,620
It's fine.

230
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,800
Aigo, a lot of people came.

231
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,320
Oh, Chun Gyu.

232
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,020
Hey, it's been a long time.

233
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,060
Hey, long time no see.

234
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,790
It's nice to meet you.

235
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,460
Long time, no see.

236
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,310
Punk ... now you're entering into a path of suffering.

237
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,780
Hey, congratulations.

238
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,770
Thank you.

239
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,520
Hey, Na Ae Ra.

240
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,830
Chun Gyu, long time, no see.

241
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,700
I haven't seen you since your wedding, right?

242
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,840
I guess.

243
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,450
Chun Gyu, are you still helping your dad's store?

244
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,490
What are you saying?

245
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,150
Chun Gyu's store really became successful,
so they opened up another one at the crossroads,

246
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,930
and he's the president.

247
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,370
That's good.

248
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,850
Ae Ra, what are you doing these days?

249
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,650
I...well...I work in a company.

250
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,840
Now, this is a freebie from Hyung!

251
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,100
Hyung, thank you so much.

252
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,200
What is this...geesh.

253
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,320
Aigoo.

254
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,530
Gosh, now. Why leave here to watch TV at the sauna?

255
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:10,400
Do you think I don't know that you want to squeeze in with the kids and drink? Hurry up and go.

256
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,810
This person! Do you think I'm someone who wants to drink wherever someone is drinking?

257
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:21,490
Then, Father, do you want to go to the sauna and have a nice cold beer?

258
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,450
Should we?

259
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,280
If you're both going to go get drunk and raise a ruckus there,

260
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
I better throw one back quickly and go to sleep.

261
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,900
Hurry up!

262
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,280
Gosh.

263
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,830
I saw you on the broadcast, too.

264
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,020
Really?

265
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,400
Who was that? A plastic surgeon?

266
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,240
Are you still dating him?

267
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,650
Then are you open to dating someone else?

268
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,240
Hey, is that something that happens as you wish?

269
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,490
Hey, hey, hey... what was that a long time ago?
The Exam Village's Madonna?

270
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,600
The Na Ae Ra who could just point to and date whoever she wanted to.

271
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,990
Ahh...you never know what will happen in life, huh?

272
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,320
Life is unpredictable, isn't it?

273
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,740
Oh, Cha Jeong Woo!

274
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,940
Hey!
-Hey, hey!

275
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,950
Here, here, attention! This year's "it" businessman.

276
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,070
Coming from the famous D & T Soft Ventures, the most famous...

277
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,200
CEO Cha Jeong Woo has graced us with his presence!

278
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,250
Sit over here.

279
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,300
Why are you all like that?

280
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,780
We didn't get a divorce because our parents are enemies.

281
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,920
We're not on bad terms.
-Really?

282
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,450
Are you really okay with it?

283
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,470
Oh, of course.

284
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,240
Indeed, the Exam Village Genius and the Exam Village Madonna,

285
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,990
there's no reason to live so uncivilized, is there?

286
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,960
I haven't heard that in a long time.

287
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,200
If this toast is for our Exam Village Madonna,

288
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,860
and our Exam Village Genius to have a fabulous fresh start,

289
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,360
are you going to say that I'm overdoing it?

290
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,320
Go ahead, it's not a big deal, we're cool with it.

291
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,960
Aigoo. Is it going to be okay if we do a "friendship shot?"

292
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,450
Indeed, our Na Ae Ra!

293
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,200
Here's to their fresh start!

294
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,940
Cheers!

295
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,780
Congratulations. Ah, yes, it's so great.

296
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,840
Eat a lot.

297
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,400
Who is that?

298
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,340
Ah, Kim Chang Gyu.

299
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,610
Don't you know him? You know there was that grilled tripe restaurant in the exam village.

300
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,450
It's their son.

301
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,200
Ah!

302
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,610
Hey, when I followed you around because I liked you,

303
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,990
as if my life depended on it,

304
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,320
you dumped me saying you were going to be the wife of a civil servant.

305
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,700
But...

306
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,800
well...

307
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,070
in the end, he's running a business now, too.

308
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,450
That must be my fate, I suppose.

309
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,700
Do you still have feelings for him?

310
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,300
Just drink and go.

311
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,110
Hey, Na Ae Ra, where are you going? Hey, sit down!

312
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,530
Na Ae Ra, come here! Hey, hey, hey!

313
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,320
Oh, are you drunk?

314
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,200
Yeah, I'm drunk.

315
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,820
Hey, you still see me as the son of the tripe restaurant that used to chase you around, don't you?

316
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,450
Let go!

317
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,860
I'm trying to get something going between us two!

318
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Truthfully, I'm too good for you now.

319
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,640
What?

320
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,950
Is Cha Jeong Woo the only president?

321
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,240
I'm a president, too!

322
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,740
And you're returned goods.

323
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,990
Hey! Kim Chang Gyu!

324
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,150
Do you know why I didn't even give you a second glance back then?

325
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,740
It's not because you couldn't study.

326
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,860
It's because you were a loser like this.

327

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,990
Yes.

For some reason, I find you comfortable and likable.

Me, too.

393
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,140
I thought that you'd be difficult and scary because you're the director of the company.

394
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,560
You seem more like a friend, and it's easy to talk to you.

395
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,680
It felt very familiar.

396
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,090
You, too?

397
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:47,040
It's probably because we have a lot in common.

398
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,040
A lot in common?

399
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,200
For example,

400
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,910
ideal type?

401
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,850
We both like men that are brusque and are workaholics.

402
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,180
A man like Cha Jeong Woo.

403
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,140
I knew that you were CEO Cha's

404
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,310
ex-wife.

405
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,170
I wasn't planning on deceiving you.

406
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,390
To say it was ...

407
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm not blaming you.

408
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,580
You couldn't say anything about a relationship that's already over...

409
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,910
It's like that, I understand.

410
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:42,470
I did it, too ... marriage.

411
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,360
Are you very surprised?

412
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,100
Uh, yes.

413
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,370
I didn't know that you were divorced as well.

414
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,570
Not divorced,

415
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,880
he passed away.

416
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,390
Truthfully, we couldn't even live a married life.

417
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,400
It just turned out like that.

418
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,950
On the day of the wedding, there was an accident.

419
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,450
In that accident,

420
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,610
I lost my husband.

421
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,250
Brothers, you have come to the church

422
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,560
so God can consecrate with his seal the love you (both) have.

423
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,820
So I, as a priest, can...(inaudible)

424
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,560
And also,

425
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,970
my right leg, too.

426
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,730
I think you're really surprised this time.

427
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,280
N...no.

428
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,860
That's why, I haven't yet

429
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,590
told Jeong Woo about my leg.

430
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,000
Because I thought it would be too much of a burden.

431
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,680
Actually, because of this, getting closer to Jeong Woo,

432
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,160
I hesitated a lot.

433
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,830
Director...

434

435
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,040
has put in for the company,

436
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,980
you wouldn't know.

437
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,240
I want to protect him.

438
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,430
Jeong Woo's dream.

439
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,130
I...

440
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:01,800
am a person who can give the strength that CEO Cha needs.

441
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,990
So please help me.

442
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,480
How can I...?

443
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,550
That person...

444
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,400
don't shake him.

445
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,270
You know better than me that he has a weak heart.

446
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,370
Right now, his wavering feelings towards you ...

447
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,980
do you think it's love?

448
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,790
Don't you think it's guilt?

449
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:43,000
Feeling sorry towards his ex-wife,
because he wasn't able to make you happy.

450
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,540
Did he say that?

451
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,550
After being with him for 3 years, there are some things I know without him saying it.

452
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,870
Right now, the thing that Jeong Woo needs to be responsible for is not you,

453
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:11,520
but is D&T Soft Ventures and over 700 employees...

454
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,500
Please remember that.

455
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,830
I'll request that.

456
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,750
Guilt?

457
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,840
Because he's sorry?

458
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,590
Ae Ra, you're really amazing!

459
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,940
I did it for the first time, when I became a manager.

460
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,170
But be careful. It's really scary when the executive managers pick at your briefings.

461
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,250
Do it perfectly thinking that our team's reputation is on your shoulders.

462
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,850
I will never accept mistakes. Okay?

463
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,820
Yes, Team Leader!

464
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,500
Fighting!

465
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,270
It doesn't make sense.

466
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,870
That they would make an intern do something as big as this.

467
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,560
Don't worry about it.

468
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,100
What if I make a mistake?

469
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,370
I'm so nervous...

470
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,770
Just do it confidently, like you normally are!

471
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,560
Don't be nervous, all right?

472
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,100
Let's go.

473
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,780
Hello,

474
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:42,410
I'm mobile shopping team's intern, Na Ae Ra.

475
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:49,520
From now on, we will start the briefing for the Unified Shilla Hotel Wedding Anniversary Event Product Proposal.

476
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,580
There are some moments that any couple wants to remember.

477
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,950
After meeting that person for the first time,

478
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,960
when we become blind,

479
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,250
can't see anything, and just looking at that person.

480
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,800
"This person is the one."

481
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,000
Feeling that this person is my everything in the world.

482
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,500
Becoming the most important people for each other,

483
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,820
they become a married couple.

484
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:43,960
Of course, as we start living together, our eyes are opened,

485
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,750
and we bite, tear and scratch each other.

486
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,060
But still, because there are those precious moments,

487
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,470
don't we endure the rest of our difficult lives?

488
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,750
This was the end of the Unified Shilla Hotel Plan's briefing.

489
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,810
The key point of this plan

490
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,260
is an event that's included, separate from the meal.

491
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,190
As you can see, along with presenting them drawings of pictures capturing precious moments,

492
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,690
there is a wedding photo shoot for the wife.

493
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,020
Even if the product price is set high ,
isn't the photo shoot an excessive event?

494
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,380
It isn't a formal wedding shoot, but more the feel of an commemorative shoot.

495
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,470
Even if it is a commemorative shooting, there'll be cost involved.

496
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,680
From our standpoint,

497
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,530
it won't work.

498
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,800
There is an inexpensive and simple way,

499
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,490
by using the hotel's wedding hall.

500
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,280
There will be a bit of cost involved, but

501
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,730
it can improve the image of the hotel ...

502
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,540
But women don't like it.

503
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,380
Just looking at my wife,

504
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,660
she prefers cash.

505
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,260
The person in charge is still single, right?

506
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,090
It seems you may be too clueless.

507
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,560
For now, this project

508
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,430
will need to be reconsidered.

509
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,420
The people who are clueless, could it be

510
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,840
the husbands who are sitting here?

511
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,780
I was married.

512
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,170
And I was someone's wife.

513
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,830
The reason why wives are happy on their wedding anniversary,

514
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,160
after receiving handbags or rings is

515
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,810
not because they are expensive gifts.

516
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,950
Although it may be a handwritten letter, remembering that day,

517
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,020
and while preparing the gift,

518
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,930
she's thankful for her husband's heart

519
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,990
who was thinking only of his wife.

520
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,390
The thing that makes a wife the happiest

521
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,980
is her husband.

522
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,530
A husband's heart.

523
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,550
Yes!

524
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,840
Yes, I understand!

525
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,130
What? Unified Shilla didn't like the concept?

526
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,520
It's not that.

527
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,200
They really like it!
-Yes?

528
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,380
That they want more than just a one-time event,

529
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,160
so they want to proceed with this regularly, every year during the wedding season!

530
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,750
Wow!

531
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,540
Ae Ra!

532
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,560
Congratulations.

533
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,700
I have to go deliver this good news to the Director!

534
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,490
Team Leader!

535
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,680
If it will be a regular event, it will be large scale.

536
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,480
The scale won't be a problem.
This plan is something our D & T Mobile Shopping

537
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,090
will be able to surpass the others,

538
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,230
then we'll get to the higher phase.

539
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,440
But Team Leader,

540
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,790
leaving that for an intern to be in charge of...

541
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,960
will it be okay?

542
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,640
Na Ae Ra will be finishing up her internship soon.

543
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,550
And there's no guarantee that she'll continue working at the company.

544
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,320
From the beginning, this kind of important deal

545
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,560
needs a responsible person to be in charge of it.

546
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,270
Wouldn't that be preferable, don't you think?

547
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,090
Pi Song Hee?
-What are you saying, Pi Song Hee?

548
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,340
It's... not that.

549
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,470
I saw Na Ae Ra working overtime several times while I was passing by.

550
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,870
If it's such an important project, leaving it to an intern,

551
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,640
is it okay with everyone else leaving for the day?

552
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,490
If it goes well, it's because of me, but if it doesn't go well, it's the subordinate's fault.

553
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,640
That's not what you were planning to do, was it?

554
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,290
Not at all, CEO.

555
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,300
How are you managing your team, Team Leader?

556
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,210
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

557
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,700
Try to do a little better.

558
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,090
♫ Mirror, mirror, which person does he like? ♫

559
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:59,740
♫ Heaven, heaven, who is he thinking of? ♫

560
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,140
♫ I'm curious about those glances,
I can't decipher what they mean ♫

561
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,340
♫ From now on, you and I ♫

562
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:11,000
♫ Shall we get to know each other? ♫

563
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,850
What?

564
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,840
"What?"

565
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,940
Earlier, that Unified Shilla proposal,

566
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,640
they want to make it a regular event.

567
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,000
Congratulations.
-Ah, that.

568
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,220
Thanks.

569
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,990
So, do you have time tonight?

570
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,000
As a congratulatory celebration, let's have dinner together.

571
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,290
Are you asking me on a date, right now?

572
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,900
What date? I'm just asking if you
want to eat dinner together, that's all.

573
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,930
Do you think the thing that's making him waver,

574
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,500
is love?

575
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,340
It's feeling sorry for an ex-wife whom he wasn't able to make happy.

576
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,590
I have an appointment today. I don't think I can.

577
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,490
Appointment? What appointment? With whom?

578
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,500
That's not for you to know.

579
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,050
Then, I'm going.
-Hey!

580
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,510
I'm going to wait until you come.

581
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,750
I said I can't go. Don't wait.

582
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,180
Even so, I'm going to wait until you come!

583
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,560
I'll wait until you come!

584
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,320
Hello.

585
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,610
The ground is going to cave in.

586
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,850
Your worrying again?

587
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,700
No, it's nothing like that.

588
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,710
Perhaps, do you have an appointment today?

589
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,250
No.

590
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,880
Then do you want to go somewhere with me?

591
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,310
Scout proposal?

592
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,120
I was watching you since the buffet deal.

593
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,070
Your passion for work.

594
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,790
And also, from this guy,

595
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,530
I heard that you're an excellent worker.

596
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,950
Anyway, after seeing the PT on the wedding anniversary event,

597
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,640
I made up my mind, Ae Ra,

598
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,250
to scout you.

599
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,830
I'm grateful for you looking so kindly upon me,

600
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,630
but it's too sudden.

601
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,320
Well, think about it. I, too,

602
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,790
am not saying that I'll automatically hire you.

603
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,040
You have to go on an interview, too.

604
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,240
Thank you so much.

605
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,010
Hyung, you will never regret it.

606
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,310
But, looking at how it is now,

607
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:40,240
I don't think Seung Hyeon's opinions are all objective,

608
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,650
so I'm a little worried.

609
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,060
Excuse me, customer.

610
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,910
Customer!

611
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,600
I'm sorry, but it's closing time.

612
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,690
What the... ?

613
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,190
Is the elevator broken now as well?

614
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,120
To cancel, press number 2.

615
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,580
What the...?

616
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,200
I didn't even push the button, what am I doing?

617
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,540
Hey ... what are you doing?

618
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:06,670
♫ I really love you, dear ♫

619
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:13,670
♫ I really love you ♫

620
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:20,590
♫ Dear, I really love you. ♫

621
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:25,800
♫ My words lingered in my mouth, ♫

622
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,200
♫ but in the end, I couldn't say them ♫

623
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,620
Because of Na Ae Ra I can't eat.. I'm so angry that I can't even sleep.

624
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,970
Seriously.

625
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,200
Why am I...?

626
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:45,050
♫ I really love you, from deep inside my heart ♫

627
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,090
♫ Dear ♫

628
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,670
What is it at this time?

629
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,790
Why didn't you come today?

630
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,880
You called to ask that?

631
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,990
I said I wasn't going.

632
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:14,090
Even so, if someone is waiting,
isn't it normal to be concerned?

633
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:16,930
Talk later. Later.

634
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:19,490
It's because of important work!

635
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,390
Secretary Gil called you because of an important work matter, why didn't you answer it?

636
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,770
Work? What work?

637
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,420
I couldn't answer the phone because I was washing up.

638
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,300
Washing up?

639
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,100
Where are you right now?

640
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,950
Me? I'm at the art studio.

641
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,410
♫ I really love you. ♫

642
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,900
♫ To the point of tears. ♫

643
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,930
♫ I really love you. ♫

644
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,930
Agh! Oh!
♫ To the point of forgetting all else. ♫

645
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:57,400
♫ I really love you ♫

646
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,050
♫ You're my all. ♫

647
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,110
Secretary Gil!

648
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,410
It's not even like your stomach hurts because your in-laws bought land.(korean saying that people are naturally jealous)

649
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:13,590
Are you that jealous that your ex-wife is seeing another man?

650
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,970
What do you mean she's seeing another man?
She's single!

651
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:21,710
Your stomach is turning inside out right now because it looks as though she's becoming "involved" with Guk Seung Hyeon.

652
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,570
Or go and hold on to her properly.

653
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,050
Why do you keep struggling and only make it tiring for me?

654
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,670
Hey.

655
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,620
You have a responsibility to assist me no matter what the reason is that I'm sick!

656
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,010
It's because it isn't real pain.

657
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,110
You're faking it.

658
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,240
Are you planning on taking a proof shot at the hospital

659
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,850
and send it to Na Ae Ra?

660
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:46,090
If you keep acting up like you know it all, you're really going to get hurt in a big way.

661
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,050
It's an acute stomach ulcer.

662
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,470
Look over at the monitor.

663
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:02,030
It must have really hurt.

664
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,850
It seems you're really stressed.

665
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:09,600
Is there anything you're particularly concerned about?

666
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,360
Ah, that...

667
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,560
He is focused on someone's work and personal life.

668
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,060
I'm a bit cautious to say it, but

669
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,040
I keep imagining ridiculous things
and then become nervous.

670
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:34,690
But because of that, you can't think of me as being crazy, I'm completely normal.

671
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,480
Yes.

672
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,870
Perhaps, is that person...a woman?

673
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:46,010
Oh! I totally got the chills.

674
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,090
The illness that you're going through right now,

675
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:56,930
it's going to be hard to regulate it medically.

676
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:01,930
People often call it "plastic flower." You've heard of it, right?

677
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,970
Isn't it lovesickness? Lovesickness.

678
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,620
Lovesickness?

679
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,060
Who? Me?

680
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,430
What kind of absurd situation is this?

681
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,840
Seeing as he's joking around with a patient with a stomach ulcer,

682
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,670
isn't he a quack?

683
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,810
From what I see, he seems to be an excellent doctor.

684
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,620
That mouth of yours is alive to the bitter end, isn't it?!

685
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,780
I'll go take care of the bill.

686
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,160
Why should I submit that?

687
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,600
The one who caused the illness should pay for it.

688
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,200
Cha Jeong Woo

689
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,290
You want to get off work early?
Did something happen?

690
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,100
Yes, about that...

691
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,490
Reason: Personal matters

692
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:10,570
As we go through life, there are a lot of

693
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,580
personal matters that we can't help.

694
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,150
Make sure that there are no set backs with the plans
you're in charge of.

695
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,300
Yes. Thank you.

696
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,490
Here.

697
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,750
What is it?

698
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,510
Some acceptance candy. (tradition in Korea to give a special taffy like candy for important tests, interviews, events, etc.)

699
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:41,390
Good luck on your interview.

700
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:45,010
Thanks. I hope I get in on my first try.

701
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,610
Now is this the end with this company?

702
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,280
Is my call like some gum that she decides to first chew (ignore) it and see?

703
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,730
And even if an intern is busy, could she possibly be busier that me, the CEO?

704
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,320
And if the CEO made time to call,

705
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,100
she should answer the phone no matter how busy she is!

706
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,890
Am I wrong?

707
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:40,400
She's makes a perfectly normal person into a lovesick mental case.

708
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,580
I need to see with my own eyes, what she's so busy with.

709
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,080
I got you today.

710
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,540
Are you here to see Ae Ra?

711
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,220
As well as others...

712
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,430
Ae Ra requested leave because of personal matters.

713
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,050
Requested leave?

714
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,420
Is she ill?

715
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,320
Ae Ra went to the Unified Shilla Hotel today.

716
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,180
Ah, she went there.

717
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,150
She really must be busy.

718
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:15,310
Ae Ra... went to do an interview.

719
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,090
What?

720
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:33,180
♫ The fates that the Heavens have decided, ♫

721
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,770
♫ Even if you try to fight against it and win, ♫

722
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:41,600
♫ I know it cannot be. ♫

723
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,060
♫  But whenever I meet you, ♫

724
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:50,620
♫ The words I kept inside, afraid that you'd find out... ♫

725
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:57,670
♫  The words I said everyday!  ♫

726
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:02,920
♫ I really love you ♫

727
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:09,800
♫ Dear, I really love you ♫

728
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:16,500
♫ Dear, I really love you♫

729
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,740
Na Ae Ra!

730
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:23,660
♫ I love you, dear ♫

731
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,080
♫ My words lingered in my mouth, ♫

732
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,530
Na Ae Ra!
♫ but in the end, I couldn't say them ♫

733
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,460
Na Ae Ra!

734
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,950
Cha Jeong Woo?

735
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:38,080
Ah, it's dangerous!

736
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,900
Are you crazy?

737
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,440
What if you got into an accident?!

738
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,100
Do you dislike it that much?

739
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,850
Do you dislike being with me that much?

740
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,500
So even though there's time left in the internship period, you're moving to another company?!

741
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,760
Yes.

742
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,860
Then or now, surviving is important to me.

743
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,690
And anyway, I'm going to leave the company.

744
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:04,910
Isn't it obvious that I grab hold of a good opportunity?

745
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:09,100
It's already too late for you to pay attention to me.

746
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,770
Paying attention to me now is laughable.

747
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,900
Why?

748
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,120
Why are you so concerned about me?

749
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,610
Am I pitiful?

750
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:19,030
Are you sorry?

751
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,140
Is that why you're like that?

752
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,060
It's not that.

753
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,400
Then why are you so involved and interested in every detail of my life?

754
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,070
I...

755
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,790
have plastic flower.

756
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:34,820
What?

757
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,520
Plastic flower! Lovesickness!

758
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,170
What?

759
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,310
I like you.

760
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,630
I really like you!

761
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,450
So, don't go.

762
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,980
♫  Dear,  ♫

763
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:02,380
♫ I really love you ♫

764
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,060
♫ I really love you ♫

765
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,340
♫ So much that it brings me tears ♫

766
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,430
♫ I really love you ♫

767
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,350
♫ Even if I lose everything, ♫
