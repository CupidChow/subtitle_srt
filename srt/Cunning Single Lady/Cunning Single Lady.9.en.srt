00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,600
Episode 9

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,100
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,430
What do you mean? I'm washing the comforter.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,760
That's what I'm saying! Why are you doing laundry all of a sudden?

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,160
You're always complaining even if I'm doing housework.
Give me other stuff to wash.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,050
I'll do them all because I'm doing it anyway.

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,140
Father-in-law...

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,600
Father-in-law, I brought you your favorite coffee.

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm sorry. It's instant coffee today.

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,730
Father-in-law, next time I'll make sure to make it 2 : 2 : 2.
(coffee : sugar : cream)

11
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,060
I'll be sure to make it delicious.

12
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:10,470
♫ When I think of you~ ♫

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,900
♫ Think of you~ ♫

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:25,690
♫ Think of you~ Love like mine. ♫

15
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:36,840
♫ Think of you~ Love like mine. ♫

16
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,850
Did you hear the rumor about
the CEO and the Director possibly dating?
-Really?!

17
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,710
I heard that the family treated her as a daughter-in-law,
even at the CEO's father's funeral.

18
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,440
They match. He's handsome and she's pretty.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,310
Let's go.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,270
Hey, Seung Hyeon, let's do that together.

21
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,800
Let me help you.

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,690
It's March, and spring is here.
Why do you look all dark and gloomy?

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,910
Interns should be glowing!

24
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,080
I guess you think you're still at the funeral home.

25
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,180
The CEO will not look at you differently just because you do that!

26
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,670
Oh, what's with her?
- There's a scandal about the CEO and Director Guk.

27
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,970
There's a rumor that they're getting married soon.

28
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,930
To the roof.

29
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,350
Why do these guys call me to the roof everyday?

30
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,980
Excuse me, what is wrong with you?

31
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,820
Na Ae Ra, can't you help me once?

32
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,270
With what?

33
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,050
I don't think I've heard an answer yet,

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,950
but it seems like it'll be easier if I hear it.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,550
Na Ae Ra,

36
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,220
do you like CEO Cha Jeong Woo?

37
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,250
Why...why are you curious about that?

38
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,750
You're right.

39
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,140
I'm asking myself the same thing.

40
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,300
Do you like him?

41
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,380
No.

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,220
Since I've answered, I can ask a question, right?

43
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,310
Why are you curious about that?

44
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,530
At the funeral, and even now,

45
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,950
why are you acting like you're angry and upset?
You're not a little kid.

46
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,940
Kid?! Who? Me?

47
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,370
Have you seen such a tall and normal kid before?

48
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,180
I have!

49
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,270
What is this?

50
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,280
It's not coming off?
-It's not coming off!

51
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,350
It hurts, it hurts! Ahhh! Don't do that!

52
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,630
Aigoo, really. Just stay still for a second.

53
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,070
Your finger wasn't cut.

54
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,520
I cut this.

55
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,360
Why did you put this on there?

56
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,480
Were you imagining being proposed... ?

57
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,720
What are you saying?

58
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,670
What are you two doing?

59
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,370
This was stuck on her finger...

60
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,380
Tongil Shilla Hotel said they were happy
with the contract they signed last time.

61
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,320
So they want to do it again.

62
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,500
They're preparing a special menu for a couple's anniversary.

63
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,220
So think of a good plan by tomorrow.

64
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,070
I have to leave in the afternoon for a product launching...

65
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,760
You can do it after you've returned.

66
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,380
Like at the funeral, I expect to see you being aggressive and active!

67
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,690
I'll be expecting it.

68
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,740
Excuse me?

69
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,180
Just do well.
- Ah, okay.

70
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,230
This is the sales report for this month.

71
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,290
I'll take a look at it and give you feedback on it.

72
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,200
Sure.
And also,

73
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,210
the workshop this weekend...

74
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,330
Excuse me?

75
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,110
I was wondering if you could attend...

76
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,340
It's not necessary, of course.

77
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,380
I know that you're purposely not attending,

78
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,100
so our team would be able to enjoy a good time.

79
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,390
Could you please approve our budget proposal...

80
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,810
I'll go, too.

81
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,600
Excuse me?
-I'll go as well.

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,140
It's a chance for me to get closer to my colleagues,

83
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,650
I don't want to lose that chance.

84
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,940
Ms. Pi Song Hee! Please call the pension (guest house) we're staying at

85
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,960
and tell them to prepare the barbecue with rib eyes.

86
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,040
Huh? Not pork belly?

87
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,790
Not only rib eye, but everything we eat,
wear and use, tell them to prepare the best!

88
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,870
Like we spoke of before, jumbo shrimp is good, too.

89
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,020
And Mr. Kang, please prepare fun recreational activities for our team.

90
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,650
Aren't we playing the 'Go-Stop' card game?

91
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,290
Who said so?
- You told me to send an email telling everyone to come prepared with loose change.

92
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,180
That's what I told everyone!

93
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,770
Now, this time Director will be attending as well,

94
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,940
so let's take care of things especially well.

95
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,230
Hurry up!

96
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,570
This week, the mobile shopping team

97
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,840
has a workshop.

98
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,360
Is that so?

99
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,400
I'm thinking about attending as well.

100
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,630
If you have time, would you like to go with me?

101
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,660
Me?
-Yes.

102
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,290
You only take care of the development team,

103
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,670
and you don't take care of our department.

104
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,200
Well, that's because you do a good job on your own.

105
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,850
And also, won't the employees feel uncomfortable if I go?

106
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,070
Is that so?

107
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,090
Here...

108
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,110
What is this?

109
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,900
It's late, but it's a gift to celebrate your
discharge from the hospital.

110
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,080
You went to the funeral right after, so I couldn't give it to you.

111
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,290
You didn't have to do this...

112
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,740
Open it!

113
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,890
It's nice. I think it'll suit me well.

114
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,980
It's a relief.

115
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,130
While choosing it,

116
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,280
I was worrying that you might not like it.

117
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,820
I was just about to buy a new tie anyway.

118
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,600
I haven't been able to buy one, since Secretary Gil has been busy.

119
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,960
It's good then.

120
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,100
If you're busy,

121
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll pick them out for you in the future.

122
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,500
While I was in the hospital,

123
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,830
I lost consciousness for a while and woke up.

124
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,910
I think I saw you then.

125
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,680
Always looking after me behind my back...

126
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,640
Thank you.

127
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,630
Actually, thinking about it, whenever I was going through a tough and difficult time,

128
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,950
Director Guk was always by my side.

129
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll wear this necktie well.

130
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,010
I will be very late.

131
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,900
I have to turn it in by tomorrow, so I may work all night.

132
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,200
You're going to quit anyways, so don't make yourself tired.

133
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Even if I quit, I should do what I have to do.

134
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,990
You know I do the best I can for anything.

135
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,540
Do you want to plan for things like a wedding anniversary event?

136
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,600
You've come back?

137
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,680
Yes.

138
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,670
You've tried really hard.

139
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,230
You, too.

140
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,040
Working overtime again?

141
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,150
Yes.

142
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,150
What about dinner?
- What about dinner?

143
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,450
Are you eating now?

144
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,870
Yes. It's a snack, but do you want some?

145
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,010
No, it's alright.

146
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,050
Or if you want to...

147
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,670
Why do you eat like this?

148
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,030
Isn't this dinner?

149
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,210
You're the one to talk. Eat up!

150
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,930
Why? Because it's a pity to throw them away?

151
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,340
You still (over-prepare) after all this while.

152
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,770
I bought it to eat with the people who work overtime.

153
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,520
You were always like that.

154
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,000
You made a lot even if it was for two people.

155
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,000
That's why there were always leftovers.

156
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,670
If I prepare just enough, then it doesn't feel right.

157
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,680
Of course, you would think that way.

158
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,280
What?

159
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,580
Is there anything to drink?

160
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,920
Father-in-law...

161
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,270
Father-in-law, I made you your favorite coffee that you liked.

162
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm sorry. It's instant coffee today.

163
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,250
Next time...

164
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,370
Father-in-law, I'll be sure to make it... 2 : 2 : 2.
(coffee : sugar : cream)

165
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,180
I'll be sure to make it delicious.

166
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,070
Why is there nothing to eat at the CEO's house?

167
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,250
You don't even have anything to drink.

168
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,840
The fridge is full of beverages.

169
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,750
What is this?
Why is my face so round?

170
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,890
What are you doing?

171
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,270
Hey! Why are you looking through someone else's things?

172
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,570
What do you mean someone else's?
My face is here, too!

173
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,260
What?

174
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,910
Why don't you give me this video?
As a model, I have a right to see it.

175
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,820
So protective of her own rights...

176
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,340
You forced me to do it without paying me anything!

177
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,810
Payment? Think of working as a model for the company as an honor!

178
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,090
To be honest, you don't have the face of a model.

179
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,150
Even though you were pretty when you were younger,
the story is different now!

180
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,490
You're all old.

181
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,360
Old?!

182
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,960
What?

183
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,360
What? What? What?

184
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,020
Excuse me, CEO Cha.

185
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,170
Yes, I have aged with time.

186
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,840
But if a woman loses her freshness,

187
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,620
maturity blooms.

188
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,340
Should I say it's a natural elegance?

189
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,370
Where is it?

190
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,420
Where is your elegance?

191
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,680
Is it there? Elegance~

192
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,370
Where is your elegance? Where is it?

193
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,640
Ah, I've found it!

194
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,490
Don't touch the nose hairs of a sleeping lion!

195
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,710
I'm in the mode of extreme solemn character.

196
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,680
You're using the word "solemn" because you know what it means, right?

197
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,000
Look at this! You don't know what solemn means!

198
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,380
If you knew, you wouldn't do this. You won't.

199
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,450
♫ I might have been in love before, ♫

200
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:44,280
♫ You're never furthest but far, ♫

201
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,490
♫ You touch my life and I'm across, ♫

202
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,570
♫ You were every breath that I take. ♫

203
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,930
So this is what you looked like, Jeong Woo.

204
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,710
I'm sorry but I'll finish up the responsibilities I have now before leaving.

205
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,990
Even so, it's only right to do so

206
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,730
for the person who entrusted this to me.

207
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:32,230
♫ I love you with every bit of my heart ♫

208
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:38,370
♫ There's only you and I around, ♫

209
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:46,310
♫ I'm kneeling alone, I miss you, ♫

210
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,550
♫ If I'm sure it's forever, ♫

211
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,950
♫ My memories, ♫

212
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:03,030
♫ Of loving and holding you, my love, ♫

213
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,380
The moments with your wife and husband that you want to cherish... We'll draw those moments for you.

214
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,370
You did this all on your own?

215
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,450
Yes. Every couple is bound to have

216
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,180
moments with their wife or husband
that they wish to keep in their memory.

217
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,730
It's giving a present of those moments
not as photos but as unique drawings.

218
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,490
Na Ae Ra did it all night long with a bloody nose. All by herself.

219
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,830
You've worked hard. But now is the time to focus on the workshop.

220
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,230
Okay?

221
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,300
Yes.

222
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,260
How about this?

223
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,490
By any chance,

224
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,640
do you know what it means when a woman gives a man a necktie?

225
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,970
It means, "I want to have you."

226
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,790
He's boring and dull,

227
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,250
a workaholic.

228
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,230
I've dated a guy like that, too.

229
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,750
Really?

230
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,900
What are you doing?

231
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,320
What do you think? This is your current expression.

232
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,670
Me?
-Yes.

233
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,560
Even if there's an unpleasant face, if there's one
as unpleasant as this one, I'm extremely worried.

234
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,610
You're overreacting.

235
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,890
Seung Hyeon, your nosiness is as big as the Pacific Ocean.
You worry about others so well.

236
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,160
At our house, there's someone who gets grumpy easily.

237
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,870
So do you know what my job is?

238
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,680
An iron.

239
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,710
An iron?

240
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,070
I flatten our frowns like this.

241
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,110
Won't you let go?

242
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,760
This time, your mouth. Smile!

243
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,280
It's so dirty!

244
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,970
I told you to let go!

245
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,570
She's very fantastic!

246
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,440
She's a very wise woman who does not make the same mistake twice.

247
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,100
Above all, when a man is shaking,

248
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,290
she's a woman who knows how to hold on to him.

249
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,110
It was Na Ae Ra?

250
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,840
Hyung!

251
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,440
What are you contemplating about?

252
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,970
It's nothing.

253
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,780
What is it?

254
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,110
I said it's nothing!

255
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,450
Okay.

256
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,210
Hey! Hey!

257
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,920
Hey!

258
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,160
What do you think of this situation?

259
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,930
What situation?

260
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:57,150
So... yesterday I coincidentally, very coincidentally heard this...

261
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,210
I'm so speechless.

262
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,990
What?

263
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,520
A close friend of his, is trying to date his ex-girlfriend.

264
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,510
Even though being cool is the trend these days,
isn't this too controversial?

265
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,230
What do you mean it's controversial?
They're not even siblings who share the same blood!

266
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,920
Huh?

267
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,970
Oh yes!

268
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,540
They're like brothers!

269
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,760
It's almost as if they were blood related.

270
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,830
Like CEO and Guk Seung Hyeon?

271
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,790
Yeah, about that much.

272
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,800
If it's that close then...

273
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,710
Right? This is totally controversial, right?

274
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,730
Yes. But why?

275
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,260
Are Na Ae Ra and Guk Seung Hyeon dating?

276
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,890
What are you saying, kid?

277
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,740
You're so funny!

278
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,510
I knew it when they kept hanging out
with each other saying they're colleagues.

279
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,700
So CEO, are you being jealous right now?

280
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Jealous? No! Never...

281
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,880
They say a man is really unattractive when he's jealous.
And there isn't even medicine for that.

282
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,620
Hey! It's not like that!

283
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,290
You really didn't know? We get our first paycheck today.

284
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,260
That's right.
I didn't even know how the time went by.

285
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,510
You're hungry, right?
What do you want to eat?

286
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,670
What do they have here?

287
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,670
It's really expensive here.

288
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,970
It's the price of listening to the accompaniment.

289
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,560
So you were against 18:1 with the gypsies?

290
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,460
Yes! I'm so lucky I had a little bit of talent.

291
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,280
If that weren't the case, I wouldn't be here.

292
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,400
If you weren't here then?

293
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,460
I would have been discovered as a dead corpse
somewhere by the sea in Italy.

294
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,820
But I'm jealous.
You've traveled from one country to another.

295
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,450
There's no place you haven't been.
I guess you live a little?

296
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,140
You didn't know?

297
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,290
Acting so cocky...

298
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,800
But what's that little talent of yours
that made angry Gypsies change their minds?

299
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,120
Should I show you?

300
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,520
You might fall for me if you see it.

301
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,860
Because of you, I had a lot of fun and talked.

302
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,490
You're a useful young man.

303
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,070
Hurry back. I'll go in now.

304
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,790
Good night.

305
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,550
Hyung?

306
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,040
Yeah!

307
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,600
Oh. Oh ... Yes.

308
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,940
Why are you calling at this hour?

309
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,110
Ah...uhm...that's...

310
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,610
I was going to tell you to have a drink with me sometime.
Good night!

311
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,170
Hyung!

312
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,330
Yeah?

313
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,960
I ... am going to say it.

314
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,090
That I like her ... to that person.

315
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,320
CEO Go sent it in appreciation.

316
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,660
How old is this?

317
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,420
It's wild ginseng that's 20 years old.

318
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,500
But the matter with the liquidation, why did you delay it?

319
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,250
CEO Go received orders from

320
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,260
the Middle East. Am I right?

321
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,400
Yes.

322
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,000
If I'm going to catch him to eat him,
shouldn't I fatten him a bit?

323
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,780
What about Seung Hyeon?

324
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,360
He went to the company workshop.

325
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,410
Where are you going?

326
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,920
There's a workshop for our department.
I was thinking of going.

327
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,940
You're even going to places like that?

328
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,710
I'll be back.

329
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,110
Go ahead. Take care of Seung Hyeon!

330
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,470
I think the Miss is trying to get closer with the employees.

331
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,850
According to Driver Kim, she gave a ride to an intern going home late,

332
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:24,010
and went shopping and ate dinner together
several days ago.

333
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,690
Oh, I see.
What about Seung Hyeon?

334
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,120
Earlier, I said he went to the workshop ...

335
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,380
♫ Mirror, mirror, who does that person like? ♫

336
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:51,090
♫ Heavens, heavens, who does that person think of?♫

337
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:54,340
♫ At the end, the end of every word, ♫

338
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,290
Oh my!

339
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,540
You came!

340
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,950
I heard that the discussion on the mobile shopping platform was being held today.

341
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,780
Let's go in.

342
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,450
Alright.

343
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,050
Hello, CEO!

344
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,940
Hello!

345
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,090
My soul feels like it's becoming clearer.

346
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,010
Team Leader, the time is a little dubious.

347
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,110
Should we eat and have the meeting, or eat after?

348
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,030
Since we came to play,
we need to do what we need to do then play!

349
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,110
Should we do that?

350
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,190
We made it so that our Don't Talk users
don't need to put in their ID's or passwords.

351
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,810
We developed a program that would allow for easy mobile shopping,

352
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,900
but it's at a state where it's not being used often.

353
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,050
Where do you think the root of the problem lies?

354
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,480
I want to hear some good opinions.

355
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,160
For now, we're focusing our deals on clothing
and lifestyle products, and tasty restaurants.

356
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,900
Although there was an unfortunate incident for a brief moment,

357
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:32,850
what do you think about pursuing the
'back alley store's projects' that brought us much success?

358
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,300
Even the luxury items that we launched this time
are receiving a lot of attention.

359
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,430
Compared to the department stores or the stores
in Cheongdamdong they can be bought for 20% less.

360
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:51,480
It's a good opportunity to get customers who want luxury brand items at a less expensive price to use our service.

361
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,600
Ms. Na Ae Ra is in charge of it, right?

362
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,890
Yes!
-What do you think of it as the person in charge?

363
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,990
Do you think it'll help us gather more customers?

364
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,890
To be honest, how many deals with luxury products
will increase the number of customers,

365
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,440
I'm not very sure.

366
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,320
No matter how cheap a designer good may be,
a single wallet costs more than hundreds of dollars.

367
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,620
The customer base is limited...

368
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,800
I think that finding deals that have to do with everyday items...

369
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,830
may be a way to increase the number of loyal customers.

370
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,140
I wholeheartedly agree with Na Ae Ra's opinion.

371
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,440
Don't you think so?

372
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,330
It's a good point.

373
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,410
I will consider your opinion.

374
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,770
Ae Ra, what are you doing?

375
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,840
Are you going to be really late?

376
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,920
Oh yeah! You said you were sleeping there.

377
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,570
No, I was wondering where you put the nail cutters.

378
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,030
Alright, have a good time.

379
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,150
Me?

380
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,680
I'll just have to make some ramen.

381
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,470
Me?

382
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,070
I'm thinking of what to do for business.

383
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,080
Meal? We have to eat!

384
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,540
Then...

385
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,900
do you want to come to our place?

386
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,470
Is there a need to eat out?

387
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,770
Our place is a restaurant.

388
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,050
No, there's no need to feel uncomfortable.

389
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,610
It's been a while, so I want to feed you a warm bowl of soup and rice.

390
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,440
Then call me once you're near here.

391
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,230
Who is it?

392
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:45,020
Oh, you know the friend that lives with Ae Ra? Min Young...

393
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,970
Min Young?

394
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,550
Yes.

395
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,820
Is she coming with Ae Ra?

396
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,930
No.

397
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,690
She's coming alone.

398
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,590
Why?

399
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,020
I don't know...

400
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,650
She says she misses me or something...

401
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,880
I'm so popular.

402
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,130
I'm going to go home for a while.

403
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,540
Where are you going?

404
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,000
You have to make deliveries!

405
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,110
Shh!

406
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,850
Spring is coming to Kilimanjaro.

407
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,340
Huh?

408
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,160
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!
(Korean national flower)

409
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,820
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

410
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,770
Ow!

411
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,760
Come here, Team Leader Wang!

412
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,590
I'm coming!

413
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,920
Fighting!

414
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,140
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

415
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,750
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

416
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,250
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

417
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,390
Are you okay?

418
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,060
Who's going to be it?

419
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,090
Ae Ra, did you fall down after hitting Seung Hyeon or not?

420
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,710
Who's it?

421
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,160
Aigoo...

422
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,330
Oh my! CEO, Director!

423
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,150
Play with us! It's very fun!

424
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,020
No, I'm fine.

425
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,110
No, I'm fine as well.

426
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,780
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed.

427
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,550
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

428
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,150
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

429
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,030
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

430
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,770
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

431
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,310
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

432
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,940
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

433
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,820
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

434
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,760
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed!

435
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,160
Look over there! What's that?

436
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,470
The CEO is out!

437
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,680
CEO!

438
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,030
Yes.

439
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,920
It feels like something is missing.

440
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,220
It's like that, right?

441
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,620
At a time like this, there is a secret weapon!

442
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,000
It is ... the ramen soup base!

443
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,170
Wow...

444
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,560
If you have this, then it's all good!

445
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,340
How do you cook so well?

446
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,050
I've learned after living alone.

447
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,340
You live alone?

448
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,740
Ah, yes. My wife and my kids live abroad.

449
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,720
It's been two years since my wife and kids have gone to America.

450
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,810
Is it bearable?

451
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,040
I just miss the kids.

452
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,260
I want them to come back, but the kids want to study more there.

453
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,760
So I'm just sending money faithfully.

454
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,290
But naturally, I have to, since I'm the head of the family.

455
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,770
Here!

456
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,150
Yes.

457
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,420
This is the taste!

458
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,730
Thank you.

459
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,780
Manager Kang, next time, please contact me outside of work.

460
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,750
Let's quietly enjoy a drink some place near the office.

461
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,700
Really?

462
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,750
Manager Kang has received the CEO's orders!

463
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,920
Your family's rice soup

464
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,160
is always warm, assuring, and it fills me up whenever I eat it.

465
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,100
Like you.

466
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,340
Assuring?

467
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,260
Drink water.

468
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,600
Are you okay?

469
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

470
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,470
Aish! This damn kkakdugi!
(Kkakdugi is a type of kimchee where cubed radish is used instead of Napa cabbage)

471
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,370
Are you okay?

472
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,660
I'm fine.

473
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,480
It's done.

474
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,830
Is she really that accurate?

475
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,120
That's what I'm saying.

476
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,140
She even predicted when my friend's husband would be promoted,

477
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,250
and she was even correct that he was cheating on her,

478
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,300
so it lead her straight to divorce, like a non-stop ticket!

479
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,370
Wow! That's totally amazing! Where is that place?

480
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,560
If it's something like that, I can predict a little too.

481
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,310
Secret.

482
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,380
Secret?

483
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,750
Yes.

484
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,470
It means that your secret is coming out.

485
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,330
If you're having one-sided love, it means that you'll get caught.

486
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,920
Even if you're hiding something you'll be caught.

487
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,250
Here.

488
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,890
Can you see that the girl is holding two buckets?

489
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,880
The girl could be two-timing.

490
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,230
This kind of complicated woman,
you should either just cut her off from the start,

491
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:34,170
or so that she can't two-time you, break her legs.

492
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,770
Na Ae Ra, are you a two-timer?

493
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,120
No.

494
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,210
Strange.

495
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,570
Anyway, if I were to interpret this, these two wolves here...

496
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:57,830
Between these two,
there's too much competition and betrayal.

497
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,710
The sun in the center is so tortured and tired.

498
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,140
But she cannot avoid it.

499
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,130
No matter what, "go". Just go.
That's the only choice you have.

500
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,370
Then what should I do?

501
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,110
What is there to do?

502
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,210
Seduce one out of the two.

503
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,660
Then you can get rid of the remaining wolf.

504
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,870
Na Ae Ra, two-timing?

505
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,590
Then I'll boil soup on my hand.

506
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,020
No, I'm fine.

507
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,640
Would you like to try?

508
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,630
I don't believe in superstitions.

509
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,250
Is it bad?

510
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,200
That is...

511
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,370
I mean...

512
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,520
I don't really believe in 'these' type of superstitions,
and it's only for fun.

513
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,400
Then I'll disregard our difference in rank and
be very frank with you...

514
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,260
Please, go ahead.

515
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,940
A huge disaster is headed your way.

516
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,540
A "disaster?"

517
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,010
You'll be faced with an enormous change,

518
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,170
and you'll be lost and crazily wander around because of that change.

519
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,520
The final ending will be...

520
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,140
You were here?

521
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,500
Today, our Team Leader Wang prepared this much
to liven up the workshop atmosphere, yet

522
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,070
I thought... I didn't give enough respect
to her kind-hearted gesture.

523
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,940
The things she said were nothing beyond ordinary.

524
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,990
Hey, later, in an hour, come out to the back yard.

525
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,850
Why?

526
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,670
As to why, you'll know when you come out.

527
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:17,110
I'm guessing that you're planning to pull an all-nighter
since you're young and youthful, but...

528
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:20,860
this noona who is in her 30s doesn't have
the strength for that anymore.

529
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,890
Jeez, it's something important!

530
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,060
Really...

531
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,430
if it's important then say it now.

532
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,640
Why aren't you saying anything?

533
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,500
About our rumors.

534
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,550
Because I felt bad about it.

535
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,680
For making you become misunderstood by people
because of me.

536
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,300
I'm sorry.

537
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,610
I'm okay.

538
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,790
How can that be okay?

539
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,120
Rumors can get out of hand,

540
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,170
and you could get hurt from them.

541
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,020
You said this, right?

542
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:18,140
When you were having a hard time,
I was always beside you assuredly protecting you.

543
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,700
That it was a blessing, that you were thankful.

544
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,720
If you protect me, too, it'll be fine.

545
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,260
If you're there protecting me,

546
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,550
I believe that nothing will hurt me.

547
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,560
Come out, okay?

548
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,130
I will wait until you come out.

549
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,300
Is that punk not going to give up?

550
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,190
Okay, I will go out, I will.

551
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,300
Team Leader Wang!

552
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,290
Yes?

553
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,140
Yes, CEO?

554
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,820
By any chance, do you have alcohol?

555
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,770
Yes, I've prepared beer and soju.

556
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,900
Shall I set the table?

557
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,280
No, excuse me, I... needed makgulli (rice wine),

558
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,260
but we only have beer and soju, so...

559
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,510
Yes, I can just go out and buy some now.

560
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,960
We don't need a Team Leader to go since
we have an intern standing here.

561
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,570
Sorry?

562
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:37,000
Ah... I'll go out and buy it.

563
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,390
What kind of makgulli should I buy?

564
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,410
That...that... What was the name...

565
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,840
I'll know once I see it...

566
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,250
Let's just go together.

567
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,770
Come with me.

568
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,170
The makgulli that I wanted isn't this.

569
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,870
Ahjumma, do you have other brands?

570
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,170
But we only have this.

571
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,080
Ha ha, really.

572
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,070
Okay, it can't be helped.

573
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,230
We have no choice but to go to another supermarket.

574
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,020
It must be here.

575
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,220
Was it this?

576
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,190
Is it this one?

577
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,640
Really!

578
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,220
What on earth is the makgulli you're looking for?
They have so many here.

579
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,780
It's over there! There.

580
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,710
Hey, it's over there.

581
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,690
Where?
- It was here?

582
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,380
This one will do.

583
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,430
Ah, now what?

584
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,310
Do you think others drink as much as you?
This is enough.

585
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,670
Really.

586
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,570
We need to buy it again if we run out!

587
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,500
Just buy it for now. If there are left-overs, I'll take care of them.

588
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,870
Why?

589
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,220
You're going to vomit again?

590
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,310
Where are you going?!

591
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,230
The toilet!

592
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,130
Na Ae Ra!

593
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,560
Na Ae Ra, Na Ae Ra!

594
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,150
Na Ae Ra. Hey!

595
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,480
Where are you running away to?
You don't take the CEO's words seriously?

596
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,350
You know that this is Alpha's oppression.
Right, CEO?

597
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,700
I should report you to the Labor Union.

598
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,050
Suddenly my leg...

599
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,520
What's the matter? Does it hurt?

600
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,900
Ah, my leg... my leg! Ow!

601
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,780
CEO!

602
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,930
I don't know.
-What, what, what...?

603
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,760
I don't know. Why is my leg suddenly like this?

604
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,250
Ow...

605
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,930
Ow, my leg... Ow!

606
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,570
I can't... I can't go, I can't go.

607
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,590
I think I'm going to die.

608
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,790
Are you sure it hurts?

609
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,220
You got here totally fine.

610
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,000
Is that something to say to someone who's hurt?

611
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,830
While trying to catch an intern that took off
in middle of her work,

612
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,630
the CEO's chronic illness relapsed.

613
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,560
And also, did I get this chronic illness for no reason?

614
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,510
I got this way from rescuing you... is how this happened.

615
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,660
You hurt your shoulder back then.

616
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,720
Never mind. I'll fall for it once.

617
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,080
I got you here, so I'm going now.

618
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,780
The injured person can come or not, whatever.

619
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:31,290
My shoulder! My shoulder... I think my shoulder popped out.

620
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,450
Hey, I think my shoulder popped out. Oh!

621
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,160
Of all... seriously!

622
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:46,310
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up so I think I can't come.

623
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,620
Are you happy being here like this
in the middle of the night?

624
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,070
Of course!

625
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,720
The sky is nice.

626
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,320
The breeze is nice, too.

627
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,310
Why?

628
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,240
Do you have an appointment?

629
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,430
Who in the world is it?

630
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,510
It's nothing you need to know.

631
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,620
A friend?

632
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,510
Yeah, a boy friend.

633
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,780
You're bluffing.

634
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,580
Can you swear on it?

635
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,270
Yeah, he's a colleague, satisfied?

636
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:42,470
But he's a good friend, you see. Unlike someone.

637
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,500
Friend, yeah, right.

638
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,790
Office romances are completely off-limits.

639
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,600
The old lady has no conscience.

640
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,100
What's wrong with my conscience?

641
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,050
I don't know. I'll call the villa,
so you can decide whether you want to go or not!

642
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:05,560
Oh! What is this sound?

643
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,690
Is it the sound of frogs?

644
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,240
It sounds like the rain, too.

645
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,850
You're getting a call.

646
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,560
Yes.

647
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,300
Oh, yes. You are nearby.

648
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,750
Yeah, yeah. Okay. I understand.

649
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,710
What is it?

650
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,820
I ordered some snacks for the villa.

651
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,130
And so?
-I told him to bring a few here on his way.

652
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,920
Over there... He wants me to go meet him over there.

653
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,070
And...?
- Why don't you go?

654
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,500
You know you like rice cakes.

655
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,980
Hey!

656
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,900
I mean...

657
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,710
I'm hurt right now. Chronic shoulder dislocation.

658
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,340
If I go, you're going to abandon an injured person and leave by yourself.

659
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,510
Ha! Cha Jeong Woo is certainly putting on a show.

660
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,760
What took you so long, Na Ae Ra?

661
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,310
Wait... what is Director Guk doing here?

662
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,510
I was taking a brief walk and was on my way back.

663
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,030
What are you doing here?

664
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,180
I mean, that...

665
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,660
Let's sit together.

666
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,250
I was disappointed to just go back.

667
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,510
It's spring.

668
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:22,200
Seeing how you can smell the grass.

669
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,520
I'm sorry.

670
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,160
I'll be ... heading back first.

671
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,560
Did you just leave?

672
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,370
Uh, what is all this?

673
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,780
You have amazing timing.

674
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,290
The mood is ruined to set it all up again.

675
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,300
And since you saw it, I can't not tell you.

676
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:45,250
Aish! I shouldn't have bothered her like that.

677
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,060
What is it that you had to tell me?

678
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,590
I...

679
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:19,190
am going to tell you honestly how I feel about a certain person.

680
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,600
I thought about it a lot and worked up the courage,

681
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,490
so listen carefully.

682
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:29,140
There's someone who keeps coming into my sight.

683
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,710
I keep noticing whatever she does.

684
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,150
And I'm curious as to wherever she goes.

685
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,480
"What is that expression?"

686
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,950
I start analyzing.

687
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:44,340
And when that person smiles, I feel at ease.

688
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,500
And when that person is sad, I get worried.

689
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,570
I want to go and make her laugh.

690
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:56,520
And when she laughs at something I say,

691
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,440
I feel happy.

692
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,870
Before I go to sleep,

693
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,270
I fall asleep thinking about that person.

694
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:08,170
And when I open my eyes in the morning,
she's the first person I think of.

695
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,570
Aren't you going to ask? Who that person is?

696
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,470
It's you, Ae Ra.

697
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:26,660
Ae Ra, you're that person.

698
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,100
Did I look that pitiful to you?

699
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,910
A divorcee...

700
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,270
who is having a hard time to survive.

701
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,640
Thanks for the thought.

702
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,040
But you don't have to worry about me.

703
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,730
I'm a very vigorous person!

704
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,060
♫ What should I do? ♫

705
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,870
I told you to listen well.

706
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,480
Don't pretend like you don't know.

707
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,330
♫ You are the one person ♫

708
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,050
♫ that I need to live. ♫

709
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:38,560
♫ What do I do now? ♫

710
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,550
♫ In my elongated days ♫

711
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:48,000
♫ our memories ♫
