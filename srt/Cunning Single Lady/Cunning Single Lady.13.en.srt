00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,900
Episode 13

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,500
Are you crazy?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,100
What if you get into an accident?!

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,400
Do you hate it that much? Do you hate being with me that much?

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,200
Is that why you're trying to move to another company even though there's time left in your internship period?!

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,500
That's right. Then or now, surviving is important to me.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,600
And I'm going to quit the company anyway. Isn't it obvious to grab onto a good opportunity when it's here?

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,500
And it's already too late for you to be paying attention to me.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,250
Paying attention to me now is laughable.

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,850
Why? Am I pitiful?

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,150
Are you sorry? Is that why?

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,650
It's not like that.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,050
Then why are you so concerned with every detail of my life?

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,850
I...

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,450
have "plastic flower."

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,750
What?
- "Plastic Flower," lovesickness.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,450
What?!

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,750
I like you.

19
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,550
I really like you!

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,950
So don't go.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:22,850
♫ I really love you, ♫

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,850
♫ I really love you, ♫

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,050
♫ I really love you, ♫

24
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,850
♫ I love you, ♫

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,350
I like you.

26
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,950
I like you, Ae Ra!

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,250
I...feel like it will explode here, so I'm going crazy.
Do you not know?!

28
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,550
So...

29
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,050
If only you like it, and your heart feels like it will explode,

30
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,850
you thought it would be the same for me as well.

31
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,450
What?
- I told you.

32
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,250
I like how my life is right now. I finally feel like I can live.

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,950
The CEO at Unified Shilla must have noticed me, starting with the buffet proposal.

34
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,650
I...

35
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,450
found out how happy it is to accomplish something on your own, and being acknowledged for it.

36
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,050
I found out what a happiness it is to stay up all night creating something.

37
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,250
I was so excited that I couldn't even sleep. Don't you get it?

38
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,150
Ae Ra.

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,550
I want to go to that interview.

40
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,850
It's true that it's a good opportunity.

41
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,650
♫ I really love you, ♫

42
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,550
♫ I really love you, ♫

43
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,050
I'll take you.

44
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,650
I want to go alone.

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,350
♫ I really love you, ♫

46
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,950
You're late because of me.

47
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:15,350
♫ I really love you, ♫

48
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,950
What's your reason for deciding to change jobs?

49
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,150
What's the reason that you're changing jobs, Ms. Na Ae Ra.

50
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,450
You didn't even prepare things like that?

51
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,250
What? I just thought honesty...

52
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,950
Honesty?

53
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,450
That you're quitting because you don't want to see your ex-husband's face?

54
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,150
An interview for people with experience looks at character over other things.

55
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,750
Since they know that the people who apply are good at their jobs.

56
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,450
Why are you changing jobs? Was there anything that was difficult while you worked?

57
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,650
Were there any troubles? Things like that.

58
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,750
For questions asking if it was difficult, if possible tell them that it wasn't,

59
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,250
and you can just show them your passion.

60
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,850
Since that's the truth, it won't be too hard.

61
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,250
Since you even postponed your birthday and worked overtime.

62
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,050
Well... although it was because I forced you to.

63
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,350
The CEO can't go home from work because of a mere intern!

64
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,350
Eat it or not.

65
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,350
You really do think of a person.

66
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,450
Did he know and buy this or what?
(Traditionally on birthdays Koreans eat a seaweed soup)

67
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,150
Na Ae Ra.
- Yes.

68
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,050
What do you think are your strengths?

69
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,150
I think it's that I do everything diligently.

70
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,150
That's not it, that's not it.
You have to be more specific when you talk about it.

71
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,050
You can show examples of them with the project we're doing.

72
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,250
Resilience, passion, ambition, and even spontaneity.

73
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,350
Since you were cool.

74
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,450
You're thankful, aren't you?

75
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,950
Yes. Thank you.

76
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,050
While you're thankful, I should quickly make a request.

77
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,350
After you're done with your interview, let's eat dinner together, Ae Ra.

78
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,450
I can't do that.

79
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,350
What's wrong? Are you ok?

80
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,150
What is it? Are you ok?

81
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,750
Pain...I have pain...

82
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,350
Why? Does it hurt somewhere?

83
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,950
Here...

84
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,150
Love... love sickness.

85
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,450
Don't joke around!

86
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,050
It's not a joke. It really hurts.

87
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,750
So, treat me with care since I'm a patient.

88
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,850
That's why...

89
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,650
Dinner.

90
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,150
Dinner.

91
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,850
They said I have love sickness...

92
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,150
They said it's an illness from my heart ...

93
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,150
Iron.

94
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,650
Iron.

95
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,350
Iro...

96
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,650
It's not even fun.

97
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,750
The customer cannot answer the phone so leave a message...

98
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,550
Aiyoo, really.

99
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,250
These days, Miss is having a difficult time,

100
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,450
but with her problems,
the Chairman is having a very hard time.

101
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,450
He can't sleep at all at night,

102
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,750
and ... if you add the CEO Cha's woman problems,
I can't guarantee...

103
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,850
Chairman's health.

104
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,450
Why is our Ahjussi beating around the bush?

105
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,550
What is it?

106
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,150
I guess Father doesn't know about this.

107
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,250
You know why I brought these picture to you, right?

108
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,250
Since she's CEO Cha's ex-wife, we can look past that,

109
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,750
but I didn't think you would do that, too.

110
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,350
I don't know exactly

111
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,050
what kind of bewitching power this woman has that she can hold onto two men and shake them up ...

112
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,650
but these pictures...
- To Father,

113
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,950
continue to keep this a secret.

114
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,050
I'll take care of the rest.

115
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,850
It's time to go for your scheduled health check up.

116
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,950
I'm not going! I told you I'm not going! How many times did I tell you?!

117
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,800
Where did you work at?

118
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,110
I was at the Venetian in Las Vegas for four years.

119
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,120
I was at the Hilton in the US.

120
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,300
I was the Marketing Team Leader for five years.

121
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,490
I was in charge of the projects related to President Obama and other important U.S officials.

122
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,470
What about you?

123
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,820
Your experience.

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,930
I am ...

125
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,380
currently working as an intern with the Mobile Shopping Team.

126
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,900
Intern?

127
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,710
What is this?
Weren't they selecting people with experiences?

128
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,880
Oh my god.

129
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,350
Na Ae Ra... don't be discouraged.

130
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,950
You are here because you were scouted.

131
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,990
I like you.

132
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,900
I really like you!

133
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,240
How are you doing this interview?

134
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,760
Huh?

135
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,160
I really... can't accept this.

136
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,770
That a lowly intern is doing this interview.

137
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,980
What's with the unlucky 'tongue roller'?!

138
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,410
It can't be based on your abilities.

139
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,340
Seeing how you're pretty and all, I wonder if

140
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,440
you have a sponsor somewhere.

141
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,670
Excuse me!

142
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,890
I should take care of that one!

143
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,430
Oh my god.

144
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,210
Jolie Choi? What's Jolie Choi?

145
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,030
Are you an imitation of Angelina Jolie?

146
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,190
As I've always said, you should keep your manners, even when you're saying mean things.

147
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,650
My heart condition and mental condition are really sensitive today,

148
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,150
so don't bother me or I'll...

149
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,200
Oh my God.
- I could jump you, right now.

150
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,940
Ah, she's so ignorant.

151
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,420
Oh my god, you surprised me.

152
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,310
Jolin Choi?

153
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,470
Oh, sorry.

154
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,460
Jolly Choi.

155
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,110
Yes?

156
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,710
The higher-ups at this hotel would like to see you now.

157
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,290
Me?

158
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,100
Actually, the interview is just for formality.

159
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,190
The higher-ups have already...

160
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,480
They've already decided on Jolly Choi.

161
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,560
I knew it.

162
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,370
Should I go now?
-Yes. To the rooftop.

163
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,800
Rooftop. Okay.

164
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,440
I don't know if I should...

165
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,810
But, actually, this is a tip...

166
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,840
But the higher-ups at this hotel

167
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,730
are going to see if Jolly Choi

168
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,760
is going to take this elevator or if you're going to walk up the stairs

169
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,990
and make their decision based on that.

170
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,440
In my opinion, how it will be if Jolie Choi takes the stairs,

171
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,940
and show them your perseverance.

172
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,410
The rooftop...

173
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,300
is at the 20th floor.. and this is..

174
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,610
the 2nd floor. Second floor.

175
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,960
Okay. I got it.

176
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,950
Yeah!

177
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,400
Fighting, Jolly!

178
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,760
Fighting!
-You got it!

179
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,440
Jolie... wow...

180
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,840
What do you consider to be your biggest strength?

181
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,500
I... believe that the relationship between a company and an employee is like fate.

182
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,240
Therefore, I believe that each and every person is precious.

183
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,880
And there is no such thing as a project that isn't important.

184
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,270
Na Ae Ra! Where are you right now?

185
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,920
Is this dinner?

186
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,660
I just felt like eating something sweet.

187
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,570
I think I'm going to be sweet.

188
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,080
Do you want eat some of mine? It's sweet.

189
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,900
You got some on you.

190
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,690
Huh?

191
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,500
Over there.

192
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,610
Where?

193
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,770
Here! Gosh.

194
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,830
Did your interview go well?

195
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,080
Why are there so many?

196
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,620
This and that.

197
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,520
The result of the interview is coming out in
a couple weeks, and...

198
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,520
Ae Ra,

199
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,440
you really... don't like my company?

200
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,280
I do. I like the work and the people there.

201
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,780
But... just because of the situation...

202
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,180
If it's that, then it's fine.

203
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,160
What is?

204
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,880
There's something like that.

205
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,080
Let's eat dinner.

206
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,270
What is this?

207
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,310
I have to do this, so it'll be safe.

208
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,290
Where is this?

209
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,860
Just trust me and follow me. Because it's a nice place.

210
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,970
Are you there? I can't see anything.

211
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,340
I'm cutting the pork cutlet now.

212
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,160
Why isn't it working? Oh!

213
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,190
What is this?

214
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,120
Did it fly over here?

215
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,990
Where did it go? Stay still for a moment.

216
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,750
Where is it? Is it here?
-Where are you....?

217
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,890
Aigoo, is it here?
-Are you crazy?

218
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,280
What do you mean I'm crazy?
-Hey, Cha Jeong Woo!

219
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,820
Are you okay?

220
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,590
Wait, I think your string came undone back here.

221
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,210
I'll do it for you.
-Stop!

222
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,530
I said to stay still. Only I can do this.
-I'll do it!

223
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,900
Stay...!

224
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,570
Okay...

225
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,560
Don't laugh.

226
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,570
Don't laugh!

227
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,190
Ae Ra, are you mad?

228
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,940
No.

229
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,110
That's good.

230
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,730
Look...

231
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,770
I couldn't really see you because it was so dark.

232
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,320
I'm sorry.

233
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,440
It's fine. You can make mistakes.

234
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,440
You said that this was the fun of coming here.

235
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,660
Not just now.

236
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,200
Earlier.

237
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,270
From the time I caught you going on the interview until now.

238
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
I, actually,

239
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,230
couldn't see or hear anything because it was so dark in front of me.

240
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,280
But I think I can see things one by one now.

241
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,050
Things are clearer because I can't see.

242
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,300
Jeong Woo..

243
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,320
Your heart that must have felt wronged.

244
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,560
Your heart that must have felt resentful.

245
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,380
Now that I can see it,

246
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,070
I'm really a terrible person.

247
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,200
Ae Ra,

248
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,840
even so,

249
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,390
can't you watch

250
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,800
how I'll get closer to you from now on??

251
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,750
♫ The words that are too bitter to swallow. ♫

252
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:07,310
♫ To the depths of my heart I really love you. ♫

253
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,810
No lights allowed in this place.

254
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,830
Yes.

255
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,340
Mister!

256
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,840
Yes, yes, I apologize.

257
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,020
Find the light.

258
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,680
We're here.

259
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,860
Yeah...

260
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,330
But... is this the only place you can stay?

261
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,210
Even if he's a colleague, it's still a man's house.

262
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,770
I'm only living with Min Yeong, so it's fine.

263
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,700
This won't do, come to my place.

264
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,350
I told you I'd take care of it myself.

265
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,840
You need to be careful.

266
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,730
Of what?

267
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,370
Of everything!

268
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,050
Everything lingering around!

269
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,200
You're the most dangerous one!

270
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,770
Go quickly.

271
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,560
Go, quickly.

272
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,280
I'm really going now.

273
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,150
You'll fall. Walk properly.

274
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,340
Good night, Ae Ra.

275
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,000
How could you cut off all calls and go into hiding?

276
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,690
I felt upset.

277
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,350
That is...

278
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,530
You don't have to explain.

279
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,070
Wait. Shouldn't you be making excuses?

280
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,830
Normal lovers would nag each other in situations like this.

281
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,900
That's what lovers do.

282
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:23,250
Seung Hyeon, I'm grateful for how you feel, but...

283
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,730
I'm tired from waiting all day.

284
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,530
I'll go now.

285
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,410
Seung Hyeon...

286
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:38,860
♫ You won’t know, you won’t know ♫

287
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,410
♫ How much I'm longing for you. ♫

288
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:53,050
♫ I don't know, I really don't know. ♫

289
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:59,950
♫ Do you have to leave me like this? ♫

290
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,730
Diet

291
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,340
I'll have to start taking care of my body again.

292
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,560
Here.

293
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,980
Where did you go in the afternoon? I couldn't reach you.

294
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,250
I took care of something really important and urgent.

295
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,050
What was it?

296
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,940
A company's core human power almost got discharged.

297
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,770
I stopped it from happening.

298
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,970
But you can't lose the competition.

299
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,110
From now on, I'm in an emergency mode, so don't look for me even if you can't suddenly reach me.

300
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,370
I got it.

301
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,250
What?

302
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,430
I was saying that...you must have gotten over your illness.

303
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,080
What are you thinking of?

304
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,220
Yes.

305
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,210
What's going on this late at night?
And what's with this alcohol?

306
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
You came.

307
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,180
Stop drinking.

308
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,100
Let go.

309
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,830
I told you to not act like a teacher in front of me, didn't I?

310
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,260
Aren't you going to get a hold of yourself?

311
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,270
What? Are you saying that to yourself?

312
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,510
You're the one who should get a hold of yourself.

313
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,760
What are you doing in between 2 women?

314
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,540
That's what you're curious about?

315
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,870
Okay then, I'll give you an answer.

316
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,180
Think well before you speak.
I think I'm going to go a little crazy these days.

317
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,800
I...

318
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,700
am going to start over with Na Ae Ra.

319
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,800
Then...

320
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,740
what about my sister?

321
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,450
You're going to throw her away?
Since you've used her as much as you need to...

322
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,780
What? While saying you're sorry?

323
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,880
Shut your mouth.

324
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,570
So, "No comment" on that?

325
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,200
It's not that I don't know why you're like this, but

326
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,490
I'm not one to play around with liking a person.

327
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,290
So don't say this lightly.

328
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,670
There's a limit to letting go just because you're young.

329
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,850
Stop drinking!

330
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,920
Don't butt in.

331
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:45,000
I ... want to protect both ... you and Ae Ra.

332
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,930
And I'm going put in my effort to do that.

333
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,160
What if ... you can only choose one?

334
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,000
I hope that won't happen.

335
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,660
Please get a cab for him.

336
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,340
I'm going.

337
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,680
There's no need to look after me.

338
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,710
You should just take care of yourself.

339
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,070
Even so,

340
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,270
can't you wait and see...

341
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,070
how I'm going to get closer to you?

342
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,070
I like you.

343
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,910
I'm saying that I really like you!

344
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,550
D&T Soft Ventures' investment funds are blocked?

345
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:19,290
D&T Soft Ventures, who were looking for investors
with the development of a new game,

346
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,660
are hitting a road block with investments ...

347
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,290
What is that about?

348
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,360
It's an editorial blog.

349
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,650
The future looks bleak...

350
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,310
Are they the weather station?!
With whose permission are they to give an advanced notice?

351
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,500
Tell them that I'm going to sue them all.

352
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
For circulation of malignant rumors!

353
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,730
You used to not care about editorial blogs.

354
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,410
Why are you so sensitive these days?

355
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,750
I'm... I'm a patient.

356
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,270
Alright, alright.

357
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,160
You and your patient act.

358
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,960
This is an example of how we can combine messenger and mobile shopping service,

359
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,150
which was brought up at the company workshop earlier.
Let's take a look at it.

360
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,380
I am a little late.

361
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,690
Continue on, Team Leader Wang.

362
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:47,240
I'm thinking about making these points
to be used like cash at the shopping mall.

363
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,750
It sounds like a good idea.

364
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:55,140
For the launching luxury promotion event this time, you'll be going with a luxury appraisal show?

365
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,230
Na Ae Ra?

366
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,650
Ah, yes.

367
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,260
Since, we plan on selling the luxury goods
at a discounted price,

368
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,640
there are a lot of comments whether the luxury products
we're selling are fakes.

369
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,330
So we can provide information on
separating whether something is fake or authentic.

370
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,420
I'm wondering if we should proceed with an event to emphasize

371
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,500
that we don't sell counterfeit products.

372
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,400
You look pretty today.

373
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,490
It does sound okay,

374
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,090
but what's the estimated size of offline customers?

375
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,450
It's not likely to get all the customers in one place.

376
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,530
Ah, that...

377
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,860
What about linking it from our company's homepage
to the internet and broadcasting it?

378
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,810
Since the goal is to inform many people rather than having a big event.

379
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,150
Go ahead and proceed with it.

380
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,090
Promotion is fine,
but don't forget the importance of holding onto

381
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,950
your current clientele.

382
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,770
Yes.

383
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,430
You look pretty today.

384
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,720
What am I doing right now?

385
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,260
You've already drawn up a list of appraisers?

386
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,480
We just got it confirmed.

387
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,840
I drew it up,
ever since the event was first discussed.

388
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,410
Yes.

389
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,360
Just because it's your first meeting,
don't feel intimidated.

390
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,400
Excuse me?

391
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,250
Yes.

392
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,950
They're ultimate professionals,
if you let them push you around and be nice, then

393
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,440
our shopping mall will have to close its doors.

394
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,320
Shouldn't we do our best at a time like this when
our company isn't doing so well?

395
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
Yes.

396
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,470
If I get overzealous and run around,
Team Leader Wang, please hold me back.

397
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:44,120
Ms. Ae Ra,
you sure do run around a bit.

398
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,110
Even if you feel that way,

399
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:51,650
if you show yourself that easily,
then your opponent will see your cards.

400
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,230
For a woman having to live alone,

401
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,720
you have to be more strict with yourself.

402
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,200
Let's succeed in a big way again and celebrate with a party.

403
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,720
Hello, CEO.

404
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,860
What about this one?

405
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,910
♬ Mirror, mirror, who does this person like? ♬

406
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:57,630
♬ Heaven, heaven, who is he thinking of? ♬

407
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,030
♬ Guessing and curious about the look in your eyes♬

408
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,240
♫ From now, and you and I.♫

409
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,740
Oh, I'm sorry!

410
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,470
Ah, my hand had a spasm.

411
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,720
♬ Mirror, mirror, who does this person like? ♬

412
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,410
♬ Heaven, heaven, who is he thinking of? ♬

413
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,840
♬ Guessing and curious about the look in your eyes ♬

414
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,030
♬ From now on, you and I, ♬

415
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,430
♬ should we get to know each other? ♬

416
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,770
Of course, the atmosphere at the office is so-so.

417
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,220
If the investors back out, what can the CEO do?

418
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,420
The reports have already been passed around,
so it's obvious for the investors.

419
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,240
Me?

420
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,990
If I can, I'd like to stay here. There's nowhere else for me to go.

421
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,530
Okay, if something comes up, I'll let you know.

422
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,670
Oh, you startled me!

423
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,210
Manager Kang?

424
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,000
Is the company in a lot of difficulty now?

425
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,290
Well, truthfully it's in a crisis.

426
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,710
Our CEO is already infamous
for having excessive scuffles with investors.

427
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,260
Do you think they'll be easy on him when he's not on their good side? They'll say, "Try being in the hot water!"

428
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,250
But an intern like you doesn't have to worry.

429
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,480
Last time, there was a situation like this.

430
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,120
And the CEO and Director Guk were able to get past it.

431
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,360
So, with this, we'll have to trust them both again.

432
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,090
You came out.

433
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,110
I thought you'd be asleep because it's so late.

434
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,330
I got up from sleeping.

435
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,330
But what is it at this hour?

436
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,590
Just because.

437
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,210
What is it?

438
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,800
Did something happen?

439
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,160
Ae Ra,

440
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,850
can I hold you once?

441
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,550
Excuse me?

442
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,950
Seung Hyeon.

443
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,190
Please.

444
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,490
Just stay like this for a moment.

445
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,620
Please.

446
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,140
You...

447
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,480
might be...

448
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,550
really disappointed in me in the future.

449
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,910
Why are you acting so strange?

450
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,900
Because I became certain of how much I like you.

451
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,200
So I am never going to step aside.

452
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,820
Today's confession,

453
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,850
it doesn't matter if I'm the only one to like you.

454
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,630
I won't ever give up on you.

455
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,140
Sorry for waking you up.

456
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,300
Go back and sleep.

457
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,660
What is this?

458
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,910
The list of contributors

459
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,410
that can fund us immediately.

460
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,100
This isn't the kind of money we can use clearly.

461
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,360
You also said that this money is dangerous.

462
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,980
We're not in the situation to pick and choose.

463
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,460
This money

464
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,900
will end up holding our company down.

465
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,020
We can't.

466
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,510
Then do you want to release an article announcing our marriage?

467
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,530
In this situation,

468
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,980
isn't this the safest and reliable way to

469
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,900
get our funds?

470
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,140
You know that, too.

471
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,980
With just one line about our marriage in an article, a new investment is a guarantee,

472
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,940
and we can also block the investments from leaving.

473
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,990
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

474
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,230
Why?
-Because ultimately, it's deceiving the investors with lies!

475
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,560
There must be another way.
I'll find it, so just wait a while longer.

476
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,440
If you change your mind,

477
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,400
there is an easy way to avoid a crisis.

478
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,660
I don't want to use you for this.

479
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,940
It's not because of Na Ae Ra?

480
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,450
Are you thinking about remarrying her?

481
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,250
Is that why we can't release news articles about marriage?

482
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,470
I do not take care of business matters with personal feelings.

483
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,330
It's just that,

484
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,600
I think I'll have to say this.

485
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,360
I can't accept your heart.

486
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,810
I'm sorry.

487
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,070
So from now on...
-I think I need to say this, too.

488
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,390
The danger this company is in right now,

489
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,960
with the method that you have,

490
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,490
we can never overcome this.

491
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,270
I told you the best method that I can do.

492
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:57,000
The judgement... is up to you.

493
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,000
CEO, the Unified Shilla Hotel CEO has contacted you.

494
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,330
I was surprised after hearing from the secretary.

495
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,470
I knew that you don't usually invest in this field.

496
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,750
Yes, I don't.

497
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,030
There's too much competition there.

498
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,860
But somehow,

499
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,260
it turned out like this.

500
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,510
Let's just say that I came to trust you while looking at this project.

501
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:43,820
I'll invest as much as you need right now.

502
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,820
Whatever the reason,

503
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,020
I'm really grateful that you're investing like this.

504
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,060
I can't accept that money for nothing.

505
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,440
Soon, there will be a fresh project that the company will announce.

506
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,720
I can't tell you about it right now, but if we can announce it,

507
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,740
it's something that will make a big mark in mobile shopping.

508
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,850
Since Shilla is investing in it,

509
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,300
I'll see to that you get some profit.

510
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,550
It's interesting.

511
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,710
This side, that side.

512
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,120
Excuse me?

513
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,800
Never mind. I do have a stipulation.

514
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,530
Give us a small role in...

515
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:32,150
the management of the company.

516
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,870
That......
-We won't directly get involved in management.

517
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,870
But please let my delegate take my place.

518
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,300
Because I absolutely have my trust in you.

519
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,510
Just... it'll be fine if you can just think of it

520
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,900
as collateral.

521
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,880
Hey, I did it the way you told me to,

522
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,510
but what are you scheming right now?

523
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,540
What do you mean "scheming?"

524
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,550
But even if it weren't for you,

525
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,150
I think it was good to make an investment.

526
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,570
That CEO Cha has charisma

527
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,970
and is very reliable.

528
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,860
He's a person I really like.

529
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,860
What? What I just did,

530
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,590
is it a knife in the back, or a shield to block the knife?

531
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,310
Well...

532
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,450
I'm contemplating that.

533
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,450
Hey! Is dating all you're doing nowadays?!

534
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,190
I'm looking at your grades from Korea!

535
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,770
Of course!

536
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,370
I think I have to hang up now.

537
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,050
Son, I love you, I miss you, I'll call you again!

538
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,530
I think I was a bother to you...

539
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,430
No, no, it's not.

540
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:19,690
I was worried, so I wanted to hear my kid's voice.

541
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,570
Is there something wrong?

542
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,940
My tooth is hurting suddenly.

543
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,420
The company is up and down
and if it gets worse,

544
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:31,030
I'm afraid that my desk will be taken away (get fired),
so I can't leave the office.

545
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,770
Look at what I'm saying. I'm sorry.

546
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,360
Please sit.

547
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,450
Here.

548
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,450
I'll only accept it because of my tooth.

549
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,790
Is he your son?
-Yeah, he's my second child.

550
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,910
I told him to study, but why is he just dating?

551
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,930
But it's good to see that.

552
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,020
You have someone to talk to when it's hard.

553
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,140
Yes, I like that.

554
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,960
But it's not like we didn't have a crisis as well.

555
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,260
Crisis?
- Was it when my first child was three?

556
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,530
Ah...while I was raving about, trying to do my own business,
I blew all the money away!

557
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:19,040
Back then, my wife said she couldn't live with me and wanted to put a seal on it (divorce papers).

558
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,770
Oh, just the thought of it now...

559
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,800
Then, but how ...?

560
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,620
Oh...

561
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,260
because of our second rascal.

562
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,010
When we were fighting whether we should end it or not, my wife got pregnant with this one.

563
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,680
My wife said this back then.

564
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,570
"Even though it was difficult, what can we do?"

565
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,890
Just think that our second is our hope,

566
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,490
and to start over again.

567
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,080
Oh, to all parents,

568
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,280
their children are their hope.

569
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,250
Don't they live to watch their children?

570
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,110
You succeeded,

571
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,930
and even if you were to repay all of those debts because of it,

572
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,120
nothing would have changed for me.

573
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,170
Because that money

574
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:13,030
wouldn't have been able to revive our hope that disappeared.

575
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,410
Lost hope..

576
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,970
Hope...

577
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,210
Was it you?

578
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,860
I'm sorry..

579
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,520
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

580
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,080
Gosh, what kind of woman...?

581
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,940
Did you get trained in combative sport?!

582
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,160
It's because you grabbed me from behind.

583
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,510
Geez, you're always sneaky!
It serves you right!

584
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,000
I knew it would be like this.

585
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,390
Now I feel like I can live.

586
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,870
Isn't it really difficult?

587
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,950
I heard all the financial resources are cut.

588
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,410
You don't even have a penny?!

589
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,010
That's so like you!

590
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,220
I do have a penny!

591
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,800
Don't worry.

592
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,550
What do you mean worry ...

593
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,060
It's because I might not get paid.

594
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:50,330
And what's with your face? Why did you come here when you're having a hard time?

595
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,440
You being here is the hardest for me.

596
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,360
I'll go to Min Yeong's house tomorrow.

597
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,950
Don't misunderstand, because I am not leaving because of you.

598
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,610
My stress just got pushed away in one shove.

599
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,810
I have to go to the office.

600
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,120
I'll leave.

601
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,150
Good night.

602
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,230
Cha Jeong Woo!

603
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,920
You are okay, right?

604
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,390
Who am I?

605
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,950
I am the IT field's leader, Cha-Era ... Cha Jeong Woo!

606
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,830
I'll be leaving.

607
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,660
Ae Ra?

608
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,530
What?

609
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,790
Last time, on the rooftop...

610
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,390
Never mind.

611
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,210
Good night. I'll leave.

612
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,220
Are you alright?

613
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,090
I am alright.

614
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,780
In the afternoon, there was another call from Dr. Kim.

615
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,030
If you don't come to the regular check up this time...

616
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:54,160
I will take care of that.

617
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,570
Even then...

618
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,550
I told you I would take care of that.

619
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,130
Director!

620
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,640
Let go!

621
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,360
I told you to let go!

622
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:45,880
CEO Cha ... this bastard!

623
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:58,740
Luxury Emotion Show with D.

624
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,960
Check often on the internet live broadcasting screen.

625
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,000
If the connections come in too fast and the broadcast can't go out out properly,

626
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,500
immediately get the support of the server team that's on standby.

627
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,800
Yes.

628
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,670
Did you check the commentary?
- Yes.

629
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,690
Hello.

630
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,610
CEO, thank you

631
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,630
for coming all the way here.

632
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,470
I can't just let such an important event for the company pass by.

633
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,520
But why is it

634
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,780
that I don't see the person responsible on scene?

635
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,120
Oh, Na Ae Ra? She is in the warehouse.

636
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,050
She has to check on the bags that we'll use for the event.

637
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,890
Warehouse?

638
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,550
Warehouse.

639
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,960
Aiyoo, that warehouse is nice.

640
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,060
It's really dark and remote...

641
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,520
Excuse me?

642
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,260
Ah, it's nothing.

643
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,340
You're about to crawl into that bag.

644
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,870
You scared me.

645
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:37,320
I'm in the middle of doing some really delicate and important work here.

646
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,380
What is that?

647
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,430
What are you doing?

648
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:54,600
This is the real luxury product. Look at the buckle.

649
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,130
This is fake.

650
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,150
Although they look the same, there is a difference.

651
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,330
The length of the buckle on the real luxury product is...

652
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,460
a bit shorter than the one on the fake one.

653
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,460
The real product is exactly...

654
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,630
1.35 cm.

655
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,580
You didn't know, right?

656
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:16,350
I've worked in a luxury shop so I do have an eye for these things.

657
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:22,160
You know Company "C", right? There, the fake one is where the curve of the logo is wide at the angle.

658
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,340
And for the Company "D", you can differentiate by

659
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,040
whether the logo is engraved or not on the front button.

660
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,360
Isn't it hard?

661
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,080
Yeah, it is hard.

662
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,370
What are you doing? I explained it all to you.

663
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,160
I guess you have a lot of spare time.

664
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,350
No. I am really busy.

665
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,650
I came by here coincidentally.

666
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:50,880
You had your nose embedded in this bag so I came, just in case, you went into respiratory distress and died.

667
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,730
Aiyoo, you.

668
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,010
CEO, you were here.

669
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,830
Yes.

670
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,740
I came by here for a moment while I am on my way to the meeting.

671
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,620
Oh, is that so? Then, I guess you'll have to leave soon.

672
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,670
Keep up the good work.

673
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,580
Na Ae Ra has no time to waste.

674
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:32,430
Then please keep up the good work.

675
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,320
Then I will go work.

676
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:53,240
Okay. Please work hard.

677
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,770
Because it'll become your last work at this company.

678
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,670
Right, Na Ae Ra?

679
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,970
Can you please move?

680
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,200
Because I have to pass through.

681
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,870
Yes, Appraiser. Have you arrived?

682
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,730
Yes, I will go to the lobby.

683
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:37,690
Luxury bag sold by Don't Talk.

684
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,530
Yes.

685
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,140
The appraiser has arrived.

686
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,900
You've come?

687
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,640
You can just check this.

688
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,490
Yes.

689
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,410
What are you doing, not bringing the bags?

690
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,140
Yes. I've brought the bags.

691
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,250
Okay. Now it is all done.

692
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,760
Ok, here.

693
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,060
They're all matched up.

694
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,330
Are you nervous?

695
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,610
A bit, since it's my first time broadcasting like this.

696
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,740
There is no need to be nervous. Do you want to see the screen?

697
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,080
Why? Is there a problem?

698
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,360
It's 30 seconds before broadcast. You're all ready right?!

699
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,390
Yes.

700
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,160
What should I do?

701
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,210
How....

702
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,170
Wait a minute!

703
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,690
Wait a minute.

704
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,740
What is the matter?

705
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,770
Have you gone crazy?

706
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,650
The bag was switched.

707
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,610
What did you just say?

708
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,650
Oh my...

709
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:30,010
The bag was switched.

710
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,460
So how did it go?

711
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,150
They weren't even able to start. The internet message boards are a mess with all the commotion being raised.

712
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,830
What will happen to Na Ae Ra?

713
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,020
Hey, go find out what's happened.

714
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,470
No. No. I will go.

715
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:58,070
Hello.

716
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,110
Hello.

717
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:04,590
Yes. Please have a seat first. Have a seat.

718
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,920
But Ae Ra, it was you...who was in the warehouse before the broadcast.

719
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,850
Think about it well. If you get blamed all for this...

720
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:18,690
Aigoo, aigoo, think about it well! Oh.

721
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,910
Secretary Kim...

722
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,370
Secretary Kim?

723
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,340
No.

724
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,700
Tell me again.

725
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,900
It was ordered by Chairman.

726
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,380
How could he do such a....

727
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,510
Are there any other people who know about it?

728
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,920
There are none.

729
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,130
The CCTVs from the warehouse onwards, collect all of them.

730
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:47,790
If it goes into someone else's hands (finds out),
it'll become a headache.

731
00:59:56,850 --> 01:00:03,050
♫ What do I do? What do I do? ♫
