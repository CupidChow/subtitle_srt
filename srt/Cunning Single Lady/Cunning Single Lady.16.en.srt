1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,190
Yes, this is Cha Jeong Woo.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,130
Hello. You can save money on your phone calls

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,180
just by becoming a member, the nation's first ...

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,280
What a pretty scene.

5
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,020
Where do you think you're going?

6
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,810
Look at you!

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,750
Cha Jeong Woo, today you will die.

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,210
You quit and leave the company?!

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,370
It just happened that way.

10
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,060
It just happened?

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,590
The CEO of the company becomes a beggar in one morning, and it just happened?!

12
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,990
You know what this is, right?

13
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,800
It was in the trashcan!

14
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,880
Why did you pick this back up?

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,340
Are you in your right mind?

16
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,630
How can you quit the company?!

17
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,390
Did you act so conceited when you left to come there and do this?

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,070
You're just playing games!

19
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,630
It's not that... I just thought I could do well again.

20
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,390
But right now, it's not like it's going so badly.

21
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,900
Who do you think you're fooling here again with that three year old lie.

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,100
I won't be fooled again.

23
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,490
The IT industry's leader of the Cha generation?

24
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,660
It'd be a relief if you had three cars.
(car and generation are homonyms in Korean)

25
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,470
Ae Ra,

26
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,400
it's a little different from then.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,260
Forget it.

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,250
This is the end of us.

29
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,500
I can't look at this twice. Cha Jeong Woo,

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,990
don't ever appear in front of me again.

31
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,240
Final Episode

32
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,070
Cheer up.

33
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,870
You can do it.

34
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,400
Have you eaten?

35
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,220
Cha Jeong Woo, don't be discouraged.

36
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,320
Na Ae Ra, what does it matter to you?

37
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,250
Oh, you.

38
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,580
Cha Jeong Woo, don't appear in front of me again. Ever.

39
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,610
See you tomorrow, Ae Ra.

40
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,420
Jeong Woo!

41
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,930
Jeong Woo! Open the door!

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,460
Jeong Woo...

43
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,320
He's not here.

44
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,670
Anyway, if he concentrates on one thing, he won't even know if you perform an exorcism next to him.

45
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,250
Cha Jeong Woo!

46
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,600
Ae Ra.

47
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm so dumbstruck that the words won't come out.

48
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,400
Are you well enough to play games?

49
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,450
Ae Ra, it's not that, this is...

50
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,130
What?

51
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,880
So it was you...

52
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,900
The proxy for Unified Shilla Hotel's CEO.

53
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,610
Yes.

54
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,150
What's this about taking the CEO position again?

55
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,060
It seems that D&T needs a person called Cha Jeong Woo.

56
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,520
Is there some problem with the newly released game?

57
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,190
Well... There's no serious problem yet.

58
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,430
That's a relief. Still, keep your eye on it.

59
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,850
You don't have any thoughts of coming back?

60
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,700
There are people at the company who hope you'll come back.

61
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,590
A few investors do... as well as the employees.

62
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,630
Well, other people, too...

63
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,970
The investors?

64
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,280
Dad's health hasn't been good, so they're just nervous!

65
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,390
Those people believe in Cha Jeong Woo's name value right after money.

66
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,140
Yeo Jin will lead the way well,

67
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,940
so you take care of her well from next to her.

68
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,890
For now, I've told you my intent.

69
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,180
I guess the choice will be made by you.

70
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,410
Should I help you today, too?

71
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,930
Seung Hyeon!

72
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,120
The talk we were having earlier about the company...

73
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,530
Let's talk some more about the company. How can you just leave like that, you punk ...

74
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,550
Just go and work.

75
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,200
But I was going to talk more about the company...

76
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,350
Let's go.

77
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,540
The company...

78
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,660
Ahjussi! Hm, look at this...

79
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,770
Why are you here alone? I'll help you put this on.

80
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,310
Let's wear our shoes.

81
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,770
I even thought whether to have an abortion.

82
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,170
Because you and I

83
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,900
were not prepared to raise a child.

84
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,000
But...

85
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,960
the child inside me gave me strength.

86
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,380
If I work hard and give birth to the child,

87
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,070
the hope of living happily would also appear.

88
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,940
So,

89
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,910
I gritted my teeth harder and lived diligently.

90
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,900
That, for that matter,

91
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,480
was where my happy memories ended.

92
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,050
When I lost the child, my love and hopes for you

93
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,860
completely ended in one moment.

94
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,590
The only thing left in our relationship was just scars.

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,010
That's when I decided.

96
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,900
It's time to really end this.

97
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,830
Are you looking at the baby or the father right now? If it's the father, it's going to be a headache.

98
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,440
It's both. When I see them together, it's nicer to look at.

99
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,820
Oh right, sorry about last time.

100
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,350
I left without letting you know.

101
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,580
You did, didn't you? Why might you have left without telling me?

102
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,800
I feel more indebted to you as time goes on.

103
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,930
Today you came to tell Jeong Woo about what's happening at the company, right?

104
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,340
Yes, well... Roughly, company talk.

105
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,840
If he hears things like that, he'll be stimulated
and it will help him with his work.

106
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,710
Ae Ra, you only have worries about Jeong Woo.

107
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,250
Since I worry a lot about Yeo Jin these days, too.

108
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,580
Well, if she lets go of her anger on her own, she'll get better.

109
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,800
I didn't think ... it might be harder for Director Guk.

110
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,990
How are you, Ae Ra?

111
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,890
Are you still enduring it to the point of death?

112
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,750
I thought that everything would be resolved if I disappeared,

113
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,350
but after the matter turned out like this, I'm not sure.

114
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,080
Right now, I don't talk about love and only think about
Jeong Woo's come back.

115
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,650
You're enduring well.

116
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,270
I'm going to have to try to endure well, too.

117
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,520
Aiyoo, I'm so starved, body and heart.

118
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,950
Hey, when are you going to buy that meal you're always telling me you're going to buy for me?

119
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,530
I'll buy it, really.
- Make sure to buy it.

120
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,280
Since I'm like this,

121
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,950
you must be relieved inside.

122
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,940
That's not true.

123
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,100
No matter what's happened, you're my savior.

124
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,930
We each think differently

125
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,260
and the paths we traveled were different,

126
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,560
but you're not a person to whom I should lose my thanks.

127
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,320
All right.

128
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,230
If you think that way, I'm grateful.

129
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,850
I will pray for your recovery.

130
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,290
Can it truly not be?

131
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,410
It must be time

132
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,560
for this Guk Gi Bong to leave,

133
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,180
I keep getting forgetful.

134
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,110
I don't have

135
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,540
any regrets even if I died today,

136
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,820
but just one thing does bother me.

137
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,330
If I'm not here, what would happen to Yeo Jin and Seung Hyeon?

138
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,840
CEO Cha, couldn't you stay next to them?

139
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,990
I got a call from that person.

140
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,930
I understand.

141
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,620
If I'm going to go anyway,

142
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,230
I'm thinking to stake my life on it!

143
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,330
Team Leader, are you ready as well?!

144
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,740
Yes.
- Wait!

145
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,920
Why are you like that?

146
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,530
This side, this side, this side.

147
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,690
Then let's see each other after we get off work.

148
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,360
Yes.

149
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,530
There's something there.

150
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,290
Brother-in-law Cha, include me, too.

151
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,490
Peel well thinly.

152
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,240
Aiyoo.

153
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,710
Father-in-law, drink some juice as you work.

154
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,670
Aiyoo, I'm not going to drink it. I'll gain weight.

155
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,240
It's vegetable juice so there's no reason to worry about gaining weight.

156
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,830
Sook Ja, she says that it's good for you.

157
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:12,040
That's true. I went to the market and they said it was 100% domestically farmed, so I bought it and made this.

158
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,170
Father-in-law, drink it as you work.

159
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,650
Aiyoo, she's so pleasant and steadfast.

160
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,940
I think she's perfect as Soo Cheol's partner.

161
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,710
Honey, I think we do have daughter-in-law luck.

162
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,180
Daughter-in-laws are good, too,
but let's also feed Son-in-law Cha.

163
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,730
He's so close by ...

164
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,210
What Son-in-law Cha?

165
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,880
I told you not to appear in front of me.

166
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,810
Soup with rice.

167
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,590
Give me a bowl of soup with rice.

168
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,940
Give me a bowl of soup with rice, soup with rice.

169
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,530
You're going to come out so brazenly, huh?

170
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,240
Ah, Ahjummoni.

171
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,180
Scallions, scallions. Give me a lot of scallions.

172
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,670
Although you probably remember.

173
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,390
Aigoo, these damn grill plates.

174
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,470
I'm so old that I can't clean them alone.

175
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,980
We'll have to find a part-timer worker.

176
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,160
It's 3 meal tickets ...

177
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,700
Father-in-law, I'll do them, I will!

178
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,970
A man has to have a steady income.

179
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,230
So that women don't look down on you. Look at Soo Cheol.

180
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,680
Look how Sook Ja completely changed her mind. You can make Ae Ra do that, too.

181
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,880
Cheer up!

182
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,860
Thank you, Father-in-law.

183
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,200
As a service (tip), shall I let you in on a secret that helps the relationship of a married couple?

184
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,370
Is there such a thing?

185
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,650
There was this one old married couple that had lived 80 years of conjugal harmony together.

186
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,460
So people asked what is the secret to your married bliss?

187
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,710
And that couple said that there were just

188
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:19,270
two things you had to do properly. "I'm sorry, Honey" and "I understand."

189
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,200
If there's a reason to apologize then, "I'm sorry, Honey," in a hurry.

190
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,080
If there's a reason for an apology then, "I understand, Honey."

191
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,690
Even while it seems easy to do, it's actually hard to do.

192
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,200
And for a man, strength!

193
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,330
Wouldn't it be strength.

194
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,310
Strength!

195
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,770
Oh.
- What?

196
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,720
Oh, it's ok. I'll get it.
- Oh.

197
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,400
Yes.

198
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,760
Are you sure, Manager Kang?

199
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,030
What about the atmosphere?

200
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,610
It's very difficult. Whether it's a simple bug or not,

201
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,900
they seem to be checking it.

202
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,590
Yes, then keep checking on the situation and please call me.

203
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,570
Yes, yes. Yes.

204
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,400
Is it company work?

205
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,860
No, what company...

206
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,240
I'm back!

207
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,830
Oh my God!

208
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,750
You should have made your presence known.

209
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,190
What are you doing?

210
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,280
What? Oh,

211
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,890
I was going to have a drink with Soo Cheol Oppa.

212
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,870
Is my brother here? Where is he?

213
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,920
Well...

214
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,840
But what are you eating?

215
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,670
I'm thinking of doing some maintenance.

216
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:09,250
You...Are you conscious of Jeong Woo, so...

217
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,380
You sly wench!

218
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,710
No, it's not like that.

219
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,800
Aiyoo, Hyungnim, really...

220
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,810
But that's true.

221
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,820
They say that even if a rich man is ruined, he can last 3 years.

222
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,120
You fell down too fast.

223
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,160
Oppa, why do you say things to make Jeong Woo upset?

224
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,490
Aiyoo, it's okay, it's okay.

225
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,200
I'll go bring some water.

226
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,050
Oh, oh, I'll go with you. I'd better bring some more beer and appetizers, too.

227
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,240
Brother-in-law Cha,

228
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,220
are you by chance

229
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,390
thinking to make a comeback as the company CEO?

230
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,840
What?

231
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,330
What CEO comeback?

232
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,940
When I saw how you answered the phone earlier, it seems like there's a problem with the company.

233
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,130
Using that as your platform... Huh?

234
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,010
No?

235
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,210
No, it's not. It's not, really!

236
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,050
You really... Such disappointing kind of... tsk..

237
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,340
Actually...

238
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,380
there's a problem with the game at the company.

239
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,970
But there's something I've prepared, just in case ...

240
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,130
I thought it might be of help.

241
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,970
You're such a busy body!

242
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,230
But since it's something that I made with my own hands, I can't help but be concerned.

243
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,690
Why would you help out a company that kicked you out?

244
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,310
Worry about yourself!

245
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,920
And here I thought...

246
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,690
Geesh! That planning manager.

247
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,530
I told you that I wasn't.

248
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,590
♫ I truly love you. ♫

249
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:15,900
♫ I truly love you. ♫

250
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:23,080
♫ I truly love you. ♫

251
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,790
♫ I love you. ♫

252
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:36,730
♫ Those words fill up my mouth, but I can't say them ♫

253
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:44,800
♫ The words are too bitter to swallow ♫

254
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,500
Oh ...

255
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,040
Did you sleep well?

256
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,680
[adds formality]

257
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,630
What is this?

258
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,060
My resume. I want to work here.

259
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,150
Ah, I'd like to work here. Pre-si-dent.

260
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,460
Here?

261
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,440
[formality]

262
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,250
As long as you pay me, you know that I am a diligent worker.

263
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,220
There's nothing for you to do here.

264
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,520
There is. A personal secretary.

265
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,880
Now, let's start the interview.

266
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,630
Oh my ...

267
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,910
I said to do it!

268
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,560
Then tell me just one thing.

269
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,370
The reason I should hire you.

270
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,720
Is there a secretary who would know as much as I do about you?

271
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,630
Passed.

272
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,070
We currently stopped the gaming service and we put out a notice.

273
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,340
The development team is searching for the bug, but the time ...

274
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,080
What is the quickest way to resolve it?

275
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,000
As of now, it'll only be resolved if the developer,
the former CEO comes back.

276
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,160
Why don't you stop looking.

277
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,720
Just work. I'll play with you later.

278
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,990
Gosh, when did I say that?

279
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,080
What are you doing this evening?

280
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,240
Why?

281
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,860
My birthday.

282
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,020
They're all lit.

283
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,560
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

284
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,790
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

285
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,160
♫ Dear beloved Seung Hyeon. ♫

286
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,500
♫ Happy birthday to you. ♫

287
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,250
Blow them out.

288
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,000
What did you wish for?

289
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,780
It's secret.

290
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,260
Happy birthday!

291
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,160
Someone could believe that you're my girlfriend today.

292
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,980
I told you to say that to a real girlfriend.

293
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,530
But since today's your birthday, I'll let it go.

294
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,060
Then Ae Ra, to commemorate my birthday, give me a compliment.

295
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,010
A compliment?

296
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,330
You're meticulous,

297
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,310
caring, and while you're pure like a child,

298
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,010
you're trustworthy. And you have a lot of money.

299
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,130
You're also young!

300
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,290
You're extremely honest.

301
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,800
Then I'll be honest with you, too.

302
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,480
Don't get mad.

303
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,590
What?

304
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,150
Today isn't my birthday.

305
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,460
What? Today wasn't your birthday?

306
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,550
I wanted to see you,

307
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,610
but if I didn't say that, you wouldn't meet me.

308
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:28,070
♫ You don't know. You wouldn't know.  ♫

309
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:34,610
♫ How much I want you. ♫

310
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:42,260
Thanks.
♫ I don't know. I really don't know. ♫

311
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:49,070
♫ Why you had to leave me like this. ♫

312
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,430
What kind of secretary neglects the president, where are you?

313
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,700
I'm hungry!

314
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,190
I told you to take care of your own food. I'll be back after eating with a friend.

315
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,370
Friend?

316
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,500
Which friend?

317
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,660
Someone.

318
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,480
Who?!

319
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,030
What?

320
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,500
What birthday? Hey!

321
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,660
His birthday is in the middle of winter with lots of snow! Come back right away!

322
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,240
Hey... hel...

323
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,850
Hello? Ae... Na Ae Ra!

324
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,620
We're here.

325
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,280
Hello, CEO.

326
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,950
I came, too.

327
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,750
You came? I'm sorry.

328
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,180
I'm sure you're busy with company work, but just because of me.

329
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,560
Not at all. Thank you for selecting us to take part in this important project.

330
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,390
I didn't know I was going to take on such awesome two jobs,
it's an honor!

331
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,830
You know that I always have to be by your side, don't you?

332
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,560
Thank you all.

333
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,960
This is the the most current report of the mobile payment system you asked for.

334
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,320
Also, a letter of intent on investment came in from
Unified Shilla Hotel today.

335
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,710
Oh, really?

336
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,320
Then it's the end of worrying about an investment fund.

337
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,600
It isn't certain yet.

338
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,630
Meanwhile, maintaining security is our lifeline.

339
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,130
Of course.

340
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,060
Unified Shilla Hotel is saving us several times over.

341
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,740
The buffet deal that Na Ae Ra made with them
is helping out so much!

342
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,240
But you know, I heard the people in the development team talking,

343
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,580
and it appears that the problems are serious.

344
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,650
Yes, this is Cha Jeong Woo.

345
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,940
There is a bug with the game's security system.

346
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,710
We need to analyze what could be causing harm to the security and find the hole.

347
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,170
It may take some time,
what should I do?

348
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,530
Let's wait.

349
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,900
There's a part that I'm suspecting.

350
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,370
The planning ended very well,

351
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,860
so it's all in the CEO's hands.

352
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,250
Thank you very much.

353
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,090
If we didn't have the help of Manager Kang and Team Leader Wang, it would have been difficult.

354
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,710
Na Ae Ra, why are you thanking me?

355
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,920
Are you already trying to act like the CEO's wife?!

356
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,350
No, that's not it.

357
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,140
I really admire CEO Cha as well.

358
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,030
I'm also trying to sort out my personal relationships.

359
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,450
'Human relationships'
are much more important assets than money!

360
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,290
Besides,

361
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:11,740
from my intuition,
CEO Cha will make a comeback in a much bigger way.

362
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,940
You know about my intuition?

363
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,190
Are you not doing well with CEO Cha?

364
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,550
Why?

365
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,960
This card represents 'death'.

366
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,360
It means ending.

367
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,850
When I interpret this in a love relationship,

368
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,000
it means that your relationship is over with him!

369
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,900
Oh my!

370
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,800
Are you and Jeong Woo breaking up again?

371
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,500
I told you, you wench to stop playing hard to get!

372
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,290
I don't want to meddle into another person's love life, but...

373
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,810
Please be good to him,
while he's right next to you.

374
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,300
You think, he's going to be around forever?

375
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,100
That's not the case.

376
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,440
I...

377
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,140
became widowed.

378
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,520
Team Leader...

379
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,960
Inner issues between CEO Cha and you...

380
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,550
I don't know and I don't need to know,

381
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,370
but not just once,

382
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,700
but to love twice,

383
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:46,200
then ... isn't it a true destiny to love one another?

384
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:55,250
Although the tarot card does make me feel unsettled.

385
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,720
Ae Ra...

386
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,260
When love sickness becomes chronic, it's a serious illness!

387
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,970
I must have fallen asleep.

388
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,390
Either sleep or work.

389
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,740
Do only one.

390
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,620
I have to work.

391
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,140
You falling asleep like this reminds me of the past.

392
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,370
Ahjussi, this place is not a sleeping facility!

393
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,220
I'm sorry.

394
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,910
Geez! This isn't the 1st or the 2nd time.

395
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,630
Your unpaid fees are a mile long!

396
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm sorry.

397
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,080
I'll pay it all at once.

398
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,510
I'm here to pay for the overdue fees at cubicle 18...

399
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,880
It's been paid for.

400
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,950
What?

401
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,390
I don't remember paying.

402
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,430
The part time worker Gil Yoo Won paid for you.

403
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,730
He told me to take it out of his paycheck.

404
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,700
Ah... Where is he?

405
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,910
He went to go serve in the army today.

406
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,370
Gil Yoo...

407
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,690
Hey, you punk?!

408
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,880
That most pathetic hobo became so rich now?!

409
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,950
I'm good at recognizing a successful person!

410
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,940
A pathetic hobo?!

411
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,590
Hey, it's not that you recognized me, but I've risen!

412
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,780
Anyways, I used to go to the PC room that was next door.

413
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,500
When it was closed for one day, that's when I started to set camp at your PC room.

414
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,160
Hey.... Of course,

415
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,390
if you were meant to meet, then you'll meet.

416
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,810
Things that will happen, will happen no matter what.

417
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,000
Yes.

418
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,290
A human destiny is very important!

419
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,200
You're right.

420
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,570
Chairman...

421
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,580
Oh Sang Moo,

422
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,770
I'm coherent today.

423
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,880
Eat this and the soup, too.

424
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,390
Weren't you really upset, because all along I was the only one

425
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,080
who ate the good stuff?

426
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,790
Not at all.

427
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:05,350
Chairman, you've already given me
the most delicious food in this world!

428
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,560
Hey, Mr. Im!

429
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,480
Come here and eat first!

430
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,490
It seems you've been working too hard.

431
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,810
You've figured out that I've been receiving lunch,
and giving it to my younger siblings.

432
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,190
So, the rice ball you gave me on my birthday, so I wouldn't have to starve ...

433
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,080
How can I forget that!

434
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,950
From that day on,
you became my older brother, teacher

435
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,330
and as my father in my heart.

436
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,440
Is that so?

437
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,750
Yes, it seems as though

438
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,840
you've aged a lot as well.

439
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,420
Oh Sang Moo,

440
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,860
isn't it tiresome for you to stay

441
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,950
next to me?

442
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,180
Chairman ...

443
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,520
are you tired of me?

444
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,960
Even when I get older, I'm

445
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,600
going to stay right next to you and serve you.

446
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,490
Just like now.

447
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,490
With CEO Cha and Chairman Guk quickly combining forces to reach a settlement,

448
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,180
D&T Soft Ventures and the new JW Ventures,
[ D&T, JW sign patent technology contract with lightning speed ]

449
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,700
have merged to form a partnership.

450
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,750
And so CEO Cha having stepped back,

451
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,630
D & T Soft which has been caught up with stories about discord and crisis,
[Sudden Rise due to Blue Chip in KOSDAQ]

452
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,400
has come to receive attention as the new blue chip in KOSDAQ.
[ IT Ventures David and Goliath have become partners ]

453
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,860
The JW Ventures that CEO Cha created as expected,
[D&T-JW Contract, 'Guk Yeo Jin - Cha Jeong Woo' Rejection Discord]

454
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:53,070
looks like it'll become an outstanding software company with its dependable investment funds and yield time.

455
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,110
Hold on.

456
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,320
Why?
-I'll go up and come right back.

457
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,560
Just wait.

458
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,280
What?

459
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,610
Wait a second. Don't move and stay here.

460
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,340
Why? What's the problem?

461
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,050
There is a situation like a bolt from the blue!

462
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,330
I will go up and take care of it first,

463
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,490
so don't move a muscle and stay here. Okay? Don't move.

464
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,170
Don't move and stay here.

465
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,380
Don't move a muscle and stay there.

466
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,880
Aigoo, that Secretary Gil, that punk.

467
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,000
He said that it wouldn't be windy today, and they're all scattered from the wind. What am I going to do?

468
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,910
How did these get all blown? When am I going to fix all of this?

469
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,180
Ae Ra.

470
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,300
Why are you looking at me so dazed?
Finish what you were doing.

471
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,500
These rose petals...

472
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,730
Because you're an IT industry leader of the next generation,

473
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,140
I thought you'd propose with the best new cutting edge technique.

474
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,150
As expected, it's just like the exam village's Cha Jeong Woo.

475
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,000
Even in a new cutting edge technique, there has to be sentiment.

476
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,060
For proposals, traditional and classics are the most effective.

477
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,370
You don't know how much I searched the internet.

478
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,940
And when I looked on there, they all lit candles and used flower petals to decorate.

479
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,490
Ae Ra,

480
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,640
when I built this house,

481
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,520
I said that I'd make you regret abandoning me.

482
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,610
Back then,

483
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,420
I was only full of resentment towards you.

484
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,210
I didn't even think about how lonely I made you,

485
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,870
or how difficult I made things for you.

486
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,100
But when I would come to this house once in awhile,

487
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,670
without realizing it, I was excited.

488
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,840
Perhaps,

489
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,800
like a lie, the thought that we could start all over came to me.

490
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,420
And in the midst of that excitement,

491
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,320
you were there.

492
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,110
At first, I didn't want to admit it; but at the workshop,

493
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,430
when I came to this house alone,

494
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,620
I came to realize it then.

495
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,550
If I were to lose you,

496
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,930
this house would mean nothing to me.

497
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,090
In this house,

498
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,160
the dream we had lost for a moment,

499
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,060
let's dream it again as we live, Ae Ra.

500
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,160
I love you, Na Ae Ra.

501
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,650
Marry me again.

502
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,140
I know why you refused this ring.

503
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,440
But you don't have to worry. Actually, I'm rich.

504
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,540
I may have resigned the CEO position,

505
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,050
but I'm the third largest shareholder of D&T Soft Ventures, and

506
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,150
my new business is going well.

507
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,010
I just need you now.

508
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,710
Cha Jeong Woo,

509
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,840
I know how you feel,

510
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,050
but...

511
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,690
I can't accept

512
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,490
this proposal. I'm sorry.

513
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,350
Ae Ra.

514
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:32,100
I liked that you were a government employee.

515
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,790
That was love.

516
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,660
Even when I broke up with you because it was hard to make a living and eat,

517
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,140
I loved you.

518
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:47,750
When I met you again, I didn't know how I felt, but

519
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,590
when you were going through a hard time, I knew it then.

520
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,850
That I was loving you again.

521
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,850
But even this time,

522
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,610
in your moment of hardship, I tried to leave you again.

523
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,220
Ae Ra.
- My decision

524
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,300
always seems to give you a hard time.

525
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,520
I can't anymore.

526
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,640
Ae Rae...
- I...with you...

527
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,960
I'll do better. I'll do much better...

528
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,410
I know, so with you...

529
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,770
Please...Please don't say it.

530
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,130
Please, Ae Ra...

531
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,170
Let me speak!

532
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,490
Everyday, even as I loved you, I was sorry that I left you!

533
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:50,050
I'm never going to leave your side again!

534
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,090
I want my second marriage

535
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,000
to be with you again.

536
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,960
Cha Jeong Woo,

537
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,550
marry me.

538
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:33,830
♫ I really love you, to me you are, ♫

539
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:40,590

♫ I really love you from the bottom of my heart. ♫

567
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,600
Yes, this is Guk Seung Hyeon.

568
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,700
Oh, the D30 design?

569
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,130
Didn't I confirm that for you?

570
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,580
Please wait a minute ... It's so crazy around here.

571
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,480
I have seen it somewhere around here.

572
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:15,240
Yes, I'll bring it for tomorrow's meeting so let's review it together.

573
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,480
Yes.

574
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,610
Please look here. Cheese!

575
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,150
You know Ae Ra,

576
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:39,120
I'd like it if I weren't only liking you by myself.

577
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,170
You're meticulous and tender,

578
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:49,610
you're pure like a baby but trustworthy,

579
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,040
and you have a lot of money and you are young.

580
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,710
Really.

581
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:01,690

When did you come?

588

Today.

589
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,480
But ... why did you come here?

590
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,110
I came here to see my daughter.

591

Mom.

592
00:52:53,290 --> 00:53:00,580

596
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:23,160
What do you think of Min Jeong? Min Jeong?

597
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,680
For some reason, I think she'll be really pretty!

598
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,350
It is, but what if it's a boy?

599
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,050
A boy?

600
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,560
Then... Sang Wook!

601
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,620
Sang Wook seems like he'd be good-looking and dashing,

602
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,740
and I think he'd be really smart.

603
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,600
Cha Sang Wook?

604
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,620
Well, for some reason I feel like he'd be someone who'd be in an important position at a company.

605
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,720
Someone like an executive director or a doctor?

606
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,360
What else?

607
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,330
Honey,

608
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,510
I think we've gone through a hundred names already.

609
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:59,900
It is the name that will be called for life.
The parents have to decide it carefully.

610
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,180
Do you know how much kids made fun
of my name when I was young?

611
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:07,390
You Ae Ra! (Korean homonym for Oh well, all right, Gosh!)

612
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,840
Ae Rai!
- Don't laugh.

613
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,620
Then what about an American name? Let's be global.

614
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,390
Since I like Angelina Jolie...

615
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,280
Jolie. Jolly!

616
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,170
Are you kidding?

617
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,740
That name has familiarity.
-Right?

618
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,820
Jolie Choi...Jali Cha?

619
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,150
Jolly. Oh, this has a ring to it.

620
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,470
No. Another one!

621
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,800
Then what if we take one part from each of our names,

622
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,180
what do you think of Ae Jeong? Ae Jeong? Cha Ae Jeong?

623
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:49,720
Ae Jeong? It's pretty.

624
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,910
But what if it's a boy?

625
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,740
Then let me ask the baby. Wait. Now...

626
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,900
What did it say?

627
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,910
To stop making noise when it's sleeping, and for Mom and Dad

628
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:08,910
to go inside and spend some cozy time together.

629
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,820
Geesh!

630
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,580
What is that!
