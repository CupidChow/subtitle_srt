00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,410
Episode 7

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,350
Mom said to give this to you.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,190
My mom is crazy, too.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,920
What kind of mother-in-law does this kind of thing
for her divorced son-in-law?

5
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,520
I loved the Cha Jeong Woo who loved only me.

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,130
All of that

7
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,390
was the reason I loved you and everything else.
So what are you going to do now?

8
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,580
No matter what, we made a promise.

9
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,840
You threw me away when that promise
became too shabby.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,080
A promise should have been kept by both sides.

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,430
You shattered our ordinary happiness and
instead, you succeeded like this.

12
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,340
At that time, I lost the confidence

13
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,760
that I could make both you and me happy.

14
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,220
It's already a broken dish (something that happened already), but

15
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,530
don't even insult the sincerity I gave you.

16
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,000
Then I become too wretched.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
Sincerity?

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,530
What's an insult and what is so wretched?

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,560
Do you know how difficult it was for me and how
much pain I felt because of you?

20
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,040
Even if you have an issue with the company, painting
graffiti on the CEO's car is a bit...

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,870
Cha Jeong Woo, you...awful bastard!

22
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,450
There's more time left to the internship period,
and if we suddenly give her a special dispensation,

23
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,340
what happens to the morale of the other employees?

24
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,310
I heard that what he raised with all her hardship and
sacrifice was this company.

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,040
I heard it from the person directly involved,

26
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,840
from a person who knows that person very well.

27
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,010
Oh, it's hot.
Hot, hot.

28
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,020
Here it is.

29
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,950
It looks totally delicious.

30
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,450
Hey, it's a good thing that I didn't eat dinner.

31
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,440
CEO, are you really not going to eat any?

32
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,230
No, it's fine.

33
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,070
I'm...I'm watching my figure these days.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,500
If you're going to maintain that 'SinDiTempting' image,
you'll have to take care of yourself.

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,980
Then, I'll just eat by myself.

36
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,620
Ggodolnam?
(Seduce, Divorced and Single, Man)

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,770
A divorced, single man you want to seduce.

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,640
I heard that you even wished 'happy birthday' to
a female secretary employee on her birthday.

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,020
Since you're maintaining the image that well,
how can it not be so?

40
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,050
Ggodolnam ... whatever.

41
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,540
Do you want to eat?

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,720
Me?

43
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,350
Not at all.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,150
I have no appetite.

45
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,700
That's right.

46
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,170
It's this taste.

47
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,100
Acting sneaky when you were going to eat.

48
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,200
Her cooking skills are still as amazing as always.

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,810
But...

50
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,140
isn't this a little overboard?

51
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,920
What is?

52
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,900
No matter how she may be a mother-in-law that loves
her son-in-law,

53
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,840
where is there a mother-in-law that even
looks after her divorced son-in-law?

54
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,460
Sh-She was always generous with food.

55
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,980
Her hand was big too (she was generous with portions), so she gave lots of side dishes to the poor exam students.

56
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,420
Her cooking skills were so good, you don't know
how tasty her food was.

57
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,100
Then your ex-wife must have had awesome cooking skills.

58
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,720
They say cooking skills are genetic.

59
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
Cooking?

60
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,120
Well, they weren't bad.

61
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,520
But she was very uneconomic.

62
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,930
What? Why?

63
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,670
When she was making a simple bean paste soup, the ingredients cost $15 and it took at least two hours.

64
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,300
She's that kind of kid.

65
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,670
She was very much uneconomical.

66
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,860
Hey, instead it's better to eat out.

67
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,880
Even then she'd argue that she was going
to make it herself.

68
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,530
Then one day, I watched her make it.

69
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,330
What she was doing that it was taking her two hours?
What I found out was...

70
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,820
She sliced the tofu and took a certification pic, sliced the zucchini and took a certification pic, dissolved the bean paste

71
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,690
and took a certification pic. She took a picture with each step. Was she going to put out a cookbook or what?

72
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,290
But still you said that she prepared breakfast
everyday without fail.

73
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,230
That's...

74
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,020
Honey, just one of these.

75
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,180
I'm late.

76
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,540
One more.

77
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,940
She did.

78
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,420
That kind of woman isn't common.

79
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,820
You're not sleeping?

80
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,520
And the seasoning is inside, too.
- Yes.

81
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,380
If you wanted to eat it spicily...

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,980
Wow
-And also the stir fry is the same.

83
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,190
Are you perhaps...

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,950
Are you sad because of that?

85
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,130
It's not like that.

86
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,590
Then, are you like that because you're hungry?

87
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,520
I told you it's not like that.

88
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,420
Then what?

89
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,490
Is it because you're angry because of Jeong Woo?

90
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,800
Angry, why?

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,250
Is Cha Jeong Woo an air conditioner?

92
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,690
You said that you were going to apologize to Jeong Woo.
Did you do it?

93
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,990
What did he say? Did he accept it?

94
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,330
What is it? Did he say it was fine?

95
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,770
Did you perhaps get rejected while apologizing?

96
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm at a loss for words.

97
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,910
I mean...when a person is

98
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,800
bowing their head saying that they are sorry,
you can't do that to them.

99
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,920
He said that he was really hurt because of me.

100
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,990
Hey!

101
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,290
What about you?! Weren't you hurt?!

102
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,800
It's the same on both sides!

103
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,170
Truthfully, why did you divorce?

104
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,900
That day you...

105
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,000
That's enough. What's the use of talking about the past?

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,210
Wench, really.

107
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,800
Hwi Jeong Hee, during processing this time,

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,610
there's a vendor called F&T. This vendor

109
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,410
received a lot of complaints from
the mobile shopping and food department,

110
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,970
so you have to check it again.

111
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,560
Yes.

112
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,910
That's why I included all the materials of the other companies that had dealings with F&T until now.

113
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,870
Are you sure that there are no deviations in this material?

114
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,380
Yes.

115
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,040
I think that I don't have that 'ation' or whatever you called it.

116
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,000
Ms. Na Ae Ra,

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,260
you don't know deviation?

118
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,700
An error.

119
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,560
Oh, an error.

120
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,300
And these days, I know that the vendors have
a lot of talking points,

121
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,130
maintaining QS (Quality Service) is the priority.

122
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,400
The deals you made have high fees. Do you think that this will work?

123
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,580
Oh yes... the...

124
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,120
as for the objective, let's look at it broadly...

125
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,150
Na Ae Ra, what do you think about this fee?

126
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,500
Even if you get the deal with this fee,
won't there be any problems with the product QS?

127
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm sorry. I can't understand what you're saying.

128
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,940
A fee. Product quality.

129
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,960
Fee ..."fee"

130
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,930
QS ... "product quality"

131
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,190
Na Ae Ra,

132
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,760
I know they didn't ask for how much education you've got,
but since you're here, why don't you study?

133
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,430
Our company is number 1 in visitor hits.

135
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,410
If you go see the vendor, like you, without any preparation,

136
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,090
it'll be a huge embarrassment.

137
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,290
Pi Song Hee, train her well.

138
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,610
Yes.

139
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,870
Cheer up.

140
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,070
Aigoo, Team Leader Wang was too hard on you.

141
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,230
How long has it been since you came in as an intern.

142
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,190
Not at all.

143
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,430
Actually, I am a little on the ignorant side.

144
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,010
No, we all learn as we go!

145
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,280
Team Leader Wang even yells at me, who's five years older.

146
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,340
So don't worry about it and cheer up.

147
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,040
But what about the product quality, fee, and error.

148
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,170
Does it all have to be in English?

149
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,810
Can't we just say it in Korean?

150
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,210
I know, right? English is the big problem with our country.

151
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:28,150
What's the big deal about English that
a family has to live apart like this?

152
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,170
But when are your wife and children returning?

153
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,090
I don't know.
They said they'd come back after just learning English,

154
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,190
but now they want to go to middle school there.

155
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,180
They even send pictures of themselves having all the fun everyday.

156
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,000
And they only make phone calls out of obligation
at a designated time.

157
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,720
Cheer up, Manager.

158
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,320
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

159
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,970
Oh!

160
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,950
I was going to peel a clementine to cheer him up.

161
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,320
How would a clementine bring him comfort?

162
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,740
Look, I even peeled it so 'person'ally for him.

163
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,960
Did your family have a clementine business?

164
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,160
If one sings well, does the family run a karaoke business?

165
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,910
And if one dances well, do they own a club?

166
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,120
No, I just thought it might be different ...

167
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,080
It's cute.

168
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,530
You're eating that?

169
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,470
What? I'm eating it because it's food.

170
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,310
Ah, geez. You can't recognize art.

171
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,990
Art?

172
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,080
I don't know anything about that,

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,660
but I do know that you're not supposed to play with food.

174
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,470
Do it again.

175
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,930
The public notification from a while ago,

176
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,910
what do you think about the "Messenger service improvement contest?"

177
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,950
Is it going well for everyone?

178
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,150
I heard that the business team has
each person submitting one idea each.

179
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,840
Can we lose to them?

180
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,520
Does anyone have ideas? "Idears?"

181
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,250
Manager Kang?

182
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,850
Uh, well, I heard this from a friend.

183
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,050
To a woman he was having a secret affair with...

184
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,390
What did he say? Oh. He sent a text saying, "Honey, where are you?"

185
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,550
He sent it wrong, and sent it to his wife who was sleeping right beside him.

186
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,890
He panicked!

187
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,530
So he threw his wife's phone into the toilet.

188
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,970
He was so upset that he wrecked it!

189
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,890
I thought of something, too. When I was preparing for exams,

190
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,530
I got a text saying, "Are you looking for an employment?"

191
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,910
I thought it was spam.
So I said, "What are you going to do if you knew?"

192
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,950
And the reply that came back,

193
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,380
"This is D & T Software. You are straight forward!"

194
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,330
It also said, "Your document has been accepted."

195
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,300
Ae Ra, did you think of an idea?

196
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,880
What?

197
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,890
No, well... that...

198
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,610
I'm going to the Hot Springs with your dad.

199
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,400
We'll be home tomorrow.

200
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,290
Oppa, my house is empty tonight. Come quickly.

201
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,060
Oh, my, my, my! This wench...?

202
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,470
Do you want to cause an accident before you get married?

203
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,210
Mom, how...?

204
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,550
What? "Oppa, my house is empty tonight."

205
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,240
"Come quickly"?

206
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,050
That was Mom?

207
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,830
Aigoo! I can't live!

208
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,510
What did you do so right?

209
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,420
Mother, Mother, calm down!

210
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,560
Mother!

211
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,160
Get out!

212
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,400
Ouch! Ouch!

213
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,420
Move!

214
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,480
That's funny. Why don't you try submitting it?

215
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,270
It's okay.

216
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,700
What is that? It's too old.

217
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,950
Why? It's seem fine to me.

218
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,430
What about this?

219
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,990
I invited my boyfriend over while my parents were traveling.

220
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,430
I sent the text, "Oppa, when are you coming?" to my parents by mistake,

221
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,490
and it caused a ruckus.

222
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:29,050
If there were a time machine, I'd go back and cancel that message.

223
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,300
That has probably happened once to everyone when they were young.

224
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,780
Even you?

225
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,680
Since our users are young in age,

226
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,120
a lot of people could relate to this episode.

227
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,400
This one.

228
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,170
I think we can use "mistaken words" as an upgrade.

229
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,740
Really?

230
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,840
Then let's go with that.

231
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,400
Yes.

232
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,980
Oh, yes, isn't the meeting with the investors that Director Oh mentioned today?

233
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,460
Yes.

234
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,830
It's scheduled at the same time with my meeting at the Chamber of Commerce. What should I do?

235
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,750
It's okay. You can head over there.

236
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm more of a veteran dealing with investors, so don't worry.

237
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,130
Okay, then. Do a good job!

238
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,880
I'll head over there if I finish early.

239
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,570
Yes.

240
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,710
Nice to meet you. I'm Robert Kim.

241
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm D & T Soft Ventures Marketing Director, Guk Yeo Jin.

242
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,530
Please have a seat.

243
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,080
Yes.

244
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,230
I heard that you have a lot of interest in our company.

245
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,350
I think you have the wrong information.

246
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,500
What I'm interested in is not D & T Soft Ventures,

247
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,420
but it's Guk Yeo Jin.

248
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,640
There isn't any word from Yeo Jin?
-Ah, no.

249
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,470
Oh!

250
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:48,250
It appears that they both don't notice the time going by.

251
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,000
Ah, then that's a good thing.

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,030
I've heard that children grow by feeding on
their parent's worries, but she

253
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,160
still has a lot to grow.

254
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,630
I think there must have been a misunderstanding.
I came without knowing.

255
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,040
I don't think it's important how you got here.

256
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,340
The important thing is that we met.

257
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,470
I don't have any thought of dating you.

258
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,320
Are you being too hasty in your decision?

259
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,640
I don't think you know enough about me yet.

260
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,080
Is there anything I need to know?

261
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,890
I have someone I'm going to marry.

262
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:35,740
If it's because of you inferiority complex,
you don't have to go that far with what you say.

263
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,140
I came here knowing enough about you already.

264
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,690
Yeo Jin, I don't think that many men can handle you.

265
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,870
I'm saying that marrying me would be
a good business for you as well.

266
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,780
I guarantee it.

267
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,690
You have an amazing confidence.

268
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,830
But you seem to be lacking some common sense.

269
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,780
You must have finished early.

270
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,640
Didn't I tell you earlier? That there's someone I'm going to marry.

271
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,700
It's this person.

272
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,700
Okay.

273
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,780
I have a handle on what's going on.

274
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,730
I'm not that clueless!

275
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,890
I think it's time for me to exit.

276
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,530
Why don't you people with more appealing conditions

277
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,700
keep proceeding.

278
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,380
You must be receiving a proper amount, taking on
this kind of woman.

279
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,770
Aigoo.

280
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,250
Try calling the guy Yeo Jin is having the blind date with.
- Yes.

281
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,490
The Madame sent it.

282
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,030
It looks like your tears finally made her come around.

283
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,450
She could have just called.

284
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,400
Why did she go so far as to write a letter?

285
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,320
With my money, she's living in the lap of luxury!

286
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,360
I sent her to France since she wanted it so badly.

287
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,230
Tell her to come home immediately!
-Yes.

288
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,940
Divorce Agreement

289
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,830
Eat this.

290
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,900
Thank you.

291
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,730
Even if he's the Alpha,

292
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,410
how can he extend our appointment two hours
and then ask to see us tomorrow?

293
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,650
We even rode a taxi here.

294
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,340
Isn't he too much?

295
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,120
Yes.

296
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,130
Still, because of it, we get to play hooky like this.

297
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,170
That part is all right. Isn't it?

298
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,140
Yes.

299
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,710
Are you mad at me?

300
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,830
You're in a bad mood, all day today.

301
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,010
Is it that day?

302
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,860
The problem with the your parent's restaurant was resolved well.

303
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm not like this because of that.
- Then.

304
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,460
Is it because Song Hee keeps making you angry?

305
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,980
Or Manager Kang?

306
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,750
It's not that.

307
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,030
Ah, it's because of the Team Leader.

308
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,390
Even though we're both interns,
she just favors me too much.

309
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,510
Am I a child?

310
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,430
Then why?

311
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,290
Do you not like the CEO?

312
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,280
Yes.

313
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,660
That's kind of serious.

314
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,640
We can't ask the CEO to leave.

315
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,750
That's why.

316
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,890
Anyway, just know it's that.

317
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,330
And I don't know how much longer
I'll be working here,

318
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,940
but during the time left, do your best for me, sincerely.

319
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,020
Yes, Ahjussi.

320
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,900
Again?

321
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,650
Alright.

322
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,070
Ae Ra, you go into the office first.

323
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,770
Where are you going?

324
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,010
It's my mom's studio.

325
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,880
Is your mother a painter?

326
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,950
She's not a painter, but as a hobby.

327
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,790
But what is with all this mess?

328
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,510
By chance, did you get robbed?

329
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,140
I know, right?
After my father came by, it became like this.

330
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,780
I was feeling down and depressed.
This is good.

331
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,830
We're going to have to empty this all and clean it out, refreshingly.

332
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,840
Ok, where are your cleaning supplies?

333
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,320
Is your hand ok? Look how red it's become.

334
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,120
Why were you just sitting there?

335
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,210
During meetings you look at me with
your eyes wide open and make your points.

336
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,690
You could have taken him on even if
you did just half of what you do to me.

337
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,330
But even so, to that point...

338
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,700
Human beings that look at marriage as a deal,

339
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,020
I can't look at them because they disgust me.

340
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,070
And Director Guk, you're not someone who
should have been treated like that.

341
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,930
CEO, you don't know that much about me.

342
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,550
Is that right?

343
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,820
But I know one thing for sure.

344
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,130
That you're a person that I can trust.

345
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,690
When you trust me like that,

346
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,610
if I had a circumstance that you don't know about...

347
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,700
Would you still ... like now,

348
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,170
be protecting me?

349
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,830
I don't know what the situation it may be,

350
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,040
but if you have a circumstance that you can't tell me about,

351
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,180
I guess I'd have to try to
understand that situation as well.

352
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,410
I was curious at times.

353
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,170
Why did you break up.

354
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,480
You're not a person that gives up easily

355
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,100
or throws people away.

356
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,460
"Why did he do it?"

357
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,830
If I was rude, I'm sorry.

358
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,450
No, it's fine.

359
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,740
Do you know that trust

360
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,340
is like a piece of paper?

361
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,720
Once it's wrinkled,

362
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,280
it can't become perfect again.

363
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,480
Except to throw it out.

364
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,930
Seeing how your father is this angry,

365
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,970
perhaps,

366
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,590
did your mother swallow the business whole?

367
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,700
What?

368
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,210
In order for this kind of serious damage to occur,

369
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,040
there has to be someone in the family
that causes serious problems ...

370
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,640
Our house was like that.

371
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,960
Was it?

372
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,320
Every time Father would ruin a business, Mom would keep throwing things.

373
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,680
My brother and I trying to put all those
things back in their right place...

374
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,700
They raised us too haphazardly.

375
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,930
If you look at that, I'm pretty incredible.
Even in that kind of environment,

376
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:27,270
I grew up this bright and confident.

377
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,840
I'm envious of you, Na Ae Ra.

378
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,610
You living so boisterously with your family.

379
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,220
Aigoo, if you're envious twice,
you might ask to come live with us in our house.

380
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,200
Can't I do that?

381
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,130
Can't I?

382
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,900
♫ Gee, I love you, ♫

383
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,300
♫ You're my beautiful girl, Oh beautiful girl, ♫

384
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,700
♫ You are my beautiful girl, You are my angel, ♫

385
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,300
♫ Show me your love, I want to show you my love, ♫

386
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,360
Try doing it properly.

387
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,200
Le...ft, left side. Left side, right side.

388
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,990
You can't do that right?

389
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,230
Get down, I'll do it.

390
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,060
This is so difficult. Just hold me well.

391
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,070
I am holding well...

392
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,410
Really...

393
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,780
The containers?
-Those containers weren't ours, but our neighbor's.

394
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,990
They're similar, so they must have mixed it up
and used it.

395
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,850
They're making a big deal asking us to return it.

396
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,320
The neighborhood's feelings ...

397
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,600
I was going to return it anyway.
I'll send it through my secretary later.

398
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,450
No, no, no!

399
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,310
There's no need to do that. It will just waste gas.

400
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,730
Just... send it

401
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,010
through Ae Ra.

402
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,160
Na Ae Ra?

403
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,070
what time is it now?

404
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,580
You left in the morning

405
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,570
and came back just in time to get off work?

406
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,270
I apologize. The shopping mall's CEO

407
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,150
blew us off. And we waited for such a long time.

408
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,880
Since we didn't get anything done today,
we'll have to go back tomorrow.

409
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,350
What should we do, Team Leader?

410
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,620
Excellent! It's precisely that.

411
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,780
There's no person who won't give in if you keep trying.
You have to work with that mindset.

412
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,210
I have great expectations for you, Seung Hyeon.

413
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,530
If you have any difficulties, come and consult me anytime.

414
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,730
I'm open minded.

415
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,190
Yes, Team Leader.

416
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,700
Hoobaenim, I waited a long time for you.

417
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,110
Please organize all this.

418
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,980
Then...

419
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,450
I'll have to work overtime again.

420
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,760
It's not like I'm going to become rich and famous.

421
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,080
Come to the rooftop.

422
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,740
Tell Mother that I ate it well

423
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,820
and that I hope she won't do this anymore.

424
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,180
I'm grateful for the effort,

425
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,430
but it makes me feel uncomfortable.

426
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,330
And the same goes for Soo Chul Hyung.

427
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,000
He keeps calling me Brother-in-law Cha.

428
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,890
You and I, since we're clearly over,
shouldn't we clear the titles, as well?

429
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,710
Tell him in a way that he won't feel bad...

430
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,520
Are you getting off work?

431
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,080
Yes. Are you getting off work, too?

432
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,500
Yes.

433
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,840
What direction is your house?

434
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,470
Huh?

435
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,760
You'll have to go out of your way, though.

436
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,730
It's okay.

437
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,150
It's not like the company provides free rides
for the employees for no apparent reason.

438
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,780
We should give a lift to those who get off work late.

439
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,560
Ah, yes.

440
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,520
Oh, um...

441
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,040
The incident about the rice soup restaurant...

442
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,680
I'm sorry for creating trouble.

443
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,920
It's a relief that it was solved well.

444
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,770
The CEO went to the hospital personally,

445
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,520
and worked really hard for that.

446
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,630
Yes.

447
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,680
He did it for me because I was on a business trip.

448
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,930
Yes.

449
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,710
Nothing happened at your parents' restaurant after that,
right?

450
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,820
Yes. Thankfully, nothing bad happened after that.

451
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:58,860
My parents told me to tell you that they are also sorry for
making trouble for the company..

452
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,990
Did you directly tell that to the CEO?

453
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,720
N..no.

454
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Is there a reason for an intern to directly meet the CEO?

455
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,100
Please wait a second..

456
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,510
Yes, Min Yeong.

457
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,890
Ah, I'm not going that way today.

458
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,840
Huh?

459
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,380
Okay. Hang up.

460
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,090
She's a friend that I live with,
and she wants me to bring home ddeokbokki.

461
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,350
You live with your friend?

462
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,360
Your house seems to be in Seoul,

463
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,600
but you don't live with your family?

464
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,630
No. My house is in Seoul,
but I lived on my own since a long ago.

465
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,380
I even got married early because
I wanted to be independent.

466
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,640
You're married?

467
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,880
Ah.. that...

468
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,960
I did... but I got divorced.

469
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,860
Is that something to hide?

470
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,130
A breakup is possible if it isn't meant to be.

471
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,130
I'm grateful that you think of it like that.

472
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:17,770
But if you're single, instead of a friend,
you need to have a boyfriend.

473
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,310
Do you have a boyfriend?

474
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,390
Huh? No.. no. I don't have one.

475
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,010
I can't believe it.

476
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,360
With your beauty, I think you'd be really popular.

477
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,040
That was once upon a time.

478
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,700
Right now I'm rejected here, rejected there,
rejected even today ...

479
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,080
It's nothing.

480
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,800
Oh, drop me off over there.

481
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,220
We're almost there.

482
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,180
Thank you.

483
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,970
Come to me if you have anything that bothers you,
or if you want to have a drink.

484
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,710
It's okay if we see each other at the rooftop like last time.

485
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,010
What?

486
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,800
Oh, yes.

487
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,790
Thank you! Thank you.

488
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,630
Secretary Kim.

489
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,340
Yes?

490
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,340
Did you ever get back with someone
that you broke up with?

491
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,170
If you keep seeing that person after breaking up,

492
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,320
that... what would that mean?

493
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,900
Why would you see someone again after breaking up?

494
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,380
Then the relationship must not be over.

495
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,660
Come in.

496
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,300
So, you cleaned all that up by yourself?

497
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,180
Not by myself.

498
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,590
With who?

499
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,260
Someone. A woman.

500
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,740
It hasn't even been that long since you returned to Korea.

501
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,190
Anyway, you've got skills.

502
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,150
What kind of a woman is it this time?

503
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,600
She's very fantastic.

504
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,730
I'm going to take revenge on you!

505
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,120
She's social enough to make a silent person dance.

506
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,360
She has a sacrificing mind to
plan something that will benefit the public.

507
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,040
Do you spit, spit, spit all over when you're impressed?

508
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,190
She's a woman that knows how to stand up
for herself, when there's an injustice.

509
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,380
She's an intelligent woman that
doesn't make the same mistakes over.

510
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,760
I throw up once, but not twice.

511
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,110
But more than anything else, when a man wavers,

512
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,140
I have a good hold of you though.

513
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,390
she's a woman who knows how to hold onto them.

514
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,640
There's a woman like that?

515
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:26,720
She must be great if you like her.
Is she pretty?

516
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,190
The face is not everything.

517
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,760
Do you know what kind of woman a guy has to avoid?

518
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,720
I'm going crazy.

519
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,010
A pretty but petty girl.

520
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,650
You didn't get the investment again?

521
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,400
You don't have the right to eat. Starve.

522
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,450
She's pretty, but holds a grudge.

523
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,700
A pretty...
- Who are you talking about?

524
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,400
Your ex-wife?

525
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,660
I should've seen her when you were still married.

526
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,200
I really regret it.

527
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,990
There's no need to talk about someone who's not here.

528
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:30,350
In any case, let's meet this fantastic woman of yours.

529
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,140
Do you feel relieved now?

530
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,500
But still.
I told you not to touch Mom's paintings, if possible.

531
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,310
Shut up.

532
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,240
Get out.

533
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,850
Father, if you keep doing this you'll get old.

534
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,360
Good news!

535
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,850
In the "Messenger Service Upgrade" contest,

536
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,060
Pi Song Hee's entry has won first place.

537
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,170
Congratulations, Pi Song Hee!

538
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,730
Thank you.

539
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,900
Wow, Song Hee,
what kind of story did you submit?

540
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,670
Oh! That story....about the time when you were preparing for a career?

541
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,660
Yes.....I submitted various ones.

542
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,880
Oh, the story that Song Hee submitted was,

543
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,580
"When my parents went on a holiday, I invited my boyfriend home..."

544
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,730
"Oppa, when are you coming?"
I sent this text mistakenly ...

545
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,890
Isn't that Ae Ra's idea?

546
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,080
Oh, well..

547
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,910
Ae Ra only gave a motive..

548
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,590
and Pi Song Hee finished the story.

549
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,780
When asked to enter the contest, they don't enter.

550
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,080
I don't think it's a desirable act to whisper behind their back.

551
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,240
Then, that's it.

552
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,650
Na Ae Ra, come see me.

553
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,450
What do you think a hoobae's most important role is?

554
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,810
Wh.. what? What role?

555
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,860
If I hadn't submitted your idea,

556
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,410
then it would've just stayed as an idea.

557
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:34,140
The moment that I've decided to submit that as an idea,
it came to me and became a flower.

558
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,220
I made your idea blossom.

559
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:43,930
I think...your most important role as a 'newbie" is to
support your senior, quietly from the back.

560
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,090
I'll buy you a meal next time.

561
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,720
Excuse me, Sunbaenim.

562
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,850
Pi Song Hee!

563
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,410
Why are you like this, really?

564
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:59,630
Then to a company sunbae,
I'll say something as a life sunbae.

565
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,460
Pi Song Hee,

566
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,820
you're a thief for selling off my privacy without my permission.

567
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,340
What did you say?

568
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,990
I'm giving you a chance, so it won't be something stolen.

569
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,360
Apologize to me.

570
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,140
That story wasn't meant to be sold off like that!
- Are you crazy?!

571
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,300
Does that story have a golden lining around it?

572
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,130
If you just search the internet,
you'll find tens of stories similar to that!

573
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,580
This place will eat you up alive,
if you don't eat them first, like a jungle!

574
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:38,490
They'll call you "stupid" behind your back if you
pout about getting your things taken. This is that place!

575
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,730
Whatever.

576
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,110
Na Ae Ra,

577
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,170
apologize to me.

578
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,740
What?
- You just spoke to me informally and called me a thief.

579
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,590
Apologize right now.

580
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,550
I don't think I'm the person who should be apologizing.

581
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,770
Apologize to me!

582
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,060
Let go! What's your problem?
- Apologize!

583
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,320
My arm!

584
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,830
Why are you like this? Really!

585
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,410
What are you doing now?

586
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,510
It's fine, CEO.

587
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,590
It's my fault for not training my hoobae well.

588
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,520
I have worked at this company for too long ...

589
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,280
Now, I'm scared to confront a hoobae.

590
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,720
Na Ae Ra,

591
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,040
come see me.

592
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,080
No, no, CEO.

593
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,450
I'll take care of this.
Don't pay too much attention.

594
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,580
Follow me.

595
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,150
No..nothing happened...

596
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,960
Oh, what should I do?

597
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,290
I'm sorry for showing you that kind of situation...

598
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,700
Okay.

599
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,420
I was a fool for thinking that
you might have changed even a little bit.

600
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,740
No, but...

601
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,590
There was a reason.

602
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,300
Is it that hard to work here quietly?

603
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,600
You said you wouldn't be a nuisance!

604
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,220
I was going to quietly come to work ...

605
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,680
Sir.

606
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,700
But? Ultimately what is this?
Fighting with your sunbae like this.

607
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,230
Even if she's younger than you, she's still a sunbae!

608
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,390
Why are you so egocentric?

609
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,680
When was I?
- Always.

610
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,590
Your feelings always come first.

611
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,980
If you're in a bad mood, regardless of who it is,
you say whatever you want.

612
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:04,110
If you were going to cause trouble like this again,
why did you say "sorry" in a pretense.

613
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,360
I don't want to know why you guys fought.

614
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,200
I've hired you on my behalf for 100%, but

615
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,410
I'm even starting to worry if it's right for you
to make my other employees uncomfortable.

616
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,540
I can't let this go like this.

617
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,940
You'll be reprimanded, according to the company's policy.
Be aware of that!

618
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,290
But there was a reason!

619
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,180
Shut up!

620
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,430
I'm this company's CEO!

621
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,010
An intern shouldn't be speaking to me like this.

622
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,740
You can go out now.

623
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,850
What happened?

624
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,140
Oh, Na Ae Ra caused a problem.

625
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,290
A problem?

626
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,860
What problem? Does it have to do with the company?

627
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,000
Of course, it's related to the company,
what else could it be?

628
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,890
Would it cause a sticky situation,
even for me to know the company's business?

629
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,350
No.

630
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,240
I saw her fighting with Pi Song Hee.

631
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,590
Oh.. really?

632
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:40,720
If it's something you're getting involved with, Na Ae Ra
must have done something really wrong to Sunbae.

633
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:47,960
I think it's unreasonable for her to pass her internship
after doing that to her sunbae.

634
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,550
Cha Jeong Woo. You.
Did you know that you survived twice, because of me?

635
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,290
You've developed 'free texting' because of me.

636
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:11,320
'Canceling a text' was also my idea.

637
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,470
If this continues, won't I be supporting
this whole company

638
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,600
Na Ae Ra,

639
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,490
you know that your free time is too long, right?

640
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,110
That all gets recorded in your evaluation record.
Don't you know that?

641
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,450
Yes, I am sorry.

642
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,040
Do you feel refreshed after tattling about everything?

643
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,680
She looks annoying and she also only does annoying things.

644
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,750
I didn't say it.

645
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,620
You want me to believe that?

646
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,860
I don't care if you believe me or not.

647
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,280
Yes, Director.

648
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,640
Can I take a look at the application of the interns who got hired this time?

649
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,120
Yes.

650
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,820
Our team's interns are generally in good standing.

651
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,740
Especially, Guk Seung Hyeon has great ideas,

652
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,500
and he has an important role in giving energy to the team!

653
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,510
And ...
-Yes. Please leave now.

654
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,430
Yes.

655
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,120
I don't want to talk about my ex-wife.

656
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,810
CEO, when you were having a hard time,

657
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:14,870
I was told that your ex-wife suffered a lot to support you.

658
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,350
After sacrificing your ex-wife,
what you built

659
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,690
is this company.

660
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:23,790
Even though I don't know where you heard that from,

661
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,720
please tell the person who knows her,

662
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,180
that she doesn't have the right to say that.

663
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:50,020
Team Leader, what should the menu be?

664
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,160
Huh?

665
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,880
I was going to buy dinner for winning the contest.

666
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,940
You can decide since you're paying.

667
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,500
Na Ae Ra!

668
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,810
Launching the luxury products is something
I've continuously been interested in.

669
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:23,270
I feel secure knowing I have an experienced worker
like you supporting me.

670
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,740
Yes.

671
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,310
Since it's the launching of a new product category,
there will be a lot of things to take care of.

672
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,110
I've emailed you the items
that have been progressed until now.

673
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:38,660
Look at it and prepare the data
before the meeting tomorrow morning, please.

674
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,380
Yes.

675
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,570
Let's go to the office dinner.

676
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,070
I feel a bit uneasy leaving Na Ae Ra alone.

677
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,650
It's too bad, but she wasn't blessed with eating food.

678
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,820
We should just let her eat with us
and make her go back to work after eating.

679
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,390
Yeah. That is better.

680
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:10,900
We have to get there by car.
Will she have the time to go back and forth?

681
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,780
By the way, as for me, if I don't finish my work completely,

682
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,570
the food doesn't go down easily.

683
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:22,300
Of course, it doesn't go down.
Then we should just go.

684
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,430
Aren't you getting in?

685
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:05,000
Excuse me.
Can I get one Jjajangmyun deliv...

686
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,080
Yes.

687
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,800
The door is closing.

688
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,860
Why are you here in this hour?

689
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,160
What do you mean? I always work overtime.

690
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:48,290
This company was created by blood and sweat from
devoted and talented people like me.

691
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,510
You have to know that.

692
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:52,720
Talented people?

693
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,840
To speak frankly,
the free message service you created.

694
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,380
You will acknowledge that you developed that
because of me, right?

695
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,980
What?

696
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,160
Of course,

697
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,000
you did develop the product.

698
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,830
But I gave you the inspiration?

699
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,860
It wasn't inspiration but mistreatment.

700
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,540
But there is one thing I acknowledge.

701
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,580
In all manners,
you think comfortably as it suits you,

702
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,020
I acknowledge that ability.

703
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,020
Hey! You rotten CEO!

704
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:50,100
Why is the bill so high?

705
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,030
Husband!

706
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:56,570
Don't create useless things, but try to
develop something where you can send this for free!

707
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:08,330
He thinks it's all because he's remarkable.

708
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:13,610
And then, he acts so humble so much.
Roll of pretenses!

709
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,870
Who is?

710
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,300
Seung Hyeon, you didn't go to the company dinner?

711
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,720
Ah, I forgot that I had a report to submit tomorrow morning.

712
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,480
I mean, isn't it a company dinner?

713
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,470
It is delicious to eat together.

714
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,070
But they just left me out.

715
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,740
Isn't it nice for them to say,

716
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,800
"We should postpone the company dinner?"

717
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,510
Then what would I say?

718
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:43,030
"You don't have to do that just for me."
That's what I would've done!

719
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:46,790
But they didn't even ask me.

720
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,800
Even then, I trusted you, Seung Hyeon.

721
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,100
Why?

722
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,720
Why else? Because we are colleagues.

723
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,070
Yes, colleagues. That's good.

724
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,680
Since we're colleagues,

725
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:10,700
let's share.

726
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,760
But you have to eat this with cup ramen.

727
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,550
You always try to steal my food!

728
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,860
Oh, don't eat all the soup!

729
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,610
I was going to buy her dinner since I was grateful.

730
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,380
It turned out well.

731
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,660
I saved my money.

732
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,270
As you all know, after the messenger update,

733
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,680
the number of new members increased by over a million.

734
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,280
In order to publicize our company's innovative image

735
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,720
through our newly developed messenger functions,

736
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,390
after examining the models...

737
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:02,470
The greatest top star!

738
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,810
We considered Brad Pitt with much enthusiasm,

739
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:10,160
but because of financial matters,
we instead chose the face of D&T Soft Ventures...

740
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,550
CEO Cha Jeong Woo as the model.

741
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,350
Wait a minute.

742
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,660
Are you saying that I will be in the commercial?

743
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:24,920
Yes. With the winner of the "messenger story contest",
you will have to shoot the commercial.

744
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,870
I mean... What is this... ?

745
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,100
That's a good idea.

746
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:39,560
Since it was CEO Cha who fully supported the research and development regarding the addition of new functionality.

747
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,920
Wait, but that's a little...

748
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:46,180
I'm not a professional model...

749
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:50,310
Save the money on model fees and invest it for research and development.

750
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,080
CEO, please don't worry.

751
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,190
Believe in me and follow me.

752
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,530
Image of a young and enthusiastic entrepreneur...

753
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,900
I'll be sure to plant that image.

754
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:28,860
You.. want me to do this? In this costume?

755
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,770
I am sorry.

756
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,430
I can never do that kind of thing.

757
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,530
I am doing this for the sake of the company.

758
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,600
Who is saying otherwise?

759
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,410
Do I.. look thinner?

760
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,670
It got a lot better.

761
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,550
Why hasn't the girl who I will take pictures together with come?

762
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,260
I know, huh? She should have started to put on makeup by now.

763
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,990
I am here.

764
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:32,290
Who are you?

765
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:36,230
I'm Pi Song Hee from the mobile shopping department.

766
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,550
Pi Song Hee, you came? Pi Song Hee, you are here?

767
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,980
First, get your makeup done, and...

768
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,470
I am sorry.

769
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,930
Huh?

770
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,040
I'd gotten a facial peel, because of this shoot.
But my face will not calm down.

771
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,380
Please make sure I get in the photoshoot.

772
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,070
You can photo shop my picture? I've heard that there's
a lot of advancement with that technology.

773
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:09,560
You can even erase all the acne, right?

774
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,430
This face is...

775
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,910
Even the director from Avatar would not be able to save this.

776
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,650
Na Ae Ra?

777
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:05,810
Why are you her...e?

778
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:09,900
Didn't you hear? I'm the substitute.
