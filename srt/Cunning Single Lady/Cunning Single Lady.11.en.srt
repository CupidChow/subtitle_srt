00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,200
Episode 11

2
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,850
What brings you here?

3
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,300
Seung Hyeon.
- Hyung,

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,010
I'm past the worry I was struggling with before.

5
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,160
Hyung... I...

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,820
You can't!

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,410
Don't do it!

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,920
Hyung, you knew about it, right?

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,170
That's right. I knew.

10
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,640
That you like Na Ae Ra.

11
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,670
I worried for nothing.

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,590
Since you say you already know, I'll just say it straightforward.

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,470
I... like Na Ae Ra.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,400
Enough that I can't stop my feelings,
even knowing that she's your ex-wife.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,380
You can't. I said you can't!

16
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,480
Why can't I?

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,400
Your relationship with Ae Ra is already finished!

18
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,450
I...

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,060
I just don't like you getting involved with someone I knew.

20
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,630
It's not like we broke up on good terms.

21
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,420
That's the only reason?

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,120
Why are we going to the sauna so late at night?

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,430
If we go to sleep like this, both you and I

24
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,590
will be tossing and turning all night
because we can't fall asleep.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,130
Let's relax in hot water!

26
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,660
Why can't we sleep? Why can't we sleep because of that jerk?

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,380
I said everything I had to say, so I can stretch my legs and
sleep comfortably!

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,640
I got it, so let's go take a bath with your daughter

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,540
who doesn't sleep at home often.

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,140
Aigoo, in the moonlight.

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,320
I asked if that's the only reason.

32
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,700
Yes, that's it.

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,890
But even if it's only that...
-That's enough then.

34
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,640
Hey, Guk Seung Hyeon!

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,840
I don't want to become uncomfortable with you because of this problem.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,270
Let's do it this way. Last time when I beat you in judo,

37
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,820
you said you'd grant me a wish.

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,670
Even if I approach Na Ae Ra,

39
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,050
that you'll be cool about it.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,890
Oh, that's right! I forgot to bring the scrubbing towels.

41
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,650
Aigoo, so forgetful. I'll bring them.

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,930
Why are you being like this?

43
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,650
You ... how did you know that?

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,390
Perhaps...

45
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,740
did Na Ae Ra tell you?

46
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,370
Ae Ra doesn't even know that I know.

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,530
Oh, Ae...

48
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,500
Aish! Seriously!

49
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,670
What is this?

50
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,200
A painting.

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,490
A painting of Na Ae Ra.

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,930
What did you draw?

53
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,560
It's my heart.

54
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,990
This is your heart?

55
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,260
Yes! I came to give her this.

56
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,210
I don't know for what business you came here for,
but if you're done, leave.

57
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,740
Hey, hey!

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,010
This...

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,720
Hyung, really?! Stop there!

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,440
I don't want to!

61
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,940
Hey!

62
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,060
What is that noise?

63
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,140
Aigoo, it must drunkards fighting again. The crazy bastards. Aigoo...

64
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,600
So childish!

65
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,750
Hey,

66
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,220
is that your heart?

67
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,710
Yes.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,460
Aigoo.

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,800
This is just infatuation.

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,170
Examine your heart again!

71
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,470
You said that you and Ae Ra are already over ...

72
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,080
Even though it's over, there's no change that
we were once married.

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,490
And if ... Na Ae Ra knew our relationship,

74
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,610
would she be comfortable?

75
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,790
Then...our relationship,

76
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,790
let's keep it a secret from Ae Ra.

77
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,690
Let's give some time for Ae Ra to see Guk Seung Hyeon as a man.

78
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,150
Oh my...

79
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,710
It won't take long. I'll do my best.

80
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,070
And Ae Ra will make the decision anyway.

81
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,880
I told you that you can't!

82
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,500
Even though you may be better at math than me,

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,790
I know my heart better.

84
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,440
So... stop acting like a teacher, Hyung.

85
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,650
I've decided what I'm going to do for sure.

86
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,950
Now, you need to decide.

87
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,160
My sister...

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,680
The way my sister feels about you, I don't think you don't know.

89
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,370
Even if your heart is different from my sister's, I won't hate you.

90
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,760
Just ... make your position clear.

91
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,220
So my sister doesn't get hurt.

92
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,310
Why is it Na Ae Ra of all people?

93
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,010
Why is it Na Ae Ra?!

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,440
The ceiling's going to fall!

95
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,730
Why are you sighing in the middle of the night?

96
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,050
Speak for yourself, Mom!

97
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,060
When my daughter is sighing next to me,

98
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,710
what kind of mom sleeps with her legs stretched out?

99
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,210
You said earlier that you'd be able to sleep comfortably!

100
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,060
You're right.

101
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,430
I thought I could,

102
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,710
but I don't feel that good.

103
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,410
If I yelled at him, then he should have retorted or something!

104
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,700
"I repaid all the debts." How could I not yell when he says that?!

105
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,440
So why'd you bring up debts? It's already over.

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,540
But that's not right.

107
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,250
Even though love is important for a married couple,

108
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,970
the friendshipt that grows while living together is more important.

109
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,830
Loyalty!

110
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,460
Even though your fate with Son-in-law Cha is over,

111
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,500
if he has a bit of loyalty,
he should recognize your suffering!

112
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,020
It's been a long time since we got divorced.

113
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,330
It's only uncomfortable.

114
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,690
Why disturb a fate that's already ended?

115
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,400
Aigoo.

116
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,530
Who am I blaming?

117
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,870
My heart jumped when I heard that he became rich.

118
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,220
I'm sorry, Mom. During the divorce, my problems were so big,

119
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,150
I didn't see how upset you were.

120
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,760
At the words that he was a skilled civil worker,

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,120
I was the one who pushed you, so why are you sorry?

122
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,730
I tried to make you live differently from me.

123
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,030
Taking care of your dad my entire life,

124
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,320
I told myself that I shouldn't make my daughter live the same life.

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,080
Aigoo.

126
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,490
It's all my fault.

127
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,050
Is marriage something you do because you're forced to?

128
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,680
Marriage and divorce are all decisions. I'll take responsibility.

129
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,440
Don't be upset, Mom!

130
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,090
Aigoo, go away! I don't want to see you.

131
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,290
Aigoo, Mom~

132
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,990
Why are you clinging onto me?

133
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,890
It's so warm and nice.

134
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,770
I...

135
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,380
You can't.

136
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,170
Don't.

137
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,550
You two are already over.

138
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,390
I just...

139
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,900
don't like the fact that you're getting involved with someone I knew.

140
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,750
Is that it?

141
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,660
♫ Like back then, I am pushing you♫

142
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,930
I asked if that's it.

143
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:59,940
♫ One day ... I'm living for one day ♫

144
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,500
Our Ae Ra ... after separating from you,

145
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,290
trying to repay all the debts,

146
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,950
she worked not knowing whether it was day or night!

147
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,270
She took over the household for 4 years right from the beginning of her newlywed years,

148
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,800
wouldn't it be strange not to have debts?

149
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,370
While she was living with her friend,

150
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,690
do you know how hard it was for me watch her

151
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,130
pay off those debts?

152
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,660
If I think of my life that was messed up because of you,

153
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,840
no amount of money will suffice!

154
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,560
So with just a few dollars,

155
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,220
don't look down at a person!

156
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,880
Alright, what about Seung Hyeon?

157
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,370
Yes, well, he's working very hard.

158
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,310
At this rate, he might become the best employee.

159
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,430
I thought he would stop after 2 weeks,

160
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,560
but he's enduring very well.

161
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,470
I told him to remain after finishing his internship.

162
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,210
Oh, really?

163
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,750
Did Seung Hyeon say that he will?

164
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,790
I need Seung Hyeon.

165
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,950
Everything's worked out well.

166
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,390
Ah, and you,

167
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,720
shouldn't you see the results?

168
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,100
There's already a rumor about you and CEO Cha.

169
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,350
Don't worry about it.

170
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,260
Although bachelors don't experience a loss from that sort of thing, is it the same for a woman?

171
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,640
I'll meet CEO Cha very soon and talk...

172
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,310
Don't do that. Don't do anything.

173
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,310
Please eat more. I'm finished.

174
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,160
Just like her mother,

175
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,090
isn't she the type to make sharp remarks?

176
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,060
Are you looking for something?

177
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,230
No, for some reason, my butt stings today.

178
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,120
I was checking to see if there are thorns
spread out on the couch.

179
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,490
I'm sorry Hyungnim.
About Ae Ra repaying all my debts,

180
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,380
and Mother-in-law who's very upset about that,

181
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm really ashamed of myself.

182
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,440
You said you didn't know!

183
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,560
Those things are possible!

184
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,440
I shouldn't have given Ae Ra's alimony through you.

185
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,570
The fact that you took Ae Ra's alimony,

186
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,090
I don't know what to think.

187
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,190
Brother-in-law Cha,

188
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,360
I felt like I was going to die!

189
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
I understand. I know it's hard while doing business.

190
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,460
Right? I thought that you'd understand me!

191
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,510
But that money wasn't the money to be used that way!

192
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,460
Of course, it's my fault for trusting you.

193
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,560
Do you know how much ...
-I'm sorry.

194
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,500
I'll see if there is a position for you in this company.

195
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,790
In D&T?

196
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,570
Okay. I've always been ... the type to be free,

197
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,610
but trying out a regular (work) lifestyle

198
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,920
isn't bad either.

199
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,990
Thank you very much.

200
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
If you would do that,

201
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,320
then my heart would be a lot lighter.

202
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,740
And please keep our meeting today a secret.

203
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,640
Okay. Thank you, Brother-in-law Cha.

204
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,400
I mean, CEO Cha.

205
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,430
Na Ae Ra?

206
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,140
How is the planning for Unified Shilla Hotel's deal going?

207
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,490
I've attached the project plan modifications.

208
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,660
Please review it.

209
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,060
Prepare so that briefing will go well.

210
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,890
Yes.

211
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,140
Song Hee...

212
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,750
It's a deal that gives our company a chance
to exclusively move forward,

213
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,290
why are they putting Ae Ra in charge of something so important?

214
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,700
To a mere intern?

215
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,850
It's just that when things aren't going well,
they need a sacrificial lamb.

216
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,360
Then is Ae Ra totally shoveling (wasting her time) right now?

217
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,530
Well, an intern's fate ... isn't it being a bulletproof vest?

218
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,170
This white and sweet dessert will lighten your mood.

219
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,080
Let's eat it on the way.

220
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,770
How long will it take to eat this?

221
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,140
I'm busy. I have to do the luxury product's deal launching.

222
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,740
I still have to work on the Unified Shilla Hotel's deal.

223
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,660
And the organic vegetables project that they asked me to plan, I haven't even started it.

224
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,820
You're going to do that all at once?

225
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,590
You're trying to finish it all at once and get a vacation, aren't you?

226
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,810
They don't give breaks to interns. Do them one by one, slowly.

227
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,780
I can't.

228
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,450
I have to finish everything, and qu...

229
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,110
Anyways, I need to get everything organized.

230
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,420
What is this?

231
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,860
"I'm thinking of quitting."
Is that what you want to say, like last time?

232
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Look at this woman.
Is it because of me?

233
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,580
To avoid me?
-It's not like that.

234
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,550
Then why?

235
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,140
There's something.

236
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,000
Because of CEO Cha?

237
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,360
You said that last time,

238
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,990
you were thinking of quitting because you didn't like CEO Cha.

239
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,450
That was a joke. Anyway,

240
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,670
I'm going to quit, regardless of that.

241
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,600
I've decided to keep working at the company.

242
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,230
Are you working at the company because of me?

243
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,400
Yes. I work to see you!

244
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,210
Why do you like me?

245
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,220
Is there a reason for liking?

246
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,720
I like you because I just do.

247
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,240
You live your life very comfortably.

248
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,360
No, I don't.

249
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,020
I've been living very complicatedly and seriously.

250
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,730
Because of you.

251
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,580
Don't keep doing that.

252
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,710
I'll be really burdened if you kept doing that.

253
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,460
Burdensome... that means

254
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,540
that you've started to care. Right?

255
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,550
Really!

256
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,760
Don't be burdened. I'm just...

257
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,010
a guardian angel who will

258
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,830
prevent you from getting sad or fall into depression.

259
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,810
It's alright.

260
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,880
Brother-in-law Cha, today was a beneficial meeting.

261
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,120
I will remember every word you said and think about it.

262
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,430
I think I'll just get them tattooed on my chest!

263
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,540
Please go in carefully.

264
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,590
Oppa!

265
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,790
Why are you here?

266
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,060
I just came to visit while passing by.

267
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,100
While passing by?

268
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,070
I guess you bought a car.

269
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,850
But why is an intern driving a car to work?
We are even lacking parking spaces.

270
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,770
None of your business!

271
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,730
You asked me for time so that Na Ae Ra
could see you for who you are ...

272
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,280
You're not trying to do something with this, right?

273
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,550
Hyung, honestly, an ex-husband...

274
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,030
don't you think it's a memory that she wants to erase?

275
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,300
You call yourself a 'love doctor,' yet you don't know anything!

276
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,980
For a woman, the man she met last is the standard.

277
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,790
They're bound to compare.

278
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,690
Really?

279
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,060
If it's like that then... what am I lacking that you have?

280
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm tall, young,

281
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,490
strong.

282
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,080
Really?

283
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,220
Look at you stumbling.

284
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,790
I'm still very strong!

285
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,670
Do you know how hard I work on taking care of my body?

286
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,950
Then do you want to bet for real this time?

287
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,270
If I win, you acknowledge our relationship.

288
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,430
What? "Our relationship?"

289
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,600
What are you doing?

290
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,580
You two?

291
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,080
Ah, uhm,

292
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
our CEO has been exercising so much lately,

293
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,070
so he has confidence and wants to compete with me.

294
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,760
Do you want to be the referee?

295
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,490
Me?

296
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,440
How about me?

297
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,890
Yo. (polite form)

298
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,550
I'm not going to go easy simply because you're the CEO.

299
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,540
Just don't insist on your way after you lose.

300
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,070
You didn't talk to Jeong Woo about money again, right?

301
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,660
What do you see me as?

302
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,190
I really don't want Jeong Woo to know about the loan.

303
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,340
Don't add to it.

304
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,280
Okay. Okay.

305
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,500
Okay, from a sportsman's mindset,

306
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,400
I'll expect you to show your skills, fair and square.

307
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,950
There's no letting you off easy because you know the judge.

308
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,340
Ready!

309
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,070
Begin!

310
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,230
CEO, be careful. You're wearing expensive clothes.

311
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,000
You... foot...!

312
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,550
You took your hand off and held it again.

313
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,030
What? I took it off slightly!

314
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,420
There's no such thing!

315
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,900
If you take your hand off your ankle, you lose!

316
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,440
Referee!
- Referee!

317
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,870
Based on the rules of our neighborhood's cockfight,

318
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,120
this is a plate appearance.

319
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,020
No, CEO Cha...

320
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,520
WIN!

321
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,870
Excuse me? Without the neighborhood rules,

322
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,540
let's do a competition to show your physical strength.

323
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,360
Three!

324
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,200
Why are you doing this?

325
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,820
What should I say...

326
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Men have an instinct to fight even if their eyes meet.

327
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,930
Then are you fighting with CEO?

328
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,490
I'm just saying.

329
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,170
It's just fun.

330
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,940
Enjoy it.

331
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,630
Huh, wow.

332
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,450
Fif...teen!

333
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,660
Six ...

334
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,850
Six...

335
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,750
Okay!

336
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,780
Yeah!
- Yeah!

337
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,370
Approved!

338
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,280
One.

339
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,330
Two.

340
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,920
You've aged a lot, too.

341
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,330
Four.

342
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,130
You're having a hard time.

343
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,000
Six.

344
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,930
Eight.

345
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,840
Nine.

346
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,230
Ten.

347
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,670
Eleven.

348
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,470
Look. Since he's young, he's doing so well.

349
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,380
Thirteen.

350
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,300
Over there. Hey!

351
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,640
You're cheating!

352
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,520
Bellyflop!

353
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,990
Yes, bellyflop.
-Really?

354
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,920
He just used his stomach!

355
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,700
Right?
- That's right, bellyflop.

356
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,750
Why are you calling it a bellyflop because I moved a little?

357
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,070
You shook?

358
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,680
Let's play fair, all right?

359
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,930
13 to 15. Since you lost this time, too...

360
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,010
2-0... Guess, I won!

361
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,730
Look! I told you age has nothing to do with physical ability!

362
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,810
I can't agree.

363
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,820
You can't argue this so one-sidedly. You can't.

364
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,200
It's not that I'm arguing. It's the rule!

365
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,720
Rule. You need to keep the rule.

366
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,320
Come on!

367
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,550
I will decide.

368
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,170
2-0 CEO...
WIN!

369
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,300
Yeah!

370
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,790
Yeah!

371
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,500
Here.

372
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,870
Seung Hyeon, let's go.

373
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,840
Okay!

374
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,610
CEO, we'll be going since we're busy.

375
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,560
You hurry up and leave, too!

376
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,360
Let's hurry up and go.

377
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,610
After thinking about it, the deal between us is of no use, right?

378
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,440
Ae Ra's heart is important.

379
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,510
You feel like you lost, right?

380
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,620
Do you like Na Ae Ra a lot?

381
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,290
How'd you know?

382
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,630
You seem to care for her a lot.

383
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,560
Even at the funeral and at the workshop,

384
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,340
having fun at the office,

385
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,210
even accepting the Design Team's Team Leader position,

386
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,420
it seems like it's Ae Ra's influence.

387
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,560
Keep it a secret from Dad.

388
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,450
When the time comes, I'll introduce her myself.

389
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,470
I don't want to burden her now.

390
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,560
Is it because she's old or is it because she's a divorcee?

391
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,010
How do you know everything?

392
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,910
You're my precious one and only younger brother.

393
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,170
How can I not know?

394
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,250
Of course, my precious older sister.

395
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,520
Yes, let's say you like her.

396
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,910
How does Ae Ra feel about you?

397
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,820
Well...

398
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,500
Let's say it's very amicable. Like it's almost ready?

399
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,360
It's still unrequited love, isn't it?

400
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,160
Besides you, is there another man?

401
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,720
Well, a person she used to know is lingering, but

402
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,270
it's nothing.

403
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,590
I wish that you wouldn't go too far ahead alone.

404
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,380
In love, the one who loves most

405
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,120
is the weaker one.

406
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,560
Noona,

407
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,720
I want you to be happy.

408
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,970
More than anyone in the world.

409
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,470
I want you to be happy, too.

410
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,180
More than anyone else in the world.

411
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,790
Aren't you coming to get your cellphone chain?

412
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,150
I'm busy now.

413
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,360
If you leave it at the front desk of the first floor lobby, I'll get it.

414
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,400
What are you doing?

415
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,510
Everyone is gone and nobody seems to be here.

416
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,420
I have something to do.

417
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,360
The ones who can't study well always stay later and show it.

418
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,910
What?

419
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,230
Here.

420
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,860
What? You came here to give me this?

421
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,060
Why else would I have come here?

422
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,850
Okay. Thanks.

423
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,770
Then... I'm leaving.

424
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,980
Okay.

425
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,050
What do I do?

426
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,150
What happened?

427
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,210
What do I do? Everything disappeared!

428
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,960
Move.

429
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,880
What do I do if I can't recover it?

430
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,670
I spent the last two days doing this.

431
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,360
I have to report this to

432
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,250
Team Manager tomorrow!

433
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,150
This is really important!

434
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,740
So you should have auto-saved while working on it!

435
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,650
Don't download just anything!

436
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,470
And don't open any emails from people you don't know! They're all viruses!

437
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,380
I don't know...

438
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,900
Is it all done?

439
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,940
It's done?!

440
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,710
Of course. I did it.

441
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,840
Oh, what a relief!

442
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,520
You even know how to do this kind of thing, I'm seeing you in a new light.

443
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,650
Don't you know who I am?

444
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,690
What place was it that developed the anti-virus program, VV 3.0?

445
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,220
It was this very company.

446
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,370
And who is the center of that?

447
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,490
Me, Cha Jeong Woo.

448
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,720
Showing off.

449
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,530
You should at least give credit where credit is due.

450
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,550
Last year, if I didn't distribute it for free, but rather,
charged money for it,

451
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,800
I'd be sitting in a bucket of money.

452
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,000
Okay, thank you, thanks. Because of you I got ten years of my life back, satisfied?

453
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,880
Well, if you say so.

454
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,030
But what is all this?

455
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,520
Unified Shilla Hotel asked us to move forward
with planning a deal.

456
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,410
Because I did a good job last time, they had a good impression.

457
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:54,110
So the Team Manager especially put me in charge of it.

458
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,820
She left this to a mere intern and left for the day?

459
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,630
This Team Leader Wang won't do!

460
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,590
But did you ever write a planning proposal?

461
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,270
What's wrong with it? At first glance, it looks well-written!

462
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,790
Hey, this...?

463
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,990
What are you looking at?

464
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,320
Let go.

465
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,780
Hey, how childish, what is this?

466
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,490
Ay, I was going to delete that.

467
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,150
You even write an unrefined planning proposal.

468
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,510
Fundamentally, you should write what kind of effect
they'll gain if they invest ...

469
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,230
You have to write it concisely so that the client can simply understand it.

470
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,090
And if you convert that effect into money, you should calculate how much that would be ...

471
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:51,970
Geez.

472
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,030
Have you done this a lot?

473
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,990
I've written them hundreds of times.

474
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,200
I'm well acquainted with business proposals.

475
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,710
If they'll just read it properly, I'd be thankful.

476
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,500
If it turns out well, I'll treat you to dinner.

477
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,010
There you go, goofing off again.

478
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,030
If an employee does a good job, the CEO should treat, why would you have to buy?

479
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,520
Do you want some coffee?
-Yes.

480
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,410
Why did my brother come?

481
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,880
Perhaps, did he come to borrow money?

482
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,340
No, he didn't.

483
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,030
I asked to see him.

484
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,740
Why?

485
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,490
The loans ...

486
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,950
I didn't know.

487
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,370
The debt we got for my research funds ...

488
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,740
that you were repaying them.

489
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,310
It's been bothering you since my mom told you, hasn't it?

490
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,520
It's fine. I'm the one who didn't tell you about it anyway.

491
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,010
Why didn't you tell me?

492
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,020
I thought you were living shabbily.

493
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,000
I didn't know you were living like this.

494
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,830
Just because.

495
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,290
I didn't want to see you again for the reason of
asking you to pay back,

496
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,800
since the debt was incurred because of someone else.

497
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,540
You must have resented me.

498
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,370
Resent?

499
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,220
No.

500
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,040
I married you because I chose to.

501
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,170
I decided that it was my price to pay.

502
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,200
Don't you regret it?

503
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,570
Perhaps.

504
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,250
You succeeded,

505
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,860
and even if you were to repay all that debt because of it,

506
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,470
nothing would have changed for me.

507
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,300
Because that money

508
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:39,030
wouldn't have been able to revive our hope that disappeared.

509
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,290
Yeah,

510
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,670
I think we were meant to be just to that point.

511
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,370
Ae Ra...

512
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,050
Ah, the night air sure is nice!

513
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,700
But why aren't there any stars in the night sky?

514
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,310
They said it was going to rain tonight.

515
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,200
Really?

516
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,110
Hey! Oh!

517
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,550
How could the rain come so suddenly?

518
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,620
Come here.
- I'm fine.

519
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,820
Come here. What is this?

520
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,090
Sit here for a moment.

521
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,300
Ay, I'm fine.

522
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,760
Just sit.

523
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,390
I said that I'm okay!

524
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,290
I said that I'm fine!

525
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,430
Just stay still, what is this?

526
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,380
Why did it have to rain so suddenly?

527
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,060
It's okay.

528
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,150
Fine, I'll wipe it carefully.

529
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,920
Just give me an umbrella.

530
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:19,840
I'll drop you off.

531
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,800
Why? There are still buses running.

532
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,370
Hey!

533
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,520
Why are you wearing white clothes when it's raining? And such light clothing at that?

534
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,870
I thought today's weather was going to be clear.

535
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,050
No, dry this all off before you go. Dry it all.

536
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,720
It's fine!

537
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,810
Take this.

538
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,240
Don't take this off until you're all dried off.

539
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,140
You're going overboard.

540
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,680
In any case, don't ever take this off.

541
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,830
Aiyoo, I'm going.

542
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,380
Th....there....

543
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,820
I'll use this and give it back.

544
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,190
This tastes so good.

545
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,140
At 11:00, the Development Team.

546
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,450
You have an appointment with professors of KAIST at 4 in the afternoon.

547
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,780
What about in between, then?

548
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,740
In between those,

549
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,520
there isn't anything official scheduled.

550
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,340
Really?

551
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,060
Then contact the security team,

552
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,480
and let's have a terrorism drill.

553
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,680
These days, the situation with the Korean Peninsula
isn't so good.

554
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,960
A terror drill?

555
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,000
Then, we'll have a business meeting, set a date and give a day's notice.

556
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,500
A drill is supposed to prepare us for an emergency. If we tell them ahead of time, there's no point in doing one.

557
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,990
Just contact the security team and tell them that 2PM would be a good time for one.

558
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,510
A realistic one.

559
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,020
"Emergency Alert!"
"Emergency Alert!"

560
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,800
There are terrorists in the building.
The automatic device will be activated.

561
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,340
What's going on?

562
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,550
The employees should evacuate the building immediately.

563
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:12,640
I'm making another announcement.
This is an emergency!

564
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,690
The automatic device that activates when the terrorists ...

565
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,420
All employees should evacuate right now.

566
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,730
Do you know where Na Ae Ra is?

567
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,050
Na Ae Ra?
I sent her on an errand to the equipment room.

568
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,260
The equipment room?

569
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,480
There's a terrorist in the company right now.

570
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,590
Terrorist?

571
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,080
All employees should evacuate immediately.

572
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,760
For now, come here.

573
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,860
... the security team should ...

574
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,720
It's fine now. He's gone.

575
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,630
Who? A terrorist just passed by?

576
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,810
Yeah.

577
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,130
Just a while ago...

578
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,240
Why would a terrorist come here?

579
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,600
If they're trying to take a famous IT company like ours hostage,

580
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,240
they're definitely trying to request something from the nation.

581
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,340
Our country? Republic of South Korea?

582
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,750
Yes, bend down.

583
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,750
But don't we have to get out of here?

584
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,060
They announced that we should go outside.

585
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,290
Aigoo! What are you saying?

586
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,230
Being here like this...like this, is far safer.

587
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,650
For now get down, let's stay bent over, down like this.

588
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,760
All employees should move out quickly.

589
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,460
Ah ... this was just a drill! A drill!

590
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,180
Ah, and I thought it was real!

591
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,260
We do this once or twice a year, are you that clueless?

592
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,350
Oh, so Team Leader, you noticed (that it was a drill)

593
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,460
and so you ran out so willy-nilly?

594
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,130
So much so that you even lost a shoe?

595
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,840
Aigoo.

596
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,090
Are you Cinderella?

597
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,900
I mean, my shoes were a little big.

598
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,140
Didn't Ae Ra come out yet?

599
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,290
No.

600
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,380
Anyway, she has her way of disappearing and reappearing.

601
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,590
She's a female Hong Gil Dong.
(Hong Gil Dong, a famous legendary robber from the old times comparable to Robin Hood)

602
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,990
Where is she?

603
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,690
Seeing us like this,
it looks like we have a close relationship.

604
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,210
A long time ago, when we would listen to music in my dorm room;

605
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,480
it's kind of like that, too.

606
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,500
You keep getting sentimental these days.

607
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,550
Yesterday, we both got wet in the rain.

608
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,850
I know. It would've been nice if there had been some stars.

609
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,810
Should we go watch a movie next time?

610
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,820
What?! You're saying something like that in this situation?

611
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,540
Emergency situation lifted. Emergency situation lifted.

612
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,260
Thank you for participating in this drill.

613
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,730
Please move back to your office ...

614
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,000
What? This was a drill?

615
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,860
Ah.. ah!

616
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,660
Aigoo!

617
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,420
So this was a drill?! I didn't know.

618
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,400
A drill.

619
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,530
Does it make sense that the CEO didn't know this was a drill?

620
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,660
Were you trying to pull a joke on me?

621
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,860
No, no!

622
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,710
I... I misunderstood it for a second.

623
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,580
Misunderstood, my butt.

624
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,130
Since you made a person into a fool, is it fun? Is it nice?

625
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,840
Aish, it hurts.

626
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,420
Close relationship?

627
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,740
Even an enemy, where is there an enemy like this?

628
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,140
Aigoo, that woman really!

629
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,570
Ah, what the...? You scared me...

630
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,440
Does it hurt to be like this and let it go?

631
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,100
Why are you like this?
Did your stress-induced stomach ulcer relapse again?

632
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Stress-induced stomach ulcer, huh...

633
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:36,000
Now days, the only problem that could make your stomach react like this ... is it because of Na Ae Ra?

634
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,250
Hey, you.

635
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,870
I'm right. I'm right.

636
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,660
Then what does that mean?

637
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,100
Love-hate? Lingering feeling?

638
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,730
Or is it pain from a newly growing love?

639
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,260
No matter how much you try to deny it with words,
the body is quite truthful.

640
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,020
Don't be like this and go rest in the car.

641
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,070
Forget it. I'm going down.

642
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,990
Do you not feel well, CEO?

643
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,470
Oh, my insides...

644
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,920
Stress-induced stomach ulcer...

645
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,120
CEO,

646
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,670
are you feeling unwell somewhere?

647
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,830
No, I'm fine.

648
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,080
Don't worry.

649
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,510
How can I not worry?

650
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,890
How can any employee in our company not worry about the CEO's health?

651
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,990
CEO!

652
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,510
I... I have a bad stomach ulcer...

653
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,140
S...stomach ulcer?

654
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,400
Yes.

655
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,360
I don't know if you've experienced it, but

656
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,700
I have very bad heartburn
and this stomach pain is no joke!

657
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:15,510
If this gets worse, they say that you can vomit blood and have bloody excrement....

658
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,820
Bloody stools? Is it that severe?!

659
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,770
Yes.

660
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,370
I'll go up and

661
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,340
rest.

662
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,250
Since I haven't eaten anything, I don't have any strength.

663
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,580
Go ahead and work.

664
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,960
If Section Chief Gam knows about it,
then everyone in the company will know.

665
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,110
CEO has a stomach ulcer?

666
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,690
Yes! He can't eat anything and

667
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,410
I think he's so stressed with his duties that
he came down with an illness.

668
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,350
Especially in times like this, so we don't cause him worries,

669
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,190
let's work diligently together! Diligently!

670
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,460
Our team is ... as long as Chief Kang works diligently, then we're all diligent.

671
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,090
They say that a person's mind gets weaker if they're sick.

672
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:25,600
Now that Director Guk is next to him, I can't even step forward too aggressively and take care of him.

673
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,190
Our CEO doesn't exaggerate,

674
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,650
that he told me those symptoms in such detail...

675
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,670
Honey,

676
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,580
I don't have any appetite now,

677
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,560
so could you make me some sesame porridge?

678
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,880
He must think of me as very special and

679
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,580
very close!

680
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,130
What should I do now?

681
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,690
When someone doesn't have an appetite ... sesame porridge? Sesame porridge is good.

682
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,220
Sesame porridge! Sesame porridge!

683
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,030
Sesame porridge! Sesame porridge!

684
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,680
Oh, wait for me.

685
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,770
CEO's line, I, Chief Kang, will mobilize personally!

686
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,140
Sesame porridge! Sesame porridge!

687
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,360
If it's sesame porridge, Na Ae Ra really makes a tasty one...

688
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,530
So what burned you wasn't your stomach, but your heart.
Now, the truth is coming out.

689
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:21,500
Aiyoo, even when I was laying down with my head cracked open, she acted like she didn't know me.

690
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,660
When I'm laying here with a stomach illness she doesn't even look at me.

691
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,430
Isn't this too much?

692
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,390
What do you mean she didn't care?

693
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:34,700
That time at the hospital, it was Na Ae Ra who stayed with you until dawn.

694
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,020
What?

695
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,990
I had to get your clothes, so I went home and slept.

696
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,920
And Director Guk got the news in the morning and went there.

697
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,560
And the one who took care of you during the night in between then was Na Ae Ra.

698
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,920
If you don't need anything, can I get in late tonight?

699
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,830
Are you awake now?

700
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,170
Sesame porridge!

701
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,890
Ah, the rice wasn't soaked ...

702
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,730
Please understand even if it takes a little long. I'll try to do it quickly.

703
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,810
Bora Home Shopping ... 20%

704
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,250
It's a failure, a failure. It's completely a mess!

705
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,490
Is it Chief Kang again?

706
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,030
Where were we at?

707
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,000
Baba.

708
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,340
Baba Fashion.

709
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,140
27%.

710
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,580
You don't have to do all this.

711
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,640
Everyone else has probably left for the day.

712
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,260
Ah, yes.

713
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,200
There are people working overtime!

714
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:30,110
Someone is working overtime?

715
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,470
Ae Ra, are you really going to be like this?

716
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,200
I feel like I could die because I can't help him!

717
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,530
I have a lot of work to do, too.

718
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,560
What's more important than the CEO's health?!

719
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,350
This is an order from your Sunbae (senior).

720
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:01,080
Before it gets any later, run over here immediately!

721
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,270
Are you going to go?

722
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,130
Who is this?

723
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,660
It's nice.

724
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,180
Hot. It's hot!

725
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,200
Be careful. Be careful.

726
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,700
You should have asked me to help you. Are you okay?

727
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,440
Yes, I am okay.

728
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,990
Can I do it like this?

729
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,990
Isn't it hard for you to work alone?

730
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,840
You probably need help sometimes.

731
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,740
I am having a hard time, but

732
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,800
I'm getting some money because I'm doing it alone.

733
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,340
If I hire people, I can't make any money.

734
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,000
Our Min Young is even shrewd.

735
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,080
But after doing business for a while,

736
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,630
there comes a time when you need to expand your business.

737
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,490
This can't shake.

738
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,230
Oh, is that so?

739
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,450
Why is it so hot like this?

740
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,950
I know, huh?

741
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,030
Me, too, there's a sudden heat coming from my body.

742
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,080
Oh, why is it so hot?

743
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,900
Why? What's wrong?!

744
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,860
Calm down! Calm down!

745
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,570
How did you come?

746
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,080
Didn't you say you were sick?

747
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,660
They say that it's a stress-induced stomach ulcer.

748
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,570
My stomach always got upset if I stressed too much.

749
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,250
Okay. Eat.

750
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,840
Do you want to eat together?

751
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,670
Since Ae Ra can't be the only one to look good to the CEO.

752
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,940
CEO, I bought an expensive abalone porridge.

753
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,350
You're totally touched, right?

754
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,370
Guk Seung Hyeon, there's not enough room as it is!

755
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,530
Come sit here. Here!

756
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,740
Um, I came empty-handed...

757
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,160
You two eat it.

758
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,890
No, we should just leave and tell Hyung to rest well.

759
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,750
"Hyung?"

760
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,320
How can you call CEO, Hyung?

761
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,270
I'm so comfortable with CEO.

762
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,740
Hyung comes out naturally.

763
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,530
Secretary Gil isn't even here. Who's going to eat all of this?

764
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,260
Sit down and eat together.

765
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,580
Sit down.

766
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,950
Yes, Min Young?

767
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,200
Fire?

768
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,690
I got it.

769
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:59,800
I will be there right away.

770
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,470
There was a fire at home? (Informal)

771
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,080
Did she say there was a fire at home?

772
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,580
I think I should leave first. I'm sorry.

773
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,660
Please leave.

774
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,500
It's not a place for you to get involved.

775
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,830
The CEO should just stay still.

776
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,850
You stay still! It's not a place for a kid to get involved!

777
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,180
Director.

778
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,760
Director, have you come?

779
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,570
You came?

780
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:56,450
I didn't know you guys were together.

781
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,250
Due to an urgent matter, we should really leave.

782
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,280
Director and CEO, you should have a talk ...

783
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,780
I will leave.

784
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,320
Let's go, Ae Ra.

785
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:26,070
Na Ae Ra...if it's anything related to CEO...

786
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,610
She's very active.

787
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,600
It will take some time to restore this place, right?

788
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,740
I can't live because of you, Oppa.

789
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,110
I thought everything was calm for a while. You can't go a day without causing trouble!

790
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:56,060
Why are you doing this to someone who came to help?

791
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,100
Oppa put the fire out!

792
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,090
I'm so thankful that you caused the fire and put it out!

793
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,150
What will you do with the house like this?

794
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,030
You can't stay here for the time being either.

795
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,370
I guess we should go to a sauna.

796
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:14,230
Should I go together as well?

797
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,740
Well.. It's shabby, but

798
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,230
there's a place you can stay.

799
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,700
Can you get here by yourself?

800
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,160
If you can't, call me. I'll go out to get you.

801
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,420
Am I a kid? I'll meet the home owner and go, so stop worrying.

802
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,870
Okay.

803
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,020
If they start talking about the repair costs,

804
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,920
we have to pay for it.

805
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,570
Okay. See you later.

806
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,330
Na Ae Ra,

807
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,660
do you still have her in your heart?

808
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,060
I knew it all along,

809
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,500
that Na Ae Ra is

810
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,380
your ex-wife.

811
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,350
Coincidentally,

812
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,070
I heard you two talk.

813
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,750
It was shocking at first

814
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,060
and I felt betrayed ...

815
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,540
I am sorry.

816
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,650
I should have told you.
-No.

817
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,640
At the thought that you were intentionally hiding it from me,

818
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,070
rather...

819
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:08,110
I liked it.

820
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,980
If you didn't do that, and told me comfortably,

821
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,090
I think...

822
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,070
I might have been in more despair.

823
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,290
Because you don't see me as a woman.

824
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,680
I think I pretended not to know about your feelings

825
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,700
even though I knew about it.

826
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,320
But I...
-Please don't say it.

827
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,860
As for today, I will just say what I'm going to say.

828
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,210
It won't be too late...

829
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:50,290
for you to say your words after you give me a chance.

830
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,300
I...

831
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,380
feel unfair.

832
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,230
I didn't really have

833
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,520
a chance.

834
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,550
A chance for me to

835
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,220
approach you as a woman.

836
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,470
I ...

837
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,540
I wish I wasn't the only one with feelings.

838
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,750
Yeo Jin...
