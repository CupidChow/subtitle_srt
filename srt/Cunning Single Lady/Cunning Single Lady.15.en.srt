1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,800
Please stand up, Chairman.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,170
Can't you overlook just one more time for this person who can offer nothing but money?

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,100
Please overlook it just one more time!

4
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,300
I haven't changed my mind.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,800
Even if you'd lose everything?

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,500
Even then?

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,900
Yes.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,700
Episode 15

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Yo Han!

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,400
Secretary Gil, I don't feel like eating dinner tonight
so just eat by yourself.

12
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
If you came, wash up and have a seat.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,200
I don't have any appetite.

14
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,500
Secretary Gil left. Come sit down.

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Ae Ra.

16
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,900
You have such big hands. (excessive portion size)

17
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,670
I know. My hands wanted to overdo it today,

18
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,900
so stop nagging.

19
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,600
Sure.

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,600
I said to go wash.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sure, I'll wash up.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,300
Forget it. Just sit down and eat.

23
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,900
Forget it if you don't want to eat.

24
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,000
Sheesh...eat up. Eat with some vigor.

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,500
Sure.

26
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,380
Earlier at the research office,

27
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,100
I was thinking too deeply like this.

28
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,400
Did it get red? Why does it get red?

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,000
You should be more careful!

30
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,100
Here.

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Ae Ra,

32
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,400
your portions today are..

33
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,100
Take it.

34
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,100
I was thinking about a little alcohol to go with my food...
I'm stunned.

35
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,400
Here.
-I'm fine.

36
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
What fun is it to drink by myself? Here.

37
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,300
Since this is the last time, so just one drink ...

38
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,900
Today, as the first and last glass, just one glass.

39
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,300
Cheers.

40
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,700
But think about it!

41
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,540
One day that friend was riding a new bicycle, so I asked "Hey, where did you get that?"

42
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,200
On the way he ran into a woman riding a bicycle
but she suddenly threw the bicycle aside,

43
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,400
and she took all her clothes off and said,
"Take everything that you want!"

44
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,700
But most

45
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,900
normal guys, their answer is obvious.

46
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,800
But he chose the bike.

47
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
But his friend is funnier.

48
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,200
"Hey, those clothes wouldn't have fit you.
You did well, you did well. A bike. "

49
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Really?
-That's right.

50
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,480
Among the friends in Engineering, this kind of humor was really serious.

51
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,400
You, too?

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Well...since I was an Engineering student, too.

53
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,400
But now I would definitely choose the naked woman.

54
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,900
No...

55
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,600
I'm not ... saying I want that ...

56
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,900
Here.

57
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Ae Ra.

58
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
What?

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
Thank you.

60
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,100
It's nice talking about stories from my engineering school days.

61
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,700
Forget it.

62
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,500
It's fan service. Think of it as your pay day.

63
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,300
Where's the emergency medical kit?

64
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,200
In the bedroom dresser drawer. Why?

65
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,700
Hey, come here.

66
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,500
It's alright. It will be fine if you leave it alone.

67
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,400
I don't want to.

68
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,300
There you go.

69
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,100
Hey...hey you!

70
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,400
What happened?

71
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,950
Why am I here?

72
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,360
Exactly. You said that you were leaving so what are you doing here?!

73
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,100
Me?

74
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
Where?

75
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,500
This is my room.

76
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,900
What is this? What happened?

77
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't you remember getting drunk and carrying on that you were leaving?

78
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,100
I offered to drive you, but you said that I should just sleep.
And you forcefully laid me on the bed and ...

79
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Oh my head.

80
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,300
I, too,

81
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,500
was drunk so my memory is dim.

82
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,500
You...you....

83
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,100
Hey, hey! I've always slept without any clothes on.
You know that!

84
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,500
As if you didn't know.

85
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,200
Then what about my clothes?
Did you take off my clothes?

86
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
I wanted to take it off, too! But...

87
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,080
you took it off.

88
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,740
What? Don't lie!
Tell me the truth.

89
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,370
What on earth did you do?

90
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,500
I have a dim memory, too!

91
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,070
You don't remember anything either? Not even a little?

92
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,400
You really don't have anything you remember?

93
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,350
You ... vomited ...

94
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,350
... the bag... and 2 even...

95
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,490
It was so hard for me to wash those bags...

96
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,260
Ae Ra, are you okay?

97
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,350
Should I take a look?

98
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,280
Don't touch me.

99
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,210
Don't move. Stay still.

100
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,720
Don't come near me. Don't come.

101
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,330
I told you not to move.

102
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,360
You may get hurt like that.

103
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,730
Wait, wait, wait. What are you going to do?

104
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,360
No, you ...
-Seriously, you ...

105
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,220
Look!

106
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,800
I told you not to move because you might fall ...

107
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,300
What on earth were you imagining?

108
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Come, come.
- Hey!

109
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,560
Oh...

110
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,430
But does this mean CEO and Na Ae Ra...

111
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,000
can get together again?

112
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,740
So what is this? Na Ae Ra ...

113
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,040
is my boss' wife?

114
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,470
Hey, you.

115
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,200
I mean, Manager.

116
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,200
I haven't been sleeping since that day!

117
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,180
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

118
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,650
That is what I want to ask.

119
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,150
You, the new employee... no... Ae Ra's brother...

120
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,870
This, this mouth ...
you haven't run your mouth off recklessly, right?

121
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,810
Of course.

122
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,720
If people find out that Ae Ra and CEO Cha
were a married couple,

123
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,730
how awkward will our Ae Ra's situation be?

124
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,760
That's why ... I'm asking you to specially keep it secure.

125
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes.

126
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,310
But it's like that for me, but why would you... ?

127
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,900
I'm in CEO Cha's line ... big shot, big shot.

128
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,200
I have a duty to protect the CEO.

129
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,680
What do you mean a married couple?

130
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm in charge of the lunch menu, how does bibimbap sound?

131
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,910
I've lost my appetite right now...

132
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,500
Right, Manager Kang?

133
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Ah, yes.

134
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,000
Did something happen between you two?

135
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,200
How could you not report such an important truth?

136
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,600
Ah, that's...I found out recently.

137
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,640
Seniors, please do me a favor,

138
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,460
about today's matter... shhhhh...

139
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,600
If you don't, I die!

140
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,200
Let's agree to keep this incident between us, for now.

141
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,300
Be especially careful of Pi Song Hee.
She's a loudspeaker that's alive.

142
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,500
How can I not remember a thing?

143
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
You're crazy, Na Ae Ra.

144
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,600
I must break up. Because I love him, I should send him off.

145
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,500
It hurts.

146
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,590
Hold on, hold on.

147
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,830
I'm sure I had my clothes on...

148
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,400
So it may not have been...

149
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,400
or not, I could have put them on again...

150
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Then ...

151
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,540
I don't know. I don't know.

152
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Good night, Ae Ra. Dream of me.

153
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,100
Did I wake you?

154
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
No, where are you?

155
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,500
I'm working, of course.

156
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,600
But it's nice hearing your voice.

157
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
You're working hard till the late hours.

158
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
But hey...

159
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,540
Do you have time tomorrow?

160
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,200
We're off tomorrow, so let's go somewhere.

161
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Okay!

162
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,400
I have time. What time do you want to go?

163
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,100
I can't!

164
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
Why?

165
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,900
Let's see each other the day after.

166
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,510
Day after tomorrow, that time is ...

167
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,620
I have it. Of course, I have it. A lot!

168
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,210
I have a lot! I'll go pick you up.

169
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,300
No, don't come. Let's hang up for now.

170
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,220
How are you going to leave when you're like this?

171
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,400
Na Ae Ra! You can never leave my side!

172
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,100
What do I do? What do I do? I can't do it.

173
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,000
Hey, fool. Do you think that's what Jeong Woo wants?

174
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,400
Dang. Why don't you know your feelings!

175
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm doing it because I know my feelings.

176
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,600
If he's with me, things will get harder for him.

177
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,300
This is all I can do for him.

178
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,400
What am I suppose to do? I can't do it.

179
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Then do it without meeting him.

180
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,500
If you see him, it'll be harder.

181
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,900
I have to go on a last date,

182
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
so I can live by holding onto the memories.

183
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,150
At least memories ...

184
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,100
Ouch! It's hot!

185
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,000
What was that?

186
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
You're okay, right?

187
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes.

188
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,440
Resignation Letter
Na Ae Ra

189
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,930
You're Na Ae Ra, right?

190
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,900
Yes? Yes.

191
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,500
I have a package for you.

192
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,640
I'm sorry, Ae Ra.

193
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,590
I love you!

194
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,230
That's a man's voice!

195
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,730
N ...o, it's not.

196
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,440
What do you mean no? I clearly heard it.

197
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,070
Give it to me.

198
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,330
No, no, no!
-No!

199
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,620
No, no, no!

200
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,560
You can't.

201
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,370
So ..ng ..Hee, I'm sure you separately have one.

202
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,370
Exactly. Let's respect her privacy.

203
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,400
When did she hook up with a boyfriend?

204
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,900
She should just work hard instead!

205
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,050
I'm sorry, Ae Ra.

206
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,760
I love you!

207
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,170
I'm sorry, Ae Ra.
I love you!

208
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,100
Please give this back to Jeong Woo.

209
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,850
Hey there......

210
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,460
I'm sorry, Ae Ra.

211
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,200
I love you!

212
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,700
Na Ae Ra?!

213
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,100
Ex-wife?!

214
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Anyhow, please!

215
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,000
Please, I'm going to die!

216
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,650
CEO's ex-wife is Intern Na Ae Ra ?!

217
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,440
Oh my!
Since her (ex)husband is doing well,

218
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,650
she came back looking for him!

219
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,800
She's really shameless.

220
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,900
Isn't CEO dating Director Guk?

221
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,400
She came to split them up.
She doesn't even have a conscience!

222
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,430
What a jackpot!
How cunning?!

223
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,910
This is a serious jackpot.

224
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes, this is D&T customer support,

225
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,570
Na Soon Chul.

226
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,820
Yes.

227
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,720
What is this?

228
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,700
Is there anything interesting?

229
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,900
An Important News!!
CEO, Cha Jeong Woo's ex-wife is our company's intern!!

230
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,200
CEO Cha's ex-wife joined the company
aiming only for his money.

231
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,310
Extorting a large sum for alimony!

232
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:38,200
CEO Cha who was sacrificing himself for his ex-wife,
loses favor with the investors!

233
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,990
Did you hear the news?!

234
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,200
It's very chaotic right now!
Na Ae Ra...

235
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,300
Do you possibly already know?

236
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,430
No way!

237
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,800
Na Ae Ra is CEO's ex-wife?!

238
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,600
That's really surprising!
-Ha,ha, ha!

239
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,700
After I found out,
I was really surprised as well!

240
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
You really didn't know?

241
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,100
If we knew,
we would've let you...

242
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,600
We would've told you already!

243
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,100
Anyhow, Na Ae Ra sure is quite cunning!

244
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,000
How can she crawl back to
her ex-husband's company?

245
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Since she knows CEO is dating Director Guk,
is she trying to break them up?

246
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,700
I wonder if Na Ae Ra is the reason why there are stories about the company's crisis floating around?

247
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,400
A single loach is seriously clouding up the water!

248
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,300
You're all misinformed!

249
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I was hoping that no one would naively believe the rumors

250
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,700
that are floating around, at face value.

251
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,300
That's the reason why I didn't come forward,
but I was wrong.

252
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,200
I will clarify the parts that aren't the truth.

253
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,900
Na Ae Ra...

254
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,100
is my ex-wife.

255
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,600
However, the rumor that because of Na Ae Ra the company's crisis getting worse is an exaggerated lie.

256
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,600
In fact, the person who presented the idea of Dontalk's free messaging service was Na Ae Ra.

257
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,500
And recently, the special function we developed through the public competition was also...

258
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,600
an idea from Na Ae Ra.

259
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,300
Aside from all those...

260
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,700
all of your thoughts that the company is facing a crisis
because of an intern

261
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,200
are wrong.

262
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,900
If the company is faced with a crisis,
then it's my responsibility as the CEO.

263
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,400
It's not Na Ae Ra
or any one of the employee's responsibility!

264
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,900
For causing an issue at the company
because of my personal rumors ...

265
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,300
I apologize.

266
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,200
I also will try my best to
resolve the uncertainty of the company.

267
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Therefore, please don't get wrapped up in rumors...

268
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
anymore.

269
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Is this because of the rumor?

270
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,600
If you're leaving the company because of it,
then there won't be anyone left here.

271
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,100
That's not it.

272
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,500
I made the decision to leave the company before that.

273
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Is this indisputable?

274
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,100
I apologize. You've treated me well.

275
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,000
You don't have to be sorry towards me.

276
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,800
Since it's your choice,
you just need to be responsible for yourself.

277
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,100
For you to take on your own responsibility,
you have to stand firm by yourself!

278
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,200
Especially, for us women that live alone.

279
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Na Ae Ra,
you were the best intern that I've ever had!

280
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Call me anytime,
if you need my letter of recommendation.

281
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,300
It should be quite helpful.

282
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,900
Thank you for your hard work.

283
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,500
This is too shabby for a farewell party!

284
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,200
It's okay, alcohol is ...

285
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,300
Instead, I'll chase away my hangover
with udon and say good bye.

286
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't do that...
and just have one shot?

287
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,300
It's no fun drinking by myself.

288
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,200
It's no fun drinking by myself.

289
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
Don't talk like that!

290
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,000
Here...

291
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,500
Is that good?

292
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,400
Did you accept the job at the hotel?

293
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,700
No.

294
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,300
I don't think I got the job strictly based on my ability.

295
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,000
I only recommended you.

296
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,700
You won't work at the hotel and you left the company.

297
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,400
What are you thinking of doing?

298
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,500
Nothing, I'm not thinking about anything.

299
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,800
You have a worry that you can't talk about again, right?

300
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,600
That's the reason why you're leaving the company.

301
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,000
The rumors may be a bit unsettling for you, but...

302
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,600
you're not the type
that would abandon the company because of it.

303
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,300
I just want some rest,
without any commitments.

304
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,590
Is it because of Jeong Woo Hyung?

305
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Seung Hyeon,

306
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,400
I was going to talk to you about that anyways.
I'll do it now.

307
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I... am thankful for your feelings,

308
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,400
but actually, I feel burdened by it.

309
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,700
I wish you'd stop caring about me from now on.

310
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,100
I'm sorry.

311
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,900
Tell me why you're quitting work because of Jeong Woo.

312
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
Jeong Woo...

313
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,800
has had a hard time because of me.

314
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,800
I...

315
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,100
don't care about rumors of being an evil wife.

316
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,900
However,

317
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,700
Jeong Woo losing the company because of me, that can't happen.

318
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,600
That... I can't watch that happen.

319
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,600
In the end, Director Guk's words were right.

320
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,800
That ultimately I'll ruin Jeong Woo.

321
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,800
I regret it. I should have listened to those words.

322
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,900
But...

323
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,730
since Director Guk is by Jeong Woo's side,

324
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,400
it's a relief, isn't it?

325
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,760
Ae Ra, really...

326
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,100
♫ I truly love you deep within my heart. ♫

327
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,890
How are you going to endure it?

328
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,030
When you love him that much?

329
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,220
When you want to see him, how are you going to hold it in?

330
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,860
With all my dying strength.

331
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,070
It's difficult.

332
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,420
Sending someone away because you love them.

333
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,660
Is this good enough?

334
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,570
You'll give it away, look at me.

335
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,460
Na Ae Ra.

336
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,200
It's a shame to just go home.

337
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,300
Do you want to go see a movie?

338
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,920
Sh...should we?

339
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,580
Ae Ra, let's talk.

340
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,070
Could you step aside?

341
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,190
I have something to discuss with this woman.

342
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,010
Now is not a good time.

343
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,770
Let's talk later.

344
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,290
Seung Hyeon, let's go.

345
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,710
Our eyes just met again.

346
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,690
Since you keep looking at me, I can't look at you!

347
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,890
I had better go.

348
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,800
You keep looking at me so this won't do.

349
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,470
You're drunk, I'll take you home.

350
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,560
It's fine, I'm okay. I'm not drunk at all. I can go.

351
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,230
It's not that direction!

352
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,410
I'm really going. I'm going.

353
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,950
Ae Ra!

354
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,880
Hey!

355
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,680
Ow, it's hot!

356
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,070
Are you all right?
-Why are these candles so big?

357
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,100
Min Yeong,

358
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,990
you better not play with fire at home.

359
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,940
I...

360
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,070
had dinner...

361
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,910
with Jeong Woo today.

362
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,780
And we drank together, too.

363
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,420
It was good to watch him eat well.

364
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,800
But...

365
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,710
but I think it's going to become the last time.

366
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,620
Jeong Woo...

367
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,430
if I'm beside him,

368
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,420
I heard that he's going to lose the company.

369
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,770
But that fool said he's choosing me!

370
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,720
That Guk Yeo Jin's father...

371
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,220
to Jeong Woo, he...

372
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,820
So...

373
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,440
I'm going to let him go.

374
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,540
It might hurt him again,

375
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,350
but I've done it once, when we got divorced.

376
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,580
To send away Jeong Woo who couldn't leave me,

377
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,450
telling him to get lost from my life.

378
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,550
It can't be helped,

379
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,350
this time either.

380
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,100
I...

381
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,340
because I love Jeong Woo so much.

382
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,090
I tried hard not to love him,

383
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,720
but it doesn't work.

384
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,730
That doesn't work, Min Yeong.

385
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,840
How are you going to send him away?

386
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,720
I'll tell him on a farewell trip.

387
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,190
If you're going to send him away, why the trip?

388
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,290
So I can live holding onto the memories, why?

389
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,020
I'll go...

390
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,320
and tell him at the end.

391
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,310
That I...

392
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,490
don't like a poor Cha Jeong Woo.

393
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,240
Because he is a successful company's CEO,

394
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,700
I mistook him for a chaebol [wealthy conglomerate owner].

395
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,100
Then...

396
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,550
he'll leave with his heart torn out, won't he?

397
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,110
What am I going to do with you?
♫ I don't know. ♫

398
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,640
Hey! Hey!

399
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,870
What are you doing?

400
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,100
You said you wanted to go away.

401
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,990
You made plans to go away with me.

402
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,510
When did I?

403
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,250
Let's meet the day after tomorrow.

404
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,060
The day after tomorrow...
-I have it!

405
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,230
Of course, I have it!

406
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,690
A lot. I have a lot.

407
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,740
I'll go pick you up.

408
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,400
If a person makes a promise, they should keep it.

409
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,040
At this hour?

410
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,260
I have time tomorrow. Then I'll see you tomorrow.

411
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,470
You should go home now.

412
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,470
Okay. I have something to say, too.

413
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,100
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

414
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,580
I said to just go home now. I'll take you there.

415
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,760
Let's go, I'll take you.

416
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,680
Why are you here alone like this?

417
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,180
What about Ahjussi?

418
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,710
I told him to go home.

419
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,160
The person who pours his own drink gets a pretty wife and

420
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,720
they say that the person next to him will live alone for 3 years.

421
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,490
Since Father, you got a beauty like Mom you're set, but

422
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,060
you should think about me, too.

423
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,000
You're right.

424
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,160
My wife is

425
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,370
a bit pretty, huh?

426
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,250
That's why it must have taken this long

427
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,150
to let her go.

428
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,550
Call your mother.

429
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,450
Tell her I'll stamp the divorce papers.

430
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,130
Father!?

431
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,770
Why are you so shocked?

432
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,550
You, too, if you don't want to live alone

433
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,120
pour me another shot.

434
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,370
Look over there.
- Yay!

435
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:49,360
Please come taste it. It's a new product that you should always keep next to you for your health.

436
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,960
Two cups please.

437
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,850
It's vegetables that are good for the body.

438
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,900
Even vegetables seem to know how we feel.

439
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,320
My Min Yeong that I want to keep next to me always.

440
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,150
Really!

441
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,180
Give me one more glass please.

442
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,150
Ai ... relax your expression a bit!

443
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,930
It's nice and refreshing having come out in such a long time.

444
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,230
We should have done this earlier.

445
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,410
I don't know why we always met secretly on the rooftop.

446
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,560
Right?

447
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,980
But it was fun having those secret dates.

448
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,700
There are a lot of memories in many areas of the company, too.

449
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,270
We won't be able to do that anymore, right?

450
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,500
Of course.

451
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,250
There's no reason for me to go to work starting Monday.

452
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,240
Ah, that darn company!

453
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,570
I feel relieved that I've quit!

454
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,090
Then to commemorate you quitting the company,
should I take some days off?

455
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,070
So we can travel together.

456
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,330
What travel?

457
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,400
Stop your interest in me and take interest in the company.

458
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,720
And...

459
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,700
I had something to say to you today...

460
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,220
♫ Inside the elevator,  ♫

461
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,990
♫ We shared our love, ♫
♫ We shared our love, even while you didn't know, ♫

462
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,750
The elevator.
♫ Yahoo, the secretive,  ♫

463
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,440
Next year I think I'll have to remodel that clear elevator.
♫love inside the elevator,  ♫

464
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,810
It really doesn't appeal to me. There aren't only one or two things that are uncomfortable about it.

465
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,720
I have to completely enclose that thing.

466
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,170
What's the point of enclosing the walls when there are CCTVs installed in all the elevators.

467
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,750
If you get caught doing something "else,"
you're going to be completely embarrassed.

468
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,930
How can you sleep here?

469
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,040
Are you really asleep?

470
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,070
I'm asleep.

471
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,570
I want to sleep like this, on your lap, every day.

472
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,270
I feel like I'm floating on the clouds.

473
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,590
Shall we go ride on an excursion boat?

474
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,400
I've been thinking a lot and...

475
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,870
Really?

476
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,990
You want to ride an excursion boat, too, don't you?!

477
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:34,270
Hey, as expected we have this communicative flow between us.

478
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,830
Let's go. Let's go.

479
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,310
Jeong Woo,

480
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,660
I...

481
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,380
Let's start over.

482
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,100
From the beginning.

483
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,780
Na Ae Ra,

484
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,710
marry me again.

485
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,110
I don't want to.

486
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,020
I don't have any thoughts about doing that with you.

487
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,210
Ae Ra
- Yes,

488
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,480
I will admit that I wavered for a bit.

489
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,960
But that was because you were successful.

490
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,830
I heard that you were the CEO of a successful company, I thought you were a "chaebol."

491
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:13,850
I was deceived by your appearance, not knowing you could be penniless at any moment like this.

492
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,180
Ae Ra,

493
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,220
stop it.

494
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,050
Yes, let's stop.

495
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:23,600
I don't want to be struggling again.

496
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,600
I thought a lot about it before coming to this conclusion, so let's not talk about it anymore.

497
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,230
I know that you're not being sincere.

498
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,720
I know that you're doing this for me, but...

499
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,780
you don't have to worry that much.

500
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,480
Ae Ra, actually I...

501
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,360
How I knew what you were thinking was...

502
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,920
Stop.

503
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,050
I don't want to hear it.

504
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,040
Father.

505
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,970
How is the balancing?

506
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,820
Yes, we are in the middle of matching it up, but...

507
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,650
CEO.

508
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,410
During the QA (Quality Assurance checks) there were a few bugs discovered,

509
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,900
but for me, it's a little...

510
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,700
Turn it over to me,

511
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,370
I'll debug it as quickly as possible and turn it over.

512
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,610
How can you be here like this?

513
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,140
Let's go quickly.

514
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,260
I told you I don't have time to waste on useless things.

515
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,370
Why is that useless?

516
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,030
As Chairman Guk's investment withdrawal became known,

517
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,330
everyone is very uneasy right now.

518
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,540
Don't be like this, let's go and...

519
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,810
It would be good for you to go.

520
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,420
Director Guk...

521
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,100
How is your health?

522
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,810
It's fine.

523
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:02,680
Even if you're busy, it will be good to come with us.

524
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,060
The meeting won't be long.

525
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,370
You just need to give the investors what they want.

526
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,030
I am sorry. I'm a little late.

527
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,450
What's the reason Chairman Guk's investment was withdrawn?

528
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,860
Doesn't it mean that there are problems in the company?

529
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,880
It is true that Chairman Guk called for his investment back.

530
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,280
But it has nothing to do with the company problems.

531
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,630
I am asking you to tell us the exact reason.

532
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,830
That reason is...
-I am Guk Yeo Jin.

533
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:15,050
I will speak on my father's behalf.

534
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,150
Director Guk.
-Chairman Guk

535
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,630
lost his confidence at CEO Cha's incompetence for not being able to get

536
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,000
secure earnings for his return on investment,

537
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,030
and he's reclaimed his investment.

538
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:32,020
And I'd like to hold him accountable in this place

539
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,690
and I authorize the dismissal of CEO Cha.

540
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,100
Director Guk.

541
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:50,780
Even then, don't we need CEO Cha for the game that is going to be released soon?

542
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,970
Is there a problem with the game release?

543
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,570
There isn't a problem yet.

544
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,720
But we've just started the beta testing...

545
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,960
Then it means we don't need you, CEO Cha.

546
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,970
If CEO Cha's dismissal is passed,

547
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:19,490
I can promise the return of Chairman Guk's investment.

548
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,180
Director Guk.

549
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,220
In the past 3 years as a founding partner,

550
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,200
while aiding CEO Cha,

551
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,080
I was the one who took responsibility for the company funds

552
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,300
in place of CEO Cha who always chose value over the profits.

553
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,960
But having experienced this most recent circumstance, he has crossed the arbitrary line of

554
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,600
only choosing his value over the company.

555
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,150
My conclusion is that he doesn't have the right as an owner.

556
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,440
We should decide.

557
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,520
I will ... leave.

558
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,080
I think there is a point to what Director Guk said about a CEO lacking the rights,

559
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:22,070
if that CEO can't guarantee the profits for investors.

560
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,040
I...

561
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,560
will resign from the CEO position.

562
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,530
Why did she have to quit that good place... ?

563
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,630
Last time I saw Son-in-law Cha, he was completely leaning towards Ae Ra.

564
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,410
Don't give Ae Ra your hopes.

565
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,180
She said she doesn't want to.

566
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,250
Look here, Mrs. Na.

567
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:05,430
If your daughter can't make the right decision, it's the parents' job to direct her to the right path.

568
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,890
Big news!

569
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:10,530
Big news. Big new..s.

570
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,350
Oppa, you finished early today.

571
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,030
Oh. Yeah.

572
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,980
Did you come?

573
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,780
What is the big news?

574
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,970
What?

575
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,980
By any chance, did you get fired already?

576
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,730
No, I didn't!

577
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,410
If I quit, I'll quit, but do you see me as a person who'll get fired?

578
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,770
Did you quit?

579
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,220
It isn't me who quit.

580
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,970
It is Brother-in-law Cha.

581
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,630
Son-in-law Cha?

582
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:42,990
He announced today that he would resign from the CEO position.

583
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,770
What do you mean?

584
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:48,360
Son-in-law Cha is the owner of the company, but what does it mean that he is going to resign?

585
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,960
I don't know the exact details,

586
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,690
but since the management of the company is difficult, the investors kept pushing him with words, so

587
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,410
he said, "I will take the responsibility

588
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,380
and leave."

589
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,270
Yes.

590
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,020
I am Secretary Gil.

591
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,400
By any chance, do you know where Hyung is?

592
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,350
Excuse me? Where he is?

593
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:30,660
He resigned his position and disappeared.

594
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,530
Where are you? Pick up the phone.

595
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,680
You look really great! (sarcasm)
