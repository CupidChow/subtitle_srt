1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,030
Aish! I shouldn't have bothered her like that.

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,310
Episode 10

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,370
I told you to listen well.

4
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,550
Stop pretending like you don't understand.

5
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,710
Na Ae Ra,

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,430
what makes you angry, what makes you cry,

7
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,140
what you like... I want share those moments with you.
I want to do that.

8
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,860
Let go of me.

9
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,660
I told you to listen well.
Stop pretending like you don't understand.

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,550
Na Ae Ra, what makes you angry,

11
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,940
what makes you cry, what you like...

12
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,130
I want to share those moments with you. I want to.

13
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,840
CEO! By chance, have you seen the CEO?

14
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,240
Oh, he's not in the room?

15
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,600
There's a big problem! They say that the server went down.

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,340
Huh?

17
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,700
CEO!

18
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,900
CEO, where are you?

19
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,740
What do we do about this? If CEO isn't here recovery will be difficult.

20
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,890
They say that the development team is going crazy right now.

21
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,350
Is he not answering?

22
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,970
Yes.

23
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,680
The CEO's car isn't here.

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,290
Do you think he got the report and headed up first?

25
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,920
No, they said that I was the first person they reported it to.

26
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,950
CEO!

27
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,730
CEO!

28
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
Cha Jeong Woo!

29
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,580
Where has he gone?

30
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,490
No way, he wouldn't...

31
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,410
When did you do all this?

32
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,070
A little at a time. Since this is my dream.

33
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,110
What are you doing here?

34
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,730
They say that there's a big commotion at the company. Let's go.

35
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Let's go. Let's go, right now.

36
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,520
Ae Ra,

37
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,970
who are you worrying about?

38
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,770
The CEO of the company?

39
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,070
Or Cha Jeong Woo?

40
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,250
Who are you worrying for?

41
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,370
The CEO of the company.

42
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,820
What's most precious to you right now is the company.

43
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
There's a problem at that company right now.

44
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,150
Why are you here like this?
Everyone 's waiting for you!

45
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,220
I know!

46
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,080
What in the world was I hoping for?

47
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,990
Why are you acting like this?

48
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,440
Na Ae Ra, you have a natural talent for saying cruel things.
Now and back then, too.

49
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,310
Then what kind of answer were you hoping for?

50
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,220
Neither. Cha Jeong Woo nor the CEO.

51
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,830
Since it's not something for you to worry about.

52
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,470
Since I don't need it.

53
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,340
Cha Jeong Woo, even when saying mean things,
there's a thing called manners.

54
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,830
I know. It's only that I don't want to follow those proper manners at this time.

55
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,080
I don't know why you thought I'd be here and came,

56
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,600
but in the future I'd like it if you didn't come.

57
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,460
DONTALK

58
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,080
Oh, Ae Ra, I'll do it. I will. I will.

59
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,710
Oh, I can't live. I can't live.
Why is he making it so obvious?

60
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,600
Hoobaenim, how can you just disappear when there's a big commotion at work?

61
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,860
With only a single text.

62
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,970
Na Ae Ra, aren't you playing independently too much?
It's a relief that the server was recovered fast.

63
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,290
Last night was crazy!
The CEO disappeared too!

64
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,980
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

65
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,220
I had a severe stomachache.

66
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,760
Here. You're tired. Eat while you work.

67
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,060
Guk...Guk Seung Hyeon.

68
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,790
Let's talk.

69
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
Here.

70
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,290
Are you buying these for us, Guk Seung Hyeon?

71
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,050
I'll eat it well.
-"Very, very" thank you!

72
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,860
Ae Ra, you learn these kind of things, too.

73
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,920
It's nothing much. Since it's to commemorate my first paycheck eat it deliciously.

74
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,660
Shall we go?

75
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,910
Did you want to eat it, just the two of us together?

76
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,940
Then it's too obvious.

77
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,010
Be quiet.

78
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,730
The doors are closing.

79
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,940
Fine.

80
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,260
Honestly, I can't say that I never expected this.

81
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,120
I had some popularity among men even back
in elementary school.

82
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,430
'If you were just taller you could go out for Miss Korea,'

83
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,660
I heard that all the time from people, too.

84
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,850
'God is fair so he gave you beauty but not brains,'

85
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,700
I even heard that kind of talk, too.

86
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,930
But still, I feel a bit perplexed.

87
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,480
That I'm a woman that appeals to a man
so much younger than me...

88
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,140
There's a piece to this that I really never expected.

89
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,730
Still, I should say what I need to say, right?

90
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,850
I, unfortunately,

91
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,380
can't accept your heart.

92
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,290
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,290
Ok.

94
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,830
So, so...sending these around and showing your generosity,

95
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,810
I hope that you'd refrain from it.

96
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,730
I didn't just give this to you, Ae Ra.

97
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:06,340
That's why. It shows that since it was awkward
for you to just give it to me, you gave it to

98
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,080
EVERYONE.

99
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,850
It shows?

100
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,200
Of course, it shows.

101
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Since you overdo it like this, I feel burdened.

102
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,580
You don't need to feel burdened.

103
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,200
Can't you just leave it be?

104
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,240
Whether you accept me or not is your mind, but whether I like someone or not is mine.

105
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,040
I... on the outside may look all right,

106
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,950
but I'm a person with a painful past.

107
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,810
Living until now, I've had a lot of scars.

108
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,040
Truthfully,

109
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,190
I don't have the margin to like anyone.

110
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,970
You don't have to speak that far, since I sufficiently understood that you were rejecting me.

111
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,410
I'm sorry, if your pride was hurt.

112
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,480
Oh, there's nothing for you to be sorry about.

113
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,940
Well, this time let's say that I was rejected,

114
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,180
since I'm going to do it again next time.

115
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,560
At that time, you'll accept ... my confession.

116
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,330
For now eat.

117
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,040
Why are you like that?

118
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,440
It's nothing.

119
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,070
What about you?

120
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,310
Me?

121
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,500
It's nothing.

122
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,430
Aiyoo.

123
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,760
Why?!

124
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,990
I...

125
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,940
was dumped.

126
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,430
What?

127
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,450
It's probably for the best.

128
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,810
You should be relieved that you broke up at this point.

129
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,260
Dating a materialistic woman,

130
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,230
will only make you suffer.

131
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,240
Hyung, are you adding salt to my

132
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,370
broken heart?

133
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,690
No, it's not that...

134
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,150
I'm going to go out of my mind.

135
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,640
Don't look for me!

136
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,540
Hey...

137
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,770
Hey punk! Don't drink too much alcohol!

138
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,490
That punk...

139
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,650
Aiyoo, really.

140
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,500
Hey punk, forget her!

141
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,870
Half the world is women.

142
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,120
I tipped our waiter well so he'll know.

143
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,340
You're going to drink from the river of goddesses very shortly.

144
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,530
That's right. We'll take good care of it
so that our brother could make a new girlfriend.

145
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:25,580
Hey, but I...don't think that I'll be able to forget her.

146
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,530
How can love change?

147
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,160
I treated her so well!

148
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,580
Aiyoo, our Hyungnims waited a long time, didn't you?

149
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,020
The goddesses in order. Go in on both sides.

150
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,610
This way.

151
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,390
Unnies, you should know that it's an honor to be here tonight.

152
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,450
Over there, you see that gentleman over there?

153
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,400
That person's background is pretty amazing.

154
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,310
He's that Dontalk's CEO.

155
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,790
Oh, really?

156
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,640
Today, I don't want to talk about those things.

157
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,880
For the women to feel burdened.

158
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,900
I'm not burdened.

159
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,160
CEO Cha was my younger brother's tutor.

160
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,350
Through my brother, I learned that his business was struggling.

161
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,480
So that's his relationship with Guk Seung Hyeon.

162
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,760
Excuse me?

163
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,740
Huh? It's nothing.

164
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,450
So you two have known each other for a very long time.

165
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,440
When I see such an amazing man with an amazing woman as partners for a while,

166
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,520
I think it could turn into some other kind of relationship.

167
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,940
Is there any possibility of that?

168
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,520
I'm not sure. There's nothing that has no possibility.

169
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,020
Yes.

170
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,540
Oh my, what does that mean?!

171
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,080
I knew this would happen!
I cast one vote in that they are already dating.

172
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,170
How could a man and woman, without any feelings ...
Just as partners ...

173
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,540
It doesn't make sense.

174
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,290
Director Guk is such a strong opponent.

175
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,900
I think they fit well together.

176
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,730
Excuse me? The CEO?

177
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,020
Yes, I understand.

178
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,650
Everyone! The CEO is coming to our department.

179
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,050
Everyone, clean up your stations!

180
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,640
Director Kang! Get me an employee report from our last workshop.

181
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,230
Now, hm?

182
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,010
Hurry, hurry!

183
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,220
Please don't mind me and continue working.

184
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,550
I said please sit.

185
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,020
Thank you for your hard work, Team Leader Wang.

186
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,850
Ah, yes.

187
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,140
Ah, yes, our Team Leader Kang as well.

188
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,770
I'm Pi Song Hee. Pi.

189
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,800
Why did you come ... to our department?

190
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,620
Oh, well,

191
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,020
from an applauding stance.

192
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,430
♫ Mirror, mirror, who does that person like? ♫

193
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,080
♫ Heaven, heaven, who does that person think about? ♫

194
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,920
Thank you for taking care of us.

195
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,130
Na Ae Ra.

196
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,400
Yes?

197
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,530
The contract deal you mentioned at the workshop.

198
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,400
Yes?

199
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,150
Well, I don't think it's bad.

200
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,640
Okay. Please make a planning document
before you leave work today.

201
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,340
Excuse me? Today?

202
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,850
Yes.

203
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,650
I haven't even done the market research for that yet.

204
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,100
Then, at the workshop, were you just throwing out
ideas without any prior research?

205
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,030
At a meeting with the CEO present?

206
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,040
I was just talking comfortably because we were just throwing around ideas.

207
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,380
Miss Ae Ra... Yes!

208
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,130
Yes, we understand, CEO!

209
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,590
Then, please work hard.

210
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,670
Yes.

211
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,550
Not yet.
I don't know if I can finish this before today ends.

212
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,140
Yes.

213
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,730
Why is she on the phone instead of the work I gave her?

214
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,700
It's me.

215
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,620
Why?

216
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,500
Are you done?

217
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,970
You did this on purpose, right?

218
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,520
What?
- How can I do this proposal in half a day? Is there only one or two things to research?!

219
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,010
When there's a will, there's a way.

220
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,490
If you're desperate, work is something that you can finish in one hour, much less a half a day.

221
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,000
Do you know what today is?
You vicious CEO!

222
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,750
Today?

223
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,430
Wednesday.
- Let's not talk.

224
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,530
Whatever the case, until you finish it up, you can't go anywhere.

225
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:47,440
Because of you, I can't get off work.
Just know that you have to be sorry.
- Shut up. End of conversation.

226
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,980
Really. Even though we've divorced,
how can he not know what today is?

227
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,100
Na Ae Ra

228
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,050
Where are you going?!

229
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,400
Where do you think you're going? Hey!

230
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,590
Na Ae Ra, you can't go anywhere.

231
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,500
Did you just come after me about the proposal?

232
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,200
That's right.

233
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:13,350
I left a text! Saying that I'll hand it in before tomorrow morning's meeting.

234
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,830
Then you should have called if it was so important.

235
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,280
It's already midnight!

236
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,240
All right. If it's that important of a proposal. Then, I'll go home and stay up all night to get it done if I have to.

237
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,700
No way!
- What?

238
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,000
Why don't you have any sense of responsibility!
You should finish your work before going home.

239
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,300
Hello, CEO Cha.

240
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,470
Even at the hospital, you didn't show your face at all.

241
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,250
I'm your life's savior. If you couldn't nurse me,
couldn't you even make a phone call?

242
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,080
I did as much as I should. I'm not going to talk any further.

243
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,800
What are you talking about, 'you did as much as you should.'
If I think about the injury I received at that time...

244
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,590
This shoulder still pains me.

245
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,800
So what? What do you want?

246
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,880
Work over time.

247
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,790
Aren't you coming?!

248
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm sorry. I think I won't be able to see you today.

249
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,530
Let's just meet tomorrow. I must pay for dinner.

250
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,000
Work hard, hard.

251
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,760
Just make sure you're doing well.

252
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,980
Is an intern some neighborhood drum?
Why is everyone picking on me?

253
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,700
Isn't it common sense that overtime is required in an IT company?

254
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,400
Why? Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.

255
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,180
At this time?

256
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,370
With who?
-Why do you want to know?

257
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,130
A guy?

258
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,740
Well, not a girl.

259
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,850
You used to say, there's no workplace like this
and that you'll work diligently.

260
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:48,710
You were only dreaming of meeting a man!
This is why the CEO doesn't have the taste to work.

261
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,410
I didn't know that an employee's dating influenced the CEO's taste for doing work.

262
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,820
From now on, I'd better turn the lights on in my eyes and just date!

263
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,130
That guy is so pitiful.

264
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,280
Does he know that your temper is like this?
- He knows. He knows it all.

265
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,160
That's charm? He takes care of every little thing. I'm so happy I could die. Happy?

266
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,030
Do your work!
- I am doing it!

267
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:24,880
I'm going to the restroom.
So just work hard, just work. Here!

268
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,930
What kind of birthday is this?

269
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,580
This is a human right's violation.

270
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,340
Crappy CEO!

271
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,320
You should work at a company. What dating?

272
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,300
Eat if you want. Or not.

273
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,280
You're really considerate.

274
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:12,400
This is a nuisance. Because of a single term intern, the CEO can't go home right now!

275
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
I want to ask the ghosts what they're doing.

276
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,710
Not capturing a CEO like you.
- Even the ghosts recognize a qualified human being.

277
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,970
Cha generation's leader who'll lead IT Korea.

278
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,200
Cha ... Jeong ...

279
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,720
Woo.

280
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,490
Really.

281
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,880
Aish!

282
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,830
So he knew and bought these. What... ?

283
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,050
Happy Birthday, Ae Ra.

284
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,690
How did he know?

285
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,830
I told you to just work without thinking about other things, right?

286
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,120
What the... ? Suddenly.

287
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,200
Seung Hyeon!

288
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm sorry for yesterday. Did you wait long?

289
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,330
No. I went home right after your call.

290
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,220
That's a relief. I was working until dawn.

291
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,600
By any chance, do you have time this evening? I'll buy you dinner.

292
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,920
Call!

293
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,950
Director! Director! You're here?

294
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,820
You can just call me (to come over)
- It's nothing..

295
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,800
I stopped by while passing through.
- Oh yes. Right,

296
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,970
I sent you the product offering list for the luxury goods launching by email. Did you see it?

297
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,240
Is that so? I'll go up and check.

298
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,530
Yes
- About the present that you picked...

299
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:38,140
Yes.
- The person who received it, liked it. Thank you.

300
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,690
Yes.
- Present? What present? For who?

301
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,570
During the last outing I asked her to choose a gift.

302
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,740
It was a gift for a man, so I didn't have confidence about it and received a bit of help from the expert.

303
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,530
A present for a man...

304
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,300
By any chance, is it...

305
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,460
That rumor is true?

306
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,200
What kind of rumor?

307
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,740
It's not that... That is..

308
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:18,400
Big News! Big News! The CEO and Director Guk...

309
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,290
What about CEO Cha and I...

310
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,280
No. It's something I heard outside.

311
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,210
Rumors are spreading that the two of us are dating?

312
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,560
How did you... ?

313
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,300
Really?

314
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:40,610
What should I do?
- That means both of you are really...

315
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,150
Omo.. Omo... Congratulations!

316
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,240
Congratulations!

317
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,400
Does Director Guk know about our relationship?

318
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,140
Wait, why would I text him?
It's not like I have feelings left for him.

319
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,500
What the... ?

320
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,070
What?

321
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,970
Nothing.

322
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:06,780
I think you're the only person
who goes on a diet to save lunch time.

323
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,410
I heard you pulled an all-nighter again yesterday.

324
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,450
What are you doing?

325
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,350
I said it's nothing.

326
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,200
What did she send? It's making me so curious!

327
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,750
What is it?

328
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,770
What were you going to say to me?

329
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,470
Don't worry about it.

330
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,320
I sent it to the wrong person in my department.

331
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,100
Department person?

332
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,110
Who?

333
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,760
S...someone.

334
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,780
Why do you have to know that?

335
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,080
Who did you send it to?

336
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,150
Someone.

337
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,460
Who is it?

338
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,550
Someone!

339
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,640
Why are you so curious about
someone else's personal life?

340
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,980
You don't have to worry about it.

341
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,370
I'm in a bad mood now, so let's stop.

342
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,700
I'm going down.

343
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,870
Say what you were going to say before,

344
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,300
who did you send it to?

345
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,690
Stop it. It's over since I said it once.

346
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,050
It's not my fault that you didn't hear it. It's yours!

347
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,290
Tell me now!

348
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,660
3.

349
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,810
2.

350
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,440
1.

351
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,250
W...was Mother-in-law supposed to come?

352
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,390
N...no..

353
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,100
What should I do?

354
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,630
What do you mean what should you do?

355
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,550
Come into the room.

356
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,520
Don't go anywhere.

357
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,560
What if she comes in here?

358
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,550
Huh?

359
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,470
Why aren't you answering your phone?

360
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,970
What brings you here? You didn't even call...

361
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,120
Why would a mother call when she's visiting her son's house?

362
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,140
But why are you home in the middle of the afternoon?

363
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,560
Oh, I came here to get something.

364
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,150
I got the card key from Secretary Gil
because I couldn't reach you. That's okay, right?

365
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,970
Yeah, good job.

366
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,580
Come in.

367
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,870
Sit down.

368
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,950
I let it go because I was distracted then,

369
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,190
but I came here since I had to finish this.

370
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,620
Finish what?

371
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,950
What do you think?

372
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,380
It's about my ex-sister-in-law working here.

373
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,780
I told you that it has nothing to do with me!

374
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,300
Aigoo.

375
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,100
Who would believe that?

376
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,030
That would only work for an idiot.

377
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,140
She's leaving after completing her 3 month internship.

378
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:38,370
She wouldn't have come,
if she was just going to leave after the internship.

379
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,260
Enough with the nonsense, have her quit immediately.

380
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,720
What is this sound?

381
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,580
She's not picking up.

382
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,980
Where did she go during work hours?

383
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,600
Na Ae Ra suddenly disappears sometimes.

384
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,080
Hey, didn't you hear something from the room?

385
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,270
I know.

386
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,640
Is someone inside?

387
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,720
What do you mean?

388
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,730
I'll go check.

389
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,700
What is this?

390
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:38,470
"Son-in-law Cha, I heard you enjoyed the soup I sent?
If you think of it again, then ..."

391
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,400
Why would you touch my cellphone..

392
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,110
Cha seobang?

393
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,360
Those people still contact you?

394
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,750
What is this nonsense?

395
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,060
It's not like that.

396
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,150
They sent me some side dishes before.

397
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,040
Hey, why would that family send you those things?

398
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,430
Oh my,

399
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,570
that old man or that older brother,

400
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:04,190
are full of it.
They must be wanting something from you.

401
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:11,830
Mom, I think they're sticking to him now, because
they want his new benefits.

402
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,830
There's nothing more to say.

403
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,600
So unlucky that even the dogs and cats have gathered!
(Meaning everyone is coming.)

404
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,140
Stop talking nonsense, and make Ae Ra leave right away!

405
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,230
Stop it, now.

406
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,420
Hey, Jeong Woo...

407
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,720
Please return home for today.

408
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,440
Take Mother home.

409
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,200
You...

410
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,870
I'm asking you.

411
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,760
Why is he like that?
It's not like I said something wrong.

412
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,300
You know that restaurant, right?

413
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,040
In-laws?

414
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,970
What do you mean "in-laws'"?

415
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,830
Take me there.

416
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,960
Did you... hear what Mother said..?

417
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,540
I heard her talking, but what did she say?

418
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,960
I couldn't really hear.

419
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,430
It was nothing.

420
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,240
Okay. Then I'm leaving.

421
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,070
Stop talking nonsense, and make Ae Ra leave right away!

422
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,190
So unlucky that even the dogs and cats have gathered!

423
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,700
Security deposit of $10,000
and $450 for each month's rent.

424
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,760
But, why did you rent this house?

425
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,130
Well, as my workshop,

426
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,570
as well as my mother's workshop.

427
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,890
What about the other place?

428
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,610
Well, it turned out like this.

429
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,170
It'd be good if you just painted this place.

430
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,740
Do it artistically as an art major.

431
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,450
If you help me.

432
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,640
Why would I?

433
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,660
Move your body if your heart is in pain.

434
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,360
Also, I bought you jjajangmyeon.

435
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,660
When did you?

436
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,080
Jjajangmyeon is here!

437
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,390
Right now.

438
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,920
It's good.

439
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,180
You chose a good one.

440
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,900
Even if the house is nice,

441
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,550
if the Chinese restaurant near it is bad,
that's not good.

442
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,520
I know, right?

443
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,040
What would I have done if this was bad?

444
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,400
You're the youngest, right?

445
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,480
Yes. Why?

446
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,900
Whatever you do, you think everyone will adore you.

447
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,620
You're the youngest, too.

448
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,580
You have a younger sibling along with your older brother?

449
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,730
No.

450
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:26,180
But I'm different from the youngest
who gets to have his own workshop.

451
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,490
You have a good life.

452
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,740
If you're jealous, we can use it together.

453
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,170
If you help me paint, I'll give you a key.

454
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,100
What?

455
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,780
Yeah, why?

456
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,850
Hey, I think you need to come home now.

457
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,880
I have to go back to work now.

458
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,360
There's a war going on here.
Do you know who's here now?

459
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,270
Who?

460
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,560
What do you mean Ae Ra cannot grasp the situation, In-law?(Mother of son-in-law)

461
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,530
Before that, calling me "In-law" is a bit much.

462
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,520
It's been a very long time since the kids
finished up their paperwork.

463
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,360
Anyway,

464
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,750
what did our Ae Ra do wrong?

465
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,970
Logically,

466
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,200
working at an ex-husband's company,

467
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,290
do you think that makes sense?
- In-law...

468
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,910
I mean, ex-In-law...

469
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,370
"An ideal couple will complement one another."

470
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,270
What if an ex-wife helps with
her ex-husband's planned business,

471
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,600
what do you mean that will be a great blemish?

472
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,060
On paper, they might be strangers,

473
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,140
but they must still have spouses' spirit between them.

474
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,320
It's probably not spouses' spirit, but darkness.

475
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,000
Our Ae Ra is not a 'pencil'(dark graphite lead).
What dark 'ulterior motive?'

476
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,870
To be honest, if Jeong Woo's business hadn't gone well,
would Sister-in-Law...

477
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,050
No... Would your daughter have even looked at him?

478
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,930
That's enough, and

479
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,570
I'm going to ask you a favor.

480
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:09,020
Please don't shake my son up.

481
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,390
Our Jeong Woo, now that his business may be up and running and his life may have become more livable,

482
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,370
but he struggled a lot during that time.

483
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:23,580
Do you not know how much trouble we went through
because we brought a wrong person into the house?

484
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,450
So, are you saying that...

485
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,950
it's our Ae Ra's fault that
Son-in-law Cha's business didn't go well?

486
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,230
Isn't it?

487
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,610
Can you say that, even after everything went well as soon as they got divorced?

488
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,270
That's because our Ae Ra supported him,

489
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,610
and those are the results because she made the money so he could invent!

490
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,050
If it weren't for that, do you think Son-in-Law Cha would be where he is now?!

491
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,450
Excuse me, my Jeong Woo

492
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,810
was a well-known genius from when he was young.

493
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,710
Whatever he did, he would have succeeded.

494
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,820
How about my Ae Ra?

495
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,050
Since she was born, rumors started spreading about how pretty she was,

496
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,840
and I thought I should send her to Miss Korea or
have her start acting,

497
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,290
do you think it was just a night or two that I spent thinking about her options?

498
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,230
In the least, I thought she would marry a civil worker and live as a housewife.

499
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,780
If I had known she would live so horribly struggling like that and end up divorcing,

500
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:13,300
I never would've given my Ae Ra to Son-in-Law Cha!

501
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,540
This person, calm down.

502
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,600
Why didn't you make her a Miss Korea?

503
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,290
If she had that kind of power, by now,

504
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,250
she wouldn't be thinking of living off of a man.

505
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,100
What did you just say?
-Since I've said everything that I wanted to say,

506
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,340
we'll be leaving now.

507
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,170
Oh, oh, my head.

508
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,880
Ow, ow, my head!

509
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,630
What is that woman saying?

510
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,740
Hey, hey. You!

511
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,840
Don't you even dream about getting back with
Son-in-law Cha!

512
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,090
I'm not saying that I never thought about those things looking at Son-in-law Cha, but this isn't right!

513
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,410
Wow, that woman...

514
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,710
You'll die of cancer...

515
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:07,090
if you live with that woman as your mother-in law!
Because of stress!

516
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:12,310
Ouch. My stomach!
My heart is going to burst!

517
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,250
Oh, oh, my head.

518
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,290
Wake up!

519
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:37,040
I'm not working at this company to date.

520
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,380
Did I say something?

521
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,340
When I first came into this company...

522
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,850
yes, I wasn't blameless.

523
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,190
But... it's not like that now.

524
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,780
Now, I like my job and want to do well.

525
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,950
So what I'm saying is,

526
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,250
I'm not working here to get back together with you.

527
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,020
I don't have any desire to do that.

528
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,190
Hey.. why are you like this?
Did something happen?

529
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,140
By any chance... did you hear what Mother said?

530
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,160
I don't care what Mother-in-law says.

531
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,880
Yes, she must hate me.

532
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,860
She must hate me, I get that.

533
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,650
But I can't stand her

534
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,240
visiting my family.

535
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,140
So that this will never happen again,
have a talk with her.

536
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,170
Hold ...

537
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,310
What is this?

538
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,450
Did you wait here for me?

539
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,270
For my birthday?

540
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,830
This isn't for you.

541
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,310
Then who is it for?

542
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,110
I bought this for you.

543
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,050
You didn't have to!

544
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,910
You grew up so properly so you act different, too.

545
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,730
Hey...
- Last time when you came home drunk,

546
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,000
we promised that we'd have tea.

547
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,250
What?

548
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,310
But what should I do?
I'm a little busy today.

549
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,450
Is something going on?

550
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:03,200
Well... I own a little business.

551
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,120
Even in this recession, quality

552
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,340
assurance and after service alone,

553
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,920
is causing a flood of orders.

554
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,950
It's being fulfilled on a day-to-day basis.

555
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,530
Then I'll help, too, while I'm here.

556
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:23,120
No, no! I can't make a guest work!

557
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,920
Min Yeong, should I do anything else?

558
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,160
No.

559
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,540
Hey, Guk, do you need help?

560
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,590
No.

561
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,860
This should be done by a delicate woman.

562
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,510
Give it to me.

563
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,040
You're doing well for your first time.

564
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,480
It's done.

565
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,430
This side.

566
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,920
I guess we should make more.

567
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,940
Give it to me.

568
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,170
Ah, it's hot. Hot.

569
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:44,560
You got burned?

570
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,780
It's so hot!
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

571
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,120
What should we do? I'm so sorry!

572
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,430
What should we do?

573
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,760
Overreacting... Anyone who sees it will think it's a pimple!

574
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,130
All we have to do is put this on.

575
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:47,970
We'll do the rest, so you can relax.

576
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,860
Hey, Seung Hyeon, could you bring the wax here?

577
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,630
Sure.

578
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,540
Noona!

579
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,370
This looks nice.

580
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,680
It's really good, right?

581
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,040
But what is it?

582
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,490
It's your first time here, but your hands are empty.

583
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,700
Seung Hyeon.
-Yeah.

584
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,380
Can I ask you to do something for me?

585
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,830
You punk! You seem desperate today.

586
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,830
What do you want? A bet is a bet.

587
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,720
Hyung, do you remember?

588
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,800
The first day we drank together.

589
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,530
Because I was struggling with friend problems;

590
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:30,290
Hyung, you said to me,

591
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:34,490
"When choosing friends, be cautious.

592
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,390
When leaving a friend, be more cautious."

593
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,840
Did I?

594
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,320
But what about it?

595
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,580
You've passed the age to be worrying about friends.

596
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,950
Are you talking about that woman?

597
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:04,490
I'll think about what to ask, for the bet I won.

598
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,310
Cautiously.

599
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,360
This punk.
What kind of great thing are you going to ask ...

600
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,220
Don't cry ...

601
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,690
Oh, Father!

602
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,270
What is that?

603
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,480
What do you mean 'what is that'?

604
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:28,670
These are sunshines to drive away
your mother's dark face!

605
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,710
Madame Jang. . .

606
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,510
What is this?

607
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,050
What do you mean? I bought it for you!

608
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,160
With what money?

609
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,620
Why is that important, in our relationship?

610
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,610
Your money is mine, and my money is yours!

611
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,680
You didn't touch the savings, right?

612
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,900
What?!
How many times have you done this?!

613
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,640
How many times?!

614
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,410
What are you doing?

615
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,840
Aigoo! Oh my goodness!

616
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,230
Calm down, calm down!

617
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,330
Oh!

618
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,280
You becoming successful;

619
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,280
honestly, I'm angry.

620
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,620
After making my daughter suffer so much,
you're living well all by yourself.

621
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,990
The one who claps her hands
is a crazy bit*h!

622
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,360
After you broke up with Ae Ra,

623
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,160
did your life work out smoothly?

624
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,780
Look here,

625
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,530
after our Ae Ra divorced you,

626
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:38,300
she lived not knowing whether it was day or night to pay off all the debts.

627
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,910
Debts?

628
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:46,240
The debts from business, I...

629
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,010
A girl without education,

630
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,410
she took over the household for 4 years
from the beginning ...

631
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,860
Isn't it weird to not have debts?

632
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:59,810
Do you know how hard it was for me to look at her
while living with her friend, trying to pay back those debts?

633
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,670
Sook Jae, darling. Please calm down.

634
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,850
Didn't Son-in-law Cha say he's sorry?

635
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,300
Yes, Mom.

636
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,330
Doing this isn't right to a person who came to apologize.

637
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,660
You stay quiet! You're the same kind of person!

638
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:19,080
How could you spend your sister's alimony?!

639
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,880
Our Ae Ra is like that.

640
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,170
Although she acts like she's doing everything in life,

641
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:36,480
she never shows her pain, and suffers all by herself.

642
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:38,680
I'm sorry...

643
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,850
You don't need to!

644
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:43,470
I don't want to see you anymore,

645
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,520
so let's end it today!

646
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,810
Mother . . .

647
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,150
Mother? What mother? Who?!

648
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,090
Mom!

649
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,840
Why... why are you here?

650
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,130
You quit your work right now!

651
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,040
A finished fate is finished.

652
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,340
Were you hurt a lot?

653
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,810
It's natural that she acts like that.

654
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,980
She must hate me.

655
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,310
I understand.

656
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,200
It's a dialogue I've heard many times.

657
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,160
Is it?

658
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,540
Hey, Ae Ra...

659
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,910
I'm looking for other jobs.

660
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:45,530
After this project, I'm going to quit.

661
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,750
That...
-Ah, my temper.

662
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,430
I shouldn't have gone to you in the first place.

663
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:55,780
I'm going now.

664
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,580
I have to comfort Mom.

665
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,340
Ae Ra.

666
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,400
There was a cellphone accessory at home. It's yours right?

667
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,130
Oh, really?

668
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,540
I didn't know it fell.

669
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:19,220
Yeah... It's in my office.
I'll give it to you later.

670
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:21,240
Okay.

671
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,900
Aren't you leaving?

672
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:27,540
I came because I wanted to sleep with Mom.

673
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,060
Bye.

674
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,430
Why are you here?

675
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,010
Seung Hyeon.
- Hyung.

676
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,930
I finished contemplating about the worry
I told you about before.

677
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,910
Hyung. I...

678
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,550
No.

679
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,770
Don't.
