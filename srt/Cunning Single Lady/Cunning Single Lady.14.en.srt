00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,710
Episode 14

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,620
Did you order her to do that?

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,200
That...

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,090
Why? Why did you do it?

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,030
Since you don't seem to understand a person's words.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,230
Why? You don't like it?

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,030
You wrecked all that hard work!

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,760
Everything that we all worked so hard on, Director, you wrecked it all!

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,320
The one who wrecked it is you, Na Ae Ra!

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,900
Na Ae Ra, you are wrecking the CEO and the company,

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,310
all of it right now!

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,210
I asked you to help me!

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,030
I told you that I could protect CEO Cha's dream.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,390
I told you that I love CEO Cha!

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,580
Are you thinking to cling tenaciously to
your ex-husband's sense of guilt?

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,310
What changes because you attach yourself to him so nastily?
- Stop it.

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,140
Whether it's sense of guilt or being sorry,

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,980
that's a matter between us. It's not a matter that Director should be involved in.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,120
Us?

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,300
You speak as if you've already remarried.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,890
Oh my, did you really think that way?

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,880
Yes, I even had thoughts like that.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,760
There's no reason that I couldn't. Whether it's guilt or feeling sorry,

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,260
since he said that he loved me, I was shaken.

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,470
What's the reason that we can't start over?

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,880
Since we've experienced it once, wouldn't we do better the second time.

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,470
If I see how much my heart flutters, it'll be all right.

28
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,260
In one day, I worry more than a dozen times.

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,980
That's right. We've changed so much in that time that I'm afraid also.

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,140
But that's all, so I'm just being cautious.

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,790
There's no reason that you can't start over. You'll do better the second time around?

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,370
Isn't this such a funny thing to say?

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,920
Now that I look at it, the one that's really broken is you, Director.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,380
You're saying that I'm clinging tenaciously to Jeong Woo's sense of guilt?

35
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,490
With the excuse of helping Jeong Woo during his hard times,

36
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,880
aren't you the one that's clinging tenaciously to the sense of debt in his heart?

37
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,180
What are you so afraid of?
Aren't things with Jeong Woo going as well as you had planned?

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,460
Yeo Jin, are you all right?

39
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,150
Ae Ra, what happened?

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,440
I...I...

41
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,770
Yeo Jin. Yeo Jin.

42
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,310
Cha Jeong Woo!

43
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,860
I requested so much that she shouldn't, at least, miss her periodic checkups.

44
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,160
She said that she was busy with work and missed her check-ups , and

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,800
due to an excess of stress; a strain occurred where the robotic leg is attached, so the inflammation has become severe.

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,140
For a while, she needs to be absolutely calm and needs rest.

47
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,690
How is she?

48
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,100
She's asleep.

49
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,620
How could you hide such a thing from me?

50
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,080
What am I suppose to do because I feel sorry?

51
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,670
Are you even sorry?

52
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,250
How can you say that?

53
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,770
She asked me to keep it a secret.

54
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,730
She probably didn't want to be pitied because of her leg.

55
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,770
If she stayed next to you while giving you everything and protecting you,

56
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,260
she probably thought she'd be loved.

57
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,180
Father, Noona ... and I...

58
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,520
When I think about it, it seems we are all in a similar kind of love.

59
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,140
But, Mother left Father,

60
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,770
and Hyung abandoned Yeo Jin.

61
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,910
What's going to happen to me?

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,150
I already told you about Ae Ra.

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,260
That I'm going to start over.

64
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,630
I don't care anymore, if you start over again or not.

65
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,870
Do you really have to do that?

66
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,530
Ae Ra and I...

67
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,440
Did you say that you were going to do your best to protect us both?

68
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,730
But...there's no reason to protect me.

69
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,670
Because I've thrown you away.

70
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,180
If you're going to protect Ae Ra, you're
going to have to give it your all.

71
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,640
Because I will do anything

72
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,930
to keep her by my side.

73
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,020
Min Yeong.

74
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,660
Min Yeong, are you in the bathroom?

75
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,210
Hey, why are you crying?

76
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,620
What's wrong?

77
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,910
What do I do?

78
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,960
What?

79
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,880
I think I'm pregnant. I'm so scared.

80
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,730
I'm scared to death.

81
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,110
I can't live because of you!

82
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,010
You should have been careful!

83
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,130
How long has it been?

84
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,770
That...Only once.

85
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,330
Give it to me.

86
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,070
You're not.

87
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,160
What? I'm not?

88
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,270
But why did I skip my period this month?

89
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,580
I'm not crying because I don't like it,

90
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,440
it's because it's so sudden.

91
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,470
Because I like Soo Cheol Oppa so much.

92
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,350
If I thought of Oppa and our baby,

93
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,920
I was so happy.

94
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,770
I'm sorry, Ae Ra.

95
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,010
Are you okay?

96
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,590
I'm okay, don't cry.

97
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,510
The number you have called won't connect...

98
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,500
Ae Ra!

99
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,070
Min Yeong!

100
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,120
Our baby

101
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,930
was my hope.

102
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,990
Really,

103
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,850
I really wanted to protect the baby.

104
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,850
But I lost the baby.

105
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,710
Forget about it now.

106
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,960
How could I forget?

107
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,420
If even I forget,

108
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,310
our baby will be too pitiful.

109
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,830
They say that babies who die in the womb

110
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,410
go directly to good parents.

111
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,330
The baby has probably gone next to good parents already.

112
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,070
Even though it was difficult for me,

113
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,740
because I tried to endure everything,

114
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,710
the baby must have known it, too.

115
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,980
You couldn't help it back then.

116
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,720
On top of that, you were so busy paying back debts and rent,

117
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,330
did you even have time to rest at all?

118
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,980
Because I am a mom,

119
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,870
I should have taken care of the baby.

120
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,890
Min Yeong,

121
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,470
I...

122
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,150
would fall asleep from being tired every day,

123
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,240
I couldn't even let the baby listen to good music.

124
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,700
And because I couldn't tell Jeong Woo,

125
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,820
I didn't even let the baby hear a dad's voice even once.

126
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,180
Maybe I should have just told him.

127
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,370
If I had...

128
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,180
If I had, Jeong Woo...

129
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,490
Don't cry, Ae Ra.

130
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,460
Jeong Woo.

131
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,060
Min Yeong.

132
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,280
I'm sorry.

133
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,610
I'm sorry.

134
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,030
I'm sorry.

135
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,470
Ae Ra.

136
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,120
Ae Ra.

137
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,680
Yeah?

138
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,630
I'm sorry.

139
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,770
I'll do better.

140
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,480
Even in my opinion, it's embarrassing

141
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,320
to say these things after all this time,

142
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,620
but this is the only thing I can think of to say.

143
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,460
Jeong Woo.

144
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,610
Say it.

145
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,520
Don't be good to me.

146
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,100
I...

147
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,820
your heart,

148
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,130
and my heart,

149
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,770
I'm not sure of anything.

150
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,630
I can't come to a firm conviction.

151
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm afraid.

152
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,240
Ae Ra.

153
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,720
I...

154
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,770
We're people who have already failed once before.

155
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,270
I don't want to ever fail again. Once is enough

156
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,580
to get hurt.

157
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,820
I'm not going to hurt you again.

158
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,480
I won't ever leave you alone.

159
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,640
Jeong Woo.

160
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,900
I'm sorry.

161
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,200
You had even asked me to wait and see.

162
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,960
Ae Ra.

163
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,580
Let's talk face to face.

164
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,870
No,

165
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,310
I like it this way.

166
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,900
Since I can't see your face,

167
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,450
it's more comfortable to talk.

168
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,770
What can I do?

169
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,390
What do I need to do?

170
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,780
Don't do anything.

171
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,490
Just leave me alone.

172
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,480
Why are they talking so much when I stepped aside so they could be together!

173
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,810
I don't know.

174
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,710
♫ I really love you ♫

175
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,420
♫ to the point of tears. ♫

176
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,870
Ae Ra.
♫ I really love you. ♫

177
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,950
Okay.
♫ Even if I lose everthing. ♫

178
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,500
I'll do as you wish.

179
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,360
♫ I really love you. ♫

180
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,150
If you want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone.

181
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,480
If it's more comfortable for you not to see me, I will.

182
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,180
♫ I really love you. ♫

183
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,030
Just don't abandon me.

184
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,460
♫ Just seeing you once ♫

185
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,960
♫ makes me tear up. ♫

186
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,440
♫ With all my excuses, ♫

187
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,900
♫ the words I can't yet say. ♫

188
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,950
♫ I really love you from deep within my heart. ♫

189
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,000
♫ My dear. ♫

190
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,200
What about CEO?

191
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,240
Oh, there must have been work at the office. He was waiting for you and left just a little while ago.

192
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,540
Okay.

193
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,350
Rest a little. They said you overexerted yourself.

194
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,720
Sleep.

195
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,130
The doctor said you need to rest for a while.

196
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,290
No, I have to quickly pull myself together,

197
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,930
and get to the office.

198
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,840
Why?

199
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,860
Are you anxious leaving Jeong Woo and Ae Ra together?

200
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,350
I've known it.

201
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,970
The relationship between Jeong Woo and Ae Ra.

202
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,790
And about Jeong Woo liking Ae Ra.

203
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,910
Don't worry too much.

204
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,630
Because I'm someone

205
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,200
who doesn't want Jeong Woo and Ae Ra to get together just as much as you.

206
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,020
The office is in complete chaos. Complete chaos.

207
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,860
After promoting to the public that we'll be doing a luxury appraisal show,

208
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,010
on that day, and right before the broadcast,

209
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,020
we only just put up an apology notice.

210
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,110
The MD in charge was Na Ae Ra,

211
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,360
she'll be reprimanded, right?

212
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,170
Why are you worried about that?

213
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,350
I mean, because of Na Ae Ra

214
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,760
our entire company's image has become laughable, that's why.

215
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,930
There will be a meeting to counter measure.

216
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,740
I'm sure there will be talk of

217
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,130
how to handle it then.

218
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,550
Ae Ra, don't worry too much.

219
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:02,260
It doesn't make sense that they would put the responsibility on an intern in the first place!

220
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,490
Yes.

221
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,210
Chin up.

222
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,680
Yes, this is Na Ae Ra.

223
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,560
This is the HR department at Unified Shilla Hotel.

224
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,590
Oh...

225
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,570
Just a moment, please.

226
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,680
When would it be possible for you to start working?
For us, it'll be better if it's sooner.

227
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,810
Yes, I'll start working as soon as I finalize things here.

228
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,420
Yes. I understand.

229
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:44,310
♫ I picture the place where there are only pleasant things. ♫

230
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:55,480
♫ Truly no one is lonely and cold as here ♫

231
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:06,100
♫  Think of you ... slow like that. ♫

232
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,560
As you all know,

233
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,680
since Director Guk is absent due to health reasons,

234
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,790
we'll have to proceed with this meeting without her today.

235
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,200
As I've reported, where the real bag should've been displayed,

236
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,530
we discovered that someone put a counterfeit product there accidentally.

237
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,040
Right before the event, we put up a public announcement that it was canceled ...

238
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,070
We don't know if that was an accident or intentional yet.

239
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,160
In ...

240
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,980
Intentional?

241
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,010
Although I think who would intentionally do something so bad...

242
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,060
It could've been instigated by a competing company...

243
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,720
I heard that the MD in charge is an intern.

244
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,580
It could be that she has some grudge against the company and is acting out on revenge.

245
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,460
That doesn't make sense.

246
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,350
Because the person who discovered prior to the show that the merchandise was switched

247
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,450
was the MD in charge, Na Ae Ra.

248
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:22,720
As Director Jung said, if she got instigated by a competing company, or had a grudge against the company,

249
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,970
she wouldn't have reported that the merchandise was switched. Don't you agree?

250
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,080
More important than placing blame right now,

251
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,200
is finding how to revive our tarnished image. Isn't it?

252
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,000
I apologize for being late.

253
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,790
You must not have heard.

254
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,730
I'll formally introduce myself.

255
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,860
I'm Guk Seung Hyeon, who'll be replacing Director Guk Yeo Jin, as of today.

256
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,050
Ah, Guk Seung Hyeon, Guk Yeo Jin. Why didn't I think of that?

257
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,660
Did I do anything wrong? What do I do?

258
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,680
Team Leader, you knew, didn't you?

259
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,710
How is that important?

260
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,290
I personally think contemptibly of those people who flatter those who are in power.

261
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,750
Oh, seriously!

262
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,760
I thought he looked so noble.

263
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,840
If I had known this, I would have treated him better.

264
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,250
For a little while, I'm acting Director Guk Yeo Jin.

265
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,760
I know that it will probably be uncomfortable since someone who was an intern is suddenly a director.

266
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,530
No, it isn't, Director.

267
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,950
But still, please remember our bond during that time and look favorably on me.

268
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,480
Oh, yes, yes.

269
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,070
And please don't ignore me if we meet in the hallway.

270
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,320
Yes.

271
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,670
Especially Na Ae Ra.

272
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,380
Yes?

273
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,260
Please stop ignoring me and see me for a moment.

274
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,370
Oh my, why are those two like that?

275
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:24,840
Perhaps, isn't he going to transfer her to a nice department,
saying they're intern colleagues?

276
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,250
Are you mad?

277
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,350
No.

278
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,770
Are you really surprised?

279
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

280
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,760
At least to you, I wanted to show you just me, without any pre-judgement.

281
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,610
If I could, I wanted to remain as intern colleagues until the very end.

282
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,350
There isn't anything more you're hiding from me, is there?

283
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,400
There's one more thing, that I haven't told you.

284
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,190
I know CEO Cha.

285
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,220
I mean, to be more precise,

286
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,330
we've been like real brothers since I was young, like a family relationship.

287
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,020
CEO Cha was my younger brother's tutor.

288
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,200
So I came to know that his business was difficult through my brother.

289
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,590
And I also know that you're CEO Cha's...

290
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:05,420
I mean, that you're Jeong Woo's ex-wife, too.

291
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,870
Actually, I was really confused, and struggled throughout this time,

292
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,010
but I've decided now.

293
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,410
Although Jeong Woo is precious to me, if I had to choose one out of the two,

294
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,720
I'd choose you.

295
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,550
This is ... I got a really good one,

296
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,200
so I made some with wild ginseng a while ago.

297
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,760
Would you like to try drinking a cup?

298
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,040
The aroma is outstanding.

299
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,350
Even though Director Guk is absent from her seat, there isn't any big hindrance to the business.

300
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,170
Seung Hyeon... please remove him.

301
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:05,170
Let's say we remove Seung Hyeon as you said.

302
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:09,250
Then Yeo Jin won't be there, so there won't be any of my people there.

303
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,460
Then who's going to protect and speak for my money?

304
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:18,070
It may not be much in your eyes, but within a company there are actual rules and procedures.

305
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,870
Overnight, appointing an intern to a director is sketchy.

306
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,720
Do you know how much this is cutting into the morale of the company's employees?

307
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,720
Seung Hyeon is a smart kid. So that he can move up on his own,

308
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,660
please leave him alone.

309
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:52,300
If you want to exercise influence using the investment as an excuse, that's fine.

310
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,750
Chairman Guk, you aren't the only investor.

311
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,280
I'll have to let the other investors exercise power as well.

312
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,700
I will get all the investors together right now.

313
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,170
I already got them together.

314
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,330
Tomorrow, the investors will hold a meeting.

315
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,240
You probably don't have time to be like this, why don't you go prepare first?

316
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,790
Now, finally you seem like my child.

317
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,630
Don't enjoy this too much.

318
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,990
The game that CEO Cha is developing right now, the release date keeps being pushed back

319
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,500
and it seems to be further aggravating the company's critical situation.

320
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,080
Even though it's a project, he put in most of the investment funds saying this will be life or death.

321
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,480
Do you remember that it was a project that you all had been against?

322
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,830
Now it seems that it's time to take that responsibility.

323
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,690
I will take responsibility.

324
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,350
Like Director Guk stated, all of your investment money

325
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,300
was poured into here.

326
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,680
Don't you all have to wait to see the result of all the money that went into it?

327
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,200
The product development is almost complete, and once the testing phase is finished it will be released very soon.

328
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,930
Only releasing it isn't a result.

329
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,060
The real result would be the return of the investment and make the target profit.

330
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,920
Now then, when do you think the result will be realized, CEO Cha?

331
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,600
Within three months of releasing it,

332
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,160
I will make it so the investment money is returned.

333
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,990
By the end of the year,

334
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,550
I will collect the 1st targeted profits.

335
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,330
Your pledge is strong.

336
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,410
Since you're a person with a strong sense of responsibility, we'll look forward to it.

337
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,160
Director Guk Seung Hyeon
(replacing Director Guk Yeo Jin)

338
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,190
You should still knock.

339
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,680
Were you like this even when Noona was here?

340
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,180
What's the reason you're going as far as you are?

341
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:15,770
Hyung, you're good at handling machines, but you're clumsy when it comes to handling people.

342
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,270
It's just that I've judged that you're not a good CEO.

343
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,200
Even if I am here because of nepotism, I should do the job properly.

344
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,670
Right. The company is geared too much toward software.

345
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,150
Since it was a program development company from the start.

346
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,020
I'm thinking to give more strength to the design side.

347
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,840
It's about time that the 'state of the art' should love the arts, too, don't you think?

348
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,660
When I have a plan made, I'll report it.

349
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,450
Ah, and

350
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,500
it's not only because of personal reasons that I'm doing this.

351
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,470
So Hyung, you try deciding it unemotionally also.

352
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,550
You're pretty good Guk Seung Hyeon.

353
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,980
Thank you.

354
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,350
For saying that it's not because of personal emotion.

355
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,850
Fine. I don't know whether your words may be right.

356
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
I'll take this time to think about it again.

357
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,810
How I am as a CEO ... and your plans, too.

358
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,160
Work hard.

359
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,820
No.

360
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,070
Please work hard.
(using respectful formal speech)

361
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,100
The new Director Guk.

362
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,130
Out of the investors,

363
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,040
are there people who are cornering him by discussing his disposition?

364
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,160
The project that the CEO is developing,

365
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,080
what if the project were to fail?

366
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,160
In a pinch, he could be...it could happen.

367
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,460
No way.

368
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,710
How can they kick him out when he started this company?

369
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,260
Don't you know Steve Jobs?

370
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,030
That genius also kept colliding with the Board of Directors and

371
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,960
in the end he was fired from the company that he made.

372
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,060
Sister-in-law!

373
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,880
Ex-Sister-in-law.

374
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,950
Is that rumor true?

375
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,630
That the company's in bad shape?

376
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:37,190
Ah, it's true that he's lived with a crisis hanging over him.

377
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,540
But it is still the most critical point that the company has ever faced.

378
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,900
Is Jeong Woo... okay?

379
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,140
Oh..

380
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,040
Na Ae Ra was really worried about you.

381
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,200
Ae Ra?

382
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,570
How did you know that?

383
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,670
I met her on my way here.

384
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,740
At the words that you were having difficulty, her face suddenly darkened.

385
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,370
You caused her pointless worry.

386
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,830
Don't do anything.

387
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,920
You're not going to call her?

388
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,800
Is Dad really sick?

389
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,850
Oh.. okay. I'll go home.

390
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,020
You didn't see her?

391
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,690
Hey, who am I? Wait a second.

392
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,750
Oh, Sunbaenim.

393
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,540
Ae Ra!

394
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,980
It's been so long!

395
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,630
Go closer! I can't see!

396
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,710
I almost got caught.

397
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,280
Where's Ae Ra?
- Just a second.

398
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,760
I'm sorry for making you worry.

399
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,650
Na Ae Ra gets off work like a knife.
(meaning she leaves on time)

400
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,100
Oh, did she say that her Father was sick?

401
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,430
Father-in-law?

402
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,020
Does the Customer Consultation Department appeal to you?

403
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,430
Oh, right.

404
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,610
The position...to me is...

405
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,460
How did Father-in-law...?

406
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,360
Oh, oh, it's obvious.

407
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,560
In front of the hiking club's ladies, he was showing off his strength holding a tray and that's how it happened.

408
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,190
Oh, man. Really.

409
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,450
I know. What can we do? For me, officially I'm on night duty.

410
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,700
Even Ae Ra has to go and help out with the household work.

411
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,770
But...that position...

412
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,660
Hyungnim.

413
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,470
Thank you!

414
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,600
Thank you!

415
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,320
Brother-in-law Cha, where are you going?

416
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,620
That position...

417
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,010
Bro...ther-in-law!
- Aiyoo.

418
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,260
Ex...ex-wife...
- Ow, hot.

419
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,610
Then.. Na Ae Ra.. is CEO's ex-wife?

420
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,590
Eat it deliciously.

421
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,630
Aigoo, my back, aigoo, my back.

422
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,390
Mom, you don't have something for me to bring out?

423
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,540
Here, here.

424
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,850
Aigoo, what can we do? You can't even rest as soon as you're done at the office.

425
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,660
It's ok, but didn't you say that we were going to have a large party of guests?

426
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,830
I know. We need one more pair of hands, but

427
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,530
of all the days, your father is sitting there saying that his back hurts?!

428
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,640
Welcome...

429
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,600
I'll do it.

430
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,680
It's hot...

431
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,260
I didn't ask him to come here!

432
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,480
Give me more side dishes for table #5 over there.

433
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,050
Oh, okay..

434
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,950
You go rest. I'll do this.

435
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,820
I am a total power man with my arms!

436
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,100
You know too, right?

437
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,010
That I'm strong.

438
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,410
Aiyoo, truthfully, even during that chicken fight I had completely won...

439
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,000
But later the person that's sitting here,

440
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,350
How will he eat the sautéed chicken if it's over here?

441
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,670
I'll try it, so watch carefully.

442
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,630
If I sit here like this, to reach...

443
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,190
I have long arms so I can reach it and can eat.

444
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,290
But if you were to sit here and eat, think about it.

445
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,660
Your arm is short so you won't be able to reach. How are you going to eat it?

446
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,550
Aigoo, those side dishes aren't what's important right now.

447
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,240
Ae Ra...

448
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,670
Here are exam soup and rice that guarantees a pass.

449
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,650
Hey, so everyone who eats the rice soup here passes the exam?

450
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,710
Ay, I wasn't going to say this again.

451
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,860
Don't you know who I am?

452
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,140
Right? You're CEO Cha from DonTalk.

453
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,730
I'm a total fan.

454
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,060
Me, too. Didn't you come and lecture at Seoul University last time?

455
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,080
Ah, were you there, too?

456
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,970
But why are you doing this here?

457
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,320
Are you perhaps doing volunteer service?

458
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,630
I ate rice soup here for a year

459
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,200
and I passed the exam my first try.

460
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,620
As a sweet tempered dimension.

461
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,320
Sit, sit, sit. Eat a lot.

462
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,590
I'll eat well.

463
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,060
Eat a lot.
-Please give us some more pickled radish cubes.

464
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,920
Hey, I think that rumor must be true.

465
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,980
That D&T might go under.

466
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,480
That's what I mean. If not, would the CEO be here like this?

467
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,820
That's what I mean.

468
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,760
Pickled radish cubes.
- Yes, I'll bring it right out for you.

469
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,320
Why is Son-in-law Cha doing that?

470
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,020
It's making me feel burdened.

471
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,040
Don't you think he's making an effort because he wants to reconcile?

472
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,310
Since his efforts are admirable,

473
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,650
should we include him as our member?
-What?

474
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,030
This person ... forget it!

475
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,110
Secrets of Godori.
(When you collect 5 birds in a game of Hwatoo)

476
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,950
I...

477
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,840
Hurry up.

478
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,840
Hey ... Soo Chul!

479
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,240
Son-in law, do you have Kwang?

480
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,930
What do you mean? You're going to help me, right?

481
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,370
Godori.
-Put down Gwang.

482
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,830
Mom.

483
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,610
If he puts down that card, how much will you give him?
-What?

484
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,300
Son-in-law Cha, if you give me the Godori card, I'll give you half of my earnings!

485
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,280
We can't trust what Father says.

486
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,960
You always say something different later.

487
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,700
You heard him, didn't you?
-Yes.

488
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,430
Then...

489
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,940
Father, Gwang!

490
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,210
Aish!

491
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,810
You had it yet you didn't put it down.

492
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,900
My mom is good!

493
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,410
You're Gwang-bak!

494
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,880
I'll get going.

495
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,540
You're already leaving?
-I have to get to work.

496
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,190
Mom, I'm leaving.

497
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,940
Aren't you leaving?

498
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,900
I should.
-Let's go together! Wait...

499
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,010
This person, you're leaving after making money?

500
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,240
No, sit down. Hurry up and deal.

501
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,820
I'm going to get you back with Gwang-bak.

502
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,210
Pi-bak ... Gwang-bak ...

503
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:59,020
Why? You should go together with Jeong Woo.

504
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,760
When I was watching him, Jeong Woo seemed so pitiful.

505
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,980
He was being mindful of you and trying hard to do well.

506
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,720
It's true you like Jeong Woo, too.

507
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,440
What are you so afraid of?

508
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,420
Is it because of Seung Hyeon?

509
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,610
Or is it because of Director Guk or Guk Yeo Jin?

510
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,200
Ay, let's go, Min Yeong.

511
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,790
You're having a hard time, aren't you?

512
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,250
Manager Kang...

513
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,020
I was always...

514
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,700
I was sure I knew what success was.

515
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,380
But now I'm not sure.

516
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,800
Compared to my abilities,

517
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,850
if I've succeeded too much,

518
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,490
and if the path I'm on right now is right,

519
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,300
if this is the best thing!

520
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,740
I'm on your side no matter what.

521
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:06,470
You're the one I trust, right behind my children.

522
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,050
Aren't you lonely, Manager Kang?

523
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,470
After sending the people you love so far away.

524
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,440
Well, still, what can I do?

525
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,960
Don't you miss them?

526
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,970
Even if I miss them, I have to endure it.

527
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,270
It's all for my family's sake.

528
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,000
Is that what it is?

529
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,360
Even if you miss them, do you have to endure it?

530
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,300
Do you have any other worries?

531
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,270
I have one, too.

532
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,140
I miss someone, but I have to endure it.

533
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,690
How much did you drink?
- Let go!

534
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,570
I have to wake up in the morning... in the morning.

535
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:07,840
Don't you know how well I drink...

536
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,370
Ay, I'm sorry.
- Please lay him down in his bed.

537
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,660
If you put a pillow in his arms, he'll go to sleep peacefully.

538
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,540
Ay, don't worry. Go in and sleep.

539
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,160
I'll take care of him.

540
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,740
Hey, come here!

541
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,230
What are you looking at?

542
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,980
What are you looking at, you punk!

543
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,910
Hey, look at you!

544
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,780
You must have worked out!

545
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,590
Hey! Ouch!

546
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,740
He's cute.

547
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,450
Aigoo...

548
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,260
Hey! I got you today.

549
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,320
Ae Ra...

550
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,720
Ae Ra...

551
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,100
Ae Ra?

552
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,160
Then CEO...

553
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,850
still...Na Ae Ra...

554
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,080
Ae Ra...

555
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,360
Ae Ra...

556
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,390
I brought you here to cheer up, thinking you're frustrated, but all you're doing is sighing.

557
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,770
It's nice.

558
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,130
If it's complicated, then just ignore it.

559
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,300
Who I am, or who I have relations with. Just ignore me.

560
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,770
Or you can completely forget.

561
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,580
How am I suppose to ignore it when I already know?

562
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,510
Because nothing is going to change with you knowing.

563
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,350
Seung Hyeon. I mean, Director...

564
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:12,560
Oh, this is going to melt. Eat up.

565
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,970
Please don't interrupt my work.

566
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,620
Okay.

567
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,570
Here.

568
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,580
Isn't it neat?

569
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,000
It has meaning, too.

570
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,930
You're good at ignoring!

571
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,040
This... was given to me by my mother.

572
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:57,170
Whether it's art or love, I like simple and easy.

573
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,280
I don't like things that are difficult and complicated.

574
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,680
Since I got here by nepotism, I'm thinking about doing the project we talked about a while ago.

575
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:10,220
I think the company's design project will make it (the company) stand out (emboss).

576
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,290
After becoming Director, you've become more pensive.

577
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,440
It's nice to see that.

578
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,110
Ae Ra, help me.

579
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,290
If you're here, I think I'll have the strength to work.

580
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,130
I don't even know the "a" to art (have no idea).

581
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,290
And I know even less about design.

582
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,970
You're already doing it.

583
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,180
Because you give me inspiration and make me work.

584
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,220
Here.

585
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:41,110
This is the tab to the can that was on your finger.

586
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,740
This?

587
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,460
How did you make it?

588
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,370
See? You help me to work.

589
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,380
Seung Hyeon,

590
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,230
I got accepted from the hotel interview.

591
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,560
I know.

592
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,500
You're making the choice.

593
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,930
I'm just asking you...

594
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,210
to give me a chance.

595
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,260
CEO.

596
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,290
Are you okay?

597
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,370
Yes.

598
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,550
I am sorry.

599
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,740
I should have paid more attention.

600
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,700
I didn't want to let you know.

601
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,270
I want you to see me as

602
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,490
a normal woman.

603
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,510
It's still a relief...

604
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,340
because the look in your eyes is

605
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,640
warmer than I thought.

606
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,320
If possible, I will get discharged quickly.

607
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,570
After I get discharged, let's go to America.

608
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,100
We'll be able to draw in funds from the US.

609
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,240
I am sorry, Yeo Jin.

610
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,540
I...

611
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,490
I gave you a harder time

612
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,040
by thanking you for being by my side.

613
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,570
Yeo Jin,

614
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,820
I can't be a good man to you.

615
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,250
I'm sorry...

616
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,040
for telling you so late.

617
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,870
I was really grateful.

618
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,430
It's rotted here.

619
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:43,150
This is the spot I cut because it rotted before, right?

620
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,570
Yes, I think so.

621
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,910
You put so much care into this,

622
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,960
I don't know why it keeps rotting.

623
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,570
Why else. I'm thinking of it all wrong.

624
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,790
What's the point of cutting the leaf,

625
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,820
when the root is the one that's rotted.

626
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,630
It's time to throw it away!

627
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,150
Take all my money out

628
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,140
of CEO Cha's company!

629
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,860
The door is closing.

630
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,620
Yes.

631
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,590
Yes, I understand.

632
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,100
Are you alright?

633
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,330
I didn't want to let you see me like this, but

634
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:16,930
I asked you to see me because there is something I must say to you.

635
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,520
Sit down.

636
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,650
Do you know what kind of dangerous situation

637
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:36,920
CEO Cha is in?

638
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,940
The company could be taken away from CEO Cha.

639
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,620
What do you mean by that?

640
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,270
Don't pretend like you don't know anything with that bright face of yours,

641
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,330
because it's repulsive.

642
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,010
I...
-Because of you, Jeong Woo....

643
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,220
will ultimately be covered all over with wounds.

644
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,780
You don't even have the ability to help ...

645
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,980
Disappear immediately!

646
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:04,340
Don't act like you're going to leave, but disappear immediately!

647
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,420
DISAPPEAR!

648
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,310
Disappear! I told you to get lost!

649
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,630
Let go! LET GO!

650
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,280
Noona.

651
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,250
What should I do?

652
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,010
What will happen to me if Jeong Woo leaves?

653
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,140
You...

654
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:02,980
are you saying all the things that you earned

655
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,930
by putting such hard effort into them,

656
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,450
is that what you're saying?

657
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,490
It doesn't matter.

658
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:15,300
Yes! If you take away your investment funds,
I may crumple at this point.

659
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,820
I may not be able to get back on my feet!

660
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,450
But just because of that, I can't exchange my marriage

661
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,100
for your money.

662
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,460
CEO Cha, look at me.

663
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,510
Please save me just once.

664
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,840
The person who can save my Yeo Jin is

665
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,500
only you...

666
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,750
Chairman Guk.

667
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,530
Yeo Jin's leg...

668
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:55,190
happened...

669
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,630
because of me.

670
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,760
So, I'll take care of everything. CEO Cha,

671
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,050
Yeo Jin might say that she's going to die,

672
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:15,790
so please save Yeo Jin one more time, as you did 3 years ago.

673
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,630
If you do that, I'll give you

674
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:22,970
everything I have. If you save my Yeo Jin this once,

675
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,100
I will give you everything.

676
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,030
Please get up, Chairman.

677
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,020
Can't you take pity on this person who can't offer anything but money?

678
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,180
Please take pity just once more!

679
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,830
I am sorry, Chairman.

680
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,410
My decision won't change.

681
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,800
Even if I tell you you will lose everything,

682
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,500
even then?

683
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,850
Yes.

684
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:08,120
♫ I really love you. ♫
