1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,350
Don't you remember?

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,980
Valentine's Day... the day we separated.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,140
"Don't use alimony as an excuse to contact me."

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,120
"Just quietly disappear from my life."

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,300
Don't use alimony as an excuse.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,410
So just quietly... disappear from my life.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,070
That request...

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,910
This time, I'll make it.

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,170
So just quietly disappear from my life,

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,400
Na Ae Ra.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,820
Even if money made you come back to me,

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,090
that wouldn't be love.

13
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,050
You...

14
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,420
"Once you were out of my life,
my life took a turn for the better?"

15
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,070
What a jerk with no sense of loyalty.

16
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,030
Who asked you for money?

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,050
At least, say sorry for how hard you
made my life back then.

18
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,630
You should at least have said thank you.

19
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,370
Stop! Stop it!

20
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,520
Aren't we husband and wife?

21
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,850
Didn't we promise to stand by each other
through thick and thin?
- No...

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,360
To me, the terms "husband and wife" apply only when
you give me a good life.

23
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,730
Not when I have to put the food on the table.

24
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,890
Get through the hard times on your own.

25
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,790
Don't take me down with you.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,020
I have people who are interested in investing in my product,
and the response has been great.

27
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,110
If everything works out...
-Stop it! Stop it!

28
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,770
Until when are you going to be in the product development stages?

29
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,960
Are you just going to come up with product ideas
for the rest of your life?

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,620
4 years is enough.

31
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,440
There's no more hope.

32
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,660
I can't live like this anymore.

33
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,810
Weren't we a couple?

34
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,910
Didn't we promise to live together through good times and bad-
-No.

35
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,560
To me, the term "married couple" only applies when you are capable of supporting me.

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,050
Not when I had to feed you.

37
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,060
Go through the hard times by yourself.
Don't drag me down with you.

38
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,740
Now,

39
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,390
is it all over?

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,240
Done?! If he treats me like this...

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,550
I can't just stay still.

42
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,520
And if you can't stay still?

43
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
I have to give it back.

44
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,050
He put me through all that hardship,
yet he refuses to acknowledge it!

45
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,270
It's despicable!

46
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,430
I should have my revenge.

47
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,800
You? How?

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,320
Huh?

49
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,970
[Temptation of wife?]
(TV: female lead takes on new identity and comes back to seduce ex-husband as part of revenge)

50
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,330
I have to woo him back.

51
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,070
What?

52
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,420
You... are Na Ae Ra?

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,690
You idiot. You don't even recognize me
after living together for 4 years?

54
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,890
Just because of a mole?

55
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,000
Na Ae Ra!

56
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,900
Why are you doing this to me?

57
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,830
What do you mean why?

58
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,280
Because it's unfair and frustrating.

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,790
You researched with the money I earned,
but you hid the fact that you got an investment?

60
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,750
Because of you, for three years after we got divorced,

61
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,440
I had to repay the money I borrowed.

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,640
To pay the loans, I lived raggedly.
And you dare to tell me...

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,600
to disappear from your life?!

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Am I a candle that can be put out like that?

65
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,830
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,260
I was blinded by money.

67
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,810
Please spare me. Please.

68
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,930
It's already too late.

69
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,610
After I take him down that way...

70
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,280
You said your business flopped and
you acted sad and desperate, but...

71
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,940
was it a ploy to fly-by-night (eat and run)?

72
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,410
No, that's not true.

73
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,420
No, really, it's not true.

74
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,530
You... You had investors but hid it from me
on purpose, didn't you?

75
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,880
So you could live well-off alone?

76
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,170
No, that's not true. I'm serious.

77
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,820
"Don't hate me too much."

78
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,750
"Sorry for making you suffer all this time."

79
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,040
If you had said that,

80
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,320
I wouldn't have gone this far.

81
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,470
Throw him away.

82
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,930
That's how you do away with

83
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,480
a traitor.

84
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,650
Are you filming a movie?

85
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,840
I understand how you feel,

86
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,750
but you should seek revenge in a realistic way.

87
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,530
Like you said, if you want to woo him back
just so you could slam him down,

88
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,670
first you need to at least meet him again.

89
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,700
But do you think Jung Woo is an easy person to meet?

90
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,930
He's so famous now.

91
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,300
Will he even meet with you?

92
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,490
I have to meet him, no matter what.

93
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,760
Every day.

Not this. Look below.

100
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,440
Do you not see this?

101
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,730
They are looking for talented individuals, not you.

102
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,070
The resumes of the people who are applying are no joke.

103
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,190
People from Seoul University, Yonsei and Korea University...

104
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,480
It's like that!

Someone who is experienced in the marketing field.

119
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,950
Right, I guess you could call it marketing...

Hey!

Man, I've worked hard!

Ae Ra, you've done a lot. Good job.

129

Cha Jeong Woo, just wait.

130
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,450
Hobbies are piano, golf, horseback riding.

131
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,370
If they're expensive hobbies, will it give a negative impression?

132
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,570
It's your first impression to the company people.

133
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,020
Ahjussi, I'll do it.

134
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,730

In terms of price, option C.

141
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,530
In terms of quality, option A and B.

142
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,100
As for reputation, option C was the highest.

143
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,220
These are the findings from my research thus far.

144
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,140
Supervisor Kang, is that really the best option?

145
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,070
Oh yes, that is...for now...

146
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,970
If you start to consider the quality and the
competitiveness of the price...

147
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,810
Strangely, it always comes down to these three things.

148
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,780
What do you think, Pi Song Hee?

149
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,630
I think that C would be better than A.

150
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,280
It goes with the healthy-food trend,
and C has received the best reviews.

151
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,740

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,030
If I think of my wife and family that are far away,
I dare not (spend more than $6 for lunch).

159
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,970
You know well.

160
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,600
Supervisor Kang, stop making it so noticeable that you're a "goose daddy."
(dads who send their wife and kids overseas.)

161
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,670
I'll pay anything over $6. Then it's fine, right?

162
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,000
Thank you.

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,030
Let's quickly eat and come back.

164
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,290
I have to conduct interviews starting at 1pm.

165
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,980
Oh right...today is the day of interviews.

166
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,770
How might the "water quality" of the kids be these days?

167
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,240
"Water quality"?

168
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,350
Is the company some kind of night club?
("Water quality" = attractiveness of people at the club)

169
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,010
Let's go.

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,970
Miss Hyun Ji Won?
- Yes.

171
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,220
Mr. Jang So Won?
- Yes.

172
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,320
Miss Na Ae Ra?

173
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,890
Yes.

174
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,500
Guk Seung Hyeon?

175
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,220
Guk Seung Hyeon?

176
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,430
Here!

177
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,750
Come in.

178
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,540
Miss Na Ae Ra, you have a lot of experience.

179
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,560
Product promotion? You must have worked
a while for a promotional team.

180
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,600
I worked along... side someone who worked
many years in a promotional team.

181
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,140
I was trained by that person and promoted various products.

182
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,440
Cell phones for elementary students,
at a price of $19 a month!

183
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,640
Thank you!

184
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,180
Free phones for the elderly, just for today!

185
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,880
The dumplings stuffed with
100% Korean produced pork is on a 1+1 sale.

186
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,270
Please try some.

187
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,950
Hey, that's so great.
It's tasty.

188
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,640
Hey, it's pretty tasty.

189
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,130
The realization that sharing with others could be so rewarding...

190
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,190
is the greatest reward that I received while working.

191
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,990
You speak quite well. Um...

192
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,710
Then what you did most recently was a shopping coordinator.

193
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,910
Is that it? Where you recommended products to customers?

194
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,150
Yes. It is.

195
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,850
Oh, then using your experience,

196
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,480
can you recommend the fashion item that will suit me?

197
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,690
If you want to do that you'll have to grasp what type of
person I am first, correct?

198
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,490
You're a person who grasps well what suits yourself.

199
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,490
You're a wise person.

200
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,570
While you're slightly covering your neck wrinkles with
your scarf, it also acts as the focal point.

201
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,860
You've overcome your physical flaw with the perfect accessory.

202
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,640
I think that your fashion sense is different than anyone else's.

203
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,870
One more.

204
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,450
With that long supple neck very like a deer, you're showing exactly 1/4 of it.

205
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,700
The attractiveness of that partially concealed exposure,

206
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,210
attracts a man's attention even more.

207
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,450
You're a person with a strategic fashion sense.

208
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,820
They say that if you look at a person's shoes that you
can know that person.

209
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,490
With a simple line that shows well the eye-catching corsage.

210
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,970
Yes, you seem like a person that has many ideas.

211
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,930
That's not all.

212
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,760
Color. By selecting a bold color,

213
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,650
even in a dull situation you're one who knows how
to show your presence.

214
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,490
You're a sincere fashionista.

215
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,030
Ms. Na Ae Ra.

216
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,620
Looking at your experience, in a short time you've had
a number of jobs.

217
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,040
What is the reason for switching jobs so frequently?

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,900
Should I say that,

219
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,000
'I wanted to experience a wider world?'

220
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,990
Truthfully, I'm not sure how the experiences
that you've listed here

221
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,460
will help you at this company.

222
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,250
How your experiences will be to your advantage,

223
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,330
will you explain that?

224
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,560
I've worked two jobs and three jobs, so

225
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,780
that's why I've built a lot of experience in such a short period.

226
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,890
It's because I'm not wealthy.

227
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,630
People who buy discount coupons on the internet via social commerce,

228
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,170
and people who use those coupons to go to restaurants...

229
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,810
or buy products, will all have the same heart.

230
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,760
With a small amount of money, they want to eat with grace.

231
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,440
They want to buy good products, don't you think so?

232
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,740
Because I wasn't rich, I had to live frugally.
Therefore,

233
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,550
I think I know more than anyone the minds of the
customers who

234
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,330
utilize social networks.

235
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,560
Hey, you!

236
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,250
Yes, you.

237
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,960
Why did you keep "snorting" while someone else was speaking?

238
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,410
Me?

239
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,470
I was admiring you because you spoke so well.

240
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,770
Do you "psh, peu, prrh" when you find something admirable?

241
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,830
I almost ruined my interview because it got on my nerves.

242
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,560
And...why did you continue to just ride my coattails?

243
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,140
Putting your spoon right down on top of the meal table
that I prepared.

244
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,740
Are you really going to be like this?

245
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,240
No matter how hard it is to get a job these days,
let's not live like this.

246
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,470
Pretty.

247
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,500
What did you say?

248
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,480
It's pretty.

249
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,550
That.

250
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,880
Hey, is it correct that you came here for a job interview?

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,490
Yes.

252
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,700
But you're hitting on me?

253
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,830
Is employment a joke to you? Do you by chance
have a higher up person who has your back?

254
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,030
Get your head on straight.

255
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,760
He's acting like a stranger.

256
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,360
Are they all like that once they become successful?

257
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,470
You were very surprised, weren't you?

258
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,460
They say that one million young adults
are unemployed these days.

259
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,270
I was more concerned about my livelihood
than my pride.

260
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,280
There are many companies out there.

261
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,270
Why did it have to be mine?

262
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,170
You know that...

263
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,640
I don't have any special skills, education or connections.

264
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,630
With other companies, I can't even get past
the application review.

265
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,310
As soon as I gain intern experience here,
I'll go to another company.

266
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,560
It won't take long.

267
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,820
That's your problem.

268
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,760
I don't want to see you ever again.
Just know that.

269
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,350
Can't you be more of a man?

270
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,900
Don't let personal feelings affect how you manage your company.

271
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,560
You're not that kind of person.

272
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,240
He's falling for it. He's falling...

273
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,200
Three...two..

274
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,410
I don't want to.

275
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,730
What?

276
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,310
What do you want me to do?
Kneel at your feet?

277
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,090
Sure, why not.

278
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,600
Why? You can't do it?

279
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,020
Kneel. Come on. Kneel.

280
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,580
That's what knees are for. Please.

281
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,510
Why that..that..

282
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,370
I would like to pick people we can
put to work right away.

283
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,620
What do you think Team Leader Wang?
Anyone you liked?

284
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,790
Whoever you pick, Director,

285
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,050
I only trust and follow your lead.

286
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,490
The interns will be working under you, so
you should give me your opinion.

287
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,000
If you insist.

288
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,280
Our team deals with marketing, so

289
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,860
looks are important. Keeping that in mind,
never mind women interns.

290
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,520
How about a male intern?

291
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,740
Director, who did you like?

292
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,770
I think it was a good decision to do away with
schooling or age.

293
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,110
Please make a list based on their scores
and send it up to the head secretary.

294
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,640
And tell him that we'll be waiting for the CEO's final approval.

295
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,450
Yes, Director.

296
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,370
What's with the orchids?

297
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,280
Tae Wan hyung sent it.

298
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,620
Why would he send this?

299
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,470
Out of old friendship, I guess, he was one of the founding members of this company.

300
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,890
Ah, that hyung is so unlucky.

301
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,240
If he had stayed longer, he would've been the Co-CEO.

302
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,840
He just couldn't wait a little more and
had to go work at a big corporation.

303
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,670
But, Tae Ho hyung,

304
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,020
I think he wants to come back to our company.

305
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,930
With whose permission? Who says I'll accept him?!

306
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,400
Go tell him.

307
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,740
You have to work through the hardships together.

308
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,490
Only then, you get to enjoy the fruit of success.

309
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,430
I know, right?

310
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,090
That hyung knew that you value trust and promise.

311
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,260
He knew that you placed great emphasis on those things.

312
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,280
By the way, this is the list of possible interns.

313
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,660
Na Ae Ra, Resume

314
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,340
I'm screwed! Screwed!

315
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,010
Why didn't you listen to me?

316
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,000
Ouch.

317
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,700
Does Jeong Woo know that you went to the interview?

318
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,100
I met him.

319
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,150
Really?

320
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,400
So did you kneel and beg?

321
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,010
Yeah I did, and I made sure to look pretty sad and pitiful.

322
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,660
Did it work?

323
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,120
Cha Jeong Woo changed a lot.

324
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,060
He used to be a country bumpkin who
didn't know how to reject.

325
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,880
But now, he's become tough as nails.

326
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,410
He wouldn't even bleed if you stabbed him.

327
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,440
A human isn't a human if he doesn't change.

328
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,500
What did I do while he was doing so well?

329
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,210
My life has been a waste.

330
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,210
A waste?

331
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,310
There's no one that's lived as dynamically as you!

332
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,570
Eat this! Eat this and die... no, eat this and forget about it.

333
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,820
Oh, it's big!

334
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,590
And that company doesn't suit you anyway.

335
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,800
I know.

336
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,250
That's the reality.

337
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,890
Hyungnim!

338
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,660
Oh, you're here?

339
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,940
There's a great guy, so I wanted to set her up.

340
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,090
I'm talking about Ae Ra!

341
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,830
I'll forget about it if you don't approve,
but at least let me tell you the details.

342
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,980
What is it?

343
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,770
First, he's a government employee and has his own house.

344
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,360
He's a really nice man and divorced three years.

345
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,270
But he has two kids.

346
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,390
But those kids are also really nice!

347
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,510
The younger one is in kindergarten and
well mannered.

348
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,290
You should talk about that

349
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,300
after you hear about my ex-son-in-law.

350
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,080
Businessman of the Year!

351
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,500
The man who women want to date the most.

352
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,730
This kind of person used to be my son-in-law!

353
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,070
I mean... I was just wondering if you'd be interested...

354
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,640
Then I'll be leaving.

355
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,140
Okay.

356
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,250
Aigoo. Do you know how Ae Ra suffered because of him?

357
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,320
Don't be like that and look here.

358
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,830
Look. The most eligible businessman.

359
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,750
He's still single!

360
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,850
He doesn't have a woman!

361
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,100
Aigoo. Stop dreaming!

362
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,900
Why would this successful man date Ae Ra again?

363
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,740
Aigoo, move. You have such big dreams.

364
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,910
But...

365
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:12,800
one of the joys in life is that you never know
what's waiting for you around the corner!

366
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,400
You majored in early childhood education?

367
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,300
Yes.

368
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,600
But you have no experience as a preschool teacher.

369
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,320
That is because I dropped out midway.

370
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,390
Wait...

371
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,030
What's this?

372
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,700
Excuse me?

373
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,800
You drew a triangle under "marital status."

374
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,000
Ah yes, because... I was and then wasn't married.

375
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,200
I'm sorry,

376
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,700
I'd get in trouble if I recommend a divorcee
for a preschool teacher position.

377
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,200
The mothers dislike divorcees and think
it will hurt their children's education.

378
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,920
Did you marry?

379
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,450
Not yet..

380
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,700
Who is this?

381
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,860
Yes, it's me. Why?

382
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,200
What?

383
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,750
Really?

384
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
Ahjussi!

385
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,220
Can you just hit me once?

386
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,370
Huh?

387
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,010
Hit me!

388
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,060
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

389
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,600
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

390
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,630
Yay! I did it!

391
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,180
Ahjussi!

392
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,770
Come on and hit me!

393
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,310
Wow, that's amazing.

394
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,020
How did you get in, even as an intern?

395
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,100
You should've seen me during the interview!

396
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,910
I was so great and spoke so well.

397
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,670
Geez, you're exaggerating.
Anyway, congratulations!

398
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,770
But didn't you say Jeong Woo cut you out
right away?

399
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,600
What happened?

400
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,150
Do you think he felt sorry for you and helped you out a little?

401
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,480
Do you think so?

402
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,120
You're right...

403
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,500
[ The night of Ae Ra's interview ]

404
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,520
Then what should I do? Kneel?

405
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,690
Sure. Why not.

406
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,120
Why?

407
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,150
You can't?

408
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,050
[ She is eating lunch all alone. ]

409
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,600
Oh...

410
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,330
That woman.

411
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,250
The winner will get the chance to date a man of her choice.

412
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,250
Ready, get set...

413
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,640
Run, run, run.

414
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,510
Run!

415
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,600
What are you doing?

416
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,700
Are you watching something erotic?

417
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,460
Let me watch, too.

418
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,170
I was happy.

419
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,840
The happiness you get from having someone
who looks after you.

420
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,390
It was something

421
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,100
I hadn't experienced in a really long time.
That woman. What's wrong with her?

422
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,200
Who cares?

423
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,330
During marriage,

424
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,380
Are you really okay, CEO?

425
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,430
It was very hard on me.

426
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,100
Of course.

427
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,450
It's fine as long as she doesn't curse me.

428
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,500
Why did I have to meet someone like that?

429
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,930
Even in my next life, I never want to
meet my ex-husband.

430
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,680
Now...

431
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,560
I want to be happy from now on.

432
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,300
Here's to hoping she finds happiness.

433
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,800
Even in my next life, I don't ever want to meet my ex-husband.

434
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,620
Once you set a goal, you should go for it
with everything you've got,

435
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,960
prepared to face death if you don't meet your goal.

436
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
But you,

437
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,150
you lack concentration at the end.

438
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,050
Even though I taught you everything.

439
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,000
I'll do better.

440
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,500
Okay, give it a try.

441
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,880
I am sorry.

442
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,190
Whoa! How exciting!

443
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,650
Father, I made it.

444
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,900
What's with this?

445
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,770
We should have a party to celebrate.

446
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,600
A party? That's nonsense.

447
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,190
"Well done. I'm so proud of you."

448
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,520
"You give me a taste for life."

449
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,350
You should give me those kinds of praises.

450
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,520
Who do you take after to want praise?

451
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,670
Am I Hong Kil Dong or something?
(Robin Hood-like fictional character who was born as an illegitimate son.)

452
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,370
Why can't I call my own father as "father"
and can't call my sister as "sister"?

453
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,240
It was your idea for me to keep my mouth shut at work, wasn't it?

454
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,700
If you get preferential treatment from the beginning,
you can't learn the job properly.

455
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,570
Of course, that's right.

456
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,890
But can it be kept a secret even if we try?

457
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,940
Especially me, even if I do nothing,
I give off air of wealth.

458
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,380
To hide that I'm a rich kid, it's really hard.

459
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,600
Don't cause any accidents, and just hold on for three months.

460
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,660
Once you complete the internship, I can appoint you
as the Team Leader of the design team.

461
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,430
Noona!

462
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,550
You can let me off 100 meters away.

463
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,350
Find your own way.

464
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,900
That kind of strictness.

465
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,870
Fine.

466
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,400
That'll make it easier for me to cause trouble.

467
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,050
In any case, I have to make them give up
on me within my three month internship.

468
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,410
I'm so not the office type.

469
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,600
I passed!

470
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Why would the CEO, who's such a kind man,

471
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,650
not have a girlfriend?

472
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,220
Does he have time to have one?

473
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,400
He doesn't do anything else but
work, sleep, and eat here.

474
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,890
In any case,

475
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,170
it's a real mystery why he's been alone
for three years after his divorce.

476
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,730
Right?

477
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:33,320
Then, it might be a good idea to
find someone within the company.

478
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,960
What's so cool about him?

479
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,110
Are you talking about the CEO right now?

480
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,650
No, I'm not.

481
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,650
I was just thinking about someone in my head.

482
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,190
It definitely wasn't the CEO.

483
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,220
Now, now, please gather 'round.

484
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,160
I'll give the introductions.

485
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Here we have Edward, which is his English name.

486
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,660
His Korean name is Guk Seung Hyeon.

487
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,400
I'm Guk Seung Hyeon. I look forward to working with you.

488
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,470
I'm Team Manager Wang Ji Hyeon.

489
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,520
You gave a lasting impression at your interview.

490
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,730
Same here.

491
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,390
Your style and figure are amazing.

492
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,700
Over here, we have Na Ae Ra.

493
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,670
Hello, I'm Na Ae Ra. I look forward to working with you.

494
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,640
How old is she?

495
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,700
I don't know.

496
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,100
Maybe her early thirties?

497
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm going crazy. What am I supposed to do when the new employee is 10 years older than her seniors?

498
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,700
So that for the next 3 months the new interns can adjust well,

499
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,060
I ask for your help.

500
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,580
The training for both of you...

501
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,160
I'll do it.
-Song Hee, you will?

502
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,780
Good. Then Song Hee, take good care of them both.

503
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,110
Yes.

504
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,830
Team Manager.

505
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,750
Isn't it difficult? Here, enjoy.

506
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,050
Team Manager, the new hire training,

507
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,080
being a man myself, I'll train him properly.

508
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,910
Supervisor Kang, just do your work properly.

509
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,600
Instead of spending time buying coffee,

510
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,220
don't you think it would be better to do
the graph projection one more time instead?

511
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,110
Someone younger than me by 5 years is so rotten and disrespectful.

512
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,970
We must be destined. We're on the same team.

513
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,370
And I think that our "breaths" (personality/style) match well.
Let's try our best together.

514
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,910
Look here, Guk Seung Hyeon,

515
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,890
acting so overly friendly seems a bit burdensome.

516
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,860
Really? Then do I have to date you?

517
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,160
Wait a minute.

518
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,350
I'll have to think about that.
Because I'm not that easy.

519
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,780
Geez.

520
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,000
Edward Guk?
It's more like "Egumoni (Oh my gosh)" Guk.

521
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,500
Hey,

522
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,630
what time did you say the new hire orientation was?

523
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,590
Uh, I think it probably started at 10:00.

524
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:31,250
If it's about now, they'll have finished the
introduction to the company and gathered in the lobby.

525
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,120
Why? Do you want to go see?

526
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,270
Me?

527
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,010
Why would I go there?

528
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,490
Just play your game, punk.

529
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,260
Show off.

530
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,560
Lee Young Soo.

531
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,700
Yes.

532
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,170
It's okay, continue with your work.

533
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,640
Please don't mind me, and do your work.

534
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,890
He's smiling?

535
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,830
Is he being conscious of me?

536
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:38,940
♫ Mirror, mirror, on the wall, whom does that person like? ♫

537
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,800
♫ Heavens, oh heavens, who is that person thinking of, ♫

538
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,110
♫ I'm curious because I'm not quite sure
I know the meaning behind your glances ♫

539
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:54,210
♫ From now on you and I, shall we try to learn about each other? ♫

540
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,080
♫ Mirror, mirror, on the wall, whom does that person like? ♫

541
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,550
♫ Heavens, oh heavens, who is that person thinking of, ♫

542
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,030
Why did he ask us to be here?

543
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,380
I know, right? The CEO is strange.

544
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,400
He's usually a person that hates these types of things.

545
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,830
♫ From now on you and I,
shall we try to learn about each other? ♫

546
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,290
Where are we going?

547
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,570
I said we were going to eat.

548
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,600
When you're just going to eat,
why make all the secretaries stand there?

549
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,100
Can't I greet the secretaries when I'm going to eat?

550
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
Good grief.

551
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,800
Yes?

552
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,620
I understand.

553
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,000
Turn the car around. Go back to the office.

554
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,170
We're not sure yet if they're trying to paralyze the system,

555
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,500
or if the objective is to pull out information.
We're not sure as of yet.

556
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,010
Even if they can't control our system remotely,
we need to be prepared for a worst-case scenario.

557
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,040
By using a Zombie PC, they can switch accounts back and forth and...

558
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,080
they can attack us unexpectedly.

559
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,300
Stay on watch for a full 24 hours changing shifts, and...

560
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,420
check the antivirus programs again.

561
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,600
Yes, I understand.

562
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,410
But, perhaps...

563
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,920
could someone inside the company...

564
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,120
I trust our employees.

565
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,070
Stop any internal investigations.

566
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,310
Cha Jeong Woo wavered. He's definitely wavering.

567
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,190
Aiyoo, even your dreams are notable.

568
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,580
Are you two celebrities that broke up after playing
around for 6 months?

569
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,290
You both saw everything there was to see.

570
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,160
You split up after saying that you
wouldn't see each other anymore on pain of death.

571
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,210
Do you think he'd waver because you showed a few tears?

572
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,270
You always take it the way that's comfortable for you.

573
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,130
I'm not.

574
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,440
When I first saw him, how cold was the wind that blew?

575
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,810
Compared to that, it's completely warm now.

576
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,500
Today as he passed by, he gave me a noticeable smile.

577
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,060
He lived by himself for three years,

578
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,300
and he doesn't have a lover.

579
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,200
By any chance,

580
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,420
are you dreaming of something big?

581
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,390
About being the wife of a CEO.

582
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,650
Only if he'll give me a chance.

583
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,380
What are you doing here?

584
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,710
I'm sorry.

585
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,810
This was the only place I could find to work...

586
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,490
The lengths I'll go to earn a living...

587
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,480
I'll stop working anyway.

588
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,220
I don't want to make you worry.

589
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,970
First I'll throw a jab,

590
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,110
then take a step back.
Then...

591
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,200
Don't worry about someone like me.

592
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,400
I'm fine. Just go.

593
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,080
What do you mean, you're fine?

594
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,060
This won't work.

595
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,670
Let's go to the hospital.

596
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,010
Don't cry.

597
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,470
I said, don't cry!

598
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,610
That's right.

599
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,990
Jeong Woo is really nice.

600
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,720
Even though you're strangers now,
he still gave you alimony.

601
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,520
You wanna die?

602
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,940
I.. feel like he's going to fall for you again.

603
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,040
He's pitiful.

604
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,190
Who... ?! Who's pitiful?!

605
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,730
Are you really going to say things like that?

606
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,640
Hey, you bad girl...

607
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,310
What are you doing, calling me out
in the middle of the night?

608
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,860
Your mind is elsewhere, and it's ruining the fun.

609
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,850
Here.

610
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:15,640
Why? Is there something wrong?

611
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,450
Just...

612
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,360
returning home makes me think about the old days.

613
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,980
The old days?

614
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,630
You're student Cha Jeong Woo, right?

615
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,910
Go to the second floor.

616
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,130
Solve it.

617
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,360
Middle School Math Olympiad

618
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,040
You're good.

619
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,590
Pass!

620
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,350
I thought then...

621
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,370
that you would get mad and leave if I did that.

622
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,970
I did get mad,

623
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,980
but my competitive spirit soared!

624
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,310
Still, how could an adult...

625
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,360
teach a kid judo while beating him around?

626
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,630
Hey,

627
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,530
back then, you were a complete mess!

628
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,510
What? You want to go again?

629
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,730
I'm not letting you off easily this time!

630
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,170
Look at you!

631
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,060
You won't regret this?

632
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,540
You haven't had enough beatings, huh?

633
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,730
You're here?

634
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,090
Yes, hello...

635
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,510
Su-Sunbaenim...

636
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:56,210
Yes, and a good morning to the hoobae.

637
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,440
I was waiting for you!

638
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,540
There's something that you must do!

639
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,800
Oh.. Ae Ra!

640
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,850
It's fine... It's fine. I'm almost done...

641
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,270
You don't have to help me.

642
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,630
Wow, Ae Ra! You're really strong!

643
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,410
You're different from how you look!
You're the best!

644
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,050
Good job.

645
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,170
Wow, you are really amazing!

646
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,190
I think you have talent for this.

647
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,960
From now on, you're in charge of water.

648
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,180
Yes?

649
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,670
I thought you were going to do it yourself
so I didn't tell you and left, but

650
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,320
you didn't wash the team's mugs on their desks.

651
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,540
Mine's fine.

652
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,110
Just think of me as a comfortable person.

653
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,360
Yes.

654
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,410
Ah, when you get done with all of that,

655
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,330
I'd appreciate it if you'd buy me a pair of stockings.

656
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,260
Coffee colored.

657
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,600
Huh?

658
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,730
Ah... yes.

659
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,730
I have to go meet a client,
but the presentation isn't done yet.

660
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,280
There's a convenience store near here.

661
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,240
Then, I'll leave it to you

662
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,380
Why is she ordering around in multiple levels?

663
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,990
Ah, sorry.

664
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,750
This is supposed to be my work.

665
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,350
Ah, it's okay. We can do it together.

666
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,050
Thanks.

667
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,100
Seung Hyun!

668
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,490
Seung Hyun!

669
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,470
I'm saying this to you because I'm worried about
you and I think of you as a dongsaeng (younger brother).

670
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,760
You should act like a new employee.

671
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,970
Come thirty minutes early,

672
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,240
and if there are cups or anything, clean them well.

673
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,860
If the water cooler is empty,

674
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,100
have the sense to change it out.

675
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,790
Shouldn't you be like that?

676
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:03,550
A new employee who drinks expensive coffee
and coming in exactly on time,

677
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,040
who's going to like you?

678
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,390
Yes.

679
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,290
Do you think I'm joking right now?

680
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,670
No.

681
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:14,110
My heart is fluttering.

682
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,150
Because you're worrying so much about me, in the morning.

683
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,220
Do you think I came here to do your stocking errands?

684
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,410
Cha Jeong Woo... I can't even talk to him, let alone seduce him.

685
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,710
But why did he accept me?

686
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,930
He definitely looked as if he was going to flunk me.

687
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,180
He has it, he does.

688
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,440
Even if he talked so rudely,

689
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,440
he still has feelings left for me.

690
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,520
Wait,

691
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,450
this isn't the time for me to be doing this.

692
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,980
If I can't meet him coincidently,

693
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,770
I'll make a reason to meet.

694
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,790
I have something to say.

695
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,440
Can you meet me for a moment?

696
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,610
Oh, did you come?

697
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,830
Tell me what you need to say.

698
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,450
Are you really busy?

699
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,270
I was thinking of going to your office,

700
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,780
but people are watching, so ...

701
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,040
Oh, you're here.

702
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,210
Don't come closer. Stay there.

703
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,950
You must have forgotten, but...

704
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,850
I'm a CEO and you're an intern.

705
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,870
We can't be talking one on one inside the company.

706
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,260
Yeah.

707
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,270
I understand. I'll just get to the point.

708
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,270
First, thanks for accepting me.

709
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,370
I wanted to say that.

710
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:39,030
You don't need to be thankful!

711
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,720
I think you're mistaken,

712
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,310
but I'm not in charge of accepting mere interns.

713
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,390
It's not like it's an important position.

714
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,000
I'm not someone with that much leisure time.

715
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,290
Anyway, thanks.

716
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,770
If your done talking, then..

717
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,010
Wait! Wait! Wait!

718
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,220
Ah, what now?

719
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,980
While I'm working at this company,

720
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,820
people might be able to find out about our relationship.

721
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,990
I'm concerned about what we should do then.

722
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,920
That won't come out of my mouth, so you be careful.

723
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,450
Because I don't want there to be useless misunderstandings.

724
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,400
Don't worry. I will never tell
anyone that I got divorced from you.

725
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,700
I'll never even mention that I know you.

726
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,900
I will zip my lips.

727
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,390
Okay.

728
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,570
It'll be hard for you to keep coming here if people know about us.

729
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,520
So please take caution.

730
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,620
Wa-Wa-Wait!

731
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:47,100
That jerk.

732
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,390
Mistake. A mistake. Mistake!

733
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,900
I shouldn't have gone when that mere intern called me.

734
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,130
I tripped up...

735
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,900
That number,

736
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,750
delete it.
- What?

737
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,690
Mom! Big news!

738
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,810
Big news! Big news!

739
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,370
Na Ae Ra,

740
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:22,070
at son-in-law Cha's company...
-Did she start a fire there?

741
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,800
Hey, Honey...

742
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,490
That's possible when you really hate someone.

743
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,480
She found a job there!

744
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,570
Really?
- Yes.

745
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,400
What is happening?

746
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,950
Why are you making a fuss?

747
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,540
When the whole world is screaming for peace,

748
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,500
our Ae Ra and son-in-law Cha

749
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,580
are working towards peace.

750
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,750
He didn't show any signs of that when I met him.

751
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,790
Huh? Who did you see? Son-in-law Cha?

752
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,200
No, no, no, no!

753
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,950
I meant, I read it in an article, an article he did an interview for.

754
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,820
And here I thought...

755
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,760
I should give Ae Ra a call.

756
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,580
You take care of this.

757
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,270
Son-in-law Cha...

758
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,080
never wanted to break up with her.

759
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,680
Ae Ra, that girl,

760
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,770
she coerced him.

761
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,990
Father, don't mess with her and just leave her alone.

762
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,210
You don't know what you're talking about.

763
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,560
Don't you know how much greed Ae Ra has?

764
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,460
There's no way she's not regretting
letting the fish swim away.

765
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,370
She just doesn't know how (to get it back).

766
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:36,740
Pecs (chest muscle), come out!

767
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,960
What is family for?
Getting involved as if it were my issue is what family is.

768
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,470
What have you done for her as an older brother?

769
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,530
Wait a moment.

770
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,220
I should have his phone number somewhere.

771
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,620
Dad, what are you doing?

772
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,670
Ah. This bastard!

773
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,270
I should at least congratulate him.

774
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:07,750
"I'm so happy that you're doing so well. It's great."

775
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,070
No, father.
He'll take it as if...

776
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,720
you're hoping to get something out of him.

777
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,190
Aish, this kid.

778
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:18,230
A man needs to have determination.

779
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,630
Oh yeah?

780
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,680
It's an unavailable number.

781
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,330
Where are we eating?

782
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,730
Out front, there is a really good pork belly restaurant.

783
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,750
It's amazing!

784
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,910
Thanks.

785
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,900
Wait, let's go together.

786
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,640
Now, on behalf of our little chick interns!

787
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,580
Cheers!!

788
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,250
Did you come to our company because you fell for our CEO, too?

789
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,950
Like Song Hee?

790
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,470
Excuse me? No.

791
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,700
You have one less rival. Congratulations, Song Hee!

792
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,500
How's Na Ae Ra my rival?

793
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,620
Would the CEO even look at her

794
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,330
if a person like her liked him?

795
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:35,830
This kid doesn't even know anything.

796
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:38,290
Look carefully, all the women employees

797
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
are the CEO's fans!

798
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,290
The whole company is his fan club!

799
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,670
Is it just our company's women employees?

800
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,460
At some marriage matching company,

801
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,970
our CEO was picked as the number 1
guy whom women want to marry.

802
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,360
A divorcee earning the #1 place while beating the bachelors, means...

803
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,110
that wealth is important in men.

804
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,160
The CEO's looks are perfect, too!

805
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,890
When I saw him walking across the lobby, my heart "bounced, bounced!"

806
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:08,310
But what kind of person is the ex-wife

807
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,910
of our handsome CEO?

808
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,190
The CEO probably dumped her.

809
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:20,490
The rumor is that his ex-wife did
something to make him divorce her.

810
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:24,620
You heard, too? That's top secret!

811
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,800
What is it?

812
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,730
Come closer!

813
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:34,530
My mom's friend's son heard directly
from an alumnus who knows the CEO.

814
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,570
The reason for the divorce was

815
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,440
that his ex-wife

816
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,420
had an affair.

817
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,750
An affair?

818
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,260
The husband is working himself to death,

819
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,240
and the woman was lonely and had an affair, that's what.

820
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,450
I feel bad for the President.

821
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,860
On top of that,

822
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,870
that woman loved Go-Stop!

823
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,940
She gambled away all the research money,

824
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,410
and even lost the house deposit.

825
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Wow, and that habit can't be fixed.

826
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,640
I don't know anything, but

827
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,440
from what I heard...

828
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:21,570
she's really ugly!

829
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,740
Awesome.

830
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,210
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo!

831
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,750
If you're going to be like that, I can't sit still.

832
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,250
I'm going to get revenge.

833
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,380
What are you doing?

834
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,790
Are you drunk?

835
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,220
No. I'm ok.

836
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,580
Are you going to be okay?

837
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,720
But do you know the President well?

838
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,950
Excuse me?
- Just now you were talking as if you knew him.

839
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,390
Oh, President Cha Jeong Woo?

840
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:28,570
I know him so well-- no, no...

841
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:32,350
This isn't the time for this. I don't have time for this.

842
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:36,140
Will you be okay?
- I'll be fine. Go in.

843
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:58,400
That jerk! I won't leave him alone.

844
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,770
Keep a good eye on Seung Hyeon.

845
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,360
Yes.

846
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,090
I'm thinking about all the possibilities.

847
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,520
While saying that he's going to work,

848
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,100
he could secretly leave the country, or...
- It's not that.

849
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,360
I'm saying that he's not the type to just play around.

850
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:33,430
He's my child, he can't take only after his mother.

851
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,960
Ah, yes.

852
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,880
There's got to be some part of him that takes after me.

853
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,430
There's got to be a serious side to him.

854
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,460
What about the company?

855
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,840
Since you decided to work for the company,

856
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,970
do it properly, okay?

857
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:11,460
I don't have any thoughts of fitting in.

858
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,410
I'm only doing this because with
Father jumping up and down,

859
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:16,820
his anger might spill over to Mom.

860
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,460
During my three month internship,

861
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,480
I'm only looking for a way to get kicked out.

862
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,020
Just try it. Let's talk after you try.

863
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:32,220
Hurry and leave for work.

864
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,780
What?

865
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,720
Did you confirm it on the CCTV?

866
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,540
That... I was going to confirm it...

867
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,870
But there are no records between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM.

868
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,980
Does that make sense..?

869
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:00,010
The culprit stole the paperwork and
deleted the CCTV recordings before he left...

870
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,040
I believe.

871
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,510
Not everyone could enter our client data room.

872
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:10,100
You can't even enter that level
unless you're an employee.

873
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,690
Who was the last person that entered?

874
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,200
Na Ae Ra, please come with us.

875
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,230
What?

876
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:46,860
♫ What do I do? What do I do? ♫

877
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:52,480
♫ You are the reason I live ♫
