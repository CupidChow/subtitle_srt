1
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,100
N-Na Ae-Ae Ra?

2
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,150
Why did you come here... ?

3
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,660
You didn't hear about it? I'm the substitute.

4
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,830
Episode 8

5
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,830
Hey, are you crazy?

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
Do you want to start a rumor about our relationship?

7
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,010
I'm doing this because they told me to!

8
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,450
And the rumor isn't going to start just because of this shoot.
If a rumor was going to start, it would have already!

9
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,570
Hey!

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,450
What?!

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,890
The only crime I have done is accepting the
Marketing Team Leader's plea to do this.

12
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,640
First of all, let's just shoot this and afterwards,
you can do whatever with your CEO status!

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,200
And also, do it with confidence. With confidence.

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,370
Don't you have any confidence?

15
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,470
You shouldn't be talking.

16
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,860
Hey, you, too...

17
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,590
You're not in a place to criticize me.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,310
With confidence! With confidence!

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,820
You're the one who should do it with confidence.

20
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,190
Okay. Superman's girlfriend who's next to him.

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,010
More of a shocked expression!

22
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,490
You're completely shocked at how innovative it is.

23
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,170
Okay... Okay.

24
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,280
And now... our Superman...

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,190
More like a hero!

26
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,580
More overflowing with confidence! Now...

27
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,950
Confidence!

28
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,580
Energy! Energy!

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,350
Okay, this look is great.

30
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,830
You two seem like a 'match made in heaven' as acting partners!

31
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,930
It doesn't seem like it's the first time
you guys are working together.

32
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,910
Ah, here...

33
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,170
Now, enough with this concept.

34
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,370
A little more.

35
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,170
Now, okay. You two,

36
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,630
get closer to each other.

37
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,050
More! More!

38
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,900
Really..

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,110
Stick together!

40
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,480
After you stick together,

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,580
raise one hand over your head

42
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,070
and make a heart! A heart!

43
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,040
Do it.

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,970
Now, look at each other.
Heart ... shoot, shoot, shoot.

45
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,530
Now, together.

46
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,790
Get closer!

47
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,760
You guys are supposed to be in love!

48
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,880
After sticking together,

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,920
put one arm up and make a heart!

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,520
Okay, okay. Heart.

51
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,840
Smile! Smile!
That's right

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,910
Will you smile a bit?

53
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,110
So, we can end this quickly.

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,740
Who should be saying that?

55
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,320
Even a nonexistent affection will grow at this rate.

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,010
Hey, this is my place.

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,920
If you're going to insist on that,
my place was over there!

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,730
Huh?

59
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,510
We're going to rest for a while.

60
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,100
Excuse me.

61
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes. I'm dying.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,860
I want the real Superman to come and take me out of here.

63
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,600
Then, should I stop by on the way from the company?

64
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,340
With some food..

65
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,630
No. Don't come. N..never.

66
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,680
Ah, yes.

67
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,570
I heard the model was changed.

68
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,310
I, too... just got the report.

69
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,520
That's why it's more painful.

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm never doing this again.

71
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,320
Okay.

72
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,380
Then, work hard, and see you tomorrow!

73
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,760
Yes.
-Yes.

74
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,680
If such station occurred ,
you should've reported that to me first!

75
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,810
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,380
I'm just about average.
What is he talking about?

77
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,740
Why does she keep glancing at me?

78
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,080
Anyway, she should do as she's told
so we can hurry up and go home.

79
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,680
Anyhow, she loves taking pictures tremendously.

80
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,540
The two of them were like this, like this.

81
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,990
Like that, and like that!

82
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,290
The concept's like that.

83
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,690
The dinner date with the CEO was Na Ae Ra.

84
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,580
And the CF shoot with the CEO is Na Ae Ra.

85
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,560
At this rate, the CEO and Na Ae Ra
are going to be best friends!

86
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,190
Wait, but if she shoots the CF, is she getting paid for that?

87
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,520
How much is she getting paid? I'm curious.

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,770
Are you that curious about that?

89
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,970
She's not even a professional model,
so how much would she get?

90
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,360
She should be grateful to grab that chance as an intern!

91
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,380
Are you still shooting?

92
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,450
I am starving to death. They didn't give me dinner, either.

93
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,450
The text message that not even Superman can catch!

94
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,980
D&T Soft Ventures will catch it for you!

95
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,860
Yes.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,160
Wow! D&T!

97
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,840
Okay, that pose is great. Keep that pose.

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,010
Since we are late, let's finish up quickly.

99
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,890
Ok, let's start the fan!

100
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,570
Ah, the wind is nice!

101
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,950
Hey! Over there!

102
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,210
He is bleeding a lot.

103
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,930
What should we do? Look at the blood..

104
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,440
Is he okay?

105
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,190
Jeong Woo! Jeong Woo!

106
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,690
What should I do... ?

107
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,080
Is the shooting already over?

108
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,290
We stopped it.
The CEO got into an accident during the shooting.

109
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,430
Huh?

110
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,880
Because of a mild concussion, he's lost consciousness.

111
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,510
We'll have to wait a while for the results.

112
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,780
Then.

113
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,770
You can leave now. I'll stay.

114
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,630
No. He's like this because of me, so I'll stay.

115
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,080
Please bring the CEO's clothes from his house.

116
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,910
Okay. Then I'll come back tomorrow morning.

117
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,190
Large size? Please wait!

118
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,330
She had a miscarriage.

119
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,930
You can go in.

120
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,480
Ae Ra...

121
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,100
Ae Ra...

122
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,190
Ae Ra...

123
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,280
What? Why are you telling me now?

124
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,600
You weren't answering your phone...

125
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,910
How is he?

126
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,910
He still hasn't regained consciousness.

127
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,490
Please contact Secretary Gil.
Tell him that I'm going now.

128
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,220
Secretary Gil is not at the hospital.

129
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,810
Na Ae Ra, the employee that did the shoot
with him at the hospital now.

130
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,520
Who?

131
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,810
Director...

132
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,710
How is the CEO ... doing?

133
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,720
He's still unconscious...

134
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,530
I heard that you stayed here overnight.

135
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,060
Yes..

136
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,600
I'm sorry for making you worry.

137
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,570
It's not your fault,

138
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,380
so you can leave now.

139
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,960
I want to see him regain consciousness ...

140
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,700
Go and work.

141
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,940
I'll stay here now.

142
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,010
Don't worry.

143
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,780
You must be tired. Take my car.

144
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,120
Let's go.

145
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,100
No. I'll be leaving.

146
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,890
Yes. Goodbye.

147
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,760
Are you awake?

148
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,830
This is the hospital.

149
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,410
How long has it been?

150
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,770
It's a relief.

151
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,610
I was worried because
you were unconscious all night.

152
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,100
Were you here watching over me all night?

153
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,740
It's such a relief

154
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,360
that you woke up.

155
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,740
I will park the car at the entrance.

156
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,920
Currently, D&T Software,

157
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,020
due to the success of the new function CEO Cha Jeong Woo developed,

158
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,470
appears on track to rise over their
existing stock price of one billion.

159
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,450
In the near future, we predict that the price will go up.

160
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,800
From the existing Dontalk,

161
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,120
you can think that it
became complete with the new function.

162
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,230
Please move around (be innovative) without stuttering.

163
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,770
The people that end up in crisis are those who
usually think about everything before acting.

164
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,840
The world changes so quickly, even while you're collecting your thoughts.

165
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,500
Your analysis falls behind.

166
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,850
The purpose of your planning is not to predict
but to take action.

167
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,940
The more the situation seems to be uncertain,
let's focus on the present rather than the future.

168
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,010
Those are my thoughts.

169
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,960
There are a lot of costs involved, not just in (software)research and development, but in user research as well.

170
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,410
I know.
But I'm against making profits just from sales.

171
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,410
First, the things that the consumers want ...

172
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,080
I can't ignore that, and it's a basic fundamental of marketing.

173
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,160
You keep saying marketing.

174
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,010
In the future, I'm going to combine all the departments, so designer, engineer, and marketer can develop the product together.

175
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,800
That's how they won't try to use their specialties to stand out, thus we won't be wasting time.

176
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,130
Not wasting time will bring money to the company.

177
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,520
Why do you work with me when our opinions never match?

178
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,180
You have the ability to protect me and
most importantly, I can trust you.

179
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,900
You have a talent at making someone feel weak, suddenly.

180
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,240
We're good partners.

181
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,850
How's your schedule today?

182
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,600
Hoobaenim.

183
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,800
The 'Public Relations' list that you've organized.

184
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh, that. I did that.

185
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,510
Wipe it. So dirty.

186
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,290
Sunbaenim,

187
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,380
can I say something impudent to you?

188
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,430
Huh?

189
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,240
Because it's company's supplies,
it seems you're being wasteful.

190
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,980
What?

191
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,950
Thoughts like "Since it's not mine, it'll be okay if it's just me,"

192
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,610
seems to be the main contributor
to the deteriorating company establishment.

193
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,100
To be honest, you use a lot of glue and paper,

194
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,710
and you always print in color.
I don't think you should do that.

195
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,400
Na Ae Ra.

196
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,960
Director.

197
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,690
That's a good attitude.

198
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,420
I feel guilty as well, when I think about it.

199
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,590
I'll be careful now, since I heard what you said.

200
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,700
I didn't mean it like that..

201
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,180
It's just that... I was thinking that I was the 'owner' of this company...

202
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,320
I wouldn't have to worry
if I only had employees like you.

203
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,100
Today, in preparation to launch the deals on luxury items,

204
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,200
I have a meeting with the contracting party.

205
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,050
I'll assist you.

206
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,150
Since it's something I've been continuously working on,
I've been preparing a lot ...

207
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,180
No.

208
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,480
When I watched you at the interview last time ...
Ae Ra?

209
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,110
Yes?

210
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,080
You have so many shopping coordinator experiences,
how about you take charge of this?

211
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,130
You seem to be the perfect person.

212
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,750
T...that... that's a good idea.

213
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,580
Then you should do that.

214
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,230
Ae Ra, let's go.

215
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,610
I'm this kind of person.

216
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,780
I already have the approval of the upper management.

217
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,050
You're that happy after being complimented by the Director?

218
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,070
I have met someone that thinks of the company in the same caring way.

219
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm glad to meet them and it makes me feel good on the inside.

220
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,090
When did she become acquainted with the Director?

221
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,090
I know ...

222
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,330
This is S/S's new line.

223
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,240
The design trend is not to emboss the logos,

224
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,100
rather than using the buckle to expose the logo,

225
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,550
the products with patterns are very popular.

226
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,370
I see.

227
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:46,180
This is the first time introducing deals in luxury products. We're thinking of going with the popular ones from the new products

228
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,740
What do you think, Ms. Ae Ra?

229
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,910
That...

230
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,730
Why?

231
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,520
The VIP clients that purchase luxury purses every new season,

232
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,040
they stray away from the products where logos are visible.
But our social network clients consists of

233
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,620
frugal people who make this purchase as a big splurge.

234
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,730
Those clients prefer the products
where the logos are visible.

235
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,680
How about we mix both?

236
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,410
Should we?

237
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,820
Please pick out the ones that our employee recommends.

238
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,520
Yes.

239
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,650
Thanks to you, we got done with our work quickly. How nice!

240
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,550
Thanks for giving me a chance.

241
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:41,570
Oh, since we came out,
can you help me with something personal?

242
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,070
What?

243
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,420
Who are you going to give the gift to?

244
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,520
I don't know.. He's hard to describe in one word.

245
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,640
Perhaps, is it that person you mentioned before?
At the rooftop?

246
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,370
Then I'll have to shop for it diligently.

247
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,770
How about this?

248
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,660
You said he's boring, brusque, and only knows about work.

249
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,100
Then he probably gives
an authoritative and hard impression.

250
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,600
A paisley pattern will give a softer impression.

251
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,440
You have a good memory.

252
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,470
I once met a guy like that.

253
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,300
Really?

254
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,790
Please wrap this up for me.

255
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,360
Yes.

256
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,560
By any chance,

257
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,200
do you know the meaning behind
a woman giving a man a tie as a gift?

258
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,670
Is there such a thing?

259
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,950
It means "I want to have you."

260
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,770
Oh my.

261
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,700
Then are you going to confess with the tie?

262
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,750
Fighting!

263
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,080
If it's okay, can I order?

264
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Yes.

265
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,620
Give me the one that I always eat.

266
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,740
Yes. I understand.

267
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,760
Does it suit your tastes?

268
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,780
Yes. I like this kind of style.

269
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,260
Eat up.

270
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,910
Yes.

271
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,820
Ms. Ae Ra, maybe because you've worked at many places,

272
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,290
you seem to adjust quickly and
are also quick to build friendly relations.

273
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,480
No, when you go from one place (work) to the other,

274
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,990
you have to work by giving up your liver and gall bladder. (swallowing your pride)

275
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,860
You end up acquiring ability to build friendly relations.

276
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:42,130
When I saw you at the interview, it seems like you've worked a lot of difficult jobs, but how is our company?

277
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,020
After working here, do you find it okay?

278
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,380
Of course! I have my own desk,

279
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,030
ID card and a business card.

280
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,250
It's the more 'improved me' from the past.

281
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,750
It's stable, too.

282
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,860
Then since you have a stable job,

283
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,000
you can slowly prepare yourself for a marriage.

284
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,500
After failing once,

285
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,700
it isn't easy to take on the challenge again.

286
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,070
Your wounds appear to go quite deep.

287
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,550
What divorce is there without wounds?

288
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,940
On the outside, I may appear to be smiling,

289
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,190
but on the inside, I'm crying.

290
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,650
They say that couples become mortal enemies after a divorce,

291
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,700
Ae Ra, how do you feel?

292
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,140
Are you like that, too?

293
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,240
We certainly were, but

294
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,340
recently something bad happened to him.

295
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,940
And although he was someone I really hated,

296
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,540
after seeing him experience harm,

297
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,540
I felt badly for him.

298
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,610
I'm not sure

299
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,250
exactly what this emotion is.

300
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,500
It's probably just sympathy.

301
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,820
Don't try to read too much into it.

302
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,210
Yes, Mother.

303
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,130
Yes, I understand.

304
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,880
I'll be right there.

305
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,520
Please let her know that I had to leave first due to an issue at home.

306
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,350
After I make a decision, I don't spend time regretting it.

307
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:26,330
Rather, I make a bigger effort, proving that I made the right decision.

308
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,270
Because the past is of no use.

309
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,320
Yes.

310
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,960
Our conversation has suddenly become too dark.

311
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,930
Thanks for helping me pick out a gift and for eating with me today.

312
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,470
Not at all. I'm the one who got a meal out of it.

313
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,000
I'll treat next time I get my paycheck.

314
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,940
Although it won't be this expensive.

315
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,890
How did you come here?

316
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,280
You have to go to Goryeong with me.

317
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,040
My father ... is critical.

318
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,170
I think I'm going to be late.

319
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,430
Don't worry about me and go to bed first, Min Yeong.

320
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,660
While we were married, I depended on him a lot ...
your father.

321
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,930
He was so good to me.

322
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,860
But why so suddenly?

323
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,590
Whenever my business wouldn't go well and fail,

324
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,370
it took a lot out of him, too.

325
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,240
I may have even caused him to get ill.

326
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,700
Is it going to break by doing that?

327
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,680
Why does he want to raise fish in a perfectly good pot?

328
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,160
In any case, now that he's older,
even the dementia he gets is strange.

329
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,180
Mother-in-law, I guess we'll have to make rice in an electric rice cooker then?

330
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,330
Ay!

331
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,700
Whatever.

332
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,080
Truthfully,

333
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,120
he collapsed from a stroke 3 years ago.

334
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,740
And after that, he's mostly been bedridden.

335
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,420
Then are you saying he's been unconscious for three years?

336
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,090
Although it wasn't often, he has recognized me.

337
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:17,660
And whenever he did, he asked for you.

338
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,750
Me?

339
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,220
That's why I'm bringing you there like this now.

340
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,730
Noona!

341
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,960
Father is...

342
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,350
Father...

343
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,540
Aigoo, honey...

344
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,570
Honey!

345
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,880
Aigoo, what am I to do?

346
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,200
Aigoo!

347
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,600
Fa ... Father.
-Jeong Woo's father!

348
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,560
Father!

349
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,530
Jeong Woo,

350
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:54,650
if you take the easy road because it's too difficult,
a dream will always remain just a dream.

351
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,400
In ten years, or twenty years,

352
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,560
I believe that all these hardships will become fond memories.

353
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:10,330
I'll wait and see that it happens. So please, always follow your dreams.

354
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,490
Father.

355
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,560
Because of me... because of me....

356
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,950
Father!

357
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,920
Father.

358
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,820
CEO Cha had a death in the family?

359
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,940
Filial duty is only possible when a parent is alive.

360
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,470
It's too late after a parent has died.

361
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,600
You shouldn't have bothered.

362
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,330
I'm talking about Robert Kim.

363
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:41,230
Do you think CEO Cha is going to make you happy?

364
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,530
CEO Cha won't be able to.

365
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:49,030
A child like Robert Kim is someone who will live for you.

366
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,780
Why don't you know that?

367
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,790
That's the difference between you and me.

368
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,960
You think that money can buy happiness.

369
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,240
Shouldn't you have figured out that that's not true by now?

370
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,570
I don't want my daughter making such an effort

371
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,470
for someone else's happiness.

372
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,650
You don't know

373
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,670
how exhausting of a job it is.

374
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,150
That's also happiness.

375
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,070
Although you may not know it.

376
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,980
The story book of the 'Fairy and the Wood Cutter'...

377
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,440
I'm the wood cutter.

378
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,630
So I can't give you my children.

379
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,190
Because I don't want you to fly away with the kids.

380
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,900
I understand.

381
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,340
When you return to work tomorrow,
please submit your reason for missing work.

382
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,810
Team Leader,

383
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:20,720
Na Ae Ra is taking the day off today for a personal matter.

384
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,270
Personal leave?

385
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,560
She didn't tell me the reason, just that it's a family matter.

386
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:32,500
She has two client meetings scheduled, too.
Does she even think or not?

387
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,000
Unbelievable.

388
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,610
She really isn't professional.

389
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,470
Her state of mind is rotten!

390
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,480
Nothing can be done about it.

391
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,060
You and I... could give it a try.

392
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,170
Yes, Team Leader.

393
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,100
Oh! CEO's father's death!

394
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,050
Yes, I apologize.

395
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,590
I'll see you tomorrow.

396
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,120
The client that Na Ae Ra was supposed to see today

397
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,510
must be totally upset.

398
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,600
But the CEO, he said that he won't accept
his employees' visits or money,

399
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,250
is it okay to be going there like this?

400
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,240
While you're all working at the company, you may work

401
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,260
for your own satisfaction and personal goals, but

402
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:32,500
I don't think that anything comes before the life and death of a human being.

403
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,250
A person existed before business.

404
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,140
Did business exist before a person?

405
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,550
Let's put everything aside, and all share in the grief.

406
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,580
When Jeong Woo couldn't make it, she split up
saying she couldn't live with him any longer.

407
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,530
But now that Jeong Woo is successful,
look at her running to his side.

408
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,860
She never came by while Father was ill.

409
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,470
That's what I mean.

410
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,590
But still, it was fortunate that they broke up early.

411
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,160
What would have happened if they had had a child?

412
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:37,260
But speaking of which, why did Ae Ra go there?

413
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,150
When the children broke up,
her mother-in-law treated her like such an enemy.

414
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,240
Why did she go? Of course, she should have gone.

415
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,420
Out of basic human respect, she should pay her
respects for her ex-father-in-law's death.

416
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,700
But still, her father-in-law

417
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,980
was so thoughtful to our Ae Ra.

418
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:01,090
Aigoo. She used to bad mouth her to her face saying how her son, who passed the bar exam could marry a daughter

419
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:05,600
of a soup and rice restaurant . What is she going to say now?

420
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,760
Wow, so this is the problem with getting divorced.

421
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,590
You can't go and you can't not go.

422
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,860
I don't want to worry about this, so I don't plan to get divorced.

423
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,190
This is a life lesson. A life lesson.

424
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,710
First, just get married!

425
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,330
You're about to turn forty and I'm still living with you!

426
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,810
Aigoo, there's no other enemy like that.

427
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,100
Why give the child a complex?

428
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,580
The phone has been turned off.

429
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,120
I can't reach Na Ae Ra.

430
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,870
Just in case, I texted her to come, even if it's late.

431
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,760
Ms. Na Ae Ra is very private.

432
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,990
Get out. I'll go park.

433
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,000
Ae Ra?

434
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,140
Na Ae Ra, what are you doing here?

435
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,330
You came?

436
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:21,150
The personal matter... was this?

437
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,720
That...

438
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,260
I didn't see you like that, but you're in a fox crowd.

439
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,500
The interns these days are fast as LTE.

440
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,320
You wanted to come first without anyone knowing,
and put your stake in the CEO, didn't you?

441
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,740
Was that it, Ae Ra?

442
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,510
Ye...yes.

443
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,750
Look here, Na Ae Ra.

444
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:50,900
You have a cunning side to you!

445
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,570
First, let's pay our respects and talk later.

446
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,750
Did you not see my text?

447
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,580
Ah, my battery ran out so my phone died.

448
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,560
But how did you know to come here?

449
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,150
Please give us some more pig's head's meat!

450
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,010
Yes!

451
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,780
I'll do it. Keep doing this.

452
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,300
I really don't like her.

453
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,800
Team Leader, isn't she going too far?

454
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,930
She is going too far, way overboard.

455
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:59,520
She doesn't do the work she's assigned, but instead she finds all sorts of sly ways to become an official worker at the company.

456
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,400
She's so despicable that I can't stand her.

457
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,090
She probably pretended and told me to not waste
tissue paper because it was in front of the Director.

458
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,240
Acting like she's nice, acting like she cares ...

459
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,930
She's an expert at acting.

460
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,530
No, she's not. That's...

461
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,290
Na Ae Ra gives her all with everything she does.

462
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,870
She doesn't refuse dirty work and she does it automatically with confidence.

463
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,050
With sincerity.

464
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:31,490
Well, Na Ae Ra is quite caring. And she's thoughtful.

465
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,150
She's kissing his ass!

466
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:38,970
She acts like she's not interested, but behind
people's backs, she's up to something.

467
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,510
I want to cook something up, too.

468
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,040
When the colleague is spurting like that
I should spurt, too.

469
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,240
Me, I'm going to go and kiss his ass!

470
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,650
I just got dissed, right?

471
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,170
Yes, but you did chew Ae Ra out.

472
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,610
I know, right?

473
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,540
I was chewing Ae Ra out, but why would he get mad?

474
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,520
He must like her!

475
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,540
This won't do.

476
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,190
Everyone go put on an apron. Hurry.

477
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,660
Uh, right now?

478
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,870
Then, do you want to do it next year?

479
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:30,600
Anyway, it's so tiring just because the wrong intern was hired.

480
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,570
Intern?

481
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,490
Why are you so dirty?

482
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,990
What's the matter, Sister-in-law?

483
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,040
Sister-in-law? What Sister-in-law?

484
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,520
If you split up, we become strangers.

485
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,180
What are you scheming?

486
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,450
Are you jealous because he's successful after breaking up?

487
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,350
Or if not, are you here to try and pick up some crumbs?

488
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,370
I don't understand what you are saying.

489
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:05,740
Aren't there any other companies besides our Jeong Woo's company?

490
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,530
How dare you crawl in there?

491
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,040
That is...

492
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,050
Your dark intentions really make my skin crawl.

493
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
I am asking you for a favor, but

494
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,590
don't ever appear in front of our Jeong Woo again.

495
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,250
Quit immediately. If not...

496
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,820
Stop it.

497
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,580
Jeong Woo, is it something I should let pass?

498
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,590
Don't you even have a heart?

499
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,180
Who was the reason why Father collapsed?`

500
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,760
I am going there now. Let's meet there.

501
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,750
You don't have to come, Father.

502
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,650
I will leave now.

503
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,380
It's a time of mourning, she shouldn't be like that.

504
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,180
Nothing bad happened.

505
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,020
Yes.

506
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,340
I am sorry.

507
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,220
For letting you hear that kind of thing, even though
you came all the way here for my sake.

508
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,640
Of course, I should come.

509
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,030
Go back to Seoul now.

510
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,520
The company's employees are watching, too.

511
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,290
But...

512
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:53,270
what did she mean by Father collapsing because of me?

513
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,100
The truth is...

514
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,640
it's because of me.

515
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,460
After hearing about the divorce,

516
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,220
he collapsed that day.

517
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,270
Director.

518
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,590
I guess all of you came down.

519
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,160
Of course, Director.

520
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,460
Our team came down as soon as we heard the news.

521
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,330
We are all saddened by this event.

522
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,320
You worked hard coming this long way.

523
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,200
Where is CEO?

524
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,850
He was here just a bit earlier.

525
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:59,740
I will go find him.

526
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,100
If you've paid your respects, you can head back home.

527
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,260
You have to go to work tomorrow.

528
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,200
Can we do that?

529
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,170
Yes.

530
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:11,940
Then we will head back home first.

531
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,270
Where is Na Ae Ra and what is she doing?

532
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:22,140
Isn't it enough for her to come alone?
Is she planning to stay back alone?

533
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,560
Seriously.

534
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:34,220
I understand Sister-in-law being like that.

535
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,920
She would hate me.

536
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,740
In any case, thank you for coming.

537
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,270
No.

538
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,770
Thank you for calling me.

539
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:00,590
Father-in-law was someone precious to me.

540
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,830
I didn't bow to him for my religious reason.

541
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,470
I am sorry.

542
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,640
It is okay.

543
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,810
Thank you for coming even though you are busy.

544
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,950
Jeong Woo, who is working at your company?

545
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:28,370
I am Guk Yeo Jin. I work together with CEO Cha.

546
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:35,210
Oh, you are the daughter of the investor who
invested in Jeong Woo's company.

547
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,960
Right?

548
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,110
Jeong Woo, you should have introduced us earlier.

549
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,980
She has a pretty face and a kind heart as well.

550
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:52,160
I heard that our Jeong Woo

551
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,080
owes you a lot.

552
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:02,360
I heard that you helped him a lot since the company startup.

553
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,120
When can we repay your kindness?

554
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:10,010
♫ What do I do?

555
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,520
♫ What do I do?

556
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,990
♫ You are the reason I live.

557
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:25,840
By the way, I heard you're still single?
 ♫ But now what do I do?

558
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,500
♫ Why is it that

559
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:39,390
♫ my heart still can't believe our farewell?

560
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:44,300
♫ What do I do?

561
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,760
♫ What do I do?

562
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,270
♫ You are the reason I live.

563
00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:02,900
♫ But now what do I do?

564
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,240
Why are you like this? Seriously!

565
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,070
I said "let's go."

566
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,590
Do you like Cha Jeong Woo?

567
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,890
You aren't going to answer?
I am asking you if you like Cha Jeong Woo.

568
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,200
Look here, Guk!

569
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,270
Today, I'm so extremely exhausted and in pain,

570
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,010
so don't provoke me.

571
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:40,440
So why are you exhausting yourself and getting cursed at for doing something no one asked you to do?

572
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,590
I am the one who gets cursed and has a hard time.

573
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,620
It isn't something for you to mind about.

574
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,280
I hate it.

575
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,300
I'm going crazy because it bothers me.

576
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,230
Yeah, you got here a bit earlier, and

577
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:56,780
you probably helped out because you couldn't just do nothing.

578
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,390
Because you are that kind of person.

579
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,570
But why are you being so mindful of everyone
as if you committed some crime?

580
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:04,040
Guk Seung Hyun.
- I told you to be confident, didn't I?

581
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,370
That looks more like you, Na Ae Ra.

582
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,050
Why do you swallow your pride, and mind everyone's moods?

583
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,220
If I see you like that...

584
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,460
Having to look at that ..

585
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:22,270
Guk Seung Hyeon!
Na Ae Ra!

586
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,230
Come quickly. Let's go.

587
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,560
Yes. I'll be there.

588
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,180
It seemed as though, you put your heart and soul into it.....

589
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,180
Why don't you put that much effort into company work, too?

590
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,790
You said that there was an important matter with your family.

591
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,940
Is the CEO your family?

592
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,410
How can that be?

593
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,770
I finished taking care of my personal business, and

594
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,030
I took off urgently after hearing the news, but

595
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:04,430
I arrived just a little bit earlier than you.

596
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:07,810
Anyway, everyone has worked hard.

597
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:12,260
Especially, Na Ae Ra. Seeing you put forth all your effort,

598
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,190
I saw it for the first time since you joined the company.

599
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,870
It's your daughter-in-law's coffee that you like so much.

600
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:07,530
I wanted to make you 2..2..2..., but

601
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:11,680
I'm sorry. Today it's coffee packets.

602
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:18,390
Father-in-law, next time I will 2..2..2...

603
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:22,410
and make it deliciously for you.
