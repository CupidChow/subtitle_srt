00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,600
Episode 1

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,200
Go Dong Sun

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,800
Ae Ra, a woman has two opportunities.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,600
The first is for myself to succeed.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,000
The second is the opportunity to meet a man that is well-off.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,300
Don't look at just anyone!

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,750
This place is full of people getting ready for exams, and
everybody's going to know if something happens.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,800
I know.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,870
Act thinking like you're a celebrity in this town.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,310
Don't just act before you think, too!

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,700
I said I know.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,370
Since you're mentioning it even though I know, I'm getting mad.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,920
Hey! Look over there.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,960
His name is Cha Jung Woo. He's studying something related to computer...

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,150
But anyway, they say that he studies the best.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,100
I'm here!

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,400
This is such a miserable world I live in.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,810
One soju here, Ahjumma!

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,600
I don't care. Take it out or whatever you want!

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,650
A lonely man's

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,850
burning soul

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,750
is nothing.

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,570
If I get small, I become great, and if...

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,980
Oh my goodness. He must have gone crazy!

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,280
Aigoo, why are you doing this?

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,820
Where did you drink so much?

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,250
Hasn't he gone crazy?

28
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,150
Hey!

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,020
Hey!

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,980
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,980
What is this situation?

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,840
Oppa.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,880
Take this.

34
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,780
Oh.

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,380
I should take this.

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,300
Oh, there is a crack in the memory card.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,100
This part is bent, too.

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,900
If this is the situation, the hard drive must have been useless.

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,920
I think it's all done.

40
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,980
Thank you, Oppa. These are 10 coupons to our store.

41
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,340
It's okay.

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,310
Take them.

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,650
Not at all.

44
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,020
Just take them!

45
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,560
♪ Let's pretend we never met.

46
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:36,860
♪ For the first time... in my life,

47
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:46,000
♪ For the first time... in your life.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,260
Cha Jeong Woo

49
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,980
Cha Jeong Woo!

50
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,040
You did it!

51
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,310
Look, say kimchi.

52
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,430
1, 2, 3..

53
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,940
Cha Jeong Woo, congratulations!

54
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,150
Tada!

55
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,870
I'm eager to live in a house like this one day with you.

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,400
First, I need a big window.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Window?

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,130
Then the heating bill will be too much.

59
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,190
I'm going to make it brick!

60
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,520
Okay.

61
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,560
And in all the corners of the living room, I want plants there.

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,460
Plants?

63
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,050
Yes.

64
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm going to check how much my happiness has grown while growing them.

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,500
This one's our baby. I'll help, too.

66
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,980
But, darling...

67
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,440
Yeah, baby?

68
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,350
What do we call each other now?

69
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,190
Darling, honey, yeobo (honey)?

70
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,020
Uh...

71
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,940
Ho...ney.

72
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,100
Yes, husband!

73
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,310
Honey, I'm leaving!

74
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,240
Honey, try this!

75
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,940
I'm late.

76
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,770
Honey, I'll call you later.

77
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,350
Alright. I'm meeting with some friends today, so I'm going to be there for a while.

78
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,130
Okay.

79
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,440
One more!

80
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,600
I'll leave now.

81
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,310
Brush your teeth at work!

82
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,380
Go.

83
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,960
Go!

84
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,560
Hey! You must be lucky. Your parents-in-law bought you a 60-square meter apartment.

85
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,810
You brat. Since it's a business household, they give you a lot.

86
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm upset because I'm paying more tax.

87
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,370
They said they would give me the building in Sacho-dong, but I'm still contemplating.

88
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm sorry!

89
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,690
Hey! This is so expensive!

90
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,630
Ah, seriously.

91
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,980
Hey, Oh Bang Soon, don't go over the limit.

92
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,130
Min Young must be in an awkward position. Even though it's expensive, how expensive could it be?

93
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,980
You can't buy this with 1 month worth of your husband's salary.

94
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,290
I knew the quality was different.

95
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,720
Where is this from?

96
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,190
So pretty.

97
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,770
Oh, honey!

98
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,310
It's finished, right?

99
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,440
Okay then.

100
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,230
Then I'll go there!

101
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,810
Jeong Woo?

102
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,440
Yes, tonight we're celebrating our 100 days together.

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,560
Aw, you guys must be all lovey dovey right now.

104
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,940
If you look at who got married well, Ae Ra is not just average either.

105
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,800
Handsome, good background, smart, and a 7th civil servant.

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,980
You, stop it.

107
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,840
Bang Soon will be upset.

108
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,490
Bang Soon's husband failed the exam seven times.

109
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,020
But I feel so bad because Jeong Woo passed the first time.

110
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,520
Oh, and did you say that your house is a rental?

111
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,160
That...why?

112
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,440
It's because I'm worried. It's not that easy
for lower class people to get jobs.

113
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,690
I heard that they have to save up 12 years
without using any of their salary.

114
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,720
Oh my, you.

115
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,380
Why would you worry about such a thing? It will work some day.

116
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,550
Unless the country fails, the salary will be given regularly.

117
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,310
I'm more worried about you.

118
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,980
My dad failed a lot of businesses,

119
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,390
so don't you think it's bad to live with debts?

120
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,590
You don't know when you'll go bankrupt.

121
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,550
Just use it well while you have it.

122
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,130
What?

123
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,980
Then, I'll be going first. See you next time.

124
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,600
I should sew her mouth together, right?

125
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,930
1, 2, 3.

126
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,960
Darling, congratulations on our 100th day wedding anniversary.

127
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,960
Cheers!

128
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,750
Congratulations!

129
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,940
It looks delicious. Should we eat?

130
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,420
Ah, hold on!

131
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,980
It's done. You can eat now.

132
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,210
Don't you regret marrying me?

133
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,900
Why would I regret it? I fulfilled my dream.

134
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,150
Dream?

135
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,170
Originally, my dream was to become a full-time housewife.

136
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,640
But you said this.

137
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,100
"If you don't want to work, forget about everything else, and get married."

138
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,890
Since I forgot everything, and got married and became a full-time wife, I completed my dream.

139
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,000
Is that so?

140
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,760
But it's not like you're at a loss.

141
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm pretty, I'm a good cook and I'm cute.

142
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,180
There aren't that many women like me.

143
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,600
There were so many guys that chased after me.

144
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
Why wouldn't I know that?

145
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,320
I said that you'd never regret your
choice, when I proposed to you.

146
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,370
I'll definitely keep that promise.

147
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,380
So,

148
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,980
I...

149
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,550
have made an important decision for our future.

150
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,900
Decision? What decision?

151
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,730
You'll...

152
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,100
follow and trust me no matter what happens, right?
- Of course.

153
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,730
We're a couple that will be together forever.

154
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,910
But, darling, why are you asking that so suddenly?

155
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,150
Truthfully, I...

156
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,070
Today...

157
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,540
I resigned.

158
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,680
Darling, what did you say?

159
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,550
I'm going to start a business.

160
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,830
There's an item that I thought of a long time ago, and
I have confidence.

161
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,210
I will succeed and make you happy.

162
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,940
Darling...!

163
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,790
You trust me, right?

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,690
Darling!

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,490
Here you go.

166
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,120
I will change the grill pan.

167
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,820
Oh, did you hear about the news?

168
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,160
Oh, hello...
- Excuse me.

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,710
Oh, darling. I'm sorry, I woke you, right?

170
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,710
The door won't open...
-Of course, it won't.

171
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,010
I changed the password.
-You did?

172
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,960
Unless you get funded and repay the debts,
don't think of coming in the house.

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
Darling, I don't have a place to sleep.

174
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,500
Sleep in the office or whatever!

175
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,590
Darling!

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,890
Today's the day to pay rent.

3 Years After Divorce
I really don't want to go.

192
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,600
Hey!

193
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,760
We're late. Hurry up and come.

194
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Cute!

195
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,920
Aunt.

196
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,700
Oh, is it good?

197
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,330
Based on the face, he will make a lot of girls cry.

198
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,490
It's a girl.

199
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,540
By the way, I heard your husband's business is going well.

200
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,650
I heard that he started a coffee business.

201
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,300
Did you?

202
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,460
I didn't care about your news after you got divorced.

203
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,450
She's just living well at my house. Nothing big.

204
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,660
I see.

205
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,890
There's no man you're meeting, either?

206
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,880
Of course not! I don't have time.

207
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,610
Oh my.

208
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,590
That's good. Out of my husband's
business partners, I know of a decent guy.

209
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,120
Huh?

210
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,060
He is 36 years old, and he lived in the USA. He has a hotel in the USA, and soon is going to open one here, too.

211
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,990
Oh my, there is such a person?

212
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,570
He's not lacking any qualities.

213
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,660
Oh! Look at my forgetfulness!

214
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:42,040
You said you don't like people who do business, right?
Because they're debtors? Oops, I forgot.

215
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,610
How pitiful! There are only CEOs of big companies around me.

216
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,060
Well...it's fine.

217
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Excuse me?

218
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,130
The highlight of the baby's first birthday,
the choosing of the item (Korean tradition).

219
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,540
I have to go. Cheer my Soo Yeon on.

220
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,550
Yes. Soo Yeon, fighting.

221
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,700
Bang Soon, I should call her a haughty queen.

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,460
What are you saying?

223
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,200
Bang Soon said she would lend
the money for the monthly house fee.

224
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,200
Aigoo, really.

225
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,470
You have to go back to the office, right?

226
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,500
Yes.

227
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,120
Get in, I'll give you a ride.

228
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,120
These days you can't go to the airport without any makeup.

229
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,900
Oh, that's right. You must be tired because of the airport fashion.

230
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,110
That's what I'm saying.

231
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,410
Hi, Writer Kim, how are you?

232
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,880
Punk?

233
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,300
Why are they being like this?

234
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,990
Oh, okay. See the situation and call me.
I will take a look into it, too.

235
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,760
What is it?

236
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,410
One of the female actresses turned off her cell phone and ran away.

237
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,690
The filming is the day after tomorrow, but where do I find a cunning, single lady?

238
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,710
Do you know any cunning, single ladies who have the looks?

239
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,150
A cunning, single lady?

240
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,730
Na Ae Ra!

241
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,510
Yes?

242
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,550
What if you get 0 votes if I go out. I don't want to do it.

243
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,750
You're a style that men would like!

244
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,650
I thought that you were a Mrs. If I'd known you were a cunning, single lady, I would have asked you right away.

245
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,930
Thank you for thinking so well of me, but I really am not interested.

246
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,080
You should have gone.

247
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,770
Is it time for me to be dating now?

248
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,240
There are so many things I need money for!

249
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
I see that you're avoiding things because I might ask you to pay for the monthly fee.

250
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,830
Anyway, you act so poor after all that happened.

251
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,910
Is it obvious?

252
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,800
After this month, I will pay half of the price.

253
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,070
But why are you paying that debt?

254
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,130
Oh, you lack in everything.

255
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,620
Aigoo, our Hyung Jeong Woo,

256
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,180
I remember the days when you spent your time at the PC room.

257
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,110
Thank you.
-Yes.

258
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,700
Drink up.

259
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,890
When you came in, were you not mad?

260
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,860
The housekeeper of the house is very strict, so...

261
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,520
If the security is strict,

262
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,430
it's safe and good.

263
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,440
Here you go.

264
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,310
Thank you.

265
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,780
There really is only you (who I can rely on).

266
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,230
I feel bad for you.

267
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,980
Why did you divorce?

268
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,010
Hey, it's all in the past.

269
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm fine!

270
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,610
Right. If you think like that, it's a relief.

271
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,260
As you live, good days will come, right?

272
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,270
Like Jeong Woo.

273
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,900
Oh my, don't you know?

274
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,850
Know what?
-You haven't heard about Jeong Woo.

275
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,360
Girl.

276
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,590
You should look at the economic newspapers and stuff.

277
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,970
Don't always watch celebrity news.

278
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,060
Cha Jeong Woo?!

279
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,960
He's not just well-off,

280
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
he apparently became a chaebol.

281
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,110
DONTALK CEO Cha Jeong Woo

282
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,540
Are you going to faint?

283
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,140
This year's business D&T Soft Ventures CEO Cha Jeong Woo.

284
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,190
From 2013, he showed a natural

285
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,690
business mind

286
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,100
and became a successful business man.

287
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,380
Thank you.

288
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
Four years ago,

289
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,720
I started a small venture with 3 workers

290
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,000
that has become a leading enterprise
reaching to the 21st century mobile age.

291
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,480
Our D&T Soft Ventures' next task is

292
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,820
to make a mobile platform used for

293
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,550
business, communication, entertainment.

294
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,860
It will be the center of everything.

295
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,520
Yes, I'm coming, but why do they want to see me?

296
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,410
I don't know. They just contacted me.

297
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,190
Okay.

298
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,920
Cha Jeong Woo?

299
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,320
Yes.

300
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,960
I have a meeting with President Cha.

301
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,230
It seems you haven't heard.

302
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,530
I think your father wanted to introduce me to you.

303
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,590
Sit down.

304
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,690
Tell President Cha that I will meet him another time.

305
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,050
I'll be going.

306
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,510
You're exactly like the rumors.

307
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,370
I rode on a plane for over 10 hours from New York to see you.

308
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,850
Can't I have 10 minutes?

309
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,910
I know that

310
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,550
you've been hurt before.

311
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,950
So have I.

312
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,090
However, I don't think that is important.

313
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,100
Should I say I'm more focused on the future than the past?

314
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,670
If you're okay with it,

315
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,260
I want to invite you to a family dinner next week.

316
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,720
I hope you have a good time with your family at the family dinner.

317
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,450
I'm not comfortable with people I don't know.

318
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,330
I think it's been 10 minutes.

319
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,250
I've said everything I need to say.

320
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,100
If you have nothing else to say, I'll...

321
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,700
Will you go out first?

322
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,660
What's wrong?

323
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,450
A punk without a bag is being told that they'll buy a bag for him.

324
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,640
Since I said that I don't want it, she's probably mad.

325
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,700
Let's go, you have an interview.

326
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,960
Congratulations on receiving the award today.
- Thank you.

327
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,650
How does it feel to be the best social network business?

328
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,190
It wasn't my goal to be first, but

329
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,420
with the thought of offering a better service to consumers,

330
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,160
I just tried my best.

331
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,420
When you started the Venture I heard that things
were very difficult.

332
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,700
When was the most difficult moment?

333
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,500
I'm not sure.

334
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,950
There were countless difficult moments.

335
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,490
Out of them all, the most difficult was...

336
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,110
I'm crazy.

337
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,640
You didn't get an investment again?!

338
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,160
Starve.

339
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,880
You don't even have the right to eat.

340
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,910
It was the coldness of the people whom I trusted the most.

341
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,430
It was

342
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,790
really difficult.

343
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,590
You've reached this success after seven years,

344
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,070
so who is the one that impacted you the most?

345
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,780
If you had to select the person you're most
thankful towards, who who would it be?

346
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,090
Many people have helped me, but

347
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,560
if I had to choose from them...

348
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,030
Do you have to be like this?
-If I don't?

349
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,150
There are many people who said they'll invest in this product, and the reaction is good.

350
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,720
-If this goes well...
-Stop, stop it!

351
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,810
Do you want to be forever developing and then ring the bell (die)?

352
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,650
If you did it for four years, it's enough. That means that
there's no hope then.

353
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,600
I can't live like this anymore.

354
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,020
Weren't we a couple?

355
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,030
Through the difficult, miserable times, didn't we promise to depend on each other?
-No.

356
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,730
I think you've misunderstood something,

357
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,240
we're a couple when you're feeding me.

358
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,630
Not when I have to feed you.

359
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,680
Get over the poor relief yourself.

360
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,820
Don't drag me into the gutter, too.

361
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,320
The person who made me grit my teeth determined to succeed.

362
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,500
If it wasn't for that person,

363
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,400
I wouldn't be as successful as I am today.

364
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,680
What is this?

365
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,940
Are you crying?

366
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,970
Are you crying?

367
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,260
They say that people with no luck for husbands also have no luck in money.

368
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,510
That bastard...He never once showed me one hair on his head because he was gaining so much popularity.

369
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,940
When you went your separate ways,

370
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,820
there's no reason to show you any of the hairs on his head.

371
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,780
But still there's this thing called affection.

372
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,550
You're doing that because your stomach hurts, right?

373
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,540
It's not because my stomach hurts,
it's because it's unfair.

374
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,240
You...paying that Cha Jeong Woo's development costs,

375
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,480
you know how much I suffered.

376
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,550
Look at the special price for these winter jackets!

377
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,960
In that cold weather, in a market,

378
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,040
I caught frostbite selling clothes.

379
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,240
At the call center I answered calls until I started hearing things.

380
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,370
I got burned while serving onto the fiery grill,

381
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,080
I cut my fingers while cutting rice cakes.

382
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,610
Hello, it's Moon Ha Bum's...

383
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,930
Excuse me.

384
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,650
I got kicked out after I got caught selling insurance.

385
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,050
If I hadn't done that... research?

386
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,680
With what money would he have done that?!

387
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,190
That is true.

388
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,990
And most crucially,

389
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,100
that free text messaging that Cha Jeong Woo made.

390
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,680
If you calculate it and see, he developed it because of me.

391
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,090
What do you mean?

392
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,780
When I was an insurance agent,

393
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,480
I sent 200 texts to customers.

394
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,340
Why are the charges for texting so high?!

395
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,090
Husband!

396
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,620
Don't invent useless things,

397
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,590
and invent something that sends these for free!

398
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,830
Do you know why the band-aid was created?

399
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,840
A loving wife cut her finger while cutting.

400
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,440
So the husband thought, "What should I do?"

401
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,000
Then

402
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,770
he put gauze on like this... and tape...

403
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,770
and wrapped it around like this.

404
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,310
So the blood stopped.

405
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,190
The husband using the inspiration that he gained there,

406
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,170
presented a new product proposal based on it.

407
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,850
If the wife hadn't cut her finger,

408
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,480
would the husband have come up with that idea?

409
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,730
So...

410
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,780
After Jeong Woo saw

411
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,780
you being miserable because of the texting charges,

412
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,600
he invented it!
-That's exactly it!

413
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,920
If he has a conscience,

414
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,130
I see that he needs to give me a percentage of that
intellectual property.

415
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,690
You're talking crap.

416
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Intellectual property. The wench who couldn't even get one cent of alimony,

417
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,020
what are whining about intellectual property?

418
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,490
Did I not receive the alimony because I didn't want to?

419
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,950
I couldn't get it because he was a broke loser.

420
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,580
So...

421
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,160
why did you break up when you were poor?

422
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,120
You should have broken up when he was rich.

423
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,940
I won't stay still.

424
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,240
Ah, yes.

425
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,120
I'm LaSaral's Manager Cha, but

426
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,970
the Cunning, Single Lady Episode...

427
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,750
Our shop's employee has decided to try out for it.

428
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,710
I convinced her, of course.

429
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,510
Yes. Yes, yes, I understand.

430
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:12,280
I thought you had no intention of doing it.

431
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,560
I suddenly changed my mind.

432
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,200
Anyway, good job.

433
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,940
Oh man, look at these clothes.

434
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,760
Min Young,

435
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,580
if I go out, I think I'm going to receive 0 votes.

436
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,160
Aigoo, all right. I'll sponsor you, but instead you have to absolutely become a couple with him.

437
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,640
Even your worries, really...

438
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,250
At one point, I was the exam takers' Madonna.

439
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,800
Even if I look like this, this Unnie still lives.

440
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,830
This... I think this looks the best.

441
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,300
Oh, what do you think?

442
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,260
You're all dead.

443
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,430
If you look from afar it's a beautiful scene,

444
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,700
but if you look closely it's a cutthroat life.

445
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,560
Woman #2

446
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,500
This woman is cold because she's alone.

447
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,300
Woman #4, a 36 year old Fund Manager, divorced 3 years
-Father keeps urging me to hurry up and bring a guy to

448
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,740
-inherit the business.
Woman #4 is a businessman's daughter.

449
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,370
You said that you were a farmer, but what kind...

450
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,480
Man #2, Agriculture, divorced 7 years, 40 years old.
I do some rice farming and some ginseng farming also.

451
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,250
Right now I'm thinking about building a factory
on the land that's left.

452
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,260
Woman #1, Elementary School Teacher,
divorced 1 year, 31 years old.
-Aigoo, well, when I was going to elementary

453
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,570
and middle school, I never had any occasion to step on anyone else's land.

454
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,970
-because it's all our land.
Woman #3, Director of a Ballet Study Center,
divorced 2 years, 33 years old.

455
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,780
Shopping Co-ordinator. 4 years since divorce.
34 years old, Woman #2.

456
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,240
I'm fine.

457
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,220
What's wrong with eating alone?

458
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,860
I don't normally eat well with people
I'm not familiar with. I'm fine.

459
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,950
Even so, you came first place in the best first impression vote.

460
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,690
A broadcast should go back and
forth for it to be interesting, isn't that so?

461
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,970
That's what I think.

462
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,750
Ah...a moment please.

463
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,210
I'm thirsty.

464
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,950
The first woman to cross the finish line

465
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,080
will get the chance to go on a
date with the man of her choice.

466
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,110
Re...ady!

467
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,250
The trigger has been pulled.

468
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,150
The women are running with all their might for their man.

469
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,650
The men cheer the women on.

470
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,850
In a fierce competition,

471
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,950
the ultimate victor is...

472
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,270
Woman #2.

473
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,150
To her, no obstacle is a problem,

474
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,850
if it can find her happiness again.

475
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,900
Fighting!

476
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,180
The night of the singles who are tired of being lonely

477
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,060
My daughter.

478
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,500
Daddy really, really misses you, too.

479
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,290
Dad will

480
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,150
bring a pretty mom home.

481
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,780
Uh-huh.

482
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,480
Daddy

483
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,800
loves you too, my daughter.

484
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,930
In the woman's room at that hour

485
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,560
These days men look at a woman's economic situation an awful lot.

486
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,740
Looking at Woman #2's face,
it shows that she eats alone.

487
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,130
I know right. I felt a little bitter (for her).

488
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,780
Woman #2 enters.

489
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,550
Unni, are you okay?

490
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,700
#2, cheer up. Fighting.

491
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,900
I'm fine.

492
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,160
But #2, the date ticket you received,

493
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,770
who are you going to use it on?

494
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,230
Yes, come in.

495
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:37,550
Just then, Man #1 comes to the women's room.

496
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,000
Excuse me,

497
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,470
Woman Number 2.

498
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,850
Me?

499
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,150
Yes.

500
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,510
A moment...

501
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,830
The handsome doctor's (Man #1's) choice,
causes a stir amongst the women.
What is it?

502
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,600
Isn't Man #1 a skincare doctor (dermatologist)?

503
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,270
Is he interested in Woman #2?

504
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,890
No way.

505
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,740
Skincare Doctor. Divorced for 2 years.
36 years old, Man #1.

506
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,560
Excuse me, this...

507
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,920
Earlier, you were hit by a lot of cold wind.
When you sleep, put this on beforehand.

508
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,550
This was made by my hospital.

509
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,050
It's really good for moisturizing and nutrition.

510
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,530
And this one is sunscreen.
It was also made at my hospital.

511
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,150
Use it tomorrow.

512
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,830
Thank you very much.

513
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,690
Not at all...

514
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,250
Life isn't something that flows by, it's
something that fills up little by little.

515
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,650
Man #1's interest has filled
up the heart of Woman #2.

516
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,250
Their date continues.

517
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,510
One night's firework date.

518
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,820
I wish my life would explode like that.

519
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,670
It will.

520
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,620
One experience of failure,

521
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,250
I think that it's because you can meet a better person.

522
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,570
Woman #2's Prince Charming?

523
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,050
I want to...

524
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,970
make this woman smile, or be her protector.

525
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,720
Well, something along those lines, that kind of thought
entered my mind.

526
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,450
I liked that she looked so pure.

527
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,680
I liked it.

528
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,990
The feeling of happiness in having someone care for me.

529
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,880
I felt it after such a long time.

530
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,250
Woman #2 wells up with emotions
she hasn't felt in a long time.

531
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,900
Ah, give me a moment.

532
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,140
Why am I like this, seriously...

533
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,540
During my married life,

534
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,630
I had a really hard time.

535
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,290
When I think of that time,

536
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,670
I think why I had to meet that sort of a person.

537
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,770
Even if it's in my next lifetime,

538
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,560
I absolutely do not want to meet that sort of a husband.

539
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,900
Now...

540
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,020
Now I really...

541
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,970
want to be happy.

542
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,760
Yes.

543
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,950
We hope that she is now happy.

544
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,050
Nasaral, Na Ae Ra, found her partner! Jjak!

545
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,980
Congratulations, Unnie.
Look, isn't it good you agreed to go out on it?

546
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,390
Yes.

547
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,170
The doctor that was matched with you. He's completely cool.

548
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,140
He ordered 100 wallets that are in the new collection. Daebak.

549
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,070
A sunbae that he knows needed a gift to give to all
of his VIP customers,

550
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,950
and thankfully he says that he'll buy them all at our stores.

551
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,350
Hey, while you do this, could it be that next month

552
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,550
you may quit saying that you're getting married?
Manager...

553
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,810
That's something we have to wait and see.

554
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:36,450
If I were to say it again, our concept surely has competitiveness,

555
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,400
but as the usage has exponentially increased,

556
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,030
it is a reality that the funds to secure server usage have become urgent.

557
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,030
While we are operating this service for free,

558
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,350
we can't ignore the unstable income.

559
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:57,810
So from now on, we should change our plan to give out paid service effectively.

560
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,540
What about your opinion, CEO?
- I disagree.

561
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:10,450
Like I told you before, giving good service
is more important than the income.

562
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,710
If the platform is set up correctly,
the income should smoothly come in.

563
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,930
It hasn't been even one month since
there was a server problem in the network.

564
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,540
Isn't preventing that the most important concern?

565
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,710
I'll ask for you to proceed after prioritizing well what's needed.

566
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,690
Do you have no fear or do you have no feeling? Do you not know how the investors are clamoring right now?

567
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,430
What investors are you talking about?

568
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,500
Is it perhaps President Gook?

569
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,120
Then tell him to pull out his investment.

570
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,530
It's too bad, but what can we do? The immediate management may become difficult,

571
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,370
but the imagination will be free.

572
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,670
I'm the one who invested the most by convincing my father.

573
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,070
That was because I trusted in
Cha Jeong Woo's spontaneous decisions.

574
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,190
But I'm starting to get a little sick of it.

575
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,340
There will be many more things you'll get sick of.

576
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,230
You can step away from this now.

577
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,210
I don't want to disappoint another person who believes in me.

578
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,210
I really can't get through to you.

579
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,000
I can't even fight with you.

580
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,660
I hate fighting with a woman, too.

581
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,100
Can't you just trust me?

582
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,270
At least I gained one thing.

583
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,010
You said you hate fighting with women.

584
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,660
I guess you do see me as a woman.

585
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:49,710
I confiscated President Hwang's house and put his paintings in storage.

586
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,050
We're planning on calling someone from the gallery
around tomorrow to get rid of them.

587
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,540
And what should we do about President Hwang?

588
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,580
What do you mean? Send him off on good terms.

589
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,310
With the stocks we received, break them up,

590
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,010
and sell them off so there won't be future problems.

591
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,810
Yes. I understand.

592
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,290
Hey! What on earth are you doing?

593
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,880
Let go of me!

594
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,770
Hey jerks! I'm President Hwang! Let go!

595
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,060
Let go!

596
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,310
Hey, President Guk!

597
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,620
Because you made some money and people call you president,

598
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,590
did you forget about your friends, you jerk?

599
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,310
Hey! No matter what, you and I were

600
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,110
gangsters from the start, you jerk!

601
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,060
Guk Gi Bong! You jerk!

602
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,300
Guk Gi Bong!

603
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,110
What is the big deal about these paintings?

604
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,470
You're here.

605
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,080
I told you not to let those kinds of people in the house.

606
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,260
I'm sorry, Miss.

607
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,120
My daughter has come.

608
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,350
Have you eaten dinner yet?

609
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,780
I ate.

610
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,200
Did President Cha hit it big?

611
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,900
What? Socia? What was it?

612
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,640
Director Oh!

613
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,270
Social Network. His is the best rated.

614
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:36,150
Yes, yes. Socia, socia ... that thing.

615
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,400
It's so strange.

616
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,790
All of the women I like

617
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,960
do not like me back.

618
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,720
What about Seung Hyeon?

619
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,360
He's taking care of his apartment in England
and said he'll be returning very soon.

620
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,090
Keep a good eye on him, or he might run off again.

621
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,820
Yes, I understand.

622
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,250
You haven't eaten, have you?

623
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,680
I just ate with the other guys.

624
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,820
You haven't eaten, right?

625
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,500
Yes, I'm hungry.

626
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,090
How's this one?

627
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,390
Why?

628
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,650
You're going to buy it?

629
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,030
I'm going somewhere with the doctor over the weekend.

630
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,460
Really?

631
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,120
Just the two of you?

632
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,610
It's not that.

633
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,310
He said there will be friends there, but
it seems like he's taking me as his date.

634
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,910
You guys are already in that kind of relationship?

635
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,170
This one's good.

636
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,610
Are you cold?

637
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,820
Do you want me to put the roof back on?

638
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,380
N...no.

639
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,170
Spring is so nice. It's wonderful.

640
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,230
Who's going to be at the villa?

641
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:26,560
Ah, a senior I'm close with and a younger friend I know.

642
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,240
Ah, it'll be nice and cozy.

643
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,440
You said we're having a barbecue party, right?

644
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,710
I'm really looking forward to it.

645
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,390
I really like that sort of thing.

646
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:35,900
Really?

647
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,700
Then we should go often.

648
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,120
By any chance, do you like potlucks?

649
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,120
Excuse me? Pot ...?

650
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,590
Potluck.

651
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,170
It's when each person brings food, and you have a party.

652
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,330
Ah ... pot-luck!

653
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,100
I really like it!

654
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,820
We did it a lot at my house.

655
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,060
At your house?

656
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,670
My mom hosted a meeting for 20 years.

657
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,770
When there was a meeting, each lady would bring a veggie side dish.

658
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,440
We'd put it all together and made a lot of bibimbab.

659
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,270
Oh.

660
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,210
What is your ideal man?

661
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,410
Ideal man?

662
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,340
Yes.

663
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,660
I'm just curious.

664
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,070
Let's see.

665
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,320
A person with a villa at Chungpyeong?

666
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:39,240
Oh, then you'll meet your ideal man today.

667
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,760
Excuse me?

668
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,910
What should I do?

669
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,910
Welcome.

670
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,290
Hello.

671
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,210
Thank you.

672
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,970
Oppa!

673
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,120
Why did you come so late? I was dying of hunger!

674
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,880
Aigoo ... my So Young was hungry?

675
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,980
Our So Young gets mad when she's hungry.

676
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,160
Welcome, Unnie.

677
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,030
-Hello, Hyung.
-Come on over.

678
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,170
You two look so great together.

679
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,310
Unnie and Big Oppa are a great match!

680
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,490
Such a great match!

681
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:01,030
Ms. Ae Ra. He's the one who ordered the wallets from your store.

682
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,330
Ah, yes.

683
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:06,000
Hey, that was no big deal.

684
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,650
Hyung, should we go to your villa in Wonju next month?

685
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,790
We can play golf, too.

686
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,300
That sounds great.

687
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,180
Do you play golf?
-No ...

688
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,700
This hyung has villas in various places.

689
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,060
When you have time, we should go together.

690
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,870
But do you have time?

691
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,110
I heard you're really busy these days.

692
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,670
Yes. After going on the show,
there's been a huge increase in patients.

693
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:45,070
The nurses are telling me to go on one more time
because it's a great marketing strategy.

694
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,510
What?

695
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,640
If you continue to do that, So Young is going to get mad.

696
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,180
I'm forgiving you this time because you said
you wanted to publicize your hospital.

697
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:56,840
Aigoo, that's what happened to our So Young.

698
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,820
Do you like wine?

699
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,050
There's a French wine in the car.

700
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,160
I'll be back after using the restroom.

701
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:22,180
What the heck? He came on the show to market his hospital?

702
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,650
Unbelievable.

703
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,420
Unnie, we're going now.

704
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,850
Right now?

705
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,170
Then I'll just bring my purse.

706
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,000
You can't leave. We're leaving you guys alone on purpose.

707
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,710
What does that mean?

708
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,150
Even though that Oppa seems like that, he's amazing.

709
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,570
He bought one unnie he dated an apartment in Gangnam

710
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,540
and gave her free visits to the dermatologist.

711
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,390
Just don't mention getting married.

712
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,780
His wife is really scary.

713
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:06,860
Oh, what is that, Oppa?

714
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,330
Huh?

715
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,200
Hey!

716
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,700
Did I look that easy?

717
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,170
What kind of thing is there?

718
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,300
What?
- To tell the truth,

719
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,530
it's good for you to have a sponsor.

720
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,730
Isn't that why you came all the way here?

721
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,490
You were thinking to do this in the first place?

722
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,990
Then, do you think I would really marry you?

723
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,760
What?

724
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,700
Oppa, let's just go.

725
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,860
Unnie, a cunning, single lady has her place.

726
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,240
Also,

727
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,380
we don't drink this cheap wine.

728
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,380
That low-classed guy.

729
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,230
National 1st place Social Network, surpassed 10 million

730
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,620
Sure, you are good.

731
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,660
Divorce?

732
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,390
You're being too selfish.

733
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,490
Hey, you divorce when you have money.

734
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,640
That's a different problem.

735
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,700
Just pay for it in 36 months.

736
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,940
How do you give divorce money in 36 months?
That's so embarrassing.

737
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,880
That's not something to be embarrassed about.

738
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,390
You know D&T Soft Venture's CEO, right?

739
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,210
Chang Sik's company's CEO.

740
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,900
His CEO also

741
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,000
gave his ex-wife the divorce money monthly.

742
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,550
Wow, but that woman is very vicious.

743
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:26,920
Since the company is doing well, she is asking him for stocks.

744
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:32,650
So, did he give her any?
- I don't know why he got a divorce, but he lost a lot to her.

745
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,390
Anyways, that CEO

746
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:40,310
can't see her get rich, so he is unwilling to give her anything.

747
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:44,240
That's why he should have met a good woman.

748
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,850
Hey, Ahjussi.

749
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,430
Me?
- Who said that?

750
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,690
Yes? What is?

751
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,570
Who said those false rumors?

752
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,580
Why is that woman causing a fight all of a sudden?

753
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,190
Don't talk to her. She's drunk.

754
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,310
Oh my.

755
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,130
Oh wow. Really.

756
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,830
Ahjussi, who said that?

757
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,800
Who said that?

758
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,460
What's wrong with this Ahjumma?

759
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,730
Did you just push me?

760
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,090
Are you ignoring me, too?

761
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,150
Oh my.
- Hey, let's go.

762
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,450
She is completely drunk.

763
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,460
Oh wow.

764
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,540
Those guys...

765
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,860
Hey, where are you going?

766
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,640
Are you guys crazy?

767
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,980
It's all written here.

768
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,160
Ae Ra.

769
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,370
Min Young.

770
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,820
What happened?

771
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,700
Why are you here?

772
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,670
It's long to explain. These guys pushed me first.

773
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,360
Ahjumma, you caused the fight first.

774
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,210
Oh geez.

775
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,350
Please be quiet.

776
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:10,090
Na Ae Ra, if what they say is true, you committed a crime.

777
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:13,650
If the men don't negotiate, it gets complicated.

778
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,300
Omo, what do you mean deliberation?

779
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,470
I told you that this guy used my identity without my permission.

780
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,210
Use of identity?

781
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:23,240
What "use of identity" did I do to you?

782
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,500
You said that I would go to my ex-husband's company and try to get stocks from him.

783
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,230
I did say that. I did.

784
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:34,640
So why you? Are you the CEO's ex-wife?

785
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,170
Are you his ex-wife?

786
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:39,330
Yes.

787
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,370
I am that CEO's ex-wife.

788
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,760
Did you see this?

789
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,280
This Ahjumma is this crazy.

790
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,070
She is out of her mind.

791
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,500
What do you mean out of her mind?

792
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,190
Ahjussi, what you're saying is too harsh.

793
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,750
What are you?

794
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,990
You guys are messed up together.

795
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,350
What did you say?

796
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,590
Hey, Ahjussi.

797
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,490
If my friend is D&T Soft Venture's

798
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,730
CEO's ex-wife, what are you going to do?

799
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,370
What are you going to do?

800
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,130
Oh really?

801
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,680
Then, prove it.

802
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,300
Bring D&T Soft's CEO then!

803
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,920
Is that correct?

804
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,870
Is D&T Soft's CEO your ex-husband?

805
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,790
It's correct.

806
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:36,570
You guys are all dead of use of identity and attack.

00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,730
He's not.

808
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,040
Why are you like this?

809
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,540
It's correct.

810
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,210
Her ex-husband is that person.

811
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,190
He's not.

812
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,790
Both of you must be crazy.

813
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,410
Yes?

814
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,070
Yes.

815
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,040
Jeong Woo,

816

I'm Min Young.

817
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,210
Ae Ra's friend.

818
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,060
Ae Ra is about to be put in jail.

819
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,280
I'm sorry, but could you come here?

820
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,790
It's a situation you have to come.

821
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,170
She's a person who has no relationship with me.

822
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,740
I'm sorry. We were too crazy, then.

823
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,810
Then, drink some coffee and make yourself comfortable.

824
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,550
Please stay calm.

825

Yes.

Hi.

Agassi, why did you come here?

828
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,310
Were you drunk driving?

829
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,620
That's how a human lives.

830
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,440
As you live...

831
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,520
Move your hand.
