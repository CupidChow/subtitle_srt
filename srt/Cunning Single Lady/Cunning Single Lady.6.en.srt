Episode 6

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,610
Shall I help you?

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,940
Do it together. Do it together.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,860
Do it together. Do it together.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,080
Do it together. Do it together.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:38,470
♫ If I look into your eyes, ♫

7
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:46,480
♫ All of this seems like a dream, ♫

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,380
♫ Of all of the many people in this world, ♫

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,430
♫ Perhaps what the two of us have gained, ♫

10
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,860
♫ I don't know if it may be a miracle. ♫

11
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:09,570
♫ When I'm held in your embrace, ♫

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:17,390
♫ I come to know a new world, ♫

13
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,280
♫ Before I came to know you,

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,360
♫ I don't know how I lived, ♫

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,990
♫ I don't even know if I was dead, ♫

16
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,820
♫ Perhaps even in this way, ♫

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,210
♫ How we crossed paths with each other, ♫

18
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,830
♫ When we were so near each other, ♫

19
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,340
♫ The time to love each other was ♫

20
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,650
♫ too lacking, ♫

21
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,780
♫ Trust in me, ♫
♫ I will trust in you, ♫

22
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,820
♫ I'll be with you until the world ends, ♫

23
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,710
♫ How long did you search for me, ♫

24
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,520
♫ Did you get lost? ♫

25
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,470
♫ Did you hear my prayers? ♫

26
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,320
♫ Did you listen closely to my prayers? ♫

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,240
♫ While we are living in this world, ♫

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,960
♫ When you bump into and pass me, ♫

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,810
♫ I hope with one glance that we could recognize each other, ♫

30
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,180
♫ Like this. ♫

31
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,400
But CEO,

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,120
can I ask you something?

33
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,360
Yes.

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,600
The reason that you're not remarrying...

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,450
I heard that it's because you were
completely burned by your previous wife.

36
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,780
Is that true?

37
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,580
Oh no.

38
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,520
Oh no.

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,860
It's true, isn't it.

40
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,560
I don't want to talk about my ex-wife.

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,050
What is that? If you talk like that, what do I become?

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,160
Calm down.

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,550
She's not worth (talking about), either.

44
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,290
Think that you stepped on poop.

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
About married couple's matters,

46
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,840
you need to listen to both sides.

47
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,730
Do you know something?

48
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,760
There is something,

49
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,250
but I don't know whether I can say it.

50
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,820
What is it?

51
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,790
When it was a difficult time for the CEO,

52
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,880
I heard that his ex-wife labored so hard to support him.

53
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,290
What he built while putting his wife through so much sacrifice,

54
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,600
is this company.

55
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,740
A rumor is probably just a rumor.

56
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,640
Ah, aigoo, of course.

57
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,020
Aiyoo, is our CEO a person that would do that?

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,390
The person directly involved...

59
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,420
I heard it from a person that knows that person well.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,630
That the ex-wife

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,940
is so pitiful. She is so outraged.

62
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,630
It must really be true.
- It must all be true.

63
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,560
Ae Ra, why are you being like this, seriously?

64
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,280
What did I do?

65
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,540
I'm only saying that that's what I heard.

66
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,170
Let's get up now.

67
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,620
The time is late as well.

68
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,290
You have to tell us.

69
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,090
CEO,

70
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,130
the rumor I heard,

71
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,480
is it not true?

72
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,960
Yes.

73
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,890
It's not the truth.

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,210
It's not?

75
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,650
Yes, it's not.

76
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,170
I don't know what you heard from that person,

77
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,920
but go tell that person that you know.

78
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,090
That woman is a person

79
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,060
who doesn't have the right to say that.

80
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,020
Then.
- Yes.

81
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,560
Stay comfortably.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,510
Cha Jeong Woo!

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,900
CEO.

84
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,920
How could she not know her tolerance at her age?

85
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,120
Getting drunk and acting up so ridiculously.

86
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,190
Are you worried about her?

87
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,410
Me? Of that woman?

88
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,960
She wishes.

89
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,120
Whether she gets drunk and sleeps on the ground or not,

90
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,090
whether she throws up into her bag...

91
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,200
Honey, honey, honey.

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,190
Are you ok?

93
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,010
Should we stop the car?

94
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,940
She's already thrown up.

95
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,460
What good will it do to stop the car now?

96
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,270
Aiyoo, my business taxi will stink.

97
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,670
I'm sorr..I'm sorry.

98
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,250
I took care of it well.

99
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,860
Aiyoo, I throw up once. I don't throw up twice.

100
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,160
Oh, I'm going to die.

101
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,750
Aiyoo, you. Why did you drink so much?!

102
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,730
You carried her on your back all the way here?

103
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,530
Yes, well...carried her on my back,

104
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,200
and at times put her down when I was tired.

105
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,960
I dragged her part of the way, too.

106
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,600
But...Ae Ra's coworker?

107
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Yes. My introduction was late.

108
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
My name is Guk Seung Hyeon.

109
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,170
Omo, I'm so happy to meet you.

110
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,300
Why didn't that wench tell me that

111
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,070
there's a flower boy colleague?!

112
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,650
Do you want to have a cup of tea before you go?

113
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,430
No, it's ok.

114
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,820
The time is late. It's not good for a man
to stay long in a house where only women live.

115
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,480
I'll come next time when it's bright outside to drink tea.

116
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,450
Keep it for me. I'll get going then.

117
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,130
Yes. Then make sure to come next time.

118
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,330
He's a fellow that was raised quite well.

119
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,460
Would you like soup with rice?

120
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,420
Yes. Thank you. Welcome.

121
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,490
Welcome. Welcome.

122
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,180
Welcome. Give them some more laver (seaweed) here.

123
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,370
Oh, yes.
A little more water.
-Yes.

124
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,270
What is that punk Soo Cheol doing?

125
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,390
What are you doing here?! Not even helping carry out the soups.

126
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,680
Father, right now soup with rice isn't what's important.

127
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,560
We have to film it when it's this crowded,

128
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,510
so that later we can use it for when
we're promoting the place and hang a picture...

129
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,240
Father, let's do an interview.

130
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,760
As the CEO of our restaurant with 15 years of tradition,

131
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
one proud word about our soup with rice restaurant.

132
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,770
Hey.

133
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,440
It's embarrassing to do it like this.

134
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,860
♫ You came like a wind and you can't leave like the dew, ♫

135
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,940
♫ Don't ask, ♫

136
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,420
♫ Don't ask where the hair dryer is. ♫

137
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,470
♫ Don't ask. ♫

138
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,430
♫ Don't ask why ... ♫

139
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,810
Aigoo, what are you doing here when it's so busy?
You're going to burn a hole in the mirror.

140
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,400
All right. All right.

141
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,440
"Wow, what coincidence.

142
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,200
There's a restaurant I know about.

143
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,450
I am one year...

144
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,250
a regular for over 10 years.

145
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,050
The taste is amazing."

146
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,860
Enter.

147
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,730
What now? I'm doing it, so stop bothering me.

148
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,110
Don't just say that it tastes good,

149
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,350
"I have a memory of meeting the person I love
at this soup and rice restaurant."

150
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,800
Well, write those kinds of things, too.

151
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,500
I don't have that kind of memory.

152
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,510
Oh, come on.

153
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,050
You've been in and out of our restaurant wanting to meet a law student.

154
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,270
Anyway, all those times that I put up good
comments like crazy on your online shopping mall,

155
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,100
make sure to pay me back this time. Bo Eun Hae.

156
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,790
Anyway, wench. You're so calculating.

157
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,800
That place is tasty,

158
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,530
but the owner's daughter's temper is really...

159
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,030
Aigoo.

160
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,630
Why is it like this?

161
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,910
This man is useless, really.

162
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,770
Did you have a delicious meal?

163
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,160
How can you pull out the cord to the refrigerator?!

164
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,430
The refrigerator was dead.

165
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,490
Aigoo. Does your mind exist or not?!

166
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,350
What are you going to do if all the ingredients go bad?

167
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,240
This person. If it's something that will go bad after half a day,

168
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,710
then it's something that will harm
the reputation of the domestic ingredients.

169
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,010
Isn't that so, customer?
- Yes, yes, yes.

170
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,090
Try doing that one more time.

171
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,090
I don't need a receipt.

172
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,460
Yes. Thank you. Come again. Thank you.

173
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,700
Yes, this is the mobile shopping team. I'm Pi Song Hee.

174
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,610
The person responsible is out of the office right now.

175
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,870
What?

176
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,490
What does that mean?

177
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,110
There's a big problem. They say that a
soup and rice customer is hospitalized right now.

178
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,270
Oh, yes, yes.

179
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,980
For now the representative has gone there
and we're finding out the circumstances.

180
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,540
Yes, yes. Aiyoo.

181
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,120
The victim is making a big commotion for the CEO to come.

182
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,500
I think that we're firmly caught here.

183
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,150
Oh my head.

184
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,530
Aigoo.

185
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,940
This is Jasmine tea. They say that it's good for your nerves.

186
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,220
What's up with all this commotion?

187
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,570
They say that one loach makes the water murky.

188
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,850
Team Leader, because of this,
you won't get blamed for it all, will you?

189
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,730
Hey, how could...?

190
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,890
This is an accident that couldn't be predicted.

191
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,030
Would they put all that responsibility on the team leader?
That doesn't make sense.

192
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,560
It's because it's not just an accident.

193
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,150
What does that mean?

194
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,640
That Examination Soup and Rice Restaurant...
Information came in a while ago

195
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,350
saying, that place is Na Ae Ra's parents' store.

196
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,900
What?

197
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,540
She introduced her restaurant as her project.

198
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,090
If things like this are known there will be useless misunderstandings.

199
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,840
But the main MD is Seung Hyeon.

200
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,310
And we selected it at the judging.

201
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,310
Ae Ra probably requested it.

202
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,980
Team Leader, anyway, don't you think that
we should report it to Director Lee?

203
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,840
It's completely a big deal.

204
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,430
Is the Director inside?

205
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,110
She left a little early today because it's her birthday.

206
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,440
What?

207
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,200
What do I do then?

208
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,310
What is it?

209
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,380
Yes...the...the...the thing is...

210
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,530
I don't know. I'm going to the hospital now.

211
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,320
They said that he has a stomach ache
and rash all over his body.

212
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,730
What happened?

213
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,060
Mom, you're not a person who would use
ingredients that have gone bad.

214
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,190
What?

215
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,050
This way.

216
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,140
It's spread all over his body.

217
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,450
What do we do?

218
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,550
I'm sorry.

219
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,980
Right now we're looking into the business'
circumstances in detail.

220
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,690
Oh, geez.

221
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,780
What are you looking into?

222
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,190
You don't see this? These things over here...

223
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,380
Noona.
- Oh, lay down, lay down.

224
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,120
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,720
But still, the other customers that came that day
say that they don't have any problems...

226
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
This woman...since you said that you came to apologize,

227
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,890
I tried to speak nicely to you.

228
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,800
Then are you saying that my younger brother is lying, or what?!

229
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,580
No...it's not that...

230
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,380
Ae Ra.

231
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,000
Just a minute.

232
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,650
Get out, get out.

233
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,680
Mom, Dad, you're coming here doesn't help.

234
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,420
I'll resolve it well ...

235
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,140
No.

236
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,570
I'll go and try speaking to him well.

237
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,460
I told you that it's fine.

238
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,140
What are you going to say?

239
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,950
You're going to tell him that you took out the cord to the
refrigerator, because you wanted to do your hair?

240
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,480
Please.

241
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,900
Please, I told you not to make things more difficult.

242
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,930
I hear that other parents can't sleep
because they worry about their children,

243
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,990
but I'm so afraid of what accidents
you and Oppa will get into that I can't sleep.

244
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,820
If you're not going to be any help like this,

245
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,950
we should break the ties right now, seriously!

246
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,660
You b*tch!

247
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,170
Mom.

248
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,320
Where do you get off saying that to your father...

249
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,360
Is that something you should say to your parents right now?!

250
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,270
You ruthless wench!

251
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,350
Even if we're not great, parents are parents!

252
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,270
You shouldn't rashly say you want to break the ties, you wench!

253
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,950
Mom, calm down.

254
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,750
Soo Cheol, go put the restaurant for sale right now.

255
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,030
I'll take out the security deposit and get you
the settlement money, so don't worry, you b*tch!

256
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,070
No matter how your parents don't satisfy you,
how can you go saying you want to cut off all ties?!

257
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,280
You rude wench! You ruthless wench!

258
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,000
Mom!

259
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,030
I'm okay, so don't hate your daughter over me.

260
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,290
I did think that I wanted to see you one time,

261
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,260
but I didn't think that I'd get to see you like this.

262
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
Aiyoo, it's ok.

264
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,490
You, who listened to an immature father-in-law's request,

265
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,430
what wrong could you have committed.

266
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,310
Really, unbelievable!

267
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,480
Na Ae Ra. A person who works without
separating work life from personal life,

268
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,190
hand in your resignation letter!

269
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,090
Mom!

270
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,300
Mom!

271
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,800
You, go with your mom first.

272
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,040
What about you?
-I need to take care of this.

273
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,850
Go.

274
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,640
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm sorry.

276
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,950
I think the restaurant

277
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
made a mistake storing the food.

278
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,800
Look.

279
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,390
I'm sorry.. I'm deeply..

280
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,050
Whatever.

281
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,820
Tell the CEO to come.

282
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,190
Excuse me, we will take care of the hospital bills..

283
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,210
Bring the CEO.

284
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,830
If you don't,

285
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,940
your company that recommended a restaurant
that used spoiled food because it was cheap,

286
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,300
I will tell the press.

287
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,110
Oh, President, President.

288
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,070
Let go!

289
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,370
CEO!

290
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,570
Oh, what should I do!

291
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,360
I am the CEO.

292
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,530
Please talk with me.

293
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,800
Now we're talking.

294
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,720
Na Ae Ra, please go outside.

295
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,310
Hurry!

296
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,150
You are beautiful.

297
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,030
Noona, happy birthday.
-Thanks.

298
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,370
But aren't you too dressed up?

299
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,690
It's been a long time since I've seen you like this.

300
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,470
What did I do?

301
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,190
Happy birthday.

302
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,850
Where's CEO Cha?

303
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,550
Yes. I will try calling.

304
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,640
Should I reheat the soup?

305
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,020
No! How many times do you have to?

306
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,750
About not picking up the phone call,

307
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,350
in any case, ...
-He said he had an important meeting today.

308
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,790
I forgot.

309
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,160
CEO told me to pass the message.

310
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,140
How important is he, that stands up an old man?

311
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,550
The four of us can eat together.

312
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,980
It's good.
-Eat up.

313
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,180
I'm done.

314
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:40,510
You'll hear very soon from our legal team.

315
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,890
Let's go.

316
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,070
Please give a call when you're discharged.

317
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,190
The company will settle this.

318
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,410
Sorry.

319
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm deeply ashamed to see you.

320
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,560
It's okay.
-I heard they asked for a huge amount of compensation.

321
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,770
The company will settle this.

322
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,060
Don't worry too much.

323
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,550
And.. about this...

324
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,390
Ae Ra doesn't have any fault.

325
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,660
I did this without Ae Ra knowing,

326
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,570
because I thought she might stop me if she knew.

327
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,280
There are always problems between
the customers and the company,

328
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,200
and we can gain more customers

329
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,180
depending on how we solve that problem.

330
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,000
It is my fault.

331
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,480
If it wasn't for that interview...

332
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,140
Because that Soo Cheol holding that camcorder
and shoot-shoot-shooting this way and that...

333
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,340
The victim is saying that he is mentally stressed,

334
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,150
so go in and soothe his mind, please.
-Yes.

335
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,280
Let's go inside.

336
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,100
I shouldn't say this to a patient,

337
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,000
but that person asked for too much.

338
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,200
He's asking for someone's yearly salary as his compensation.

339
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,570
And it seemed like he was already better.

340
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,500
Investigate more about the victim.

341
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,360
Yes.

342
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,980
By the way, you got a lot of calls.

343
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,480
Are my clothes ready in the car?

344
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,710
Yes. Isn't it too late?

345
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,450
Director Guk?

346
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,790
Yeah?
-It is me.

347
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,450
Is it okay for me to come now?

348
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,780
Even though it is late, I want to keep my promise.

349
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,430
No, it's okay.

350
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,990
Don't pay too much attention.

351
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,830
Rest while you work.

352
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,230
I'm afraid that you'll get sick.

353
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,070
A birthday is only once a year,

354
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,830
so I don't want to pass over it today.

355
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,590
Hey, go quickly.

356
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,250
Yes.

357
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,000
As expected, Jeong Woo is kind.

358
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,300
Even while you two fight so hard,

359
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,890
hearing that there's a problem with your house,
he comes running and resolves it for you.

360
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,880
It's also his company's problem.

361
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,680
But is it that easy

362
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,800
for a CEO to go apologize like that?

363
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,230
I feel like

364
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,030
you guys are going to make up.

365
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,260
We fought too harshly to do that.

366
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,160
You regret it, right?

367
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,040
Harassing him with the lilies,

368
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,380
maybe I shouldn't have done it.

369
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,780
Hey,

370
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,450
why didn't you stop me when I was doing that?

371
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,790
Would you have listened even if I told you to stop?

372
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,260
You always had to stick your finger in it and taste it

373
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,020
and throw up to listen.

374
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,910
I don't know. I am sleepy. I'll sleep.

375
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,090
President!
-Let go.

376
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,190
I told you to let go.

377
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,270
CEO!

378
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,210
Oh, what should I do?

379
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,100
I am the CEO.

380
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,810
Please talk with me.

381
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,030
The company will take care of this.

382
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,330
Please don't worry, too much.

383
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,160
I am sorry.

384
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,990
♫ What can I do? ♫

385
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,590
♫ What can I do? ♫

386
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:01,000
♫ The person that you are, all this time I've been living, ♫

387
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,740
♫ Now what am I to do, ♫

388
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,700
♫ What can I do? ♫

389
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,350
♫ What can I do? ♫

390
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:20,650
♫ You're the reason I live ♫

391
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,380
♫ Now what can I do? ♫

392
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,530
♫ Now ~♫

393
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,920
It's my first time...

394
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,810
eating a birthday dinner in the middle of the night.

395
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,870
Even then, I feel happy.

396
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,360
I am sorry for being late, Chairman.

397
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,140
It's fine.

398
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,510
How am I supposed to eat this?

399
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,020
I will do it for you.

400
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,280
Never mind. It has come out.

401
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,310
You eat yours.

402
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,540
Let's take a picture.

403
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,350
Don't take a picture of me.

404
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,650
If I don't take the picture of the birthday girl, what will I take?

405
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,120
I won't upload it on SNS, so don't worry.

406
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,260
Hyung, take one with Noona.

407
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,140
Me?
-Yeah.

408
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,250
Hey, you guys are so stiff.

409
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,940
Get a bit closer.

410
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,000
I didn't know you even prepared this kind of thing.

411
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,900
I didn't know if you would like it.

412
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,580
It is really pretty.

413
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,930
That is a relief.

414
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,210
Didn't you work too hard today?

415
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,390
That was my work.

416
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,080
It's okay.

417
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,600
It's nothing compared to the things you've done for me.

418
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,340
You were always by my side.

419
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,360
It doesn't make sense for me to break
my promise to attend your birthday party.

420
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,090
Wow, this picture is... impressive.

421
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,290
Seung Hyeon took that picture.

422
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,230
Americans! Americans are coming.

423
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,290
This person, got compensation from GG Home Shopping.

424
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,750
Because he ate a spoiled marinated crabs.

425
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,150
Don't you smell something funny here?

426
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,140
Didn't the hospital say that it was food poisoning?

427
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,760
That is the problem.

428
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,510
He might've gotten food poisoning from eating somewhere else,

429
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,550
but I don't have any evidence to back-up my suspicion.

430
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,770
You're sure that none of the others who
ate the food that day got sick?

431
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,160
Yes.

432
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,340
Ae Ra!

433
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,000
Ae Ra! Ae Ra!

434
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,480
By chance, did you videotape anything on that day?

435
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,950
What?

436
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,350
Welcome!

437
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,640
Ah, Mother, what is the secret of this delicious rice soup?

438
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,940
I'm so busy! Ask your dad!

439
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,670
Ah, Dad...

440
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,520
Dad! Are you done yet?

441
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Very nice.

442
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,640
Aigoo, aigoo.

443
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,150
Oh!

444
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,250
It is this person, right?

445
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,570
Something urgent came up.
I'll pay for this before I leave.

446
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,010
Okay. Okay.

447
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,100
What the heck? He left without even eating it!

448
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,130
He didn't eat.

449
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,650
He didn't eat it, right?
-He didn't eat it.

450
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,700
You're right...

451
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,910
He didn't eat.

452
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,340
Something urgent came up.
I'll pay for this before I leave.

453
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,600
Okay, okay.

454
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,990
I told you not to do this!

455
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,230
Aish, really.

456
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,510
Sir and Madame, I...

457
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,520
I.. really didn't mean to do this...

458
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,280
Life was really tough.

459
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,320
You shouldn't do that even though you are having a hard time.

460
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,170
Of course.

461
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,860
Could you please forgive me this once?
If you do, then I'll...

462
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,970
You don't need to do that to me.

463
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,940
Later, the "higher ups" that you like so much will come

464
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,470
and charge you with fraud, work disturbance, and defamation.

465
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,840
So have a nice talk with them.

466
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,890
What am I to talk to you?

467
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,680
Let's go. The law will take care of the rest.

468
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,490
No. Excu..excuse me.

469
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,160
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

470
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,350
You are having a meal now?

471
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,350
You should have told me. I would have bought something.

472
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,650
It is okay. I'm almost done eating.

473
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,290
I heard it got resolved well.

474
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,310
Because of the scene that you found.

475
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,610
I got the report.

476
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,760
I guess you've been keeping your mind on it, huh?

477
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,080
Me?

478
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,620
Not at all.

479
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,320
Hey, why did you laugh?

480
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,670
I'm saying, I really haven't had my mind on it.

481
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,210
Did I say something? You just feel guilty for getting caught.

482
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,420
Hey, hey, they're almost here.

483
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,480
I'm fine.

484
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,680
Oh, they're here! They're here, they're here!

485
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,310
Oh, Ae Ra.

486
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,420
Ae Ra.

487
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,140
Come sit.

488
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,040
Ae Ra, you have a seat, too.

489
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,170
And Seung Hyeon, sit, too.

490
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,450
Since everything worked out well,

491
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,400
we should all have a drink.

492
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,870
We're having soju?

493
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,380
Should we make it beer?

494
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,540
Don't do that,

495
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,360
go bring the ginseng liquor from the room.

496
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,310
Mom, you want to open that?

497
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,510
Hurry up and get it.

498
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,700
Before your mom changes her mind.

499
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,810
Hey, Mom is celebrating big today!

500
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,330
Opening that expensive ginseng liquor!

501
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,390
Here, the aroma smells good.

502
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,070
Oh, Seung Hyeon.

503
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,200
You must not like the ginseng liquor, huh?

504
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,960
Mom, you should have a glass, too.

505
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,190
I'm fine.

506
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,920
Well, you can go ahead and pour me some.

507
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,070
Let's toast, toast, aigoo.

508
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,360
Aigoo, thank you very much for coming.

509
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,900
That's good stuff!

510
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,210
Long ago,

511
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,830
there was a saying, "Woo Hu Ji Sil."

512
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,960
What is that, Father?

513
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,120
Rain-Woo, After-Hu, Land-Ji, Fruit-Sil.
(These are Chinese characters)

514
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,750
It means that the ground gets firmer after the rain.

515
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,230
If it can be said in simple terms,
why use complicated words?

516
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,650
Between siblings,

517
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,740
and between parents and children,
they get upset and then get over it.

518
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,350
That's how everyone gets bonded together.

519
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,980
Then that means that our family

520
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,750
is extremely bonded together.

521
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,380
Since we fight every day.

522
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,370
What?
- We're bonded because of Oppa.

523
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,530
You just have to watch yourself.

524
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,450
Just you.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

525
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,070
Oh my!? Aigoo!

526
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,940
Try hitting him once.

527
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,800
You're kind of cute!
- Go ahead and smack him!

528
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,370
Here Seung Hyeon.
- Hit him, hit him one.

529
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,140
Take another glass.

530
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,770
You see, business is...

531
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,500
He's a little wacky.

532
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,290
I said we're colleagues.

533
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,570
You should give him a smack!

534
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,220
Just know that you're in big trouble!

535
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,880
Aigoo, still that's too much.

536
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,220
You should have seen that conman backpedaling.

537
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,940
It's good enough that it worked out well.

538
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,510
But...

539
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,460
how did you know to tell me

540
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,840
about the video footage taken at the store?

541
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,290
You were caught off guard.

542
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,150
I'm disappointed.

543
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,750
Anyway, thanks.

544
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,270
Thanks to you, I ate well.

545
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,680
What are you talking about?

546
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,240
The owner of the rice soup store

547
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,960
gave me some ginseng liquor and a table full of food.

548
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,290
What?

549
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,410
But...

550
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,650
when I eat together with that family,

551
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,400
I don't know if I'm eating through my mouth or through my nose.

552
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,700
Because it's so noisy.

553
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,350
It's a picture you'd never see at my house.

554
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,760
Really?

555
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,010
That's why I liked it.

556
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,360
Because it feels like people live there.

557
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,610
Dear,

558
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,290
you said you would trust me and follow me no matter what, right?

559
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,840
That goes without saying.

560
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,840
We're spouses together forever.

561
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,530
Didn't I tell you when I proposed?

562
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,940
That I'd never make you regret your decision.

563
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,800
I'll make sure to keep that promise.

564
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,650
Honey, is it hard for you?

565
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,430
No, not at all.

566
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,600
Bang Soon said she fought with her boyfriend.

567
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,440
Why?

568
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,060
Bang Soon asked her boyfriend...

569
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,250
who he would rescue first if she and his mother fell into the water.

570
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,570
When she asked,

571
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:29,170
Bang Soon's boyfriend hesitated.

572
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,510
Isn't that crazy?

573
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:37,720
You wouldn't be the same, would you?

574
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,040
What is it?

575
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,460
Oppa,

576
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,020
you would save your mother first?

577
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,240
I don't know.

578
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,310
I'm really disappointed.

579
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,560
If my father and you fell in the water,
I was going to save you first, no matter what.

580
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,530
Are those words...

581
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,500
really true?

582
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,120
About saving me first?

583
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,000
Of course.

584
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,870
If I marry you, I have to trust and live with you forever.

585
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,860
Ae Ra,

586
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,310
but you should still rescue your father first.

587
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:33,200
They can make a good chance out of this.

588
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,250
Oh!

589
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,400
How is that a foul? Is he blind?

590
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,070
It is a foul. We pushed him from behind.

591
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,200
Earlier, the French guy pushed him from behind just like that, too.

592
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,480
He didn't get caught by the referee.

593
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,630
Honey.

594
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,960
Whose side are you on?
How can you say that when we're about to lose?

595
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,170
But still, if it's wrong, it's wrong.

596
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,500
Excessive patriotism is like poison.

597
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,930
You have a tendency to watch sports with too much emotion.

598
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,250
Just enjoy it.

599
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:39,580
I'm going to go in and sleep.

600
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,470
Honey, why are you being like this again?

601
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,160
Leave me alone.

602
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,350
Honey, the chicken's here!

603
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,240
Open it.

604
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,680
I ordered half of it fried, and half with sauce.

605
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,730
What should I give you?

606
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,360
That one.

607
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,190
This one?

608
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,540
Not that one.

609
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,120
That one.

610
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,630
This one?

611
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,920
Honey,

612
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,310
can I turn on the TV?

613
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,450
If you want to.

614
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,580
Goal. Goal!
♫ Mirror, mirror, ♫

615
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,470
♫ who do you like?
Heaven, heaven, ♫

616
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:16,880
♫ Who are you thinking of? ♫

617
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,570
Uh, something was on you.

618
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:18,910
I thought it might ruin your image if
you went around with this on you.

619
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,480
I'm sorry.

620
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,590
Ah. Thanks for

621
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,240
your concern.

622
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,190
Then...

623
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,120
A note?

624
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,620
Americano. $3

625
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,160
It's just a receipt.

626
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,490
After investigating into this, I've found that
during the process of working up this deal,

627
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,840
there was no bribery or special favors involved.

628
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,810
Ah, the restaurant was chosen under strict evaluation.

629
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,440
That Guk Seung Hyeon did absolutely nothing wrong,

630
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,270
I want to say this with confidence.

631
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,300
The problem is Na Ae Ra.

632
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,900
Her drinking habits are bad, and...

633
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,100
Na Ae Ra is someone that I value.

634
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:35,040
And this time it was my decision, so it was my responsibility.

635
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,580
Not at all.

636
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,550
If you insist on making someone take responsibility for this,

637
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,430
please make me, the Team Leader, take responsibility.

638
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,370
Our Seung Hyeon, this incident...

639
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,990
threw you more off guard than anyone else, right?

640
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,570
In life,

641
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,560
these things happen all the time.

642
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,670
However,

643
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,300
I was amazed at your skills

644
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,350
at handling this matter, even as an intern.

645
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,570
Yes, thank you.

646
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,290
After the issue with the black consumer,

647
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,390
Na Ae Ra, I've seen you in a new light.

648
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,590
Yes?
- After the incident occurred,

649
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:32,380
you responded quite promptly, and I think it was outstanding.

650
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,360
Uh, m...me?

651
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,900
Yes!

652
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,240
Hey, I made this using the best quality beef bone.

653
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,610
Be sure to tell him that his ex-mother-in-law packed it
with her heart, with so much love that...

654
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,770
it's incomparable to the expiration date of this soup.
(Beef bone broth has an extremely long exp. date)

655
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,610
I got it.

656
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,390
I'll meet him and make sure to tell him.

657
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,390
You aren't thinking of giving it
directly to Son-in-law Cha yourself, are you?

658
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:10,260
I should get credit by giving it directly to him.

659
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,280
I know, Father.

660
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,120
You need to give it to Ae Ra.
That way, when she's giving it to him,

661
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,080
she can say, "Thanks for helping this time."

662
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,850
"Should I buy dinner?"

663
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,760
Hey. While doing that...huh?

664
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,590
Ahhh.

665
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,890
You truly are a strategist.

666
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,000
It's not the first time I'm doing this, you know?

667
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,630
I should've gone into politics.

668
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,960
Be quiet!

669
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,830
Okay, I got it.

670
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,700
Make sure you tell in-law Cha.

671
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,210
That our whole family

672
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,100
is truly grateful for his efforts.

673
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,980
Thanks? What thanks?

674
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,040
The CEO should at least do that much.

675
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,860
Does he get paid that salary for nothing?

676
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,430
I know you're my sister, but in times
like this, it's hard to like you.

677
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,690
If it weren't for in-law Cha, we would have been fooled by that conman.

678
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,080
If he didn't tell us about the footage
where the guy didn't eat anything and left,

679
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,240
would we have even thought to check the video?

680
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,380
What are you talking about?

681
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,830
Who made this one line of code into ten?

682
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,610
It makes it hard to find the mistake.

683
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,940
The code is so long that the program has only become heavier.

684
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,310
This is why the service is so slow.

685
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,550
How's the new function upgrade coming?

686
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,820
Yes, we're in the process of beta-testing it.

687
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,170
Would you like to take a look?

688
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,080
I made it, decreasing the lines of code here.

689
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,100
Wow, how can he so easily fix code that someone else did?

690
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,970
CEO Cha isn't called a genius for no reason.

691
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,910
We'll probably be up all night again, huh?

692
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,580
Since even the CEO is here, working overtime.

693
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,330
Do you even need to say...?

694
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:24,990
Let's go.

695
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,600
Come to the rooftop for just a moment.

696
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,130
I have something to say.

697
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,570
You should have at least told me.

698
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,130
How am I supposed to know if you don't tell me?

699
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:27,860
What?

700
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,950
Why didn't you tell me?

701
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,340
What?
-About the black consumer video footage.

702
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:39,030
I heard that it was you who told Oppa
and Guk Seung Hyeon about it.

703
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,000
Does the CEO have to report these things to an intern?

704
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,600
Na Ae Ra,

705
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,850
you have a really confident side.

706
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:52,080
It's not that.

707
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,890
Anyway,

708
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,490
at the hospital,

709
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,280
I was thankful.

710
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,330
Well,

711
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,720
I only did what a CEO should have done.

712
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,200
In any case,

713
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,470
as an employee making trouble for the company,

714
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,230
I'm sorry.

715
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:20,880
It isn't even anything.

716
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,300
And I'm sorry for a lot of things this whole time.

717
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,190
I'm sorry for vandalizing your car,

718
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,170
and for uploading the old pictures,

719
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,290
and for causing you to have an allergic reaction,

720
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,110
I'm sorry.

721
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,310
Oh.

722
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,020
After slightly charming you,

723
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,550
I imagined pushing you into the ocean and killing you, too.

724
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,760
Well, I did that.

725
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,560
You did?

726
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,290
Well, it's okay.

727
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,690
When my internship is over,

728
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,960
I'll resign from the company, so don't worry.

729
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,130
I won't be a nuisance anymore.

730
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,120
Can I trust you?

731
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,250
In any case, if that's your point, I understand.

732
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,870
I don't want to think about it anymore.

733
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,370
Hey!

734
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,380
CEO Cha!

735
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,490
Is that all you can say to someone who is sorry?

736
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,640
Did I ever lie to you?

737
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,160
When my internship is over, even if you beg me to stay, I won't!

738
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,650
You say you can't lie?

739
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,540
What did I (lie about)?
- To give you an example...

740
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,100
You...

741
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,040
You said that you loved Cha Jeong Woo,

742
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,590
but you merely wanted a man who passed the exam.

743
00:58:56,590 --> 00:59:00,130
You said you would be happy marrying me,

744
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,410
but you only liked my circumstances that gave you stability.

745
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,910
Those are the lies you said.

746
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,710
Were they not?

747
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,900
Those lies, you said them, too.

748
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,580
You said you would never start a business or invest in stocks.

749
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,910
And then you go and resign all on your own?

750
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,410
You...

751
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:23,860
you keep being so cynical about me being a gold-digger...

752
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,860
How can anyone love without circumstances?

753
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,650
Did I like the circumstances you had?

754
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,210
Yeah, I did. Why?

755
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,020
You didn't play any tricks, you were smart, humble,

756
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,740
you had a stable job,

757
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,960
and above all that,

758
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,940
I liked the Cha Jeong Woo that only loved me.

759
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,590
All of those...

760
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:01,860
were reasons and circumstances for liking you.
What are you going to do about it?

761
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,730
Did I ask for a whole lot?

762
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,110
Anyway, we made a promise.

763
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,190
You dumped me when that promise lost its appeal.

764
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,950
A promise...

765
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,900
should have been kept by both sides.

766
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,590
You broke our ordinary happiness.

767
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,700
And in return, succeeded like this.

768
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,640
Isn't that good enough?

769
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,680
Do you have to resent me?

770
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,840
Back then, I lost the confidence

771
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,430
to make you happy, and the confidence that I could be happy.

772
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,710
When we were together, it wasn't only double the joy,

773
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,590
it was double the poverty,

774
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,780
and double the sadness.

775
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,980
That's why I said to break up.

776
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,770
Although it's an already a broken dish,

777
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:06,060
please don't insult that sincerity that I had given you.

778
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,510
Then I become too wretched.

779
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,340
Sincerity?

780
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:17,650
What's insulting and what's wretched?

781
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:23,490
Do you know how difficult it was for me,
and how hurt I was because of you?

782
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,480
Yeah,

783
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,930
it must have hurt.

784
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,870
I know. I'm sorry.

785
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,900
My mom told me to give it to you.

786
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,820
My mom is crazy, too.

787
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,600
What kind of mother-in-law does this for a divorced son-in-law?

788
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,330
♫ What can I do? ♫

789
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:38,860
♫ What can I do? ♫
