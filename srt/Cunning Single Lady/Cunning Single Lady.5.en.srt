1
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,860
When did you

2
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,540
do all this?

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,930
A little at a time.

4
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,160
Since this is my dream.

5
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,940
It would be nice if in the living room and the kitchen, there were a lot of potted plants throughout.

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,100
-Potted plants?
-Yes.

7
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,900
While they grow, I can see 'my happiness has grown this much,'

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,260
I'm going to confirm it each and every day.

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,940
Tada. I'll work diligently and have you live in a house like this.

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,220
This one is our baby.

Resignation Letter [Na Ae Ra]

♫ What can I do, ♫

19
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,290
I received all of those suspicions. You don't know how they treated me like a criminal at the company.

20
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,280
Here, look over here. Cheese.
♫ What can I do now, ♫

21
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,220
Thank you.

22
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,040
Don't mention it, CEO. I'll work much harder.

23
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,510
Episode 5
If you look at it as the merits of standing up for our company,

24
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,570
of course, we have to formally reward you for it.

25
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,620
Seeing as how it's a security issue, I feel apologetic that we had to take care of it so quietly.

26
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,710
No. For me, the fact that I was a small help to the company

27
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,780
makes me happy.

28
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,110
Truthfully, the customer data is the most important information inside the company.

29
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,950
Since you blocked that from leaking out,

30
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,630
I will definitely compensate you in some way.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,380
I mean, rather than saying that that's only because
of Ms. Na Ae Ra's merit...

32
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,330
To tell you again, I only assisted.

33
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,530
Na Ae Ra's ability to spot the criminal was the decisive point in this.

34
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,890
But from the start, wasn't the cause of the problem the lost identification card...

35
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,660
It's not loss, but theft.

36
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,300
Weren't you the heroine of this month's dinner date
with the CEO?

37
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,910
Isn't that right?

38
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,070
Yes. At that time, the CEO was so good to me.

39
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,370
I was extremely touched.

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,570
He drove himself and we went for a nice drive and

41
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,540
he showed me a nice place, too.

42
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,470
CEO, you know how to do things like that, too?

43
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,730
Wow, I'm jealous.

44
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,360
Well...

45
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,010
Since it was a founding anniversary event, I did my best.

46
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,780
Today, we have even these good things happening.

47
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,940
Since coming into this company, it's emotion placed
on top of emotion.

48
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,690
CEO always says that a meeting with an employee is fate.

49
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,180
I think we have a good connection.

50
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,560
Yes, I think of it that way too, Director.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,250
CEO...

52
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,370
I'm sorry. Chung Sung Group's Madame is here.

53
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,750
She found out that Director Guk Yeo Jin is here.

54
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,460
I understand.

55
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,670
I'll go to the restroom for a minute.

57
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,240
You crafty jerk.

58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,670
-What?
Vicious jerk.

59
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,000
Jerk.
-Hey!

60
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,420
Noona, please don't say anything to dad.

61
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,250
This is something that has nothing to do with work ability,

62
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,820
he'll uselessly get his hopes up.

63
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,280
If I don't tell him, will Father not know?

64
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,720
Noona!

65
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,940
That's...

66
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,990
The reason I took you to that house that night...

67
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,730
I didn't have any intention of going that far.

68
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,790
It wasn't your intention to go that far?

69
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,830
As I recall, you had a lot to say at that place.

70
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,560
As if you practiced and practiced and prepared it.

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,030
Throwing me away because it was hard at present.

72
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,320
Now that I've appeared before your eyes, attaching yourself to me...

73
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,980
That's not a dream. That's just greed.

74
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,440
Marriage wasn't a promise to you, but it was greed.

75
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,550
I don't know why I had to meet a person like you.

76
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,430
Even if in my next life, I don't want to meet you again.

77
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,960
Now I want to become happy also.

78
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,660
No, that's what you said first on the TV broadcast.

79
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,270
If I think of then,

80
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,650
why did I have to meet a person like that?

81
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,880
Even if it's in my next life,

82
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,530
I don't ever want to meet my ex-husband.

83
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,180
Now...

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,900
Now I really want to become happy.

85
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,310
Yes.

86
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,910
Wow, the CEO is much more idle than I thought.
You saw that?

87
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,130
You being in my company,

88
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,210
what is your motive?

89
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,970
I came, so I can eat and live.

90
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,230
You acted like you had no blood nor tears,

91
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,980
but I guess it's uncomfortable for you to see me.

92
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,960
Do you need more money?

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,330
Do people who have less money seem like nothing to you now that you've earned some money?

94
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,590
Who was the person who mocked the weak and penniless person?

95
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,530
Do you have the right to say that?

96
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,980
You're the one who left the household to me, who was weak and penniless.

97
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,130
Never mind. What is it that you want?

98
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,850
What I want?

99
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,920
What I want is this:

100
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,360
To stay in your life and bother you forever.

101
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,100
I don't think you know, but I can fire you with just one word.

102
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,530
So immature, so immature. Stop fooling around!

103
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm the person who saved your company!

104
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,030
I'm your life's savior. Hey, jerk!

105
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,970
What? What?

106
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,410
Hey, jerk?!

107
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,940
Really.

108
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,020
CEO, are you uncomfortable somewhere?

109
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,260
I don't think that you're eating well.

110
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,120
No.

111
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,080
Why? Are you not feeling well?

112
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,620
If you have indigestion, should I prick your finger for you?

113
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,820
I'm good at pricking fingers. (common Asian remedy for indigestion).

114
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,050
No. Excuse me for a moment.

115
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,310
Hyung. Once the internship is over, you're going to fire me no matter what.

116
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,400
That's the compensation I want.

117
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,160
But why were you drinking alcohol with Na Ae Ra?

118
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,880
Well, there's a story behind that.

119
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,500
What story?

120
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,030
Why do you go around making stories with just any woman? What story?!

121
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,710
Well... it's not much.

122
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,110
She picked up my muffler that I dropped...

123
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,180
Why are you getting angry?

124
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,060
Don't make a scandal inside the company.

125
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,950
I've warned you.

126
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,360
It would have been nice if Ae Ra took after even half of your careful behavior.

127
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,720
That's kind of regretful for me.

128
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,860
Truthfully, there are some parts that
Ae Ra shouldn't have done to you.

129
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,710
When you were young, how popular and smart were you.

130
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,100
Everybody knew you from Joo San University

131
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,190
and even people from Eung Byun University knew you.

132
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,350
Up until 8th grade,

133
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,690
you were always in 1st place. How did this happen?

134
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,420
Even I'm upset.

135
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,330
It's because I was born in the wrong era.

136
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,630
Thanks.

137
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,070
What are you doing here?

138
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,140
How did you know to come here?

139
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,120
I was about to leave now.

140
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,430
I was going to see you come in before I left.

141
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,410
Hurry up and leave!

142
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:10,990
-Huh?
-I'm leaving.

143
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,630
Now what are you planning to do?

144
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm going. I'm going, going now.

145
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,960
What more are you planning to do?

146
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,030
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

147
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,090
Now what are you going to do?

148
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,010
Quit asking me what I'm going to do.

149
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,230
If I knew that, would I be here like this?

150
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,590
That's what I mean.

151
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,760
You shouldn't have let someone like that
into the company in the first place.

152
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm regretting that myself, too.

153
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,580
This wouldn't have happened if
you didn't watch that dating show!

154
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,340
It happened because I ended up watching it with you.

155
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,980
Again, again. You're taking it out on me.
Are you really going to be like this?

156
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,370
Did I give her the job? You're the one who accepted her.

157
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,070
Ugh, I shouldn't have gone to the police station!

158
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,420
We shouldn't have met again.

159
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,070
Oh, my head hurts!

160
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,610
Hey, let's turn on some music.

161
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,420
You startled me! What is that?

162
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,560
What?!

163
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,510
I'm going back to work at that company.

164
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,070
Do you have no pride?

165
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,880
You're going to keep working there after Jeong Woo treated you like that?

166
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,220
This game hasn't ended yet.

167
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,790
The real game starts now.

168
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,740
Now what, what, what are you talking about?

169
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,380
I can't end like this.

170
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,490
As many tears as I've shed,
I have to make him shed just as many.

171
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,960
Hey, hey!

172
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,610
As my standard, I think

173
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,540
when a woman has a knife in her hands, she should at least chop it into cubes.

174
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,860
This isn't right.

175
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,100
You're getting dissuaded by Jeong Woo's pace.

176
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,250
Just forget him completely

177
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,980
and start fresh. Losing is winning, you know.

178
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,980
It's not like I haven't thought about that, but...

179
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,280
But what?

180
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,040
Cha Jeong Woo has gone too far to do that.

181
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,470
If someone is going to step on that detestable jerk...

182
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,350
I gained a sense of duty that I'm the only one to carry that out.

183
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,920
A woman warrior is born.

184
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,880
But you already resigned.

185
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,390
What are you going to do about that?

186
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,990
Resignation? Oh! That's right!

187
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,550
Are you looking for this?

188
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,550
Resignation
Na Ae Ra

189
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,310
Wait, why do you have that?

190
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,690
Were you going to quit?

191
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,770
What do you mean quit? To benefit whom?

192
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,150
But why did you suddenly write something like that?

193
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,790
Don't try to know too much about a person's private life.

194
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,040
It had fallen on the floor.

195
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,530
Aren't you leaving for the day?

196
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,440
I was going to give you a report, but I thought of a thing I needed to fix.

197
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,100
What did I say?

198
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,020
I knew he could do big things!

199
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,140
I heard that he flipped him over in one judo move.

200
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,330
Of course, of course, isn't he my son?

201
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,170
He's lucky he didn't die.

202
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,600
On the outside, he's a gentleman, but has a competitive spirit.

203
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,010
He takes exactly after you, Chairman.

204
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,280
Does he?

205
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,710
Did you go to Chairman Jang in Ulsan?

206
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,220
This time, Father, you were a coward.

207
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,330
Intimidating CEO Cha's business like that,

208
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,560
I'd rather you not do it again.

209
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,250
You can't win people over by just treating them nicely.

210
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,530
You have to keep a tight rein.

211
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,870
Win people over?

212
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,670
Since you're a person that doesn't even know how to win the heart of a family,

213
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,040
I can't really believe you.

214
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,650
What did you say?!

215
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,130
Now that you know a little about business...

216
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,950
You have to realize that your methods,

217
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,570
won't gain you a thing anymore.

218
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,920
Didn't you sacrifice too many things to figure that out?

219
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,260
And I've also... lost many things.

220
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,620
Stop! Stop the car! Stop!

221
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,540
Stop the car! Stop! Stop!

222
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,290
Hello, James!

223
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,330
Stop the car! Your father's waiting!

224
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,310
He's very worried!

225
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,630
What? I can't hear you!

226
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,520
Stop the car! Your father's waiting!
He's very worried!

227
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,060
Stop! Stop the car! Stop!

228
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,090
Back then,

229
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,650
I lost the one I loved. But this time,

230
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,740
I'm going to protect him.

231
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,030
Seung Woo, something good must have happened to you.

232
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,340
It's so funny.

233
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,120
What do we do?

234
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,770
Hello.

235
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,110
4 stages...

236
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,670
Unbelievable!

237
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,830
Look, look!

238
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,800
Just a minute! Just a minute!

239
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,510
What is this?

240
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,770
Oh!

241
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,260
CEO?

242
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,210
Who is this?

243
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,760
4 Stages of CEO Cha's Transformation.

244
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,720
Is this how your past is revealed?

245
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,200
It wasn't me!

246
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,810
I only know you from stage 3.

247
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,590
I think this picture is before you passed the exam.

248
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,380
I said these are versions that I don't even know.

249
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,850
I checked the IP address and it came out as Kang Min Yeong.

250
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,900
Na Ae Ra,

251
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,450
so childish... Really..

252
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,560
Hello?

253
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,170
It's you, isn't it?

254
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,810
What are you referring to?

255
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,720
Don't try to deny it.

256
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,190
This is a serious violation of the rights to one's portraits. If I sue you ...

257
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,130
If you become furious over something I did to humor people, I'll feel awkward.

258
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,990
Consider it a little fan service.
Aren't you the star of this company?

259
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,780
Once in awhile, isn't it the job of a star to show their embarrassing side to the fans?

260
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,210
This little....

261
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,240
Yes, this is Na Ae Ra.

262
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,190
Come see me.

263
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,900
I'm sorry, but I'm working right now.

264
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,730
Oh, CEO, hello!

265
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,230
The door is now closing.

266
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,250
I bought these during lunch at the flower shop.

267
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,620
I thought they would be nice to put in the office.

268
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,500
Seriously.

269
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,410
Try smelling them, the fragrance is really nice.

270
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,770
I'm allergic to lilies.

271
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,950
Really? I'm sorry.

272
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,430
I didn't know.

273
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,240
Our mobile messenger's functions

275
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,640
are at the top.

276
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,740
So at this point, the background or the color

277
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,680
changing ...

278
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,020
But we should still develop something new.

279
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,780
I don't think it's right

280
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,840
to win by the design.

281
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,540
The new service will lead to brand loyalty.

282
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,900
If we want to continue competing on this mobile platform,

283
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,590
we need something to distinguish ourselves.

284
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,410
Ah! If the etem (said item as etem) comes out, it will be nice.

285
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,290
Oh, I see. Item.

286
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,920
Oh, we've decided the crane point will be the new item.

287
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,590
Let's see the screen now.

288
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,420
That's the original messenger background.

289
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,580
Also...

290
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,700
What's the matter?

291
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,520
Allergies.

292
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,300
Allergies?

293
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,620
I'm allergic to lilies.

294
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,930
Lilies?

295
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,620
Where were there lilies?

296
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,930
I know, right? They just suddenly popped out from somewhere.

297
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,360
Ay, this is big trouble.

298
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,850
Gosh.

299
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:30,070
If she just hadn't cursed me, I would have said thanks.
But that temper...

300
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,760
The way I see it, your company life

301
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,800
is going to become difficult.

302
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,120
Just get on your knees, and say you were completely wrong...

303
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,530
Be quiet, punk! Just go!

304
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,230
Your bad habit again.

305
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,650
Whenever I'm right, you tell me to be quiet and leave!

306
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,340
Hyungnim, that's being cowardly!

307
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,880
A straight uppercut isn't going to do it.

308
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,420
If he gets jabbed a hundred times, he'll get KO'ed.

309
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,540
Cha Jeong Woo

310
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,330
Come see me for a moment.

311
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,220
I was here seeing the team next door, and stopped by.

312
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,910
If you're interested in delivery, too, take a look at this.

313
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,770
Ahjumma, I'm working right now!

314
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,680
I'm sorry.
-Ahjumma.

315
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,940
I'll take a look.

316
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,890
Ah, yes.

317
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,160
I'm not sure if I'll order,

318
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,700
but would you like to go out and talk?

319
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:18,000
Wow, Na Ae Ra is really thoughtful. Very thoughtful.

320
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,470
No... Pi Song Hee.

321
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,320
If you cut off a person like that,
how embarrassed would she feel?

322
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,180
She can't sleep at night, she'll be so sad.

323
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,970
From now on, use nicer words.

324
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,120
That's so sad.

325
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,180
Be quiet.

326
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,320
If you tell me to be quiet, I'll scream.

327
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,600
You're going to be fired starting tomorrow.

328
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,630
Just wait and see.

329
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,400
When they've done that much for the company,
you're still not going to make them regular employees?

330
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,350
Then when the internship is completed,
does that mean they can be sent away?

331
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,750
I'm just saying to wait a little longer.

332
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,370
There is still time left in their internship, and if we give them special acceptance suddenly,

333
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,740
what will the other employees' morale be like?

334
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,850
Why would giving special acceptance to a person who has set merits to the company,

335
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,930
cause problems with other employees' morale?

336
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,120
If you suddenly give special acceptance,

337
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,690
we have to admit the leaked information and
it will be known to the public.

338
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:55,120
Also, it all started when Na Ae Ra lost her ID.

339
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,630
Fine. Then I'll look into another way

340
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,830
to properly recognize their efforts.

341
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:40,420
I thought this would be better to avoid people and talk comfortably.

342
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,970
What is it?

343
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,150
I'm thankful that you helped the company.

344
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,890
Sincerely.

345
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,300
I want to compensate you for what you've done. As much as you want.

346
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,430
No, more than that.

347
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,790
And so?

348
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,520
So,

349
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,260
since it isn't comfortable running into each other...

350
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,270
You want me to leave?

351
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,220
Seeing each other often at the same place is a little weird.

352
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,420
Let's settle this right this time.

353
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,070
I don't want to. I'm not leaving.

354
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,150
I had to work so hard to get into this company. Why should I leave?

355
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,820
You didn't get in because you did well.

356
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,280
I got you in.

357
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,600
Really? Why did you do it?

358
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,390
Ah, that's right. How well you turned out,

359
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,180
you wanted to show it off childishly,

360
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,290
and you were going to despicably play with me, right?

361
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,080
That...

362
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,090
I didn't know things would turn out like this. I regret it, too.

363
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,380
That's why ... Let's take it back.

364
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,170
I said I don't want to.

365
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,630
I've never been in a company like this, and

366
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,010
I like going around wearing a badge, and the pay is good.

367
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,190
I'm going to keep working. I like it.

368
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,850
You hate everything about me, but you like my company?

369
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,390
Gosh...!

370
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,750
As a CEO, how can you not distinguish personal life from business life.

371
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,320
And also, can you waste the time of an
employee who is so busy working?

372
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,820
It's working hours.

373
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,240
After I torment you to my heart's content, and get an apology,

374
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,010
I wouldn't stay even if you asked me to.

375
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,140
Yes?

376
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,590
I'm feeling frustrated,

377
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,540
but do you want to go for an on-spot inspection?

378
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,910
What?

379
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,150
Let's leave the cars and people behind.

380
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,270
It won't be good to stand out.

381
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,670
Alright.

382
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,650
Truthfully,

383
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,700
it's been a while since I went on a subway.

384
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,740
Sometimes you have to ride the subway like this
and see the people in person

385
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,800
to be in touch with reality.

386
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,870
I feel so strange when people sit like this

387
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,180
and look at my website.

388
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,020
Did you see the messenger that person used?

389
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,480
Our service is in the safety zone, but

390
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,640
we should modify and improve our tracking services.

391
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,620
That will speed up the mobile shopping service.

392
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,060
Yes.

393
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,620
Watch out on your left.

394
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,040
They will catch on that you're staring at their cell phone, because of the reflection.

395
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,000
Okay.

396
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,490
I thought about

397
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,830
having a contest, open to our users.

398
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,160
The employees can participate, too.

399
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,390
Sometimes, compared to input from professionals,

400
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,630
regular ideas from regular people

401
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,920
can be much better at helping us develop our service.

402
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,660
As our number of users grew,

403
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,040
it's true that we didn't focus on service development.
"Creating with users, hand-in-hand..."

404
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,560
That's a good idea. Let's do that.

405
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,950
We're agreeing with each other for the first time in a long time.

406
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,930
Are you okay?

407
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,460
I'm sorry. I'm a little dizzy.

408
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,170
Hold onto me.

409
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,840
Director Guk, you're someone I can't figure out.

410
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,640
I'm disappointed.

411
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,240
I thought you and I

412
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,400
were closer than anyone else.

413
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,130
We are close, but you did something I didn't know about.

414
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,230
I heard you met CEO Jang.

415
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,570
It was a surprise, but I was thankful.

416
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,310
Sincerely.

417
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,370
But when there's a problem, let's solve it together.
Don't try to solve it yourself.

418
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,320
I.. am not a weak CEO.

419
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,720
I'm always grateful to you, although I don't express it a lot.

420
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,560
From the first time I saw you and until now, you were always by my side,

421
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,200
and you helped me without showing it.

422
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,700
If you do nothing but work, when will you be in a relationship and get married?

423
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,530
Did I ask a shameless question?

424
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,140
I always make you work overtime.

425
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,940
I... was married before.

426
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,520
It was a marriage between the two of us

427
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,410
that no one congratulated.

428
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,360
I didn't know..

429
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,340
I don't regret it... because I really loved him.

430
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,210
Even though he's not with me right now...

431
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,290
Then he's really unlucky, letting a woman like you go.

432
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,420
I'm sorry if I said anything rude.

433
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,350
You didn't.

434
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,500
You'll find someone else,

435
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,200
who will make you forget about all your pains from the past.

436
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,050
Yes.

437
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,830
I hope he's not too far away.

438
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,940
On that side, shine the blue light.

439
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,230
This way! Yes! The pink box!

440
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,100
No! No! This way!

441
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,590
Aish!

442
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,420
Until next time.

443
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,850
Yes.

444
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm home!

445
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,620
You're here?

446
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,580
You're here, Miss?
-Yes.

447
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,160
Noona!

448
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,250
The day after tomorrow... let's have a family party on your birthday!

449
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,750
Let's call Jeong Woo Hyung, too.
What do you think?

450
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,240
I don't know.. Will he be able to come?
He's such a busy person.

451
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,860
Don't make him uncomfortable with our family business,
okay?

452
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,940
Dad, are you okay with it?

453
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,310
Oh yes, sure.

454
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,390
Your birthday comes every year,

455
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,240
therefore I thought you said, don't make a fuss!

456
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,160
I have something to report.

457
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,300
You're going to say something trivial again.

458
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,080
So why are you lowering your voice?

459
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,100
This is real.

460
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,680
This evening, Miss and CEO Cha...

461
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,400
CEO Cha?

462
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,840
Without their secretaries, only the two of them...

463
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,250
Only the two of them?

464
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,860
Rode a subway.

465
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,100
Is that your report?

466
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,570
Yes.

467
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,450
Contest: When you sent the wrong text message and the problem it caused. Tell us about your unpleasant experience!

468
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,030
Award: $5,000 dollars! If you win.

469
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,550
As much as our "talk" is loved by our customers,

470
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,270
we're trying to provide new services to them.

471
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,150
You've had bad experiences with messengers, haven't you?

472
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,740
We're trying to develop new services that people "wished" they had when they were having such experiences.

473
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,680
I'm short on ideas to participate,

474
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,000
but if I don't participate, I'm worried that it would make me look like I don't have any passion for my job.

475
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,580
It's really difficult!

476
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,650
And Interns: please go out to the field(outside work) with Supervisor Gam.

477
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,990
Our project on restoring small back alley businesses

478
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,350
is in the works, so...

479
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,090
Please look into many good, hidden shops.

480
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,320
Yes.
-Yes.

481
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,320
Okay... then, let's go check it out!

482
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,390
Even if some people come on strong,

483
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,320
don't show your weakness.

484
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,840
Go in with confidence, okay?

485
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,570
Okay. Let's go!

486
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,370
We're trying to advertise far and wide

487
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,910
for your business to grow.

488
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,970
That's what we'll do for you.

489
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,530
I'm telling you that we don't need it.

490
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,900
It's already really crowded.

491
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,530
Oh, well then, we'll lower the sales commission, and

492
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,180
we'll go along with whatever you want..

493
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,150
I said I'm fine. Ask someone else.

494
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,740
Noonim!
(Older sister or term used for older women whom you're friendly with)

495
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,150
Don't be like this...

496
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,650
This man! What do you mean "Noonim?"

497
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,910
Why am I your "Noonim"?

498
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,530
You look like a pale colored cucumber pickle!

499
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,020
If you're going to come again, come with better looks!

500
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,130
You have no manners!

501
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,130
Why is their business doing so well?
They're doing too well...

502
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,440
Ah, she's so sensitive.

503
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,760
I have lived too long... This is entertaining!

504
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,440
Oh..

505
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,530
Yes, Team Leader.

506
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,040
Oh yes, that..

507
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,550
Oh, yes. I'll go back and give you a report.

508
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,170
Ah, I need to go back to the company because I have an important matter to take care of.

509
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,560
So, you two do the rest.

510
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,100
Do as I taught you.

511
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,410
Ah, this company doesn't function without me!

512
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,500
Work hard.

513
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,270
Ah, really.

514
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,300
Where should we go first?

515
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,260
Well, wherever our feet lead us.

516
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,360
What a show-off!

517
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,390
We provide the individualized custom package for each and every client.

518
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,820
We also hold private events.

519
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,910
If you look at this...

520
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,920
Hey, come faster!

521
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,110
My stomach..

522
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,620
Why? What's wrong?

523
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,290
My stomach...

524
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,770
What's wrong with your stomach?

525
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,120
My stomach...

526
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,090
is hungry.

527
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,630
You're wasting my energy on such useless things!

528
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,420
I'm too hungry to work!

529
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,360
Let's do rock-paper-scissors
and the loser has to pay for the food.

530
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,150
Are we here to play? Just eat anything quickly.

531
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,210
Then I'm going to skip work and run away.

532
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,270
So that you can go around by yourself?

533
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,310
Okay, fine. Let's do it.

534
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,230
You're going to do scissors, right?

535
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,780
No..
-Oh, so it's not scissors.

536
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,780
I thought you would do scissors.

537
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,740
Did you know that?

538
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,600
In rock-paper-scissors,
scissors has the highest possibility of winning.

539
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,490
Really?

540
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,150
I, of course, wouldn't do rock

541
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,990
if you do scissors.

542
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,910
I won't do rock.

543
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,230
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

544
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,150
Ah, why did you say those weird things!

545
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,080
Why didn't you trust me when I said I won't do rock?

546
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,940
Look, scissors has the highest possibility of winning.

547
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,620
What should I eat?
Should I eat something expensive?

548
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,220
Do you want to eat rice soup?

549
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,240
Rice soup?

550
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,870
Call!

551
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,160
Ah, so good!

552
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,300
It's so good, Mother!

553
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,110
I'm grateful since you eat it so well.

554
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,370
You guys are colleagues? Eat more.

555
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,090
But, why is it so empty? It's lunch time.

556
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,670
After a big building came in,

557
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,730
all the businesses at the market went down.

558
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,950
Should we move?

559
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,420
Hyungnim!

560
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,820
Ah, Ae Ra, you're here!

561
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,210
Hello.
-This is good because I came because of you.

562
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,450
Hey sis, do you remember that city office worker,

563
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,920
did you tell Ae Ra about him?

564
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,410
There aren't many marriage material guys left, now days!

565
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,660
He's a government employee that you like so much.

566
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,990
And he owns a 1000 sq. ft. apartment in Gaebongdong.

567
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,070
He has a lot of hair, too!

568
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,010
Isn't he perfect?
-What do you mean perf...

569
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,120
How could you introduce a widower with two kids to her?

570
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,200
The youngest child is already in kindergarten,

571
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,790
and they're all grown up!

572
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,430
Also, the kids are nice,

573
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,160
so she doesn't have to do much.

574
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,150
Go, go, go!

575
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,430
Don't even mention a widower with kids!

576
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,790
Hey, sis!

577
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:33,350
Then were you going to send your divorced daughter off to a man who never married?

578
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,940
Oh, leave!

579
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,490
I'm leaving!

580
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,060
Oh, that woman, what's wrong with her?

581
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,120
She makes me so angry!

582
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,480
Oh, do you want more?

583
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,380
Did you hear that?

584
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,970
What?

585
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,510
That I'm divorced.

586
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,150
Yes.

587
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,950
Since no one asked,

588
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:09,320
I didn't say anything. It's not like I was trying to deceive anyone.

589
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,830
There wasn't a place to write it on the employment application, either.

590
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,070
By any chance...

591
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,450
Do you like me?

592
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,700
Me?

593
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,440
Then why are you explaining it to me?

594
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,120
Like a person who deceived her boyfriend and feels sorry.

595
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,660
Well, as co-workers,

596
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,120
you might've gotten shocked,

597
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,530
and you might feel betrayed.

598
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,570
But,

599
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,840
when did I feel sorry?

600
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,130
Why would I be sorry?
Did I do anything wrong to you by getting divorced?

601
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,290
Then you can just say it like that.

602
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,680
To the other people, like you did to me, with confidence.

603
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,570
That...

604
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,530
suits you better.

605
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,780
So good.

606
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,140
Baekdusan.
- Hallasan.
(Korean mountains)

607
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,890
Dad!

608
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,580
Oh my!

609
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,830
I thought you went through difficult times living alone,

610
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,940
but you look fine.

611
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,190
Did you...

612
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,330
stay at a sauna all this time?

613
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,290
No, I.. went to a lot of..

614
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,370
How's Mom?

615
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,440
What do you think?

616
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,980
She's upset,

617
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,950
and business is so bad.

618
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,970
Even if I try not to look, the pork cutlet restaurant that's right across from us, well... they're flooded with customers.

619
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,950
I just get pissed.

620
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,410
That pork cutlet restaurant,

621
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,320
they started selling discount coupons

622
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,080
on the internet.

623
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,610
Discount coupons?

624
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,040
Yes. It's called mobile shopping..

625
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,340
It's when a mobile shopping does a collaborated purchase with the restaurant and gives the customers a discount.

626
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,560
I think they're doing that at Ae Ra's company, too

627
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,660
Hey.

628
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,310
Discount coupons..

629
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,240
How do you make those?

630
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,910
Son-in-law Cha!

631
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,420
You should've called me earlier.

632
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,730
I would've brought you to a better place.

633
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,220
No, no. I came because I had some other business and just stopped by.

634
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,600
Let's order something.
-Yes.

635
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,790
Here!

636
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,710
I'm really grateful

637
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,040
for you letting your ex-wife work

638
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,120
at your company.

639
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:44,990
Yes.

640
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,730
It probably wasn't an easy decision.

641
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,600
You are truly a man.

642
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,220
To repay your big heart,

643
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,420
I'm prepared to endure my losses,

644
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,290
I've made this big decision.

645
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,290
The paradigm for this generation is coexistence.

646
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,220
Living together.

647
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,000
I also made a hard decision.

648
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,790
We're back!
-We're back.

649
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,020
Oh, you're back! Did the negotiations go well?

650
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,650
-No..
-Yes!

651
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:23,670
In Shinrimdong, we found a rice soup restaurant that's been around for 15 years.

652
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,720
The taste is good and the location...

653
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,200
it's perfect!

654
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,770
Oh, that's great! Make a project proposal!

655
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,990
Very good!

656
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,220
Are you crazy? It seems like it's all planned out if you recommend my family's restaurant.

657
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,940
That's why I'm going to do it!

658
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,530
Look here, Guk Seung Hyeon.

659
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,080
Thanks for worrying about me,

660
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,700
but I strictly separate work from my personal life.

661
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,910
Should I call it being professional? In any case,

662
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,450
my conscience simply can't...

663
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,420
Let's do the advertisement shoot together, if the proposal passes.

664
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,370
Hey, Guk Seung Hyeon!

665
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,780
Guk Seung Hyeon! Mr. Guk!

666
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,160
You two!

667
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,110
For the merits you two set for the company,

668
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:22,570
you should be rightfully compensated by being offered permanent positions at this company,

669
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,430
but we worry that a rumor will spread that there is a security issue in this company.

670
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,490
Therefore, please stand by until your internship is complete.

671
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,720
How could you...?

672
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,460
Then how about a reward?

673
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,920
That, of course..

674
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,450
I'm okay.

675
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,690
I didn't do it expecting rewards.

676
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,810
I want to finish my internship without any problems,

677
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:47,040
and wish to quickly get acknowledged for my skills.

678
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,830
I'm really glad to meet someone like you

679
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,820
who really cares

680
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,900
about the company.

681
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:58,450
I'm glad, too,

682
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:01,670
to meet you who understands me.

683
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,220
Tell me if you need any help.

684
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,690
Yes.

685
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,260
Yes, CEO. Yes.

686
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,480
Why are they talking for so long? With interns?

687
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,640
Wait, where's Seung Hyeon?

688
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,260
She said she had something to say to him.

689
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,710
Ae Ra, you can go down first.

690
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,900
Yes, Team Leader.

691
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,900
Noona, there's something you have to do, unofficially, for Na Ae Ra's sake,

692
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,550
and for the company's sake.

693
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,740
You know,

694
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,290
the project to develop back alley businesses?

695
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,980
But first,

696
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,300
this. You uploaded this, right?

697
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,720
What is this?

698
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,400
It's not me.

699
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,670
I really didn't do it.

700
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,750
It's not you?
-No.

701
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,950
Who uploaded this?

702
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,170
Does Hyung's old friend go here?

703
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,020
Maybe.

704
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,650
Isn't it cute?

705
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,540
Alright, Noona.

706
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,920
Noona?
-I'm leaving now.

707
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,020
Team Leader,

708
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,210
she's said to come in.

709
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,820
Oh, yes.

710
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,310
Guk Yeo Jin.

711
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,090
Guk Seung Hyeon.

712
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:02,250
Why, why, why didn't I think of this?

713
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,760
I had a golden rope to heaven right in front of me...

714
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,260
I didn't realize it.

715
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,260
I lived my life the wrong way.

716
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,050
Guk Seung Hyeon.

717
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,940
Your plan for the rice with soup project is excellent.

718
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,140
Let's get to work right away.

719
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,300
Ae Ra, by today, write up a report for the advertisement and leave it on my desk.

720
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,010
Get ready with Seung Hyeon to take photos
for the rice with soup advertisement.

721
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,090
Yes.
-Yes, thank you.

722
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:47,100
Hey, the business isn't running well, and if we sell it at half price, we're going to go bankrupt!

723
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,420
What?

724
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,160
What do you mean it's not always like that?

725
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,080
Small profit, quick return?

726
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,480
If the restaurant will be widely known,
there is nothing bad about that.

727
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,820
Alright. I'll talk it over with your father.

728
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,050
Okay.

729
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,900
Honey, Ae Ra said...
-Do it.

730
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,320
What do you think it is?

731
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,690
Something that Ae Ra's company is doing...

732
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:18,390
Was it mobile shopping or something?

733
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,730
Isn't that what she wants to do?

734
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,380
However,

735
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,390
you only break even, if hundreds of people show up.

736
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,560
Do you really think a lot of customers will show up to a restaurant without a parking lot?

737
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,820
How can a person not see the big picture?

738
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,240
This isn't to make money.

739
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,330
We'll raise Ae Ra's reputation through this and

740
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,710
we'll be helping out Son-in-law Cha's company.
Then, the two of them will naturally (engage in conversation)...

741
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,130
"Thank you. Please don't mention it."

742
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,850
"Is the family doing well?"

743
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:52,430
That's how the reconciliation begins.

744
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,410
That's true.

745
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,350
If we're going to be generous,

746
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:00,080
should we put out some kimchi tofu for free?

747
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,890
Talk about going overboard!

748
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:05,680
Pay attention to the details so that it will reflect nicely on Ae Ra.

749
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,840
Alright.

750
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,110
I'm going crazy.

751
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,680
I can't think of any ideas.

752
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,050
It's not just anyone but my family business.

753
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,190
I have to do well even if I have to sell my soul.

754
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,140
Soul?

755
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,750
If the rice soup...

756
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,990
had a soul,

757
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:49,670
the courage of the bone marrow soup to come to boil by raging fire.

758
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:53,300
The responsibility of the cow head meat to softly cook,

759
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,300
despite going through many difficulties.

760
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,370
It must have the warmth

761
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,680
to appreciate the sauce of radish kimchi.

762
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,210
Nonetheless, rice soup

763
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,980
is the perfect soup.

764
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:27,140
Mom, what's wrong with your make-up today?
It's not as if you're in a folk play or something.

765
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,420
What do you mean? I didn't put on any make-up.

766
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:34,420
Mother, please pose while holding the rice soup.

767
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,740
Hold this?
-Yes.

768
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,020
Like this?

769
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,550
Wait!

770
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,750
We're here!

771
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,390
Is that the hair you did at the hair salon?

772
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,540
What is that? What's that red thing?

773
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,840
This is the trend these days.

774
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,100
Oh my!

775
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,400
You look like Hyang Dan (old traditional servant).

776
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,650
Not Hyang Dan, more like Choon Hyang! (nobel gisaeng)

777
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,540
What's with this?

778
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,280
Are you ready?

779
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,180
Please shoot it well.

780
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,250
I'm going to take the picture now.

781
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,900
National exam rice soup.

782
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,070
National exam rice soup.

783
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,520
It's really tasty!

784
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,270
Yummy, yummy!

785
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,800
Stop it now!

786
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,190
I'm like a twisty donut.

787
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,920
Why do you keep holding me?

788
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,370
Drink it up. Looks yummy, right?

789
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:30,300
Yummy, yummy!

790
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,200
Wow.

791
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,050
Jackpot.

792
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,290
It'll be a jackpot.

793
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:45,660
Oh, it's going to be sold out soon!

794
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,700
The response is good.

795
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,090
Team Leader,

796
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,640
this... you could call a celebration.

797
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,460
Should we go out to an office dinner today?

798
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,090
Office dinner?

799
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,270
Today's not good.

800
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,900
I'm going to Min Philharmonic Orchestra performance.

801
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,900
We'll have a formal office dinner, next time.

802
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,240
Manager Kang, why don't you take the employees out for dinner today?

803
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,200
The newbies worked really hard.

804
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,510
Wait, wait!

805
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,440
M...me? Give me the company credit card..

806
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,840
What do you do with your salary?

807
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,070
You even request for overpay the most.

808
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:26,590
Then, eat well.

809
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,430
Yes. This is Won Ji Eun.

810
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,890
Yes.

811
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,300
Director?

812
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,250
And the CEO?

813
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,600
Call! (I'm up for it!)

814
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,290
Call, call, call! (I'm up for it!)

815
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,640
Office dinner, call!

816
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,180
Sunbae will go first.

817
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,660
Wait, just one song.

818
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,370
♫ The wind is blowing out of sorrow~

819
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:39,130
♫ The wind is blowing out of sorrow~

820
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:46,540
♫ An empty scene blows by~

821
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,100
♫ The rain that follows in clusters~

822
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,660
♫ The rain that follows in clusters~

823
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,420
♫ Seems like it's far from me~

824
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,970
♫ I think it has already stopped~

825
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,180
♫ The world is the same, just like yesterday~

826
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,430
She sounds pretty good.

827
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,310
♫ And time keeps passing by~

828
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:15,910
♫ I am the only one who has changed~

829
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,180
I'm not against it,

830
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,070
that save the alley business project.

831
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,260
Don't you think you're rushing a little?

832
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,860
The restaurants definitely have good food.

833
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,490
Also, to Na Ae Ra,

834
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,970
we couldn't do anything for her,

835
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,240
so we should at least help her this way.

836
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,670
♫ My empty wishes that have been swept away by the wind~

837
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,400
♫ My empty wishes that have been swept away by the wind~

838
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,900
♫ Desperately, they...~

839
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,530
Stay seated.

840
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,920
Ah, you can keep eating.

841
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:20,810
Sit here.

842
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,480
Sit.

843
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,860
Since the CEO is here,

844
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,160
shouldn't we hear him sing?

845
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,880
CEO!

846
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,710
CEO! CEO!

847
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:43,180
CEO! CEO! CEO!

848
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:49,650
♫ My memories of loving you intensely~

849
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,900
♫ My memories of loving you intensely~

850
00:59:52,900 --> 01:00:00,480
♫ Those memories are longing for you, but~

851
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,890
♫ I can't keep you here using my love for you as an excuse~

852
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,590
♫ I can't keep you here using my love for you as an excuse~

853
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,710
♫ I can't keep you here using my love for you as an excuse~

854
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:27,740
Do you want me to help?

855
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:34,130
Together! Together!

856
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,580
Together! Together!

857
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:50,560
♫ When I look into your eyes~

858
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:58,790
♫ All of this seems like a dream~

859
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:04,340
♫ Out of all the people in this world~

860
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:10,460
♫ How could it be us two?~

861
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:15,790
♫ It may have been a miracle~

862
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:21,020
♫ When I'm in your arms~

863
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:29,250
♫ I realize something new about me~

864
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,230
♫ I wonder how I lived before I got to know you~

865
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:41,280
♫ I wonder how I lived before I got to know you~

866
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,840
♫ I may not have been alive~

867
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:53,130
♫ How could we have never crossed paths?~

868
01:01:53,130 --> 01:02:00,790
♫ We were so close to each other, all along~

869
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:08,540
♫ The time we have to love each other isn't enough~

870
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,690
♫ Trust me~
- I'll trust you~

871
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:17,730
♫ I'll be with you till the end of this world~

872
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:22,620
♫ How long have you been looking for me?~

873
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:27,350
♫ Did you get lost?~

874
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,890
♫ Mirror, Mirror. Who does he like? ♫
