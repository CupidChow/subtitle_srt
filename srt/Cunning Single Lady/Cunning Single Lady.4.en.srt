1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,190
Ms. Na Ae Ra, come with us.

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,030
Huh?

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,290
Come with us.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,860
What do you mean leaking of customer information?

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,950
After the office dinner, I went straight home.

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,590
Look here, Ms. Na Ae Ra.

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,230
You went home after 3 A.M!

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,320
If the dinner ended at 1A.M,

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,640
no matter how late you go home,
you should be home by 2:30 A.M.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,200
Until that time, what were you doing?

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,530
I really went home right away...

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,930
The woman was cheating on him.

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,170
I heard that she was ugly.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,640
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo!

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,230
If you do that, I can't stay still.

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,280
I will get revenge on you!

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
After the dinner, you went to the Customer Information Management Office, and

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,600
moved the customer information onto a USB, and went out!

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,790
Also, you went to the security room and erased the CCTV!

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,300
No...

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,370
No?!

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,570
This is driving me crazy, really.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,850
Here, we have evidence, too.

24
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,260
The ID card log...

25
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,670
It saves who went into the room if you use your ID card.

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,320
You didn't know?

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,880
ID card? Employee card?

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,370
I lost it.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,070
I think I'm going to go crazy.

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,930
Why did I go there?

31
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,900
Think. Think.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,620
My brain isn't there just for no reason.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,110
So, you knew it from the beginning...

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,520
that that woman works for the company.

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,600
I mean, why?

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,670
It's not just you, but I can't understand that woman either!

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,550
Why would she come to her ex-husband's company?

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,230
Wait a minute. Did she come in to affect the company like this?

39
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,360
I remember.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,770
So... what did you do when you went there?

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,460
Well, I went there, but I don't know why...

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,120
This woman...seriously...

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,450
Should I tell you?

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,750
You went to the 8th floor and
copied the customer information and

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,250
went to erase the CCTV!

46
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,110
Huh?

47
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,480
Me?!

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,510
Na Ae Ra,

49
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,450
should I tell you your alibi from after the dinner until committing the crime?

50
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,430
You pretended to go home after dinner,
but instead went to the company.

51
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,490
Also, you pretended to go to your office, but instead
entered the Customer Information Management Office.

52
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,170
[Customer Information Management Office]
D&T Soft-Ventures Co. Ltd.

53
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,630
You saved the information on our customers that we were retaining,

54
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,020
and finally stopped at the basement CCTV room,

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,610
and after making the security guard drink a sleeping potion,

56
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,030
erased the records for the time of the crime.

57
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,570
Me?

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,320
When a woman holds a grudge, it can even snow in May.

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,820
Your ex-wife,

60
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,900
she must have a serious grudge ...

61
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,460
Do you have glue?

62
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,850
Huh?

63
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,750
Why do you want the glue?

64
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,620
Glue your mouth shut... You're so noisy...!

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Oh Hyung... CEO!

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,930
Where are you going?!

67
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,170
CEO!

68
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,380
Oh!

69
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,410
What is this?

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,360
[*** ** * B*tch]
(Sentence was not completed)

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,210
Cha Jeong Woo... you bastard...

72
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,750
You should go die.

73
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,320
The whole nation has to know your true nature.

74
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,200
I prepared it and brought it with me.

75
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,350
Cha Jeong Woo... you... you...

76
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,820
You have to...once...

77
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,670
I remembered something.

78
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,520
I really remembered something.

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,070
The reason why I went there was because

80
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,630
I had something to do with the CEO's car.

81
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,950
Are you joking around?

82
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,660
What business do you have with the CEO's car?

83
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,020
About that...

84
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,430
Car wash.

85
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,740
There's a reason I need to get a car wash.

86
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Also, have a look at this.

87
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,090
I see.

88
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,800
If you were there at that time,

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,290
you must not be the criminal.

90
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm sorry, Ms. Na Ae Ra.

91
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,300
Clean it well, so it will disappear.

92
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,410
Yes.

93
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,890
"개 ㅅ" (Gae shiot)

94
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,180
What was after that?

95
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,920
I think that they came in using the ID card that the intern lost.

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,690
Does it make sense that an intern's ID card gives them
access all the way to a client database room?

97
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,280
We have to quickly recover the data and catch
the perpetrator before it becomes known outside.

98
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,450
Yes. I'm cooperating in full with the police cyber investigation.

99
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,970
About Ms. Na Ae Ra...

100
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,630
For now, let's cover it up.

101
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,570
So that the data theft doesn't get spread throughout the company.

102
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,130
Yes, sir.

103

107
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,910
I'm going to use a double curse word.
(making reference to ㅆ)

108
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,900
It couldn't be "son of a bit.."?
개새끼 (kaesaekki = son of a b----")

'Our perfect score personality CEO, Fighting,'

110
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,240
was what I was going to write.

111
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,330
What?

112
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,760
Why?

113
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,310
It's right that CEO has an overflowing personality (stressing the part of the word that sounds like the Korean word for dog).

114
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,710
Aiyoo, I could have broken (the record).

115
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Ae Ra!

116
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,430
Hey, did I just get out of jail?

117
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,090
You should have seen the awful likes of what I went through
at the scene.

118
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,880
The Security Team Leader screamed at me and stuff.

119
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,500
Saying that if he passed me over to the police that I'd have to eat bread and water.

120
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,420
Anyhow... this time Jeong Woo saved you,

121
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,980
you know, right?

122
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,400
What do you mean, saved?
Whose fault was it I was there in the first place?

123
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,230
I, a person that could live without the law forever,

124
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,700
because of Cha Jeong Woo, I keep being shaken by matters of the law.

125
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,960
The person who made a kind person like me is all ...

126
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,910
So, did someone tell you to go crawling into that company?

127
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,670
Why did you really go there?

128
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,390
There is a reason.

129
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,530
Regardless, I am a little sorry.

130
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,800
I'd have to at least see him so that I can apologize.

131
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,930
Geez.

132
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,620
They said that the CEO is leaving at 2pm.

133
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,720
No, he's going to stop somewhere first.

134
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,420
Yes, yes.

135
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,960
You seem to be going somewhere.

136
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,770
The car graffiti...

137
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,770
CEO.

138
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,640
Hello.

139
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,050
Ah, Ms. Jung Su Mi.

140
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,250
Yes.

141
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,090
Happy Birthday.

142
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,850
You must be so happy!

143
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,520
How could he remember such things?

144
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,940
It would be so nice to have a meal with him.

145
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,510
He used to be my food in the old days.

146
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,220
He congratulated me on my birthday.

147
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,490
You seem to be constipated.

148
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,200
Pardon?

149
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,780
Who uses the bathroom for 30 minutes?

150
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,450
You're a newbie.

151
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,760
I must have been a bit nervous since it was a new experience.

152
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,810
Did you have something urgent?

153
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,200
It's not that, but when leaving your seat for over 30 minutes,

154
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,670
you must notify a sunbae and receive approval.

155
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,970
You should go in that manner, in my opinion.

156
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,210
Isn't that basic knowledge?

157
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,450
Yes.

158
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,500
I'll definitely let you know before leaving my seat next time.

159
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,240
One from our team will be invited to dinner with the CEO.

160
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,950
Wow.

161
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,110
For the selection standard to be fair,

162
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,100
it will be assigned to the person that succeeds at their deal first.

163
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,290
No complaints, right?

164
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,280
Yes.

165
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,500
Dinner with the CEO?

166
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,540
Why do that? What's so great about having dinner with the CEO?

167
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,360
Doing what with whom?

168
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,970
Heaven is finally giving you an opportunity. Cha Jeong Woo.

169
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,560
Become the hero that gets to have dinner with the CEO.

170
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,860
What is this? Does he have a woman?

171
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,100
Tada.

172
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,360
I'm going to work hard so that you can live in a house like this.

173
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,620
This is our baby.

174
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,330
I want big windows for starters.

175
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,450
I would also like a bunch of little potted plants inside the living room window.

176
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,020
Potted plants?

177
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,030
Potted plants, so that I can watch them grow
and realize my happiness has also grown this much.

178
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,920
Something I can compare.

179
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,490
Since CEO Cha is so popular,
there are many marriage match requests.

180
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,180
Could it be... that the CEO has a girlfriend?

181
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,400
He doesn't have one.

182
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,420
Are you sure?

183
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,660
Yes.

184
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,880
Does he have somewhere other than this penthouse?

185
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,290
Could he have another house set up somewhere?

186
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,590
What?

187
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,010
He often plays hooky alone

188
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,620
or disappears somewhere?

189
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,410
You have some kind of imagination.

190
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,380
As if our president would do that?

191
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,460
♫ Don't ask. ♫

192
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,120
Aigoo.

193
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,130
You're still doing this at your age?

194
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,770
How could you break our savings to buy clothes?

195
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,750
Don't you realize how I saved that money?

196
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,210
Aigoo.

197
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,450
My terrible life!

198
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,840
In order to live a good life,

199
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,810
a family has to live well.

200
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,000
I was wondering where my calling was being blocked from.

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,040
Ae Ra seems to be the reason.

202
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,310
I need to take care of that first.

203
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,060
What is it? What are you planning?

204
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,620
Tell me. You're not going to tell me?!

205
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,540
Where are you going?!

206
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,490
The father has to show a good example for the son
to follow and do well.

207
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,480
It's your fault that he goes around like that!

208
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,890
Oh, ho..This person!!

209
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,140
This won't do!

210
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,390
Come here!

211
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,330
Why!?

212
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,950
Come in here!

213
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,990
Why are you doing this?

214
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,360
What's wrong?

215
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,450
Oh my!

216
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,300
You are so silly.

217
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,670
I need to go out to the store.

218
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,300
Things seem to have gotten better really quickly.

219
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,890
What's most important between a man and woman is.....strength!

220
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,920
I need to get married to use my strength or not.

221
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,580
But why did you buy such an expensive suit?

222
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,160
I'll tell you later.

223
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,880
CEO's car?

224
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,470
Yes.

225
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,290
Alright.

226
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
Good job.

227
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,790
Tell Team Leader Wang to come in on your way out.

228
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,270
You were very surprised, right?

229
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,690
How could something like this come from my team. It's all my fault.

230
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,810
I have nothing to say.

231
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,910
Please pay better attention to your subordinates.

232
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,500
You can leave now.

233
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,080
A mere intern gives me this humiliation?

234
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,100
Unbelievable!

235
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,250
What? M-me?

236
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,870
Yes, give it a try.

237
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,430
You said it during your interview,
that you have a lot of experience selling.

238
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,690
That fact you're able to provide
input in a business situation

239
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,170
was your biggest scoring point.

240
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,380
Good luck making this deal a success.

241
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,500
But... they don't give discounts there.

242
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,850
I heard that you even worked at a luxury store?

243
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,080
To have worked in a place
which was frequented by an upper class clientele,

244
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,190
is of great merit.

245
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,060
Team Leader is really cool.

246
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,730
You're so clueless.

247
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,440
Have you ever seen Unified Shilla Hotel

248
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,180
do discount coupon events?

249
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,120
We couldn't even do it with all our mighty efforts.

250
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,630
That over there right now...is firing her in a round-about way.

251
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,420
They give her an impossible mission,

252
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,160
and use that to mark her badly on her performance appraisal,
and it becomes a vicious cycle,

253
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,350
and then down comes the axe.

254
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,920
It's obvious that she's not going to make the deal...

255
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,970
She's not going to last long.

256
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,050
Not going to last long?

257
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,900
Team Leader!

258
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,070
I'll do it with her!

259
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,600
What?

260
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,300
We should do it together since we're colleagues.

261
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,900
We'll share the responsibility, too.

262
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,480
Seung Hyeon, you can do some other work.

263
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,600
No! We'll work hard.

264
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,870
We'll work hard.

265
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,300
You're working hard.

266
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,620
Is CEO Cha at the company?

267
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,140
What?

268
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,950
Could you call the secretary's office
and ask if the CEO is here.

269
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,300
Ah, also, he'll know if you tell him that I'm Na Gap Soo.

270
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,170
Do you have an appointment?

271
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,850
No, no, no.

272
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,360
If he's here, just tell him that I'm Na Gap Soo.

273
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,780
I'm sorry but you can't see the CEO without an appointment.

274
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,740
No,

275
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,080
whether to meet or not, is up to CEO Cha.

276
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,260
You can just deliver my message.

277
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,260
We're sorry, but you can only enter if you have an appointment.

278
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,310
It's because I can't contact him!

279
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,490
Can't you just call the secretary's office?

280
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,350
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,930
I don't want to say this, but I'm CEO Cha's fath..

282
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,200
Then, I'll see you later.

283
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,530
We'll meet again sometime.

284
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,480
You uselessly smart kid.

285
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,080
I've told you that a young man's future
is like an unscratched lottery ticket.

286
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,200
Not to end it thoughtlessly.

287
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,470
I told you so many times.

288
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,840
Fa ...

289
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,710
Father.

290
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,510
Aigoo.

291
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,840
It's been a long time, Son-in-law Cha.

292
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,750
You must be startled because I came to see you so suddenly.

293
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,040
Are you startled?

294
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,900
No.

295
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,690
I'm... really happy that you turned out well.

296
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,750
Congratulations.

297
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,200
Thank you.

298
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,770
Ae Ra..

299
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,960
and all of us.. are very happy.

300
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,300
Seung Hyeon, I've been saying this over and over again,

301
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,300
but we really need to make a deal
for the buffet discount tickets.

302
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,810
So, get a hold of your senses, and..

303
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,110
We're not here to play!

304
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,250
He's over there.

305
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:21,900
Yes.

306
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,100
Everything is ready for the reservation at 4, right?

307
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,720
Yes, it's ready.

308
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,780
Hello. I'm from Dontalk. I've called.

309
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,210
I heard from the assistant manager.

310
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,530
I was going to do it as

311
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,400
a promotion to celebrate our renovation . . .

312
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,090
Omo, that's great!

313
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,500
It'd be really good to promote the interior renovation that you did!

314
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,600
But it'd be hard to give the number of discount tickets you've requested.

315
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,110
Oh my, why?

316
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,840
We should promote the delicious food here!

317
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,150
In order to do that, please give us a large quantity.

318
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,200
Well...

319
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,430
I'm kind of against that.

320
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,320
Five star restaurant's shouldn't be overcrowded
like a market restaurant.

321
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,100
While you try to catch new customers, it's perfect to lose existing ones.

322
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,220
That seemed a little problematic to me, too.

323
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,200
I'll discuss it more with my CEO and I'll call you back.

324
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,650
Aren't you irritated?

325
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,790
I've been here and there, but I've never seen
a more perfect buffet compared to here.

326
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,740
The perfect service I've experienced is here.

327
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,510
I think 'how wonderful would it be.'

328
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,420
What was so great about our service?

329
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,650
Well, everything...

330
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,890
Overall...

331
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,310
I'll contact you after the meeting.

332
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,620
E..excuse me...

333
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,530
He said we can't.

334
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,060
Gosh, do you have to throw seeds into cooked rice (rain on my parade)?

335
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,690
You mean "ashes"?(into cooked rice)

336
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,750
Don't you feel bad? He was totally ignoring you.

337
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,090
I do feel bad.

338
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,020
Even if I feel bad, I do it if it's my job.

339
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,210
Aren't you working too hard?

340
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,100
You're not even the CEO here, and it's
not like you get more money for doing this.

341
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,060
You should also work diligently,
thinking as if you are the owner of the company.

342
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,630
Who knows?

343
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,030
You might be able to become a full-time employee because of someone.

344
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,930
An opportunity is always near to you.

345
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,440
That's true.

346
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,460
Hey!

347
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,620
You...

348
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,880
Are you hiding something from me?

349
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,300
Hiding? What would I hide?

350
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,850
Oh, that child?!

351
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,870
You're going to create distance in our father-son relationship?

352
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,160
By any chance...

353
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,130
Did Brother-in-law Cha say anything?

354
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,810
You must be pulling a fast one over me, because your nostrils are flaring up!

355
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,600
Tell me the truth.

356
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,700
Did you receive money from him?

357
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,190
You bastard!

358
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,330
I didn't ask for it...

359
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,580
Brother-in-law Cha, he gave it to me

360
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,110
as Ae Ra's alimony.

361
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,080
Alimony?

362
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,810
Well, that... Since I'm the eldest son,

363
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,310
I have the right to take care of Ae Ra's alimony problems...

364
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,450
So? Did you give it to Ae Ra?

365
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,130
That...

366
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,800
Did you...

367
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,580
You spent it... all?

368
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,880
Yes...

369
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,620
Oh, you moron!

370
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,910
She doesn't know that I went to see him myself.

371
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,330
If she knows that, I think she might really kill me...

372
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,480
Is that why you lied? That Brother-in-law Cha
called you to give it to you?

373
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,250
White... lie...

374
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,750
I should just...!

375
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,840
What are you talking about?

376
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,250
Mom!

377
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,520
Mom, mom, mom, mother!

378
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,500
Listen to me!

379
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,100
Soo Cheol.
- Father.

380
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,790
Father. Here.

381
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Now doesn't seem to be the right time.

382
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
For a while, stay away.

383
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,310
But...

384
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,900
Mother is really mad, right?

385
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
That's true.

386
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,000
Why are you using your sister's alimony?

387
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You shouldn't do such a thing......as a Kilimanjaro's proud leopard.

388
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,270
No matter how,

389
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,380
as the elder son, please just know that
I genuinely wanted to add something to this family.

390
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,210
Please, just don't take that away from me.

391
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,440
I'm leaving like this today, but

392
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,010
I will return to the family when I have the
guaranteed means to raise up our household's status.

393
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,950
Son...

394
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,220
Don't just be looking for rotten meat.

395
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,840
Oh my, CEO, thank you!

396
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,360
We'll introduce you well. I promise.

397
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,130
Then I'll call you back!

398
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,000
Did it work out?

399
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,890
About 90%?

400
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,790
Song Hee! Making progress and eating with the CEO?

401
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,670
Wow, you must be really happy!

402
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,090
Whatever.

403
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,010
Then, I'll leave first.

404
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,870
Aren't you getting off work?

405
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,780
Hey, who is this? Chang Sik Hyung?

406
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,060
I heard you came to our hotel today!

407
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,200
The manager had your business card.

408
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
I was totally surprised.

409
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,040
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

410
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,080
What do you mean it's nothing? They said you devoted your life to this!

411
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,040
What?

412
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,760
Manager, I'm sorry that I keep calling you and bothering you,

413
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,910
but can I come and see you again?

414
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,510
Ah, I can come to your house today.

415
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,580
Manager, Manager?

416
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,580
Geez, Guk Seung Hyeon!

417
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,930
Ah, that bastard is so unhelpful!

418
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,980
I guess that you have something upsetting you.

419
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,430
Do you want to have some with me?

420
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,290
It's good that the misunderstanding was solved.

421
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,510
Yeah. I almost got really blamed for it.

422
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,850
You should always have your employee card with you.

423
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,470
Yes.

424
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,420
Also,

425
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,000
even if you have dissatisfaction regarding the company,

426
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,210
you shouldn't doodle on the CEO's car..

427
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,750
How did you know?

428
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,510
It was a mistake.

429
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,620
Though, you probably won't understand
since you don't make any mistakes.

430
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,410
You look like a perfectionist.

431
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,040
Do I look like one?

432
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,880
Did you... suffer a heartbreak?

433
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,210
I'm not suffering a heartbreak,

434
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,450
but I'm betraying someone.

435
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,830
I said I'd never forget him even after I die,

436
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:40,010
but I'm betraying him.

437
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,080
It's okay.

438
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,840
They say that love doesn't stay in one place.

439
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,780
If it did, everyone would've married their first love!

440
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,710
If you have a new love you should go "all in."

441
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,810
Is something not going well with the new person?

442
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,260
Who doesn't like such a perfect person like you...

443
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,880
Is he... a celebrity?

444
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,020
He's boring, brusque,

445
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,890
and only knows about work.

446
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,170
Just go for it.

447
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,610
It's better to be embarrassed once rather than having
it worry your heart.

448
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,640
You can get off work.

449
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,820
I'm going to stay and do some more work.

450
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,280
And the car...

451
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,100
you can take it.

452
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,500
I'll go home on my own.

453
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,330
Yes.

454
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,910
Yes?

455
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,420
Didn't we say that we're going to discuss it tomorrow morning?

456
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,090
Did we?

457
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,710
I think I made a mistake.

458
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,730
The storyboard for the TV commercial came out,
and I meant to show that to you...

459
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,180
I checked it earlier by email.

460
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,820
Oh, okay.

461
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,080
Then, I'll be hanging up..

462
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,870
Aren't you getting off work? It's late.

463
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,790
Thank you.

464
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,460
My secretary said that he dropped the car off for repair,

465
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,280
and he said that it would take some time.

466
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,990
It's fine.

467
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,210
By the way, about the date event..

468
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,420
Can we not do that?

469
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,140
Why not? Are you embarrassed?

470
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,060
Wouldn't I be embarrassed?

471
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,780
But what can we do,

472
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,040
it got the most votes

473
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,980
out of all the ideas for the 3rd anniversary event.

474
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,380
Perhaps, you like it

475
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,910
and you're just pretending to make a fuss?

476
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,420
Liking it but making a fuss?

477
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,300
Then why don't you do a date event, too?

478
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,620
You're probably popular among the male employees.

479
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,770
If you're going to participate.

480
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,900
What?

481
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,430
President, what are you talking about?

482
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,600
How could you suddenly do this?

483
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,410
President! President!

484
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,160
Ah, really! How can he do this now?

485
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,170
I already came up with the description
and the photos for the promotion!

486
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,550
Why? He's not going to do it?

487
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,440
The chef came back from his vacation in the United States, and...

488
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,820
he refuses to sell it at a discount; because
to him, a culinary affair is an art form.

489
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,540
He said that even the President can't do anything about it if the chef said so.

490
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,700
Ah, what should we do?

491
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,200
Yes, this is Na Ae Ra.

492
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,890
Yes, Manager.

493
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,460
Ah, yes. What? Really?

494
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:52,420
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!

495
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,680
He said he'll do it!

496
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,330
50% buffet sale tickets! 500 of them!

497
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,470
Oh, daebak! Daebak!

498
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,630
Ae Ra, you're really good!

499
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,200
Thanks, I owe you.

500
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,410
Kid, I never knew you worked so hard.

501
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,420
I thought you weren't interested in that area.

502
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,110
I'm not.

503
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,850
But I'm interested in some other area.
-The person going to the dinner event with the CEO is

504
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,100
Na Ae Ra.

505
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:31,060
If I keep this up, I will mess up my plan...

506
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,910
As soon as you entered this company...
you're really lucky Na Ae Ra.

507
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,260
Thank you.

508
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,330
Here, a congratulatory gift.

509
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,930
What is this? So childish.

510
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,420
Ah, do it well.

511
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,810
This won't work. Let's do something else.
This is too hard.

512
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,290
We don't have time. It's today!

513
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,810
And also, you just have to grill the meat!

514
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,410
That's the easiest thing.

515
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,880
Hey, can't you push back your vacation? Do you have to go today?

516
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,120
You.

517
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,590
Who's more important, your girlfriend or me?

518
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,130
What are you talking about?
Of course,

519
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,840
my girlfriend.

520
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,760
I can't live without women.

521
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,010
Hey! You bastard!

522
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,930
This is the first overnight trip I'm going on since dating this girl.

523
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,530
To get to this point,

524
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,360
I've put in a lot of work.

525
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,790
Alright.

526
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,540
Well, what can I do?
If you're not going to be here...

527
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,100
I can just make her a ramyun (instant noodles), I guess.

528
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,480
You...your bad side is coming out.

529
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,180
That's why. Why did you agree to do this kind of thing?

530
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,050
So unlike yourself.

531
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,880
I really can't do this. I'm going to have to cancel the event.

532
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,600
CEO.

533
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,540
I was just on my way to see you. Nice timing.

534
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,180
Pardon? Me?

535
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,060
What do you mean... ?

536
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,870
Um...

537
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,690
The dinner with the CEO...

538
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,730
Ah, yes.

539
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,620
This time it's the mobile shopping division. An intern
was chosen,

540
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,030
named Na Ae Ra.

541
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,400
Why are you only now...

542
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,640
I emailed Secretary Gil this afternoon.
- Secretary Gil left for vacation...

543
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,470
Hello, CEO.

544
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,920
Welcome. Nice to meet you.

545
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,660
Alright, shall we start.

546
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,830
While the two of you are eating comfortably,

547
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,240
Ms. Na Ae Ra, if you had something you wanted to ask him,

548
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,740
you can ask him.

549
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,700
Yes.

550
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,930
Please eat.

551
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,520
Oh wow, did you make this all yourself?

552
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,940
I don't know whether it will suit your tastes.

553
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,410
It's all burned.

554
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,790
I didn't know that I'd be feeding it to you either.

555
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,720
It's delicious.

556
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,200
CEO, I heard that you do nothing but work every day.

557
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,580
I didn't know that you had this hidden cooking skill.

558
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,730
Why? Do you regret it?

559
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,830
Well, this is nothing.

560
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:42,610
If Intern Na Ae Ra asks about any difficulties,

561
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:48,110
I would like for you, as a mentor, to say
some words of encouragement.

562
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,390
Does the CEO have a past that he wishes he could change?

563
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,990
I have a past like that.

564
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,830
I hurt someone.

565
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,760
Right now...

566
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:10,220
Shall I say that I'm regretting it. I'm worried about
what I should do.

567
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,090
It's already too late for that.

568
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,520
There's no past that can be turned back.

569
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,600
Even if you regret it, there's no use.

570
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,860
That's why you should have been prudent.

571
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,810
Well, aren't you so smart.

572
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,460
I guess so.

573
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,160
I regret that I was so flippant and careless.

574
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,260
If you really regret it so much, you can try going to the person
and bowing down on your knees to beg (forgiveness).

575
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,770
Of course, with all your sincerity.

576
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,940
I don't know if the person would accept it, though.

577
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,380
What bull sh*t is this?

578
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,350
I'll think about it. Thank you for the advice.

579
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,800
Even if you laugh like that there's no use.

580
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,510
You've already gotten a red card and are expelled.

581
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,000
Do you want to have a glass of wine?

582
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,450
This wine is called Cheval Blanc, and it means "white horse."

583
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,510
A prince riding his white horse...
Something that every woman fantasizes about.

584
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,650
When I went to the Bordeaux region of France, a wine expert recommended it.

585
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,020
He said that it resembled me.

586
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,140
Aren't you full of sh*t.

587
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,760
Oh wow, it really seems to.

588
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:54,200
Wait a minute. If this is Cheval Blanc...

589
00:44:54,830 --> 00:45:00,320
By chance is this the wine that they say cost more than $1,000?

590
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,550
It has good quality for the price.

591
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,420
You've lost your mind.

592
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,490
CEO, the promotional team sent me an email yesterday, but I completely forgot...

593
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,070
Oh, is that so?

594
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,880
By chance is she already there?

595
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,530
Should I go there now?

596
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,120
Are you saying that Bill Gates recommended it?

597
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,710
Look at him putting on airs.

598
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,960
I will think about it. Yes.

599
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,280
Who...?

600
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,980
It's the Miami Yacht Club. They're asking me to stop by
in the summer.

601
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,700
Forget about taking any time off; but even if there
were ten of me, I still wouldn't have enough time.

602
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,730
When you're tired, resting at home is the best.

603
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,740
Out of everything, health is the most important.

604
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,350
You have IT Korea resting on your shoulders.

605
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,160
I hope that you won't forget it.

606
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,060
Now do you understand what level I'm at?

607
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,990
Since Intern Na Ae Ra says that, I'll think about it.

608
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,250
Please, have a nice comfortable chat together,
since we're done with all planned events.

609
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,250
You really have changed. (speaking informally now)

610
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,220
Really?

611
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,010
I'm not sure; I haven't really noticed it.

612
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,580
No...

613
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:22,410
Right now, how shall I say...the confidence of a successful man?

614
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,120
Should I say that I realize a certain specialness?

615
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,570
Anyway, I'm happy that you succeeded.

616
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,330
I'm a person that knows better than anyone how you suffered.

617
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,540
Thank you.. for saying it like that.

618
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,660
Until the end you're not saying that it's because of my help.

619
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,830
But your image now, while I'm happy,

620
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,890
on the other hand, I'm a little...

621
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,880
Because the old you that I used to know seems to have disappeared,

622
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,120
should I say that I feel a little sad?

623
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,320
I miss the old you.

624
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,840
You...

625
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:10,950
Tell me.

626
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,770
You have something stuck in your teeth.

627
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,200
Should we go somewhere and talk some more about old times?

628
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,220
Huh?

629
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,420
So... where are we going?

630
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,200
Home.

631
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,120
Besides the house at the company, you had another house?

632
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,430
Yes. It was all built last year, but I haven't been
able to go there often.

633
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,700
Do you remember?

634
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,370
Wow.

635
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,700
Ta da.

636
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,880
I will work hard, so that we can live in a house like this.

637
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,740
First, the windows have to be big.

638
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,000
Window?

639
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,520
Then, we will have to pay a lot of heating fees.

640
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,500
I'm going to have a fireplace.

641
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,650
Ok.

642
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,910
Also, I want there to be a lot of pots filled with flowers
around the living room and the kitchen.

643
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,070
Pots filled with flowers?

644
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,610
Yes.

645
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:45,320
As I grow them, I want to check how much my happiness grew.

646
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,610
This is our baby.

647
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,350
This...

648
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,640
this is that thing.

649
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,850
The large windows you wanted.

650
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,460
This sofa, this curtain ...

651
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,900
Even dishes, it has everything.

652
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,700
It really has it all.

653
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,490
All of this,

654
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,400
when did you do it?

655
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,510
Little by little.

656
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,870
This was my dream.

657
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,560
That's right,

658
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,540
our dream.

659
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,460
It is not our dream.

660
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,400
It is my dream.

661
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,780
Do you think I don't know that you still have feelings for me
and that's why you approached me?

662
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,270
Do you think I'm still the stupid Cha Jeong Woo?

663
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,550
Because you're having a hard time, you leave me,
and now you have feelings for me, so you approach me.

664
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,740
That is not a dream.

665
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,820
That's just greed.

666
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:40,160
Marriage, to you, wasn't a promise, but greed.

667
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,400
I don't know why I met a person like you.

668
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,400
Even if I was born again, I wouldn't want to meet you again.

669
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,840
I want to be happy now.

670
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,890
Is this why

671
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,170
you brought me here?

672
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,800
Is it because you wanted to seek revenge?

673
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,900
I wanted to show you how I will live
with the person I am going to marry.

674
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,130
A person who will be with me whether I succeed or fail.

675
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:24,960
Someone who will continue to love me until the end.

676
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,690
Someone I will love until the end, too.

677
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,390
As a CEO, I'm going easy on an intern.

678
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,820
Ms. Na Ae Ra,

679
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,800
from now on, please remember to act appropriately.

680
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,220
Even though after three months, I won't be able to see you.

681
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,830
I have to go.

682
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,310
I'm tired.

683
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,700
Resignation Letter
Na Ae Ra

684
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,480
Ms. Na Ae Ra,

685
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,310
I have something to tell you.

686
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,220
I said, I have to something to tell you.

687
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,980
What?

688
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,020
We've met each other once before.

689
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:24,270
I had a muffler exactly same as yours.

690
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,450
What? This?

691
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,790
I'm fine. Thank you.

692
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,260
No wonder. When I first saw you,

693
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,120
you seemed familiar.

694
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,590
Then, are you saying that is mine?

695
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,300
I was going to find the owner, so I was wearing it all the time.

696
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,780
Here.

697
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,720
I guess you found your expensive muffler because of me.

698
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,750
Guk Seung Hyeon, you are a very lucky person.

699
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:08,630
Ah, it's cool.

700
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,050
How can you?

701
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,640
How can this be my muffler "that ran away from home?"

702
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,000
So...

703
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,800
So why do you drop it on the streets?

704
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:25,900
It's embarrassing, pretending the muffler
I found on the streets is mine.

705
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,210
I have such an unlucky life.

706
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:31,300
Excuse me.

707
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,750
I will buy you alcohol for giving me back my muffler.

708
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:45,050
You seem like a person who's just been rejected.

709
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,990
By any chance, did the date with the CEO go wrong?

710
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,600
Or did you propose, but get rejected?

711
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,270
Aish, I don't want to drink alcohol now. What do you mean CEO?

712
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:00,650
I don't like people like that.

713
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,740
I want to curse them.

714
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,250
People who succeed

715
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,940
are all despicable people.

716
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,650
Some like me, who are clear and truthful,

717
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,780
live like this.

718
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,170
How about it, Ae Ra? You live well.

719
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,600
How old are you?
- Huh?

720
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,270
How old are you to act like this to me?

721
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,280
How old are you?

722
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,350
26 years old.

723
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,790
You're young.

724
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:39,780
Noona is 34 years old.

725
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,850
You're eight years older than me.

726
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,860
Buying, selling, producing.

727
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,720
I did all that.

728
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,410
How is it? Aren't I awesome?

729
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:59,350
So that's why I wore the muffler I found on the ground,
and went to the interview.

730
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,290
Anyway,

731
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:05,750
our relationship ends today.

732
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,800
I'll show you something fun.

733
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,400
Wow.

734
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,400
How did you do this?

735
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,000
Do you want to try? It's easy.

736
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,500
Wow! It's so cool!

737
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,110
Isn't it?

738
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,180
That person... why is he running away after looking at me?

739
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,900
Hey!

740
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,890
My arm, arm, arm!

741
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,920
You're only a 2nd degree in Judo.

742
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,420
You! You, you, you!

743
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,980
You look innocent, yet...

744
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,970
Don't live like that! You know how much I suffered because of you?

745
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,290
Ms. Na Ae Ra?

746
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,840
He entered the company disguised
as a water delivery person.

747
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,700
I think he stole Na Ae Ra's ID and stole the data.

748
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,640
Tomorrow, he was planning on selling it to China.

749
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,720
Since it's before he sent over the data,

750
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,400
there isn't any damage done.

751
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,150
That's a relief.

752
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,830
I'll give this back after we investigate.

753
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,200
Ah, yes.

754
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,080
Because this man took my ID card, I took all the blame.

755
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,000
And the chief of security was so hard on me ...

756
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,940
Now, look here.

757
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,780
Cheese!

758
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,400
This important company data could've been leaked if it weren't for the new interns.

759
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,800
Does that make any sense?

760
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:04,200
On top of that, no one reported this to me until now.

761
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,100
I will figure out who's responsible for this incident.

762
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:16,700
Okay.

763
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,800
Come in.

764
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,700
They are interns, Gook Seung Hyun and Na Ae Ra.

765
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,530
These two arrested the culprit,

766
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,370
and worked hard at stopping a company's crisis.

767
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,040
Yes, Na Ae Ra did everything.

768
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,640
Of course.

769
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,500
Thank you.

770
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,200
You did a great job.

771
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,000
Thank you.

772
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,260
It was nothing. I'll work harder.
