1
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,560
Don't worry,
you can finally go home tomorrow.

2
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,645
-Thank you, ma'am.
-All right.

3
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,110
Mr. Romie, how are you feeling?

4
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,362
I'm doing a bit better, ma'am.

5
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,031
I'm glad to hear that.

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,617
-Just keep taking the Metformin, okay?
-Nurse Rose?

7
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,745
Thank you so much.
My dad finally has a bed.

8
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,041
Now we're just waiting
for his surgery schedule.

9
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,044
Just make sure he gets better.

10
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,087
-Yes, thank you.
-Okay, take care.

11
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,596
-Babe, wanna watch a movie?
-Sure.

12
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,432
But I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat first.

13
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,685
All right. But after the movie,

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,729
maybe we can…

15
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,731
You know.

16
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,024
You're unbelievable.

17
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,069
Why? It's not a big deal.

18
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,445
Okay, fine.

19
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,204
Let's go.

20
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,152
Hey, Sandra.

21
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,362
Hey.

22
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,073
Did you get your back pay yet?

23
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,742
Not yet. This government's terrible.

24
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,537
They pay so little,
and they're always late.

25
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,834
When are you leaving, again?

26
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,795
Next month. Just a little longer.

27
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,674
What about you?
When are you getting out of here?

28
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,596
I don't have enough money
for the papers yet.

29
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,808
And my mom's just recovered
from her illness.

30
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,937
Plus, with my two siblings,
it's hard to manage all the expenses.

31
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,816
It's fine, though.

32
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,610
I'm doing okay.

33
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,738
Good luck.

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,740
Take care of yourself.

35
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,992
Thanks.

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,579
Here.

37
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,414
Take it.

38
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,335
I won't be able to use it.
I don't want to fail the medical exam.

39
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,465
You're such a drama queen.

40
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,175
I'm gonna miss you so much.

41
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,387
I'll miss you too.

42
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,900
-Okay.
-Jeez.

43
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,860
So much drama.

44
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,862
All right, I'll go ahead.

45
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,368
Damn it.

46
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,663
-I don't even--
-Don't move.

47
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,124
Don't shout. Give me all your money.

48
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,877
-Ouch.
-All of it. Give it to me.

49
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,545
-Hold on.
-Hurry up.

50
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,629
Okay.

51
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,216
-Here. Take it.
-Put it in my pocket. Do it.

52
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,801
Just take it already, please.

53
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,428
-That's all I have.
-That's it?

54
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,804
-That's all you have?
-Yes.

55
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,848
Are you kidding me?

56
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,351
I'm not.
Look, my paycheck hasn't even come in yet.

57
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,645
Please, that's really all I've got.

58
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,690
-You don't have anything else?
-Nothing. I swear.

59
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,234
Fine. Since you don't have anything else,

60
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,320
just give me this.

61
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,947
Your beauty is wasted
if it's not put to good use.

62
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,282
What do you mean?

63
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,368
-Come here.
-You bastard!

64
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,789
Help! Please someone help me!

65
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,918
Oh, God.

66
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,254
-Rapist!
-Let's go!

67
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,672
-Let's go.
-Come here.

68
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,467
Damn you! Bastard!

69
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,007
Rose, do you really have to go?

70
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,885
Yeah, do you?

71
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,428
Your new job is too far.

72
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,806
I told you, right?

73
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,850
We need this.

74
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,352
I'll be back.

75
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,980
It'll just take a while.

76
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,525
Mom.

77
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,197
Don't be sad.
You're making it harder for me to leave.

78
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,532
I'll call you all the time, I promise.

79
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,328
But what if there's no signal there?

80
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,665
Do you really have to go?

81
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,751
Aren't you afraid?

82
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,171
That place is isolated,
and you're going to live with a guy.

83
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,090
I'll be fine, Mom.

84
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,512
It'll be good for us.

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,518
And why do you sound like
you don't trust me?

86
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,936
It's me, you know.

87
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,774
Don't you trust me?

88
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,986
I trust you,
but not the man you're going to live with.

89
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,822
You know how awful men can be.

90
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,325
Mom, that's not fair.

91
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,160
Not all men are awful.

92
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,872
Yeah, just the ones in our lives.

93
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,208
Those are definitely good for nothing.

94
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,711
Anyway, take this with you, okay?

95
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,215
You're going alone.
You'll need protection.

96
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,556
Be careful, okay?

97
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,020
I'll miss you.

98
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,775
We'll all miss you so much.

99
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,989
I'll miss you guys too.

100
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,078
Okay, that's enough.

101
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,582
I might miss the van.

102
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,918
-Hurry up and take that outside, Fern.
-Okay.

103
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,128
All right, go on.

104
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,130
Just be safe, okay?

105
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,133
I love you.

106
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,401
OUR LADY OF THE ANNUNCIATION PARISH

107
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,778
Thank you.

108
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,411
-Thanks, sir.
-Okay.

109
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,749
Ouch.

110
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:24,952
-Rose?
-Ma'am.

111
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,415
-Rose!
-Hello. Nice to meet you, Miss Mabeth.

112
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,792
Just call me Mabeth.

113
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,878
Don't be so formal.

114
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,547
-How was the trip up here?
-It was okay.

115
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,382
-Did you get bored?
-Not at all.

116
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,967
I'm sorry this place is so far.

117
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,969
-Let me help you.
-No, I got it.

118
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,138
I'm excited for you to meet Mr. Peter.

119
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,431
-Ready? Let's go.
-Okay.

120
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,892
I'm sure you two will get along well.
Come on.

121
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,440
You know there's no signal there, right?

122
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,692
But there's some by the highway.

123
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,445
You can go there in case of an emergency.

124
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,615
Don't worry,
I'll show you the spot when we pass it.

125
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,367
And there's no Wi-Fi. Is that okay?

126
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,952
That's fine.

127
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,247
I don't really use the Internet that much.

128
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,417
To be honest, all I do is work and sleep.

129
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,585
That sounds sad.

130
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,215
You probably don't even have time
for a boyfriend.

131
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,678
That's right.

132
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,763
Seriously?

133
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,724
With a pretty face like that?

134
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,774
What about you?

135
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,359
Am I pretty? Of course.

136
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,489
I meant, do you have a boyfriend?

137
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,742
No, but I've got a husband.
Been married for 34 years.

138
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,286
Wow.

139
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,288
You're lucky.

140
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,750
Well, there's only one secret
to a long relationship.

141
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,752
It's not always easy, you know?

142
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,837
You have to make sacrifices.

143
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,880
You know?

144
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,799
You've got to make an effort.

145
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,260
You have to give your partner
what they want.

146
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,846
Can you do that?
Can you give everything for someone love?

147
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,307
Like blow jobs or anal sex.

148
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,850
-The dirty stuff.
-Ma'am.

149
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,228
I'm kidding!

150
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,647
I'm just messing with you.

151
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,607
I'm trying to lighten the mood.

152
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,513
Rose.

153
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,850
There it is.

154
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,185
That's your cottage.

155
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,437
Pretty nice, right?

156
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,022
Yeah.

157
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,483
This place is huge, isn't it?

158
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,945
You know why? This used to be a resort.

159
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,697
All of this used to be a resort.

160
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,243
But the manager that Mr. Peter hired
scammed him,

161
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,163
and he lost all his money.

162
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:01,794
All that's left now
is his retirement fund and this place.

163
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,754
So yeah, it went under.

164
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,466
-Really?
-Yeah.

165
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,761
Doesn't he want to reopen it?

166
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,098
I don't think so.

167
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:22,690
He's probably just grown fond
of the peace and quiet here.

168
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,567
Come on, look at it.

169
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,072
The air here is different, right?

170
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,699
It's so relaxing.

171
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,534
It's peaceful out here.

172
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,745
Anyway, he's getting older too.

173
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,333
And his mind isn't what it used to be.
You know how it is.

174
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,254
That's why I try to help him
as much as I can.

175
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,798
I owe him a lot.

176
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,970
Anyway, come on,
I'll show you your room. Let's go.

177
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:57,307
-Sure.
-Leave your suitcase for now. Come on.

178
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,517
I hope you like it.

179
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,310
It's beautiful.

180
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,938
What? You haven't even seen
the inside yet.

181
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,940
Come on.

182
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,860
I built this place myself…

183
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,611
Just kidding.

184
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,905
I thought…

185
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,324
See?

186
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,577
Nice, right?

187
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,788
-Wow.
-Do you like it?

188
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,873
It's beautiful.

189
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,045
You can arrange things however you want.

190
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,047
Just make sure to keep it clean.

191
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,675
You see all these cabinets here?

192
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,970
They're all yours.
You can put your stuff in there.

193
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,431
And the plants outside, you see them?

194
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,100
-Yes.
-You can plant anything you like.

195
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,185
Follow me.

196
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,190
This here is your very own kitchen.

197
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,735
And there's a bathroom right over there.

198
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,653
Wow, it sure has everything.

199
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:58,035
So listen.
When Mr. Peter's resting or sleeping,

200
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,538
you can use all the facilities
available on the property.

201
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,290
-Really?
-Yeah.

202
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,877
But just a heads-up,
Mr. Peter is not always in a good mood.

203
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,338
Some days he doesn't say a word.

204
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,508
But then other times,
he won't stop talking.

205
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,719
I'm not sure
if it's the dementia acting up.

206
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,723
But you know what I mean.
You're a nurse, after all.

207
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,935
I'm sure you've dealt
with patients like him.

208
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,977
I have.

209
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,979
Oh, I know.

210
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,275
Let's grab your stuff
before I introduce you to him.

211
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,861
Come on.

212
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,115
And here's your key.

213
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,787
All right, now that you're all set up,
I'll introduce you to Mr. Peter.

214
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:48,127
Miss Mabeth,
does Mr. Peter have any family,

215
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,337
or someone close to him?

216
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,842
No. His parents passed away overseas.

217
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,387
His dad was American,
and his mom was Filipino.

218
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,098
Mr. Peter grew up abroad.

219
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,475
He's a retired US Navy officer.

220
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,310
Wow, really?

221
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,690
So you've known each other
for a long time?

222
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,317
I used to work here at the resort.

223
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,239
It's beautiful here, right?

224
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,368
That's why I get people
to help me maintain it.

225
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,996
It's still looks amazing, though.

226
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,875
So spacious and fresh.
Feels so relaxing here.

227
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:33,172
Actually, Miss Mabeth,
if I'm being honest,

228
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
I think I already like it here very much.

229
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,259
Really?

230
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:38,927
Yes.

231
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,181
It just feels so different from the city.

232
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,018
Don't get me wrong,
city like is quite fulfilling,

233
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,395
but it also drains you.

234
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,648
Everyone has their own baggage.

235
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,817
Nurses, patients, doctors…

236
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,405
And you're not supposed to
get attached to your patients,

237
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,618
because in the end,
it's you who gets hurt.

238
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,207
But let's not think about that.
Sorry I brought it up.

239
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,417
I'm just really happy to be here.

240
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,797
This place looks great.

241
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,090
-Yes.
-There's an ATV.

242
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,467
-Yup.
-Does it work?

243
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,843
Yeah, it works.

244
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,430
You can definitely use it
provided you can find the key.

245
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:30,062
The thing is, Mr. Peter doesn't remember
where he put it.

246
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,856
-You know, it's because of his…
-Dementia.

247
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,942
Exactly. Anyway let's head inside.

248
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,154
-It's such a cool ATV.
-Yeah.

249
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,532
-Is he in there?
-Yup, let's go.

250
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,497
Mr. Peter's routine is pretty simple.

251
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,960
I used to take care of him,
but lately I've got too much on my plate.

252
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,588
Plus, he really needs special care.
You know what I mean?

253
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,340
That's why he needs a nurse.

254
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,425
Oh, and one more thing.

255
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,137
No matter what,
don't feed him any beans or seeds.

256
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,432
His uric acid is high,
and he's allergic to them.

257
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,643
-Make sure to remember that.
-Got it.

258
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,021
Oh, my.

259
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,066
Sorry about the dust.
I didn't have time to clean.

260
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,068
I had to come pick you up.

261
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,152
Come on.

262
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,490
I also haven't bathed Mr. Peter yet.

263
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,328
Mr. Peter?

264
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,249
Sir?

265
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,836
Sir, someone's here to meet you.
It's your new nurse.

266
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,012
This is Rose.

267
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,557
Hello, sir.

268
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,694
He says you're okay.

269
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,655
-Really?
-Yeah, he says you're fine.

270
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,033
You'll get used to it.

271
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,868
He's just a little sleepy.

272
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,620
The routine's pretty simple.

273
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,497
Once he wakes up,

274
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:17,085
feed him, give him coffee,
then some exercise and a bath.

275
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,795
If he gets hungry, make him lunch.

276
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,339
If not, dinner will do.

277
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,259
Aside from vitamins,
he isn't on any medication. That's it.

278
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,344
-Okay?
-Got it.

279
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,852
All right, let's go.

280
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,650
I'll take care of those later. Let's go.

281
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,241
It's just gonna be you and Mr. Peter here.

282
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,576
So here's the deal.

283
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:55,665
If you two ever get a surprise visitor
and you feel like you're in danger…

284
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,961
I've got something for you.

285
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,297
Okay.

286
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,153
What's that?

287
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,074
It's for your protection.

288
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,412
But I don't know how to use a gun.

289
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,415
Just use it to scare them off then.

290
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,001
You don't necessarily need to shoot. Okay?

291
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,797
But if things get out of hand,
you have to shoot at them.

292
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,008
-How do you use it?
-Here.

293
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,261
Hold this.

294
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,640
Let's say someone shows up unannounced,
and things get dangerous.

295
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,434
Just point it at them to scare them off.

296
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,938
And if you really feel like
you're in danger,

297
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,232
then for your protection, shoot them.

298
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,401
Just pull the trigger. See?

299
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,236
You got it?

300
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,781
-All right.
-Ma'am…

301
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,950
Put it somewhere safe. Give that to me.

302
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,202
Do you have any questions?

303
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,831
I'm leaving you in charge.
Take care of Mr. Peter.

304
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,916
And be safe, okay?

305
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:25,839
I'll come by every Sunday
with supplies for you two.

306
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,009
If you need me to bring you anything,

307
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,305
or want to send something to your family,
or talk to them,

308
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,473
you can come with me to town.

309
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,934
-Do you understand, Rose?
-Yes.

310
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,686
All right then.

311
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,637
There you go.

312
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,682
It's time to eat, Mr. Peter.

313
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,773
There.

314
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,861
I hope you like it.

315
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,028
It's really good.

316
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,870
I even peeled an orange for you
as a dessert.

317
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,502
Let's get this set up.

318
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,713
There.

319
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,885
Here, have some water first.

320
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,358
Don't you want some water?

321
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,113
You need to drink water.

322
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,160
You also need to eat, okay?

323
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,947
Do you want this?

324
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,118
You like it?

325
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,830
Okay.

326
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,929
All right, you can finish it.

327
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,138
Take it slow.

328
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,103
Delicious, right?

329
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,699
This is my favorite, you know that?

330
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,370
As a child, whenever I would throw a fit,

331
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,456
my mom would always give me this.

332
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,669
Since then, it's been my go-to drink
when I want to relax.

333
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,595
I'll give you one more,
but here's the deal:

334
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,722
I'm the only one who can give this to you.

335
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,182
You can't finish it all. That's bad.

336
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,768
And you have to eat.

337
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,062
Okay?

338
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,150
Is that okay?

339
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,655
You have to eat now.
You promised, remember?

340
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,582
Damn, that's some strong stuff.

341
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,087
Okay.

342
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,494
I'm sure t's nothing.

343
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,120
That was nothing.

344
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,039
Okay.

345
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,853
You're so stupid, Rose.
I told you not to do drugs.

346
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,690
Grass is for cows, remember?

347
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,281
Sandra, you bitch.

348
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,283
You almost killed me.

349
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,709
Okay.

350
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,719
Mr. Peter?

351
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,486
Mr. Peter, you startled me.

352
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,954
Let me see.

353
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,460
There you go.

354
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,048
You look great, sir.

355
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,095
All right, shall we eat?

356
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,892
It tastes good. I hope you like it.

357
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,982
Hold on, let me put on your bib

358
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,278
so we can eat without making a mess.

359
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:45,995
All right.

360
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,629
This property is huge, isn't it, sir?

361
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,506
But it's kind of far.

362
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,470
Why did you choose to move out here?

363
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,151
You know, sir,
I actually dreamed of a place like this.

364
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,822
Not as big or as remote as this but…

365
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,410
hopefully this close to nature.

366
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,915
And far enough
from the stress of the city.

367
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,088
You know, my mom really loves plants.

368
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:43,844
That's why she named me
and my siblings after them.

369
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,683
There's Daisy, Fern,

370
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,271
and then me, Rose.

371
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:01,279
I've always wanted to give her
a place like this someday.

372
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,700
A place where she can have her own garden.

373
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,414
My mom's really good with plants.

374
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,375
She knows everything about them.

375
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,420
She knows which ones look nice,

376
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,048
which ones bear fruit easily.

377
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,469
And she even knows
which ones are poisonous,

378
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,638
which ones to avoid.

379
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,353
I'm sure she'd love it here.

380
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,488
<i>You're next.</i>

381
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,694
Damn you, Sandra.

382
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:13,989
That stuff's potent.

383
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,159
It's affecting me in my dreams.

384
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,264
It's been a while since we last spoke.

385
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,322
Is it time to eat, Ann?

386
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,384
Nothing, sir.

387
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,428
It's nothing.

388
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,139
Here you go.

389
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,021
Let's eat.

390
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,523
I'll just grab some water.

391
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,699
I've got your water here, all right?

392
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,783
And then…

393
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,916
Hey.

394
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,631
Peter.

395
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,594
Why is there a yogurt drink missing?

396
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:03,140
Didn't I tell you
only I'm allowed to give it to you?

397
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,835
A few times.

398
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,713
I take after my mom.

399
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,675
I've loved and gotten hurt a few times.

400
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,189
Yeah, I was happy.

401
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,235
But it always felt like
something was missing.

402
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,631
I think you're right.

403
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,303
You know,

404
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,014
all the men I've loved

405
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,059
only ended up hurting me.

406
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,687
They all lied to me.

407
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,650
My mom says I'm too forgiving.

408
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:41,363
Most of my exes were older than me.

409
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,907
My friends say I date older men

410
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,162
because of my daddy issues.

411
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,210
I grew up

412
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,546
without a father.

413
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,395
what about you?

414
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,608
Have you loved anyone after Ann?

415
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,111
After me?

416
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,268
Okay.

417
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,520
The light.

418
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,030
There.

419
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,869
I'll take care of your slippers later.

420
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,456
Okay? Comfortable?

421
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,957
Time to sleep now, sir.

422
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,585
Okay?

423
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,765
You want me to get it?

424
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,979
Okay. All right.

425
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,759
Is this what you were looking for, sir?

426
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,018
Really?

427
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,857
You look handsome.

428
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,610
Hold on, who's this?

429
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,030
Mama.

430
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,870
Is that your mom, sir?

431
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,889
Navy…

432
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,766
Sounds awesome.

433
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,019
That's impressive.

434
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,567
You know, sir,
I also plan to work abroad someday.

435
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:18,325
It's my dream to go be a nurse overseas.

436
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,424
What are these?

437
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:43,809
What?

438
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,650
Okay.

439
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,112
Get some sleep now, Mr. Owl.

440
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,743
Take it easy.

441
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,751
Good night, sir.

442
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:02,275
<i>Happy anniversary, love!</i>

443
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,320
<i>I'm sorry I can't be with you today.</i>

444
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,530
<i>It's been hectic at the ward.</i>

445
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,659
<i>But don't worry,</i>
<i>tomorrow we'll do dinner and a movie.</i>

446
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,408
Shit!

447
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,550
Mr. Peter!

448
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,221
Mr. Peter,
there's someone here at the resort!

449
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,557
Wake up! Someone's here, sir!

450
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,560
-Visitor?
-Intruder! There's an intruder!

451
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,149
I saw him.

452
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,153
He's following us.

453
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,876
Let's lock the windows.

454
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,594
Come on.

455
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,929
I saw him.

456
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:50,860
Mr. Peter.

457
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,113
Mr. Peter.

458
00:58:56,574 --> 00:59:02,413
Mr. Peter, shall I go to the highway
and get help?

459
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,296
We don't have a choice.

460
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,550
We can't hide in here forever.

461
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,969
I'll be back soon, don't worry.

462
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,298
Ow! Let go of me!

463
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,479
I said let go of me!

464
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,230
Fuck you!

465
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,526
Let me go.

466
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,014
Let me go.

467
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,182
Who are you?

468
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,350
What do you want?

469
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,851
I'm not here to hurt you.

470
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,269
Let me go!

471
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,646
Why should I believe you?!

472
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,022
I said let me go.

473
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,440
I'm telling the truth!

474
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,694
I'm just looking for my girlfriend!

475
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,323
She's been missing for months.
This is the last place she worked.

476
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,616
What are you saying?

477
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:49,455
I've been roaming around the town for days
because I couldn't find this place.

478
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,457
Then you showed up.

479
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:56,546
And that woman Mabeth
was in touch with my girlfriend too.

480
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,339
That's how I followed you here.

481
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,299
-Let me go.
-Listen to me.

482
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,634
Let me go, you--

483
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,261
Just listen to me!

484
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:08,975
I don't have any proof, but there's
something off about this place.

485
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,810
I'm not sure what it is exactly.

486
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,812
I've been watching this place for days,

487
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,732
and I'm sure this is where
my girlfriend disappeared from.

488
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,121
Mr. Peter, thank you.

489
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,915
Thank you.

490
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,596
Let me go,
or we're both gonna die out here.

491
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:47,865
What do you mean?

492
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,494
My girlfriend…

493
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,998
she's a nurse who used to work here.

494
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,838
She stopped contacting me
a few weeks after she moved here.

495
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,800
I did everything I could to find her.

496
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,345
But no one had any information about her.

497
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,683
That's why I came looking for this place.

498
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,437
But I couldn't find any trace of her.

499
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,026
The only thing I found
was her phone in the woods.

500
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,445
I'm sure

501
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,740
that Ann never left this place.

502
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,536
Take my phone from my pocket.

503
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:38,249
Take it.
You'll see that I'm telling the truth.

504
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:39,959
Hurry.

505
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,086
Take it.

506
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,696
Where's the gun?

507
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,115
Where is it?

508
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,816
Whoa!

509
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,110
Don't even try it.

510
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:03,834
But now

511
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,303
Unfortunately,

512
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:17,264
I'm the one holding it.

513
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,350
Not you.

514
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,269
You monster!

515
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:31,237
Do you really wanna know
what happened to Ann?

516
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,501
What did you do to her?!

517
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,937
I really miss her.

518
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,481
But then

519
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:11,610
I visit her if I want to talk to her.

520
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,156
Why do you call me Ann?

521
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,344
Flirty,

522
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,346
weak…

523
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,726
She was fun to play with.

524
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:51,145
That's why she's never coming back to you.

525
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,438
Fuck you.

526
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,273
You fucking monster!

527
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,527
Fuck you.

528
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,031
Stop! Come back!

529
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,033
Come back!

530
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:05,868
Back!

531
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:15,920
Useless.

532
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,630
Someone with no potential.

533
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:20,883
Yes.

534
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:28,719
Where's Ann? Bring her back.

535
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,054
You want to see her?!

536
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,722
Then go join her!

537
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,722
Good thing you're pretty…

538
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,227
pretty fun to play with.

539
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,989
I'm sure you already know
what I'm going to do with you.

540
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,410
Please don't.

541
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:25,539
And you? Have you reunited with Ann?

542
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,168
Fuck you, you monster!

543
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,045
Let me go--

544
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:42,806
I want you to experience the darkness

545
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,809
before I kill you.

546
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,372
You really wore me out.

547
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,586
You're fun to play with.

548
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,487
Hurry up!

549
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,006
You seem to have forgotten something.

550
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,392
This is really good.

551
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,277
It has a unique flavor.

552
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,203
Delicious.

553
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,141
Want some?

554
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,023
It's all gone.

555
01:21:56,536 --> 01:21:58,204
What shall we do now?

556
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,585
I can't think of anything.

557
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,715
Maybe it's time for you to rest.

558
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,347
Let's finish this.

559
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,268
What about you?

560
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,815
Fuck you.

561
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,070
You…

562
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:29,295
Didn't I tell you?

563
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:34,342
My mom loves plants, remember?

564
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,389
She knows all the poisonous plants.

565
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,018
You know, my mom really loves plants.

566
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,270
She knows everything about them.

567
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,772
<i>She knows which ones look nice,</i>

568
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:51,276
<i>which ones bear fruit easily.</i>

569
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:56,114
And she even knows
which ones are poisonous,

570
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,324
<i>which ones to avoid.</i>

571
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,871
You're going alone.
You'll need protection.

572
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,548
This rosary I'm using…

573
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:20,680
it's made from a plant called Rosary Pea.

574
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,435
Most people don't know

575
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,063
that it's poisonous.

576
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:37,238
Its toxins are now flowing
inside your veins.

577
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:42,035
So I'd say, Mr. Peter,

578
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:46,623
that it's time
you started saying your Hail Marys.

579
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:23,660
Good thing I listened to my mom.

580
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,790
She said to always be careful
of demons like you.

581
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,062
Fuck you.

582
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:20,855
Fuck.

583
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:24,692
How could he do this?

584
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:29,781
How could he?

585
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:02,188
No.

586
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:15,256
Love?

587
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:18,676
Love.

588
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:22,763
Seems like he enjoyed it.

589
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:31,314
You're just as evil as him.

590
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:33,065
Rose, wait.

591
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:35,067
Let me explain.

592
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:39,030
I was forced into this, believe me.

593
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:40,406
Please believe me.

594
01:33:41,073 --> 01:33:42,992
-I'm just a victim of--
-You're a victim?

595
01:33:43,075 --> 01:33:44,827
-Yes, I am.
-A victim?!

596
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:47,163
Yes. You must feel sorry for me.

597
01:33:47,246 --> 01:33:49,457
-Did you feel sorry for us?
-Rose…

598
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:52,668
Is he your husband?

599
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:53,753
Rose…

600
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:56,464
You don't deserve any sympathy.

601
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:58,007
Rose, please.

602
01:33:58,632 --> 01:33:59,675
Have some pity.

603
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:02,803
Have some pity, Rose.

604
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:05,389
Rose, have some pity. I'm so sorry!

605
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,950
I'm fine.

606
01:35:08,786 --> 01:35:11,414
We found the victims in the freezer.

607
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:12,832
Including Mabeth,

608
01:35:12,915 --> 01:35:16,794
who according to you, was shot by Felix
and is an accomplice of the killer.

609
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:22,258
We also got the documents
relating to his past.

610
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:24,593
We've verified it with Interpol,

611
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:27,012
and based on the evidence you saw,

612
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:31,350
he is indeed the serial killer
they've been searching for.

613
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:37,481
But the problem is…

614
01:35:41,944 --> 01:35:47,199
we didn't find Mr. Peter Coleman's body
at the resort.
