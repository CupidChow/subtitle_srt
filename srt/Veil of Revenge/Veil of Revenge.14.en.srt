=Episode 14=

4
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,560
Lulu?

5
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,850
Why are you here?

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,510
I know we have a misunderstanding,

7
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,980
but if you need help,

8
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,140
you can ask me.

9
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,020
Ask you?

10
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,940
For what?

11
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,220
To see how happy you are

12
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,380
after stealing my man?

13
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,620
If you want to see it,

14
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,620
that'd be great.

15
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,260
Is this a reliable job?

16
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,460
You can leave now,

17
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,580
but can you find another job?

18
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,790
(What a coincidence.
It's the same neighborhood.)

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,020
Why is it here?

20
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,460
Isn't it Chen Yue's...?

21
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,460
You're here.

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,140
Ms. Chen.

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,540
Go on with your work.

24
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,380
I'm leaving.

25
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,700
Don't go.

26
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,820
Why is it her?

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,060
I don't want to work for her.

28
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,400
You can quit,

29
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,460
but I've paid a deposit

30
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,620
and signed a contract.

31
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,790
If you violate it,

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,040
you'll pay ten times the deposit.

33
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,140
(Live-in Maid Agreement)

34
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,340
50 thousand yuan?

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,340
Where's the money?

36
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,620
I spent it.

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,660
Well,

38
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,060
I'm doing this for you.

39
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,700
It's a great job.

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,980
Ms. Chen

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,180
is kind and beautiful

42
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,500
and offers you high salaries.

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Be grateful.

44
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,530
You...

45
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,050
Lulu,

46
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,020
I just want to help you.

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,020
You did it on purpose.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,830
We were sisters.

49
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,950
You're so miserable now.

50
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,340
If Zhiren finds out

51
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,460
I didn't help you,

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,780
he'll say I'm cruel.

53
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,020
How dare you talk about him?

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,220
Hey, Lulu,

55
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,460
don't be a child.

56
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,820
I'm going to work.

57
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,140
You only need

58
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,620
to mop all the floors,

59
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,980
wipe the cabinets,

60
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,780
and wash the sheets and covers.

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,380
That's a lot.

62
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,380
Only need to...?

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,650
Thanks.

64
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,740
Honey,

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,460
I hired a maid for you.

66
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,700
She'll come tomorrow morning.

67
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,820
Maid?

68
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,100
Hello, Mrs. Li.

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,260
I'm Zhang Lulu,

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,620
the new maid.

71
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,700
Zhang Lulu...

72
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,930
Zhang Lulu...

73
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,320
Zhang Lulu...

74
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,870
Ghost!

75
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,630
Zhang Lulu...

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,820
I didn't do it...

77
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,900
Stay away!

78
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,980
Zhang Lulu...

79
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,880
Ghost...

80
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,870
Lulu,

81
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,940
what's wrong?

82
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,540
Are you uncomfortable?

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,340
It's okay.

84
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,500
I just

85
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,100
had a nightmare.

86
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,700
Okay.

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,980
Have some milk

88
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,040
and rest early.

89
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,220
You can't live in a murder house.

90
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,980
Why do I have nightmares every night?
