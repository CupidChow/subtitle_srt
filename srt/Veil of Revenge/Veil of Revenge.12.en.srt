=Veil of Revenge=

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,950
Did you get married before?

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,280
Yue,

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,630
here's to our new company

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,190
and everything you've done
for me and my family.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,470
We're one.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,150
What's wrong?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Nothing.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,030
Why

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,220
didn't you talk about her?

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,280
She...

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,910
She passed away.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,720
Sorry,

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,390
I shouldn't have asked.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
It's okay.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,910
It's in the past.

=Episode 12=

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,190
Are you still sad?

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,430
Why would I be sad?

20
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,470
I've got money

21
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,590
and a company.

22
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,190
Lulu has left.

23
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,230
I'm finally free.

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,750
I'm free.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,830
I'm so happy right now.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,670
I'm glad that you're happy.

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,720
Well,

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,680
it's getting late.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,590
Since you're okay,

30
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,190
I'm leaving.

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,470
Yueran, don't go.

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
Don't go...

33
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,070
You're awake.

34
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,630
I...

35
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,190
I was drunk.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,490
What happened after we...

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
You didn't sleep well.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,710
Do you have a headache?

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,310
I'll make breakfast.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,550
Get some sleep.

41
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,230
I don't want you to be tired.

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,390
Let's go to a restaurant.

43
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,790
So, you've been
having an affair with my man!

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,710
What are you doing?

45
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,950
Yueran is my girlfriend now.

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,110
Don't bother me anymore.

47
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,550
We're only strangers.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,630
Li Zhiren.

49
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,350
Zhang Lulu, stop making a scene.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,110
Karma is real.

51
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,150
I was standing there

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,460
and seeing you push that woman.

53
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,830
I never expected my retribution
would come so soon.

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,510
But I'm lucky

55
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,920
to be alive.

56
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,500
Chen Yueran,

57
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,970
you'd better be careful.

58
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,870
The more happy you are,

59
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,270
the more miserable you'll be!

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,110
Zhang Lulu, get out of here.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
Guards, get her out!

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,850
- You! Li Zhiren,
- Don't make a scene!

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,190
you'll be punished!

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,510
You'll go to hell!

65
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,190
Yueran, are you okay?

66
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,990
Let's go.

67
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Just ignore her.

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
Mr. Gao.

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,190
The files you asked.

70
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Wait.

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,020
Mr. Gao, what else can I do?

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
Yueran,

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,470
do you really like Li Zhiren?

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
Mr. Gao,

75
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,500
it's my privacy.

76
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
I have a good reason,

77
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,020
but I promise it won't affect my work.

78
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,140
Please don't interfere in my life.

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
What secrets are you hiding?

80
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,620
Why can't you tell me?

81
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,060
I don't understand.

82
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,340
Good!

83
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,790
Zhiren,

84
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,630
congratulations.

85
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,540
We've got the deal with Mr. Wang.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,500
It's up to you now.

87
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,400
Make sure we get the investment.

88
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,450
Don't worry.

89
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
Let's have the cake.

90
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,770
Okay.

91
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,490
Tissue.

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,760
I need a tissue.

93
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,660
Mr. Li, bad news.

94
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,100
The financing list related to

95
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,940
our project

96
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,500
has been published,

97
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,060
but we're not on it.

98
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,220
We promised Mr. Wang again and again

99
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,420
that we'd get Lingyu Group's investment.

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,020
That's why he decided to work with us.

101
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,540
If he finds out,

102
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,020
the entire new project will fail.

103
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,940
Did you call Ms. Chen?

104
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,180
I did, but I couldn't get through.

105
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,980
Then go to her place!

106
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,780
I can't. Even her company

107
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,100
doesn't have her address.

108
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,660
Mr. Li, aren't you

109
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,500
in a relationship

110
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,420
with Ms. Chen?

111
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,140
Don't you know her address?

112
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,420
Get out now!

113
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,020
I remember

114
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,800
this restaurant is always popular.

115
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,380
Why is there no customer

116
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
at this hour?

117
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,500
It's Mr. Gao's birthday,

118
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,300
and he booked the entire place.

119
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,030
This way, please.

120
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,180
Okay.

121
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,660
My secretary told me

122
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,460
you liked the steak here.

123
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,420
Me too.

124
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,300
I didn't know it was your birthday,

125
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,140
so I didn't prepare anything.

126
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,980
It's okay.

127
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,940
I'm glad that you can

128
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,100
celebrate my birthday.

129
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,820
However, I've prepared
something for you.
