2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,360
Lulu,

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,950
it's not what you think.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,270
This is a misunderstanding.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,750
Stop crying.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,680
Look...

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,800
How about this?

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,180
I...

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,710
I'll give you anything you want, okay?

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,040
Okay?

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,230
Then I want to be a director.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,350
Please, okay?

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,320
I...

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,110
You're the best.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,710
Okay. Stop crying.

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,780

=Episode 8=

17
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,750
Hello,

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,390
I'm Li Zhiren, the general manager
of Zhiren Daily Chemicals.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
I had

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,070
an appointment with Mr. Zhu at 2:00 p.m.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,390
Wait a minute.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,390
Mr. Zhu is busy.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Honey,

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
why are you here?

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,380
- I...
- Yue.

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,600
Yue,

27
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,270
- Mr. Zhu...
- didn't I tell you

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,230
I'd send someone to you?

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,870
Why did you come in person?

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,650
My husband knew you liked
Mr. Zhou's painting,

31
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,520
so he asked a friend
to get it from the auction.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,440
It just arrived.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,320
Zhiren

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,490
asked me to send it here.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,670
It's just a small gift.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,440
Thanks.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,710
Let's go inside.

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,560
Okay.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,390
I'm going to announce
something important.

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,030
From now on,

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,280
we'll...

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,800
What are you doing?

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,270
From now on,

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,430
we'll work closely with Lingyu Group

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,830
in the new product

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,710
and the financing project.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,710
This is Ms. Chen from Lingyu Group.

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,830
Lulu, you'll assist Ms. Chen

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,970
and satisfy all her needs

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,630
for the success of this project.

51
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,640
But you promised...

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,350
We'll talk about it when this is over.

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,500
Ms. Zhang,

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,340
looking forward to our cooperation.

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,700
Are you kidding me?

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,800
Didn't you promise to announce
my appointment?

57
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,900
Lulu, be patient.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,790
When you finish this project,

59
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,540
I'll immediately make you

60
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,960
a director. I swear, okay?

61
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,510
Don't be angry,

62
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,630
babe.

63
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,070
Babe.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,840
That's my girl.

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,000
Lulu,

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,710
I've prepared the materials

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,150
of this project for you.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,430
Please read it

69
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,710
and give a project plan on Friday.

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,060
Friday?

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,010
Isn't it tomorrow?

72
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,140
We don't have much time.

73
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,050
Thanks, Lulu.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,170
Lulu.

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,450
You're off.

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
Why are you here?

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,430
But I need to read the materials.

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,710
There's so much left.

79
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,790
Okay, go on with your work.

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
You'll make it.

81
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,350
Zhiren.

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,840
Mr. Gao is having a dinner party.

83
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,030
Do you have time for that?

84
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,490
I can also use this opportunity

85
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,660
to help you to introduce

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,070
our project to him.

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,550
Okay.

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,640
I'll go with you.

89
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,810
Okay...

90
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,450
Okay.

91
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,650
Let's go.

92
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,740
(Zhang Shuai)

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,550
Never mind. You should go.

94
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,050
I need to finish my work.

95
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Okay.

96
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,450
Then we're leaving.

97
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,380
(Zhang Shuai: Miss me?
I'm at the stairwell.)

98
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,990
What are you doing?

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,110
Didn't I tell you

100
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,310
not to come here again?

101
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,150
I miss you so much.

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,590
It's been a long time.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,110
Don't you miss me?

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,550
Stop it.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,950
This is Zhiren's company.

106
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,990
What if someone sees us?

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,840
What?

108
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,390
Who'd come

109
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,830
to the stairwell at this hour?

110
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,710
You need money, don't you?

111
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,590
Lulu, you know me the best.

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,350
I like how you read my mind.

113
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,790
Same old place

114
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,430
after work.

115
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,150
I'm not going.

116
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,710
Zhiren and I are making a baby.

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,800
Well,

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,670
you've been together
for more than a year.

119
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,830
You're still not pregnant.

120
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,270
When we were together,

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,670
you got pregnant twice.

122
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,550
Maybe

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,030
he can't get you pregnant.

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,470
Shut up.

125
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,430
I'll give you the money.

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,270
I don't want to see you again.

127
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
I'll be waiting.

128
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,510
This is the Pu'er tea
I've stored for years.

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,400
Try it.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,430
I can't finish the work.

131
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,950
There are so many files.

132
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,790
I can't finish them in two days.

133
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,440
Well...

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,030
It's enough for a normal person.

135
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,630
Maybe I didn't
take into account your ability.

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,630
Will two more days be enough for you?

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,750
Lulu,

138
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,030
work harder,

139
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,340
and you'll catch up.

140
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Mr. Li,

141
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,190
we're having a business dinner tonight.

142
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,430
Do you have time?

143
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,590
Tonight?

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,830
But I had an appointment with Mr. Li.

145
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
Zhiren, I'll do it for you.

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,590
Paperwork doesn't suit me at all.

147
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,030
I'm better at communication.

148
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
But...

149
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,730
it's very important.

150
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Mr. Wang...

151
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,150
Don't worry.

152
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,790
I can definitely handle Mr. Wang.

153
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Zhiren.

154
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,270
Please trust me.

155
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,910
Okay. You can go.

156
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,190
Give me the money.

157
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,410
What was he doing?

158
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,550
Asking directions.

159
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,710
Asking directions?

160
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,050
Learn from Yueran

161
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,250
at dinner.

162
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,750
Don't make trouble.

163
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,370
I can do this.

164
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,970
It's just a dinner.

165
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,010
Okay. I believe you.

166
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,010
- Let's go.
- Okay.

167
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,480
