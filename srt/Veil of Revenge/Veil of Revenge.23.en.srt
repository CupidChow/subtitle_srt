=Veil of Revenge=

2
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,750
Thanks.

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,180
Eat it.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,250
But my hand got hurt.

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,090
I can't move.

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,410
Never mind. I can do it.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,860
Forget it.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,990
I'll feed you.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,390
So sweet.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,090
You should have some too.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,760
What's wrong?

12
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,360
Are you thinking about
how Li Zhiren ran away?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,510
Where do you think

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,280
he can go?

15
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,820
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 23=

16
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,990
My buns!

17
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,990
My buns!

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,990
Give them back!

19
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,000
Give them back!

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,950
Give them back!

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,960
Zhiren.

22
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,430
Zhiren?

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Zhiren?

24
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,370
Zhiren? Are you home?

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
What?

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,230
What's wrong with him?

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,990
He didn't answer my calls.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,590
He's neither in the office nor at home.

29
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,670
Where is he?

30
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,920
He's an adult.

31
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,360
How could he get lost?

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Maybe

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,340
he's out having fun with his girlfriend

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,110
Zhang Lulu.

35
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,510
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,990
He's at home, isn't he?

37
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,730
Zhiren.

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,720
Zhiren?

39
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,790
- Zhiren?
- Why is he in the guest room?

40
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,450
Zhiren?

41
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,190
Zhiren, are you in there?

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,070
Is he locked in the room?

43
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,820
I'll get the key.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,300
Zhiren?

45
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,480
Zhiren?

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,780
What is...?

47
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,070
What's wrong with you?

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,110
Why are you such a mess?

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,310
How long have you been hungry?

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,270
How did you get locked there?

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,560
Where's Zhiren?

52
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,410
Where is he?

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,340
I should be asking

54
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,390
where he is!

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,600
He's a psychopath!

56
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,870
It was he who locked me there.

57
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,710
Listen, it's a crime!

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,030
It's illegal imprisonment!

59
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,050
What's going on?

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
I'll sue him.

61
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,990
I'll definitely sue him!

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,350
Nonsense!

63
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,030
My son would never do that!

64
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,750
You can't go!

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,630
You can't go!

66
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,800
Mom, Mom...

67
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,850
It's Zhiren's stuff.

68
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,710
You can't take it!

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,680
He imprisoned me.
This is the compensation!

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,070
No, you can't take it away!

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,270
Mom, you can't...

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,230
You... Mom!

73
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,750
Forget it.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,030
We should wait for my brother.

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,350
I'm so pissed off!

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,910
Here's to your recovery.

77
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Thanks.

78
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,790
I didn't prepare anything

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,110
for your birthday.

80
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,390
I'll make it up for you.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,670
Make a wish.

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Okay.

83
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,990
You...

84
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,430
What did you wish for?

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,910
I wished...

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Take a guess.

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,190
Gao Lingyu!

88
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,470
Forget it. Don't be angry.

89
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,020
I'll wipe it.

90
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,630
Here too.

91
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,990
It's sticky.

92
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,550
I'll get cleaned up.

93
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
Okay.

94
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,830
You...

95
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,070
Are you blind? Can't you see me?

96
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,150
You're so...

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,600
Girl.

98
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,310
What's wrong?

99
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,950
Okay. You...

100
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,790
Naughty girl.
