2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,880
Lulu went out to see her friend.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,180
She won't come home tonight.

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,710
Zhiren.

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,470
Does the aroma diffuser

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,390
smell good?

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,230
Of course.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,350
Yueran...

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,310
Oh, no.

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,600
Sorry. Well, Ms. Chen.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,600
Ms. Chen, sorry.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,840
I should finish this one first.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,150
I drank too much.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,680
Give me a break.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,480
I don't think you're drunk.

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,990
You're sober now.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,990
So hot...

18
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,380
Smell good?

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,760
Didn't I just answer you?

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,320
I mean...

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,670
Do I smell good?

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,980

=Episode 3=

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,100
I mean...

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,500
Do I smell good?

25
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,470
Yes.

26
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,960
Li Zhiren!

27
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,300
Do I smell good?

28
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,180
Yes.

29
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,700
Lulu!

30
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,870
Open the door.

31
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,480
Stop joking, okay? I'm sorry!

32
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,420
- Mom?
- Zhiren, are you okay?

33
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,300
What happened?

34
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,470
Mom, we're just messing around.

35
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,040
It's still early in the morning,
You've gone too far!

36
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,520
We're joking. Don't worry.

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,870
Why did you lock my son in the room?

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Li Zhiren,

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,320
I won't forgive you
unless you kneel for half an hour!

40
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,510
How dare she?

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,470
Mom! What are you doing?

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,870
Look at you.

43
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,990
She was just a maid.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,830
You feed her and give her money,

45
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,030
but she's never taken good care of you.

46
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,920
- Mom, what are you talking about?
- How dare she yell at you?

47
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,510
Doesn't she know her place?

48
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,030
You're not married yet.

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,950
If you are, it'll be a disaster!

50
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,830
Chen Yue was so rich,

51
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,470
but she never dared to disobey me!

52
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,070
Who the hell are you?

53
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,930
Chen Yue?

54
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Chen Yue, right?

55
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,200
She's dead.

56
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,670
Why are you still talking about her?

57
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,330
Do you want to go to hell with her?

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,050
- What? How can you say that?
- Mom, Mom!

59
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,880
It's been a long time.
Don't mention it anymore, okay?

60
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,860
Li Zhiren,

61
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,020
I'm not as weak

62
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,300
as Chen Yue!

63
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,900
Don't go too far!

64
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,510
Lulu, Lulu!

65
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,660
Lulu, don't go!

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,910
What are you doing?

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,070
Don't spoil her. Let her go!

68
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,950
Mom, stop talking!

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Lulu!

70
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,270
Listen to me.

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,430
It was a misunderstanding last night.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,320
I don't want your explanation!

73
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,390
I know you better

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,470
than anyone else!

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,750
Lulu, Lulu!

76
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,240
Don't stop her! Let her go!

77
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,310
She'll definitely come back
in a couple of days!

78
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,150
Mom!

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,590
How can she live without you?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Get out!

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,310
Get out of here now!

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,510
Hello,

83
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,070
are you the owner here?

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Yes.

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,550
Here's the thing. The property manager

86
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,470
is sending electronic doorbells
to our clients.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,990
Sign this, and I'll install it for you.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,670
- Please install it.
- Okay, hold this, please.
