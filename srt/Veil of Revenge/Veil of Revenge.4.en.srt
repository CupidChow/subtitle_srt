3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,760
Honey,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,400
I hired a maid for you.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,510
She'll come tomorrow morning.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,910
Maid?

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,430
She can help you with housework

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,470
and cooking.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,590
Most importantly,
she can keep you company.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,350
I don't want you to feel lonely at home.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,440
Thanks, honey.

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,230
Let's go to sleep.

(Fallopian Tube Stenosis)

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,110
Honey,

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,110
are you upset?

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,770
I've quit my job and stayed at home

18
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,750
having Chinese traditional medicine
for a year,

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,950
but I still can't get pregnant.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,440
Honey.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,870
You must be patient.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,670
Yesterday, Liu told me

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,750
he'd been married for ten years,

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,670
and his wife just got pregnant.

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,030
- But...
- Stop crying.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,390
Do you dislike me?

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,230
I'm so fat.

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,190
I don't deserve to be your wife.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,110
Your appearance isn't the reason
why I love you.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,200
Besides,

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,830
you gained weight because you've been
taking medicine to get pregnant.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,110
How can I dislike you?

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,480
Honey,

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,070
you've been so good to me,

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,590
but I can't even give you a child.

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,290
Honey,

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,310
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

38
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,310
We've got the medical report, right?

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,350
It's hard for you to get pregnant

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,830
because of the fallopian tube stenosis.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,990
Just let it be, okay?

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,630
Even if we don't have a child,

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,070
I'll still love you
for the rest of my life.

44
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,510
Mom, why are you here?

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,870
Zhijie wanted to eat sea cucumbers.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,470
I remembered you had some,

47
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,670
so I came here to get them.

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,280
My mom just brought me a box
of sea cucumbers and abalone

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
a few days ago.

50
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,110
They're in the kitchen.

51
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,110
Just take them.

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,470
Your mom brought you?

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,310
Do you think you're a boss?

54
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,830
You haven't worked for a year!

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,230
My son has been

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,830
running the company.

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,910
He's been paying for

58
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,670
everything you have now.

59
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,890
I...

60
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,870
Look at you.

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,950
You're always dancing.

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,270
Can't you clean up the mess

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,710
in the kitchen?

64
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,470
Why can't you do something useful?

65
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,030
Look how fat you are.

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,270
Why are you still dancing?

67
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,550
I just cleaned up the kitchen
this morning.

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,110
I know I'm fat, so I'm exercising.

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,270
Otherwise, how can I lose weight?

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,790
Look at your clothes.

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,950
You've got layers of fat

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,830
on your waist.

73
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,910
How can you dance by the window?

74
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,230
Who are you dancing for?

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,630
Zhiren. It's midnight.
When are you coming back?

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,510
What? I can't hear you.

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,830
I'm seeing a client.

78
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,720
What's wrong?

79
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,150
I think I hurt my back.

80
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,750
Can you come home now?

81
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,340
Hello, what?

82
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,850
What did you say?

83
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,870
Stop calling me.

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,870
I've been busy every day.

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,500
Can't you put yourself in my shoes?

86
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,900
Okay. I'm hanging up.

87
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,000
- Hello?
- Talk to you later.

88
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,220
Zhiren?

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
Honey,

90
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,710
you're finally back.

91
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
Honey.

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,790
You must be tired.

93
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm exhausted.

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,790
I'll get some sleep.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,270
It's okay.

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,790
he's been lying to me!

104
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,070
The shoes...

105
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,680
These are my shoes.

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,340
They're counterfeits.
