2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,180
I'm back.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,020
You must be tired.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,900
Are you hungry?

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,920
Yes.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,460
Ms. Zhang made this?

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,300
Yes.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,020
It's good.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,500
I agree,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,940
but...

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,800
I think

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,580
she was kind of weird today.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,460
She was spying on me.

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,580
No way.

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,460
When I got home,

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,940
I saw her

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,900
sneaking out of my room.

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,740
Mrs. Li, you're back.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,500
Should I hire another maid tomorrow?

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,620
I'll observe her for a few days.

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,740
Let's have dinner.

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,060
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 5=

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,450
Honey,

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,580
happy 5th anniversary.

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,740
Thanks, honey.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,380
I thought you forgot it.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,100
How could I forget it?

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,830
Come on. Let's have dinner.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,800
Okay.

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,020
Honey.

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,940
I ordered these

32
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,260
from your favorite restaurant.

33
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,420
Thanks, honey,

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,340
but that restaurant

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,700
is always popular.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,660
You must've

37
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,060
waited for a long time.

38
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,980
As long as you're happy, it's worth it.

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,620
Honey, I love you.

40
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,540
I love you, too.

41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,700
Cheers.

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,820
The wine is nice, right?

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,290
Come on.

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,580
Let's eat.

45
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,510
Have a big duck leg.

46
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,350
Okay.

47
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,820
Honey, eat more.

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,500
- Okay.
- Eat more.

49
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,220
Honey.

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,740
Don't worry

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,620
about the company.

52
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
Just stay at home

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,270
and enjoy your life,

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,140
okay?

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,180
Thank you.

56
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,100
Come on.

57
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,660
Honey, I love you.

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
Cheers.

59
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,860
Honey,

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,900
what's this?

61
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,460
I bought new clothes for you.

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,420
You need to attend
a business banquet

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,500
in a few days.

64
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,460
I was worried
that you didn't have a new dress,

65
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,820
but I bought one for you.

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,100
Check it out.

67
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,340
Okay. Thanks, honey.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,660
It's beautiful.

69
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,900
I've wanted to buy it for a long time.

70
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,900
Oh, look at the shoes.

71
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,030
- Okay.
- The shoes.

72
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,340
Hello, Mrs. Li, I'm Zhang Lulu,

73
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,300
the new maid.

74
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,020
The shoes...

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,940
These are my shoes.

76
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,220
They're counterfeits.

77
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
What's wrong?

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,110
You don't like them?

79
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,140
Shall we go shopping tomorrow?

80
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,860
No.

81
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
I like them.

82
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,460
Thanks, honey.

83
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,580
Okay. Let's go downstairs for dinner.

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,740
Okay.

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,940
It's supposed to be here.

86
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,960
Where is it?

87
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,420
Mrs. Li,

88
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,740
I just cleaned your room.

89
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,740
I'll cook now.

90
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,490
Okay.

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,900
Are you crazy?

92
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,250
Call Li Zhiren back

93
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,820
and tell him I'm not at home.

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,880
Lulu.

95
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,220
Why did you call me back?

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,220
Where is the fat pig?

97
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
Honey...

98
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,780
You call me honey

99
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,100
when I'm around

100
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,060
and call me

101
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,140
fat pig behind my back!

102
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,060
Honey, it's not like that.

103
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,420
You're a b*stard!

104
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,420
Honey, I'm sorry.

105
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,980
Honey, I'm so sorry.

106
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,340
- Yue.
- It's not like that.

107
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,700
We love each other.

108
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,620
I knew him long before you did.

109
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,220
He's my first love,

110
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,860
We finally met each other again.

111
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,620
Please fulfill our wish!

112
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,220
What a romantic

113
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,580
but cliche and disgusting love story.

114
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,020
You had nothing we got together!

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,060
I gave you

116
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,900
everything

117
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,420
after you married me!

118
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,340
Don't be mad. Calm down.

119
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,540
Li Zhiren.

120
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,900
We're getting a divorce,

121
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,380
and you won't get

122
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,100
anything from me.

123
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,340
No, you can't!

124
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,650
- Let me go!
- No, honey!

125
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,020
- Let me go!
- No, no!

126
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,980
Honey!

127
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,980
Honey...

128
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,150
Honey?

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,010
- Honey?
- Blood...

130
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,040
- Honey.
- What can I do?

131
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,250
- Honey, don't scare me.
- Call the ambulance...

132
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,740
Wake up...

133
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,830
Honey!

134
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,940
- Hello?
- You can't.
