00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,640
Yue,

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,150
my mom told me

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,010
you couldn't get pregnant
after you got married for a long time.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,080
Why don't you

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,510
give me a chance

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,870
to see if you can get pregnant?

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,300
What are you doing?

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,830
What are you doing?

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,070
What's happening?

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,150
Mom! Zhijie was trying to...

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,000
Mom!

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,980
Yue

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,100
saw you leave,

15
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,310
so she wanted to seduce me!

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,390
What are you doing?

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,550
Honey, are you okay?

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,720
Zhijie, are you okay?

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,340
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 11=

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,920
Why did you kick me?

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,630
I kicked you, and I'll beat you,

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,100
- you b*stard!
- What are you doing?

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,230
- Mom.
- Why beat your brother?

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,830
You should beat her!

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,760
I know my wife

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,920
more than anyone!

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,760
Li Zhijie,

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
get the hell out now!

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,380
I don't want to see you here again!

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,670
I'll beat you every time!

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,150
What are you doing?

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
Li Zhiren,

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,310
you're successful now,

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,550
so you want to abandon us.

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,880
Don't forget

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
when our family

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,070
could only afford
one person's college tuition,

38
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,080
it was I who gave up my education

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,670
and made money for your tuition!

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,710
You were playing games every day.

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,710
You couldn't make it!

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,110
Do you think I was stupid?

43
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,350
I never liked playing games,

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,300
but you persuaded me to go

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,310
to internet cafes and paid for it.

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,110
You're always like this.

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,470
You've never changed.

48
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,710
You pretend to be a good guy,

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,110
but in fact, you're just

50
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,950
a selfish and shameless b*stard!

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,970
- Zhijie!
- What?

52
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,110
Say it again!

53
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,410
You...

54
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,450
Mom.

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,990
Yue and I are married,

56
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,270
but this house belongs to her.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,990
If you want to come,

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,470
you need to tell me in advance.

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,230
I get it now.

60
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,030
You're an ungrateful son!

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,790
I wish I never had you!

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
Honey.

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,400
Are you okay?

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,760
Zhiren,

65
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,670
sorry for the trouble.

66
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,110
No! It's all my fault.

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,630
I shouldn't have got you into this.

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,230
I'll see a doctor tomorrow.

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,600
Okay.

70
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,690
We'll see a doctor.

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,830
We'll go tomorrow.

72
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,340
(Hua Mao Tower)

73
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
Mr. Gao?

74
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,140
Mr. Gao?

75
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,630
According to our investigation,

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
your classmate

77
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,420
Chen Yue

78
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,470
died two years ago.

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,710
Dig into the background of Ms. Chen.

80
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,830
Ms. Chen?

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,190
Didn't we investigate her

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,430
when we hired her?

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,790
It's not about her work.

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,150
Find out her identity,

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,430
education, home location,

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,280
and her family.

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,190
I want to know everything about her.

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,600
Okay.

89
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,440
Are you blind?

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,430
Watch your step.

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,550
Don't you have eyes?

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,470
You don't have eyes!

93
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,270
You're so angry.
Did your girlfriend cheat on you

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,950
or have another man's child?

95
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
What did you say?

96
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Say that again!

97
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,110
I was right, wasn't I?

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,870
Get off me.

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,830
Say it again.

100
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,510
Get off me!

101
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
You...

102
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,220
- Does it hurt?
- Ouch...

103
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,630
Put up with it.

104
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,510
What a coincidence.

105
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,470
Why were you at the bar?

106
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,660
Actually,

107
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,160
it wasn't a coincidence.

108
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,270
Your colleagues told me

109
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,430
you were drinking alone,

110
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,510
so I wanted to check on you.

111
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,200
You...

112
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,740
Did you have a fight

113
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,400
with Lulu?

114
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,430
Did you drink so much for her?

115
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,790
You really love her.

116
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,350
I can't believe

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,950
she's been lying to me,

118
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,830
But I heard,

119
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,190
she was your first love.

120
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,530
It's been a long time.

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,030
I thought you loved each other so much.

122
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,150
First love is always blind.

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,950
She was young and beautiful,

124
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,890
and I was naive,

125
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,070
so I was fooled by her pretty face.

126
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,550
Who'd have thought

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,650
that she's been lying to me?

128
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,470
Oh, I see.

129
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,710
I was wondering

130
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,430
why a successful and capable man

131
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,550
like you

132
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,300
would fall for Lulu.

133
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,940
I shouldn't say it behind her back.

134
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,990
I'm not saying she's bad,

135
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,070
but I think

136
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,660
a good guy like you

137
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,870
deserves someone better.

138
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,860
That's right.

139
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,390
I always know
she's vain and superficial,

140
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,090
but I'm a kind man.

141
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,510
We were both from the countryside

142
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,900
and went through a lot together.

143
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,900
She used to demean herself

144
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,630
to be

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,500
my ex-wife's maid

146
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,370
and suffered a lot.

147
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
Really?

148
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,090
Did you get married before?

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,150
Thanks, honey.

150
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,010
Yue, here's to our new company

151
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,730
and everything you've done
for me and my family.

152
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,430
We're already married.

153
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,010
Your family is also my family.

154
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,950
We're

155
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,350
one.

156
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,430
Yes, we're one.

157
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,430
What's wrong?

158
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,540
