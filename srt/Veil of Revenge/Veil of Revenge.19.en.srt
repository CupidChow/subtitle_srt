2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,510
(Will she come today?)

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,470
(If she comes,)

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,750
(I'm going to give her
the Christmas gift)

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,670
(and tell her how I feel.)

=Episode 19=

7
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,860
Back then,

8
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,900
seeing you leaving with Li Zhiren,

9
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,950
I buried my first love in my heart.

10
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,530
If I had the guts

11
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,740
to take you away from him,

12
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,740
you wouldn't have been through all this.

13
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,940
It's all my fault.

14
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,420
My weakness led to your suffering.

15
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,980
Can you give me a chance

16
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,540
to make it up for you?

17
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,900
So,

18
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,320
you already knew, didn't you?

19
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,220
Yes,

20
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,180
I knew it in the first place.

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,300
I can never forget the way you dance.

22
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,300
Even if you look different,

23
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,180
I can recognize you immediately
when you start to dance.

24
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,980
I recognized you at the prom.

25
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,650
Zhiren, something's wrong!

26
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,420
Why are you anxious?

27
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,780
Look,

28
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,230
the media exposed our use

29
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,180
of expired cotton

30
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,310
(Watch out!)
and sexist

31
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,250
(Rotten cotton.)
slogan.

32
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,780
There are so many negative comments.

33
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,340
Lingyu is trying to destory us.

34
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,540
What should we do?

35
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,220
Mr. Li, bad news!

36
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,820
All our distributors are asking for

37
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,420
refunds and compensations.

38
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,360
What?

39
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,380
Refunds?

40
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,900
Let's see what happened.

41
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,280
What are you doing?

42
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,340
Back off!

43
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,940
Sh*tty company,

44
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,300
you're scamming us!

45
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,630
Refunds and returns!

46
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,700
Refunds and returns!

47
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,540
Returns!

48
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,340
Refunds!

49
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,140
- Listen to me...
- Refunds!

50
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,040
Listen to me!

51
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
Calm down!

52
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,580
Lulu...

53
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,960
Lulu?

54
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,860
Sorry,

55
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,100
the subscriber you dialed is turned off.

56
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,120
Sorry...

57
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,000
Lulu!

58
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,060
I've helped you win the bidding

59
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,830
and filmed the production process.

60
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,550
Can you let me go?

61
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,640
Only I can decide whether to let you go.

62
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,380
It's not up to you.

63
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,540
Do me another favor.

64
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,460
You're back.

65
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
Where did you go?

66
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,140
I...

67
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,000
I couldn't sleep,

68
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,260
so I went to the spa with Mei.

69
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,220
Why are you up so early?

70
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,620
I couldn't sleep
because of the incident.

71
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,460
Don't be angry.

72
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,090
I'll get some water for you.

73
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,260
Chen Yueran got everything

74
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,060
because of Gao Lingyu.

75
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,140
If we turn them against each other,

76
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,100
it'll be much easier.
