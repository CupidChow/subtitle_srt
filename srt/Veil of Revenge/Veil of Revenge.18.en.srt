00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,880
Chen Yue, you...

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,190
Aren't you dead?

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,350
No,

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,590
I'm still alive.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,480
No...

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,620
No way!

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,450
I saw you get pushed down by Li Zhiren,

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,800
hit the corner of the table,

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,910
and die...

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,630
You were thrown into the sea.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,680
No...

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,290
Why didn't you save me

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,690
when you watched me die?

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,220
It was so painful!

16
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,210
I want your lives!

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,780
It's not my fault. I'm innocent!

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,260
It's Li Zhiren's fault.

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,660
Send him to hell...

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,980
Send him to hell!

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,860
Chen Yueran...

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,630
Do you know what this is?

24
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,820
Impossible!

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,600
I saw you get pushed down by Li Zhiren,

26
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,910
hit the corner of the table,

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,850
and die...

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,860
You were thrown into the sea.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
No...

30
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,650
This is your sentence of imprisonment.

31
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,340
Please have mercy...

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,580
It's...

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,740
It's all Li Zhiren's fault.

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Don't worry.

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,580
You only need to do as I say.

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,880
Okay.

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,820
What's wrong?

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,260
I have a stomach ache.

39
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,940
Is it serious?

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
Want to see a doctor?

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,900
No need.

42
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,380
Go to work.

43
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,300
I'll take the pills and have a rest.

44
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,740
Okay.

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,620
Rest well, okay?

46
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,060
Goodbye.

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,380
Mr. Li, have some tea.

48
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,860
Have some tea.

49
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,140
Mr. Zhu,

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,500
do you have other guests?

51
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,620
Just two friends.

52
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,700
It'll be fun.

53
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,230
Okay.

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,580
Mr. Zhu.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
Mr. Zhu.

56
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,210
Hello,

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,660
Mr. Li.

58
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,190
Mr. Li,

59
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,340
are you surprised?

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,060
Do you know each other?

61
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,180
More than that.

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,540
Then I don't need to introduce you.

63
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,700
Mr. Li,

64
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,740
as for the baby products project,

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,500
Lingyu Group and Chen Group

66
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,460
will work together

67
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,540
to compete with you.

68
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,900
Do you have a problem?

69
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,380
No. Of course not.

70
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,380
Mr. Li,

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,620
competition first,

72
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,780
friendship second, okay?

73
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,630
Okay.

74
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,580
Sorry to keep you waiting.

75
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,740
Here's the bidding result.

76
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,220
In this bidding,

77
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,220
your offers are both

78
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,540
close to our budget price.

79
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,580
Congratulations,

80
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,140
Lingyu Group and Chen Group.

81
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,500
Impossible.

82
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,100
No way.

83
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,310
Mr. Li,

84
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,380
we're sorry.

85
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,780
Your offer

86
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,900
is a little higher than theirs.

87
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,670
We're doing business,

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,540
so we have to choose them.

89
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,340
Glad to work with you.

90
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,900
Me too.

91
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,240
Glad to work with you.

92
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,390
Me too.

93
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,180
Hey,

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,080
are you blind?

95
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,300
Can't you see I'm going out?

96
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,940
Mr. Li,

97
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,540
we stopped to thank you

98
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,700
for your mercy.

99
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,740
Don't get carried away.

100
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,900
I'll have the last laugh!

101
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,980
I talked to Mr. Zhou's assistant.

102
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,900
I was about to get the deal.

103
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,500
How could they take it from me?

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,340
Congratulations

105
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,700
on taking the project from Li Zhiren.

106
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,700
When you get the money,

107
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,060
Chen Group can start running again,

108
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,060
and all problems will be solved.

109
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,660
If Lingyu Group hadn't helped us,

110
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,540
Mr. Zhu wouldn't have given it to us.

111
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,660
Lingyu, thank you.

112
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,100
Have you fulfilled your purpose?

113
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,180
Almost.

114
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,260
Then...

115
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,140
Can you accept me now?

116
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,620
A young

117
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,020
and rich man like you

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,020
should be very popular.

119
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,700
I don't deserve you.

120
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,460
Yue,

121
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,300
I lost you many years ago.

122
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,020
I don't want to lose you again.

123
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,380
What did you call me?
