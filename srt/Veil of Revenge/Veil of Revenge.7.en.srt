00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,920
Are you happy?

10
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,520
You're finally slim and pretty.

11
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,270
But who'd have thought

12
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,410
it'd cost me my life?

13
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,030
My parents have taught me to be kind

14
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,350
so that others will be kind to me.

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,710
Look what happened to me.

16
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,830
If that's the case,

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,200
I'll be the bad guy.

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,530
I'm going to make everyone who hurt me

19
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,550
pay a hundred times the price.

20
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Hello, Mr. Gao.

21
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,470
I was on a business trip

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,190
and missed the Welcome party yesterday.

23
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,670
I've prepared a gift.

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,190
If you have time,

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,670
I'll send it to you after I arrive.

26
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,590
My apartment is quite far
from the airport.

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,790
You don't have to.

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Not a big deal.

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,350
If it's inconvenient for you,
just forget it.

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,350
If you don't mind,

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,470
can I go to your house

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,550
and prepare a welcome dinner.

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,190
But I just learned to cook.

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,190
I'm still new to this.

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,350
Please don't mind.

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Okay.

37
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,230
I'll prepare some groceries
and wait for you.

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Okay.

39
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,180
(Zhang Lu, Maid)

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,790
It's almost done.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,030
Mr. Gao, you can wait
in the living room.

42
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,350
Just call me Lingyu outside the office.

43
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,950
Lingyu.

44
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,030
Dinner is ready.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,480
Let me help you.

46
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,550
Based on our evaluation,

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,590
Li Zhiren's company

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,630
doesn't qualify for our financing.

49
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,470
Why did you choose them?

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,070
Li Zhiren's ex-wife

51
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,080
is the only heiress of Chen Group.

52
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,190
Do you know that?

53
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,950
You mean the multinational group?

54
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

55
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,350
Chen Group's president

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,550
went abroad
after his daughter passed away,

57
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,190
but his company

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,670
still plays an important role

59
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,110
in the domestic market.

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,590
Li Zhiren

61
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,670
is not on the board,

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,950
but

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,390
he's got shares of the group.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,710
Do you mean

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,710
you don't care about his company

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,870
but his shares of Chen Group?

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,870
With Li Zhiren's ability,

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,190
it's a waste for him
to keep those shares.

69
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,830
I knew you had your reason.

70
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,580
I believe your ability

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,080
and my judgment.

72
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,420
I knew I made the right choice.

73
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,900
Come on.

74
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
What's wrong?

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,880
Lingyu.

76
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,050
I think I'm drunk.

77
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,740
Can I take a break?

78
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,060
Just for a while.

79
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay.

80
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,220
(Hua Mao Tower)

81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Lulu,

82
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,670
what are you doing?

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,750
You tell me.

84
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,070
You pretend to be innocent

85
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,230
while seducing my boyfriend!

86
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,550
Have you no shame?

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,430
Lulu, what are you talking about?

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,210
You're still denying it.

89
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,550
Didn't you invite Li Zhiren to a bar?

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,750
We just wanted to talk about work.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,390
Besides, you know

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,310
we're working on that project.

93
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,030
Talk about work?

94
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,990
You talked about work
at my home, didn't you?

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,550
What?

96
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,680
Okay.

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,360
What's this?

98
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,290
What's this?

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
This...

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,840
Lulu.

101
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,510
I'm innocent.

102
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,530
This doesn't belong to me.

103
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,150
Besides,

104
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,750
how can I fit in the size?

105
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,210
Move.

106
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,190
Please don't make a scene
at our company.

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,950
Ms. Chen was with me last night.

108
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,510
Apologize to her now,

109
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,870
or I'll call the police.

110
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,970
I just brushed against her.

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,310
Why should I apologize?

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,350
Our surveillance covers every corner.

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,720
Lulu,

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,240
could it be

115
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,590
a gift Mr. Li bought for you?

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,640
Lulu.

117
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,830
Mr. Li is so good to you.

118
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,910
You can't find another man like him.

119
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,490
Don't be reckless

120
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,270
and ruin your relationship.

121
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,940
You're right,

122
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,010
but I still think he's cheating on me.

123
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,270
Men are like cats that steal fish.

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,950
You can't always keep an eye on him.

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,060
Every snack has a fatal weakness,

126
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,670
so does a man.

127
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,400
Fatal weakness?

128
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,230
Mr. Li is a proud man.

129
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,110
He cares about his career the most.

130
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,870
If you can play an essential part

131
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,150
in his business,

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,110
you'll share the benefits with him.

133
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,670
By then, even if he wants to cheat,

134
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,790
he'll have to think about his career.

135
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,320
Career?

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
Yueran,

137
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,270
why didn't I think of that?
