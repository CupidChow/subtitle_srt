00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,300
Lulu,

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,180
hurry up.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,620
You can't always be late.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,760
Almost done.

7
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,740
Zhiren.

8
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,020
Can I take a day off?

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,020
I get the menstrual cramps.

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,780
Are you okay?

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,020
Shall we see a doctor?

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,300
It's okay.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,660
Maybe I had too much drink,

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,260
and it led to the cramps.

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,980
I'll take some pain pills

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,500
and have a sleep.

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,780
Okay.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,060
Rest well.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,180
You can call me.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,250
Bye.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,180
Be safe.

23
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,500
You're so busy.

24
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,180
When are you leaving?

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
You're here.

26
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,060
I want to invite you and Lulu to dinner.

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,780
Where's Lulu?

28
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,460
Why isn't she here?

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,260
She took a day off
because of the cramps.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,460
Lulu must be upset

31
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,380
about what happened yesterday.

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,220
It's my fault.

33
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,940
I couldn't protect her.

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,900
She suffered a lot.

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,500
Yueran, you've done enough.

36
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,340
She insisted on working at my company

37
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,740
but made a lot of trouble,

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,540
She should go to a mall or a hair salon

39
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,660
instead of bothering me here.

40
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,660
She should act like a woman

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,900
and stay at home.

42
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,740
I hate those women

43
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,940
who want to be independent.

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,580
Sorry, Yueran.

45
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,140
I'm talking about
those incapable women like Lulu,

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,420
instead of

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,260
an outstanding woman

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,220
like you.

49
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,180
Zhiren, I know what you mean.

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,580
If I had such a good boyfriend,

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,460
I'd rather stay at home

52
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,780
or go to a mall or a salon.

53
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,660
Yueran, you're a good girl.

54
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,020
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

55
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,980
Is your standard too high?

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,420
Yes.

57
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,620
My standard is so high

58
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,300
that the man I like

59
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,460
already has a girlfriend.

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,180
Mr. Gao.

61
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,380
Mr. Gao, why are you here?

62
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,340
Pick up Yueran.

63
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Sorry, Mr. Gao.

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,820
I just told Mr. Li

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,460
I'd visit Lulu with him.

66
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,980
She's ill.

67
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,500
Maybe I can't

68
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,340
have dinner with you tonight.

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,100
Then we're leaving.

70
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,620
Mr. Gao.

71
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,380
We can have dinner sometime.

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,580
Mom.

73
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,100
Zhiren, you're back.

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,700
Who is...?

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,980
Hello, Mrs. Li,

76
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,100
I'm Chen Yueran,

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Zhiren's business partner.

78
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,900
I heard Lulu was not feeling well,

79
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,940
so I wanted to visit her.

80
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,780
Lulu went to sleep
after taking the pills.

81
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,980
Mom,

82
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,020
I'll check on her.

83
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,140
Take care of Yueran for me.

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,100
Okay.

85
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,070
Yueran, have a seat.

86
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,820
Yueran, come on.

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,820
Have a cup of tea.

88
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,540
Mrs. Li,

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,420
does Lulu often get menstrual cramps?

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,060
Frequent dysmenorrhea

91
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,120
might be a sign of poor health.

92
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,980
Really?

93
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,060
I've heard

94
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,700
frequent dysmenorrhea

95
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,220
is likely to affect her fertility.

96
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,860
This...

97
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,380
My friend is a doctor.

98
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,810
If you need it,

99
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,660
I can help her make an appointment

100
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,580
with an expert.

101
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,540
That'd be great.

102
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,490
Thank you so much.

103
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,330
Not a big deal.

104
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,500
(International Medical Center)

105
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,910
Doctor,

106
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,980
is my girlfriend okay?

107
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,130
Based on the results,

108
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,120
Ms. Zhang can't get pregnant
mainly because

109
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,590
her uterine wall is too thin

110
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,460
to make fertilized eggs land and grow.

111
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,860
Why would that happen?

112
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,100
Why is

113
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,660
her uterine wall so thin?

114
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,660
Is it because she's too skinny?

115
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,220
If a young couple

116
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,500
doesn't want a baby,

117
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,300
they need to use contraceptive methods.

118
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,600
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,170
Zhiren, I didn't!

120
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,820
Based on the results,

121
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,980
I think she had an abortion
in the last year.

122
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,470
In the last year?

123
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,860
When we were together, you...

124
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,950
I didn't!

125
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,980
You're hurting me!

126
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,580
Who was the guy who asked you
for directions at the gate?

127
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,850
What guy?

128
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,800
I don't remember!

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Your phone!

130
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,540
Give me your phone!

131
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,490
What's this?
