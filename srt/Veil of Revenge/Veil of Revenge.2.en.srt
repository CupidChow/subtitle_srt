2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,420
(One year ago)

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,580
Lulu,

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,690
we're finally free.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,750
What's wrong?

6
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,500
(Graveyard)

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,960
What was there?

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,800
I have this feeling...

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
she's watching us.

10
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,630
Isn't it exciting?

11
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,660
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 2=

12
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,740
Ms. Chen is quite efficient.

13
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,660
I said I liked it in the morning,

14
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,220
and now I've received it
in the afternoon.

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,360
Zhiren.

16
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,990
How did she know

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,920
our address?

18
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,020
Didn't you send her the address
in the morning?

19
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,350
The address I sent her?

20
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,380
I remember

21
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,270
I only sent her
our company's address.

22
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,660
(Ms. Chen, thanks for your gift.)

23
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,020
(When you have time,
I can treat you to a meal)

24
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,860
(and tell you
more details of the project.)

25
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,150
(Chen Yueran)
(It's just a small gift.)

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,630
(Not a big deal.)

27
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,810
(You don't have to treat me.)

28
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,360
(I'm on a diet lately.)

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,860
(Ms. Chen, you should find
a better excuse to reject me.)

30
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,380
(Why would a slim woman like you
need to be on a diet?)

31
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,460
(Chen Yueran)

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,350
(Mr. Li, I wouldn't dare to reject you.)

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,070
(We're having a welcome party tonight.)

34
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,840
(We can grab a drink at a bar
after the party.)

35
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,150
(I'll pay.)

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,790
Okay. It's enough.

37
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,510
Didn't you just...?

38
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,990
Which one do you like?

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,640
Are you going out?

40
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,520
I need to have dinner
with Mr. Wang tonight.

41
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,930
The blue one.

42
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,110
I can wear my blue dress,

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
- and we can go...
- Don't come with me tonight.

44
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,150
It's a business dinner only for men.

45
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,110
No one will take his girlfriend.

46
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,350
How about this?

47
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,550
You can go shopping and have a massage

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
with your bestie.

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,740
No!

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,920
I'm going with you.

51
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,310
I can go shopping and wait for you

52
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,350
when you're having dinner.

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,430
Honey, don't be naughty.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,440
That's very inconvenient.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,320
Babe.

56
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,500
(Same old place!)

57
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,280
Zhiren,

58
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,270
Mei had a fight with her boyfriend.

59
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,270
She's staying at the hotel alone

60
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,270
and wants to see me.

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,040
Had a fight?

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,280
Are you going to stay out

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
tonight?

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,240
Maybe I can...

65
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,590
come home early?

66
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,830
It's okay.

67
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,910
If it's too late,
you don't have to come back.

68
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,830
It's okay. Just stay with her.

69
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,230
Then I'm leaving.

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
Call me if you need anything.

71
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,660
(Ms. Chen, where are you now?)

72
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Sir,

73
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
we're about to close.

74
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,610
(The subscriber
you dialed is turned off.)

75
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,610
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
is turned off.)

76
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,240
(The subscriber
you dialed is turned off.)

77
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,920
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...)

78
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
Ms. Chen.

79
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,070
Please come in.

80
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,270
Mr. Li?

81
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,520
Sorry,

82
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm drunk.

83
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,310
It's okay.

84
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,200
My phone just died.

85
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,560
No wonder.

86
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,240
Is this your home?

87
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,630
Yes.

88
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
This room...

89
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
I remember now!

90
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,040
Did a fat lady

91
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,470
live here before?

92
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,680
How do you know?

93
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,910
No wonder

94
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
it's so familiar to me.

95
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,160
I rented the lady's apartment

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,800
when I just graduated from college.

97
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,920
Do you mean

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,000
you lived here before?

99
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
Yes.

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
What a coincidence.

101
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,400
I was wondering
why the address Lulu sent me

102
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,990
was so familiar.

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, do you mean Lulu gave you
our home address

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,120
instead of the company's address?

105
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,470
Yes.

106
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,150
If she hadn't,

107
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,830
how could I have sent it to your home?

108
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,710
Sorry, Mr. Li.

109
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,920
I was wasted.

110
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,400
The driver asked about the destination,

111
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,630
and it just came out.

112
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,030
I should go back. Maybe next time...

113
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Since you're here,

114
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,190
why don't we have a chat here?

115
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,480
I'll get some wine.

116
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,070
Let's have a drink.
