2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,630
I didn't know it was your birthday,

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,470
so I didn't prepare anything.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,440
It's okay.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,430
I'm glad that you can

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,590
celebrate my birthday.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,840
However,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,480
I've prepared something for you.

=Episode 13=

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
This song...

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
Do you remember?

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,390
It's familiar,

13
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,850
but I forgot where I heard it.

14
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,630
Mr. Gao, did you play it before?

15
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,270
But I don't think

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,040
I've seen you play the piano.

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,670
It doesn't matter.

18
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,210
Yueran,

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,000
if you really want to give me a gift,

20
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,290
could you dance for me?

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,210
I'll play the piano for you.

22
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,110
Thank you for celebrating my birthday.

23
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,390
I'm happy.

24
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,470
Sorry, I didn't prepare anything.

25
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,950
I'll make it up for you.

26
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
No need.

27
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,470
I am so lucky

28
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,150
to have met you.

29
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,230
It's late. Let me send you home.

30
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,640
No need.

31
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,550
I need to go.

32
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Goodbye.

33
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,040
Rest early.

34
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,670
Happy birthday.

35
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,110
Why are you here?

36
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,870
Do you know I've been looking for you?

37
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,150
I'm right here.

38
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,910
Do you know

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,990
we're not on the list of Lingyu Group's

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
financing projects?

41
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,120
I know.

42
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,020
You know?

43
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,470
Is that all you want to say?

44
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,070
Mr. Wang's project is going to fail!

45
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560
Calm down.

46
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,300
These are all small projects.

47
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,080
I've got more financing for you.

48
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,790
Not just Mr. Wang,

49
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,160
We can also cooperate
with Rong Daily Chemicals

50
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,450
to expand our business
to baby products.

51
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,040
Baby products?

52
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,990
After all, you're a man.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
If your company only has
female hygiene products,

54
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,410
it's kind of awkward.

55
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,140
Isn't this the reason
for the financing and transformation?

56
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,230
But transformation needs time.

57
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,220
You can't make it overnight.

58
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,780
I've got the approval of Mr. Gao,

59
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,700
but I still need
the other directors' approval.

60
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,540
(Financing Plan)

61
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,780
I believe we'll be on the list

62
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,660
of big projects.

63
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,980
(Part One: Introduction)

64
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,100
Yueran...

65
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,740
Yueran...

66
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,740
Yueran, I don't what I can do
to thank you.

67
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,010
No need.

68
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,530
We're family now.

69
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,980
Yueran,

70
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,880
why don't you

71
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,630
move in and stay with me?

72
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,520
I can,

73
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
but I don't want

74
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,700
to live where you and Lulu used to live.

75
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,600
It's kind of weird.

76
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,300
Well, no problem.

77
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,340
I've got another

78
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,220
empty house.

79
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,080
We can go there.

80
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,820
You're so good to me.

81
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,900
Thank you so much.

82
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,900
This house has been empty

83
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,260
for a long time,

84
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,180
but it's got the finest decorations.

85
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,500
If you don't like it,

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,620
we can redecorate it.

87
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,700
I like it.

88
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,980
It's just...

89
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,000
a little bit dusty.

90
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,990
I'll hire someone to clean it up.

91
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,080
Okay. It's up to you.

92
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,540
(I'm back.)

93
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,860
(I'll take back everything.)

94
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,500
You can't even hand out flyers.

95
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,660
What can you do?

96
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,730
You're fired.

97
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
Lulu?
