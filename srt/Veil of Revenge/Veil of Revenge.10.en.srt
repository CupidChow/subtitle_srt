2
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,320
It's too complicated.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,990
I don't know how to make the form.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,110
You need to use techniques.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,350
Give me your phone.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,190
I'll send you some notes I took.

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,270
This is the pour-over coffee
I made for you.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,870
Have it while it's still hot.

(Receiving, Sent)

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,000
It's done.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,670
- Thanks.
- Go ahead.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,120
What's this?

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,610
Shameless b*tch.

15
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,120
You can't give him a child,

16
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,710
and you've been cheating on him!

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,110
He got me pregnant twice,

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,310
but your son can't.

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,710
Why don't you blame him?

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,350
We're so miserable!

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,230
His two wives

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,750
can't get him a child!

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,990
Oh, lord! You're ruining
the Li Family's blood!

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,310
What should we do?

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,030
Stop!

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,550
You can't take them away.

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,830
My son bought them.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,950
These are his gifts for me.

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,190
For you?

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,750
You won't get them.

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,710
Give them to me!

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,550
You're just a maid from the countryside.

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,790
If it weren't for my son,

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,070
you wouldn't have been able to
afford nice clothes.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,950
Listen,

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,070
you need to not only leave the stuff

37
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,990
but take off

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,350
your clothes!

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,190
Zhiren won't allow you to do this!

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,150
Stop dreaming.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,310
My son

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,030
will never care about
a frivolous b*tch like you.

43
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,190
You...

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,270
You seduced my son

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,990
when Chen Yue was still alive.

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,950
Back then,

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,950
I already knew

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,430
you were a b*tch!

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,630
You should think about

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,630
what kind of girl
deserves to be his wife.

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,430
Even if she's not as rich as Chen Yue,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,990
she has to be

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,750
a capable woman like Chen Yueran.

54
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,360
You're a poor girl
who can't get pregnant.

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,310
Stop dreaming!

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,590
Go back

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,950
to where you belong!

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,590
Stop dreaming!

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,110
Go back

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,430
to where you belong!

61

(Two Years Ago)

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,670
Mom, Zhijie,

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,830
why are you here?

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,270
It's my son's house.

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,550
Why can't I come?

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,270
The house is so empty.

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,150
You don't cook?

70
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,070
Mom, I can't cook.

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,750
What can you do?

72
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,350
You can cook

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,470
or do housework.

74
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,990
You can't even get pregnant!

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,630
Are you trying to ruin our blood?

76
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,680
Why would my son

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,870
find such a useless girlfriend?

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,830
This is our great misfortune!

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,550
I'm so pissed off!

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,720
Mom!

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,110
It's not that I can't.

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,310
Actually, it's because

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,950
I don't like doing these things.

84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,970
But don't worry.

85
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,750
I won't let Zhiren do these.

86
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm rich.

87
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,070
Money can fix anything.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,070
Don't force others to do things
you don't want to do.

89
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,990
As for children,

90
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,430
Zhiren and I are going to see a doctor.

91
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,390
I want children

92
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,790
not because of family blood

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,910
but because

94
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,950
I love Zhiren.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,070
You're so talkative, aren't you?

96
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,870
I just said one word,

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,150
and you replied with ten!

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,710
You're better at talking,

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,270
but I can teach you a lesson!

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,310
Zhijie, I'm going to the grocery store.

101
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
I'll be right back.
