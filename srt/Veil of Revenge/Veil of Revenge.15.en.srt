(One Year Ago)

3
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,910
Mrs. Li,

4
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,370
I saw Mr. Li...

5
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,250
Forget it. Nothing.

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,550
What's wrong?

7
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,550
You can tell me anything.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,670
I think Mr. Li

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,070
is too close to his secretary.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,350
No way.

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,310
You're overthinking it.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
Mrs. Li,

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,470
don't blame me for this.

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,310
This is so typical.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,550
Mr. Li is handsome

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,540
and rich.

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,910
Keep an eye on him

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,990
for prevention.

19
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,500
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 15=

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Mr. Li,

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,930
you need to sign this.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,240
Okay.

23
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,920
Be careful.

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,230
Honey?

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,670
Get out.

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,710
Just go.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,760
Ms. Chen.

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,950
Go to the Human Resources tomorrow

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,150
for departure procedures.

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
Ms. Chen, I...

32
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,490
Honey, why are you here?

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,510
I brought some cakes.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,000
Did you make them?

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,600
By the way,

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,230
here's the financial statement
of this month.

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,090
Check it out.

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,560
Okay.

39
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,710
Never mind.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,990
I trust you.

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,590
I believe you can manage

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,510
the company well.

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,730
The most important thing for me

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,070
is to prepare for pregnancy

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,230
and have a child as soon as possible.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Honey,

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,230
you're the best.

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
Yueran.

49
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,620
(One Year Later)
Have you thought about leaving?

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,460
Leaving?

51
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,670
I mean you might feel better

52
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,830
in a different place.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,110
What do you think of Australia?

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,390
I never escape.

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,390
If you have a mission,

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,710
you can tell me.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,910
I can help you.

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,990
I'm always on your side.

59
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,750
Talk to me when you want to.

60
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,720
Zhiren,

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
why are you here?

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,150
I want to talk to you

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,310
about Mr. Wang's project.

64
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,630
We just did the accounting.

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,510
Our current financial flows

66
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,350
are far from enough.

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,750
Lingyu Group won't give us the money
until next month.

68
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,110
Can you help me

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,030
think of something?

70
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,070
You've got Chen Group's shares, right?

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,790
Sell them,

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,670
and you'll have money.

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,030
Sell the shares?

74
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,190
After all,

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,710
Chen Group isn't yours.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,350
If you sell the shares,

77
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,670
the money

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,790
will be yours, right?

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,830
Okay. I'll ask them to do it.

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,070
Do you box a lot?

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,830
No. It's the first time.

82
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,630
I'm bad at it.

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,150
Zhiren, can you do it?

84
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,750
Anyone can box.

85
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,910
Come on. Let me teach you.

86
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,040
Come on.

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,640
Come on. Hit me.

88
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,760
Use some strength.

89
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,200
Show me what you've got.

90
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,150
I don't want to hurt you.

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,040
You won't.

92
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,350
Look how flexible I am.

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Look.

94
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,060
Hit me.

95
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,640
Are you okay?

96
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,480
You're bleeding.

97
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,830
Let's go home and get cleaned up.

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,430
Why is she here?

99
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,830
You kicked her out,

100
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,920
but she couldn't find a job.

101
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,260
She was about to be homeless.

102
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,180
I felt pity for her,

103
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,290
so I helped her

104
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,590
I heard she used to be

105
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,570
you and your ex-wife's maid.

106
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,150
I assumed she'd be
familiar with the work.

107
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,670
You broke up with her

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,110
because she hurt you,

109
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,150
but we're sisters.

110
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,550
Besides,

111
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,950
it's in the past.

112
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Zhiren,

113
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,190
I'm yours now.

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,750
Will you

115
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,220
blame me for this?

116
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,550
Why would I?

117
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,990
Yueran, you're kind and generous.

118
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,610
Why would I blame you?

119
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,680
Lulu,

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,350
I bought some seafood.

121
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,350
Please cook it.

122
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Zhiren

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,910
will have dinner with me.

124
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,040
Got it.

125
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,230
I'm sweaty.

126
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,270
I'll take a shower.

127
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,380
