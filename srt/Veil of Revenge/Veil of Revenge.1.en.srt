Hello, Mr. Gao.

49

My name is Chen Yueran.

Have a seat.

51
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,550
Ms. Chen,

52
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
I've seen your resume.

53
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,670
It's impressive,

54
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,040
but I need a good reason

55
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,280
to let you stay.

56
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,400
Lingyu Group is a startup company,

57
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,200
but it has made it to the top
of many industries.

58
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,230
Mr. Gao,

59
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,670
as far as I know, you're working on

60
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,310
expanding your business

61
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,920
to the daily chemical industry.

62
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,390
I worked for Lianhua Group, a leading
daily chemical producer in the world,

63
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
for its business expansion
in our country.

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,230
I believe my experience and networks

65
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,390
will play an essential role
in Linghua Group's transformation.

66
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,880
Looking forward to our cooperation,

67
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,060
Director Chen.

68
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,640
Looking forward to working with you,
Mr. Gao.

69
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,190
The new director is so arrogant.

70
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,950
Her predecessor never
kept us waiting for such a long time.

71
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,880

72
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960

Just call me Yueran.

75
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,950
It's you.

76
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,590
I didn't get the chance
to ask for your number last time.

77
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,440
I was thinking about
treating you to a meal.

78
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,830
We can exchange our numbers now.

79
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,470
Okay.

80
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,390
I can't believe

81
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,470
you're our new director.

82
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,990
No wonder Mr. Gao and you
seemed to be close last time.

seeing your business plan.

85

No problem.

86
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,790
We can have a meal together sometime.

87
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
No problem.

88
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,810
By the way,

89
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,440
what's the scent surround diffuser
in your office?

90
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
It smells so good.

91
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,340
Well,

92
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,070
my friend customized it for me.

93
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,200
If you like it,

94
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,150
give me an address,

95
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,990
and I'll send one to you.

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,380
How can I accept it?

97
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,710
Don't be too polite.

98
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,000
Zhiren, look, Ms. Chen

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,950

and beautiful, right?

101
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,720
Yes.

102
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,600
Then we're leaving.

103
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,600
