=Veil of Revenge=

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,230
(I've seen a lot of doctors)

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,190
(had so much medicine.)

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,270
(I've done everything I can.)

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,150
(Why can't I have my own child?)

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,670
(If I can never become a mother,)

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,750
(what's the point)

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,270
(of living as a woman?)

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,310
(Why should I live?)

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,510
(Will I)

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,630
(find peace after I die?)

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,580
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 6=

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,070
Honey!

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,350
Hello?

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,470
You can't.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,590
You can't.

17
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,190
It turns out

18
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,830
I'm not the reason

19
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,310
why we can't have a child.

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,270
I can't believe Zhiren has azoospermia.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,950
He's been

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,230
lying to me for a year.

23
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,600
But all men

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,830
are proud.

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,950
He wouldn't

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,190
tell me the truth,

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,760
but

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,910
he's been so good to me.

29
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,950
I believe he had no choice but to lie

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,870
because he couldn't face it.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,550
He's also a poor guy.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,990
Since I love him,

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,310
I should keep the secret for him.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,510
It's okay if we can't have a child.

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,210
As long as we love each other,

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,710
we'll grow old together.

37
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,620
(Farewell Letter)

38
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,100
(Beloved Wife Chen Yue)

39
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,470
The love of my life,

40
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,900
the woman who lit up my world,

41
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,980
(Beloved Wife Chen Yue)

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,470
my wife Chen Yue

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,870
has left me forever

44
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,870
because of depression.

45
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,230
I can't bear...

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,470
losing my dear Yue!

47
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,990
I'll remember her
for the rest of my life!

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,800
Zhiren.

49
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,740
Zhiren.

50
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,750
Zhiren!

51
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,680
Zhiren!

52
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,550
Why was Yue so silly?

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,990
Why would she end her life like this?

54
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,470
It's my fault.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,790
It's all my fault!

56
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,390
Yue was too kind.

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,950
She didn't want me to worry about her,

58
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,390
so she never told me
about her depression.

59
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Zhiren.

60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,390
You've been

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,830
dealing with Yue's funeral

62
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,190
over the past few days.

63
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,510
Thank you!

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,150
Dad, Mom,

65
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,790
This is my duty.

66
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,670
Yue is gone,

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,550
but I'll take care of you for her.

68
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,790
We want

69
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,750
to go abroad to take a break.

70
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
Dad.

71
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,910
Dad.

72
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,710
I'll manage the company well.

73
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,460
(One Year Later)

74
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,160
Wow.

75
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,830
After paying the bills,

76
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,310
you can leave the hospital.

77
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,790
It's been a tough six months.

78
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Yes.

79
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,020
Thank you for taking care of me.

80
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,220
It's our job.

81
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,070
You're welcome.

82
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,350
You're the one who suffered a lot.

83
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,150
Luckily, the surgery was successful,

84
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
and you've lost weight.

85
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,670
You're so pretty now.

86
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,550
Come on. Here it is.

87
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
Take a look.

88
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,070
To be clear,

89
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,270
You can only make

90
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,710
monthly payments for three months.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,110
When you get a job,

92
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,510
you need to pay the rent

93
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,110
every three months.

94
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,470
It'll also save you some money.

95
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,480
Okay.

96
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,790
Okay. Unpack your things.

97
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm leaving.

98
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,600
Feel free to call me.

99
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,920
Okay, thanks.

100
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,150
Li Zhiren,

101
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,140
whatever it takes,

102
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,110
I'll make you pay the price.
