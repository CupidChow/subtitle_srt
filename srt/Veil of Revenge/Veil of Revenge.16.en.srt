2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,240
What are you doing?

3
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,430
Zhiren,

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,680
do you really want to abandon me?

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,300
Don't be so cruel, okay?

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,750
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,240
Yueran is my girlfriend now.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,850
But I can't move on.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,820
It's okay.

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,020
We can do the same
like when Chen Yue was alive.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,420
Didn't you say

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,820
it'd be so exciting?

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,700
You're playing with fire.

=Episode 16=

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,300
Lulu, get me a bottle opener.

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,140
Sorry, sorry.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,980
Look at me.

18
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,820
That was a mistake.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,340
I won't do it again.

20
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,380
Aunt Zhang,

21
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,140
I need a bottle opener

22
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,460
and two glasses.

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,020
Aunt Zhang?

24
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,010
Aunt Zhang,

25
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,220
Zhiren is going to move in.

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,750
From now on,

27
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,420
he'll also be your boss.

28
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,220
I pay the salaries,

29
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,620
but you also need

30
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,860
to listen to Zhiren.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,460
Aunt Zhang is still here.

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,900
It's awkward.

33
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,380
I don't want to go back.

34
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,460
Let's get in the room.

35
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,050
I'm not feeling well.

36
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,700
Besides,

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,820
you'll move very soon.

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,140
Wash some cherries for us.

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,290
You smell like

40
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,460
my ex-wife.

41
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,030
Maybe it's a coincidence.

42
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,370
Sorry.

43
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,740
Sorry, let me wipe it.

44
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,540
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,580
Li Zhiren is really selling his shares.

46
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,100
I've hired a third party to talk to him.

47
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,500
We'll get them in a few days.

48
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,860
He's never changed,

49
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,380
always looking for a shortcut.

50
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,740
His offer is below the market price,

51
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,260
and he agreed

52
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,860
to our bargainings.

53
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
He needs money for the project.

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,260
He's got a lot of shares.

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
It's hard to sell them all
to one person.

56
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,860
I think he wants

57
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,160
to get all the money.

58
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,980
Lingyu,

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,160
thanks.

60
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,420
You know,

61
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,200
I'll help you

62
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,540
whenever you need me.

63
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,300
Here's the file you asked.

64
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,540
Get out.

(Hua Mao Tower)

66
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,940
- Did you get in touch with Mr. Li?
- No.

67
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,780
I've repeated it to him we'd sign

68
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,180
the contract at 10:00 a.m.

69
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,660
Maybe he's on the way.

70
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,380
Wait a little longer.

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,010
Yueran, come over.

72
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,380
Something's wrong.

73
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,900
When I took over Chen Group's shares,

74
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,820
I found all the money

75
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,900
was transferred in advance.

76
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,540
And he's got a big mortgage

77
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,900
in the company's name.

78
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,780
Oh, no.

Throw the couch out.

81
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,010
Get that cabinet in.

82
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,350
What are you doing?

83
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,940
Who are you in our house?

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,640
Your house?

85
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,980
Who told you to move my stuff?

86
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,830
Your stuff?

87
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,340
We've bought this place.

88
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,180
What?

89
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,500
I signed the contract a while ago.

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,070
I'm here to check the house.

91
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,380
Get out. Don't make a scene.

92
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,730
Everything we do is legal.

93
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,610
Don't move my stuff.

94
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,380
Did that guy send you here
to make a scene?

95
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,860
She was kept by that man,

96
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,780
and his wife found out,

97
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,210
so they sold this house.

98
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,100
Is the buyer a couple?

99
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,180
Yes.

100
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,540
Is that her?

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,100
Yes, isn't she his wife?

102
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,180
He just let you stay for a while.

103
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,540
Do you really think you're the owner?

104
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,100
He's got a family.

105
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,940
Just accept it.

106
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,180
He's just playing with you.

107
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,460
Do you really think he'd buy you
houses and cars?

108
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,540
Get out.

109
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,900
Don't bother us.

110
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,100
Lulu,

111
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,460
thanks to you,

112
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,280
I managed to keep everything.

113
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,940
Wipe it.

114
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,770
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

115
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,290
If she hadn't given me a hard time,

116
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,820
we wouldn't have found out their secret.

117
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,790
Hello?

118
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,630
Aunt Zhang,

119
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,140
I left a file

120
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,540
on the shoe cabinet.

121
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,340
Please send it to my office.

122
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,140
I've hired a third party to talk to him.

123
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,260
We'll get them in a few days.

124
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,460

Get out.

131
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,460
Honey,

132
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,750
I'll try my best to protect you.

133
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,980
No one can bully you anymore.

134
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,820
Ms. Chen,

135
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,940
do you like

136
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,860
my surprise

137
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,020
for you?

138
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,260
I can be more generous.

139
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,700
I'll hire the staff

140
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,140
to my new company

141
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,860
so that it'll be more convenient for you

142
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,100
to shut down the company.

143
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,140
Li Zhiren,

144
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,470
you're a monster.

145
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,460
You'll be punished.

146
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,940
Stop pretending,
