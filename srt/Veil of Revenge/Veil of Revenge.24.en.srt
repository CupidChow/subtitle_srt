2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,300
What's wrong?

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,540
Look.

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,540
The show has begun.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,420
What are you doing?

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,240
Guys, look!

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,860
This j*rk just touched my butt!

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,060
You're slandering me!

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,180
I like girls.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,880
It was you who approached me.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,180
Who'd believe

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,020
- I touched you?
- You...

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,020
I believe him.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,180
I saw it.

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,380
You've been harassing him
since you left the bathroom.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,540
Guys,

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,820
we can check the surveillance.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,380
You touched me!

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,380
You can't go!

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,540
- Get off me!
- Don't go!

21
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,740
This isn't over!

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,740
Don't go!

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
Did you do this?

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,460

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,180
(In most cases, compositions
are centered around visual necessities.)

28
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,780
Hello.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,020
Okay.

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,220
I got it.

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,600
I have good news.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,140
Li Zhiren was arrested

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,300
in a hospital.

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,100
I heard he stole

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,020
a beggar's buns

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,680
and had an accident when he ran away.

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,060
That's the best way to end it.

38
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,300
Yueran?

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Why are you here?

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,060
Are you looking for Zhiren?

41
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,020
I don't know where he is.

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,060
The house has been seized.

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,340
Besides,

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,740
we're not looking for him.

45
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,660
We just want to witness it.

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
Why would the court seize our house?

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,100
Tear it off.

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,220
In that case,

49
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,780
maybe you can meet your son

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,940
in prison.

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,340
What did you say?

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,740
My son's in jail?

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,980
Mom,

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,300
all sinners will be punished in the end,

55
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,190
right?

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
What?

57
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,500
You call me Mom?

58
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,580
I forgot to introduce myself.

59
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,260
I'm Chen Yue,

60
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,380
your son's ex-wife.

61
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Chen Yue?

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,340
No way!

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,220
Your son pushed me off a cliff,

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,140
but I survived.

65
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,360
Sorry, your wish didn't come true.

66
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,980
I'm afraid your good life

67
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,260
is over.

68
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,420
Li Zhiren is going to die in jail.

69
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,460
As for Li Zhijie,

70
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,780
he eats, wh*res, and gambles.
What a loser.

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,060
And you

72
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,010
will go back to your miserable days.

73
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,820
Impossible! Impossible!

74
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,260
You're so miserable.

75
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,620
There's nothing I can do

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,740
but to send you my best wish.

77
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,060
Wish you

78
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,780
a poor

79
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,620
and lonely life.

80
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,550
No! No way!

81
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,560
It's impossible!

82
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Chen...

83
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,780
(Document Envelope)

84
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,820
Good morning, Ms. Chen.

85
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,810
Good morning.

86
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,280
You have a delivery.

87
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,940
Please sign for it.

88
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,620
What's this?

89
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,740
I think it's what you want most.

90
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,420
(Document Envelope)

91
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,700
Yueran,

92
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,660
I know you can't forget your old house.

93
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,440
Lingyu,

94
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,340
thank you.

95
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,130
How will you thank me?

96
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,560
I don't think

97
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,260
that house is important anymore.

98
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,470
(Chen Yueran realized she broke)

99
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,980
(the law, so she turned herself in.)

100
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,740
(One Year Later)

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,210
Where are we going?

102
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,660
That's it.

103
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,430
It's where I was reborn.

104
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,820
The old Chen Yue

105
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,580
has gone with the waves.

106
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,300
From now on,

107
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,840
I'll be more confident,

108
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,930
stronger,

109
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,300
and braver.

110
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,240
My rebirth

111
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,050
has enabled me to move on

112
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,920
and meet the right person.

113
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,060
(Lingyu has made me realize)

114
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,850
(the real rebirth)

115
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,930
(is not clinging to the past)

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,860
(but embracing)

117
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,740
(a brand new life.)
