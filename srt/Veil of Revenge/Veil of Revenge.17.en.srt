2
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,740
(Murderer)

3
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,580
(Murderer)

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,510
Who did it?

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,230
Could it be Chen Yueran?

6
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,220
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 17=

7
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,080
You're

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,110
Chen Yue's

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,960
sister.

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,990
Chen Yue never told me

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,390
she had other families,

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,790
so you must be

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,670
the illegitimate daughter of Mr. Chen.

14
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,590
My father-in-law

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,950
seems to be an honest man,

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,300
but it turns out he's raised

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,190
a daughter with someone else.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
All these years,

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,990
you couldn't come home
because of your identity.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,750
You heard your sister died,

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,510
so you wanted
to take over the properties,

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,760
didn't you?

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,210
You're right.

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,590
I'm Chen Yue's sister.

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,630
I'm so glad

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,830
that Chen Yue is gone.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,440
Now I've finally got the company.

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,950
I'm busy.

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,310
Goodbye.

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,750
Take care, Ms. Chen.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Mr. Gao, goodbye.

32
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,630
There's another show
waiting for them upstairs.

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
Let's go.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
No way.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,550
She doesn't know we're related to
Chen Yue's death.

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,750
Besides, she said

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,550
she hated Chen Yue

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,150
and wanted her dead.

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,390
Who else could it be?

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Gao Lingyu!

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,320
I heard

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,030
you went to the same college.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,830
Did he

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,030
have a crush on Chen Yue?

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,690
He also helped her sister...

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,450
Does he want to take revenge
for Chen Yue?

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,830
Actually...

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
I get you.

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,950
Hope you can get what you want.

50
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,840
No matter who you are,

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,690
I'll be by your side.

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,390
None of your business!

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,590
Ms. Chen is here.

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,230
You're the boss, right?

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,800
Money!

56
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,880
Pay back our money!

57
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,350
What's going on?

58
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,230
After Li Zhiren left,

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,830
he cut off the cash flow

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,750
and suspended all the projects.

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,350
The workers want to quit.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,110
(I have to protect)

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,230
(the business my father has fought for.)

64
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,740
(The company can't go bankrupt
because of Li Zhiren.)

65
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,760
(I won't allow it.)

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,070
Money!

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,990
Calm down, everyone!

68
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,910
- Money!
- Listen to me!

69
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,630
I promise you

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,110
I'll pay back

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,430
the money we owe you in a month.

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,190
Please believe me.

73
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,750
The company needs you right now.

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,230
I hope you can

75
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,150
go back to work

76
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,710
to keep the projects going.

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,350
Why should we believe you?

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,070
What if you run away?

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,230
No. You must pay us back now.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,190
- Pay back the money!
- Money!

81
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,690
If she runs away,

82
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,150
you can ask me.

83
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,680
I'll vouch for her.

84
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,910
You?

85
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,110
Who are you?

86
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,390
I'm the president of Lingyu Group.

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,670
Lingyu will be
responsible for everything.

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,750
How's it going?

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,590
I checked the company's account.

90
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,900
It's a mess.

91
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,320
What's your plan?

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,350
If you have trouble with money,

93
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,350
I can help you.

94
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,550
Lingyu,

95
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,750
you've done enough.

96
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,430
As for money,

97
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,190
I'll figure it out.

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,270
Li Zhiren wants to get

99
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,230
everything overnight,

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,310
but haste makes waste.

101
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,790
I'll take back

102
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,950
everything he took from me
sooner or later.

103
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,230
I'll get the ointment.

104
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,870
You don't want to see a doctor?

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,070
No need. Just a cut.

106
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,850
You've been so tired,

107
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,430
so I wanted to make soup for you,

108
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,070
but I cut my finger.

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,830
Then I have to

110
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,310
have more soup.

111
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,820
Sorry,

112
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,500
does it hurt?

113
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,700
I was kidding.

114
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Gao Lingyu!

115
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,020
I was just kidding.

116
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,580
I'll turn it off.

117
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,060
Zhang Lulu.

118
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,340
You're back.

119
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,040
Ghost...

120
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,260
Ghost, ghost!

121
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,980
Zhiren,

122
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,420
let's go abroad.

123
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,020
I don't want to stay here anymore.

124
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,110
She keeps showing up in my dreams!

125
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,950
Enough, Lulu.

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,900
Get over it.

127
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,260
Babe.
