00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,880
Li Zhiren,

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,030
if you want to know who I am,

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,470
meet me at the cliff

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,630
where you killed Chen Yue at 10:00 a.m.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,070
I won't wait.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,430
I killed Chen Yue...

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,620
No one knows...

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,510
No one knows...

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,760
Impossible...

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,620
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 22=

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,030
I can finally end all of this.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,630
We've got the stuff on his computer.

14
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,190
There's evidence of tax evasion,
corruption, and bribery.

15
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,110
Hand it over to the police tomorrow.

16
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,040
Apart from that,

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,550
we also found a fake suicide note.

18
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,090
You might want to see it.

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,940
(Suicide Note, Chen Yue)

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,590
No wonder my parents
were so convinced of his lies.

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,030
It turns out he deceived them
with the diaries I wrote

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,110
when I was depressed.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,320
Yue,

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,230
what happened to you at that time?

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,030
Why were you depressed?

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,550
Li Zhiren has azoospermia,

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,150
but he hid everything

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,190
and told me

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,150
we couldn't get pregnant

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,030
because I had fallopian tube stenosis.

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,790
He watched me take pills

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,710
to get prenant,

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,430
get fat, hate myself,

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,830
and even break down.

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,670
As a result,

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,470
I was trapped at home
trying to kill myself.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,030
He's a monster,

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,950
a devil in a human's disguise.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,550
I'll face it with you tomorrow.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
Don't be afraid.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
As long as I'm here,

42
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,630
everything will be alright.

43
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,230
Who the hell are you?

44
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,470
Why do you know Chen Yue?

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,910
Before I answer you,

46
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,270
I have a question.

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,390
Did you know she was still alive

48
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,390
before you threw her body

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,930
off the cliff?

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,950
You want to know who I am, right?

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,870
I'll tell you.

52
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,660
I am Chen Yue.

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,020
Do you remember?

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,450
You pushed me down

55
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,040
right there.

56
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,140
Luckily,

57
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,970
someone saved me,

58
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,500
but I was disfigured.

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,970
After so many plastic surgeries,

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,020
I changed my face

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,740
and my name.

62
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,800
I was reborn.

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,140
Why are you so surprised?

64
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,540
You've suspected me for a long time,
haven't you?

65
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,130
I...

66
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,130
You made me do this!

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,180
I made you?

68
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,780
You couldn't have come this far

69
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,090
without me and my family!

70
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,180
Shouldn't you be grateful?

71
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,420
Yes...

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,410
You're always pitying me.

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,580
You've never changed.

74
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,780
You're always arrogant

75
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,270
and proud!

76
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,340
You talk about what you've given me

77
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,100
all the time.

78
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,740
Since we got married,

79
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,460
you've been telling me

80
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,390
everything I have

81
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,260
is from your family!

82
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,860
But I'm a man.

83
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,260
What kind of man can stand

84
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,760
to be looked down on
by his wife every single day?

85
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,940
Is that what you think?

86
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,140
What am I supposed to think?

87
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,960
Should I be grateful to you?

88
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,140
Should I bow to your entire family?

89
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,560
The first time I went to your house,

90
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,120
your mom

91
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,860
started at me as I washed my hands!

92
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,550
You thought my mom was vulgar

93
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,510
and told her not to speak
at our wedding.

94
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,960
Only your dad could deliver a speech!

95
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,680
My mom is a neat freak,

96
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,970
and it was your suggestion
about the wedding.

97
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,550
Then why didn't your mom
start at you when you washed your hands?

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,640
I made that suggestion

99
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,180
because your parents

100
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,650
always looked down on my mom

101
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,660
as if she was disgusting.

102
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,460
If I hadn't said so,

103
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,380
they'd never let you

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
marry me!

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
How can you talk about them like that?

106
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,180
Haven't they been good to you?

107
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,020
Good?

108
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,670
Your father said

109
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,090
he'd treat me like his son
after we got married,

110
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,820
but the cars and the house he bought

111
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,760
were all under your name.

112
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,970
You even owned the company

113
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,920
I worked so hard for!

114
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,370
If Chen Yue hadn't died,

115
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,060
I'd work for your family like a dog
for the rest of my life

116
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,460
and still have nothing.

117
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,620
So,

118
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,980
my death wasn't an accident.

119
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,940
You always wanted to kill me,
didn't you?

120
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,840
I don't feel

121
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,820
any sympathy for you anymore.

122
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,940
Today,

123
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,580
let's end this right here.

124
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,740
You're going to pay

125
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,380
for all the crimes you've committed

126
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,660
and the illegal deals you've got

127
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,260
with my father's company.

128
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,350
You...

129
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,650
How dare you call the police?

130
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,790
Lingyu!

131
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,540
Are you okay?

132
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm fine,

133
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,300
but he ran away.

134
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Are you okay?

135
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,800
Li Zhiren, I need to go to the bathroom!

136
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,290
I can't hold it in!

137
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,330
Let me out, or I'll do it here!

138
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,790
I'll pee in your room!

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,500
Li Zhiren, let me out!

140
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,750
Li Zhiren, let me out!
