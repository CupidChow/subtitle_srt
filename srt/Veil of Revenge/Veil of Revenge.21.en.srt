2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,150
What is the password?

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,790
One, nine, three, six, one, seven.

4
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,150
It's not relevant to
any of my information.

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,310
Of course you can't figure it out.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,310
Do you want to know

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,110
how I found out
you checked my bank account?

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,820
=Veil of Revenge=
=Episode 21=

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,390
This.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,840
But,

11
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,950
you drank that wine.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,150
That wine?

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,990
I'd taken the cure

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,710
long before I drank it,

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,350
so it didn't work for me at all.

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,470
So, honey,

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,750
what are you going to do?

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
Zhiren!

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,510
It was Chen Yueran

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,390
who forced me to do this!

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,910
Chen Yueran?

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,030
I thought she was
Mr. Chen's illegitimate child.

23
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,710
Guess I was wrong.

24
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,390
She not only wants
to take away my properties

25
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,590
but wants to destroy me.

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,310
She impersonated Chen Yue
to freak you out,

27
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,750
so she must know something.

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,790
Could she be...?

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,710
Then what should I do?

30
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,950
Just act normal.

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,120
Don't let her find out anything.

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,630
Then...

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,510
Then install this on her car.

34
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,110
Did you get the password?

35
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,230
No.

36
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,470
After Li Zhiren passed out,

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,170
I tried many times but failed.

38
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,390
He's very suspicious.

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,070
I wouldn't dare drug him every day.

40
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,990
Keep looking for the password.

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,340
I need you to do
something more important.

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,230
I hired someone to cook the books

43
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,390
and put it in the USB drive.

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,110
Replace the file in his computer

45
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,250
with this.

46
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,680
I have something to do.

47
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,840
You should go.

48
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
How did it go?

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,990
I've installed it on her car.

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,870
Zhiren!

51
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,950
Are you okay?

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Why?

53
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,670
Are you okay?

54
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,650
I'll get some water for you.

55
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,190
Are you feeling better now?

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,390
Why are you shouting?

57
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm not deaf.

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,230
Do you want to try again?

59
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,630
Maybe later.

60
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
What's this?

61
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,270
Chen Yueran hired someone
to cook the books

62
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,630
and asked me

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,950
to copy it to your computer.

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,270
She's clever, isn't she?

65
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,900
(Unidentified USB Drive)

66
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,700
(Transacting...)

67
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,820
(Completed. Balance: 0)

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,390
Didn't you say it was false accounting?

69
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,750
It's a virus!

70
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,430
What's happening?

71
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,230
Did you conspire with that b*tch
to do this?

72
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,580
- I didn't!
- Did you do it?

73
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,630
- I didn't!
- You didn't?

74
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,070
You didn't?

75
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,910
Didn't?

76
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,950
You didn't?

77
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,220
Gave my money back!

78
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,710
My money is gone!

79
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,710
It's all gone! It's all gone!
