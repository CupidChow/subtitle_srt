1
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:34,210
   

2
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:43,720


3
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,956
♫  Cold wind breezes by my shoulder  ♫

4
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:50,626
Kim Yoo Ri.

5
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:51,796
Close your eyes.

6
00:00:51,796 --> 00:00:56,940
♫  The night I could only think of painful memories  ♫

7
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:05,356
♫  Do you remember that time when you came to me quietly to hold my hand  ♫

8
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,456
Don't think about anything.

9
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:11,060
♫  The tears are finally flowing  ♫

10
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:18,666
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

11
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,196
♫  Do you feel it?  ♫

12
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:27,026
♫  Can you see with kindly eyes?  ♫

13
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:35,256
♫  It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long  ♫

14
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:38,836
♫  Just lean on me  ♫

15
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:44,420
♫  Embrace me just like this  ♫

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,740
♫  Does this feeling...  ♫

17
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,696
It's okay.

18
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:49,166
Yoo Ri, it's all right.

19
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,386
In the cafe...

20
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:53,156
Nureongyi...

21
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,196
- Nureongyi... 
 - I know.

22
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:59,116
I know. I'll take care of it.

23
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:01,286
Come on. Lie down.

24
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:06,856
♫  It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long  ♫

25
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:10,036
♫  Just lean on me  ♫

26
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:15,950
For now, you just focus on breathing.

27
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,650
   

28
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:06,176
It looks like they killed it on the doormat and dragged the body over there.

29
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,396
You said it wasn't a dog that you were raising?

30
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,366
We basically took care of it as if we were raising it.

31
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:14,196
But man, the floor is a bloodbath, and yet there is no sign of any footprints.

32
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:17,816
And all the CCTVs in the cafe and in front of the building are destroyed.

33
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:20,256
I think he was quite determined.

34
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,856
We also have to run the fingerprints through the system,

35
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:24,236
but I don't think someone that meticulous would—

36
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:27,226
Are you saying you won't investigate since he's meticulous?

37
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:29,386
What did you just say?

38
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:33,166
If you investigate this way, just turn over all the files to the prosecution!

39
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,276
- What do you mean— 
 - Aigoo, Detective!

40
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,746
It must be tough being out here this late, Detective.

41
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:39,376
I am Jeong Moon Shik, the deputy director of

42
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,316
Criminal Division 3 of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

43
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,616
Why did you come by yourself, Director?

44
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,836
I thought you wanted to grab drinks since you called so late.

45
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:50,016
I had no idea you'd call me to a crime scene in the middle of the night.

46
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:51,986
Yes, you're working so hard. We're all good.

47
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:54,096
- Not just the CCTVs in front of the building, 
 - Let's go. No, no!

48
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,926
- you should look at the entire neighborhood! 
 - Thank you!

49
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:57,876
Why just around here?

50
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:59,596
- Let's go. 
 - Geez...

51
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:02,046
- Look how they're doing it. How can I not get angry? 
 - Oh, yes, yes!

52
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:04,506
- Prosecutor. 
 - Geez!

53
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:07,456
What good comes out of fighting with the police?

54
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,046
You need to control your temper.

55
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:22,396
Attorney! Attorney!

56
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,626
Are you okay?

57
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:26,876
How did you come here? I thought you'd left...

58
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:29,926
I did leave, but I came back after hearing from Jeong Ho.

59
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,596
Don't worry about it too much.

60
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:39,596
Jeong Ho is taking care of everything and talking with the police.

61
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:44,936
Because of the shock, you may not be able to sleep well tonight.

62
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:48,556
So I came to be of some help.

63
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:53,146
Are you going to be all right?

64
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,796
When I woke up, it was already afternoon.

65
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:47,186
I ended up sleeping at Kim Jeong Ho's place all day.

66
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,406
 I'm going to run by the police station. 

67
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:13,236
 Rest, and don't go anywhere. 

68
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:51,066
Attorney!

69
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,836
Wh-What is this?

70
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,986
Are you okay, Boss?

71
00:06:57,536 --> 00:07:00,486
This is my first time seeing a crime scene...

72
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,346
Oh, my God! Oh, my...

73
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:04,186
Wh-What happened here?

74
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:06,636
What happened?

75
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,616
Are you okay?

76
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,656
Here.

77
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,176
Thank you.

78
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,256
It's 2,500 won.

79
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:23,046
What's going on here?

80
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:26,690
Gosh, it's like a war broke out. What a disaster.

81
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,450
Seriously.

82
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,566
There used to be a restaurant here,

83
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,106
and they used both the first and second floors.

84
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:42,646
 But when they left, 

85
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:47,546
 I guess the people who moved into the first floor just blocked off that entryway. 

86
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,416
What do we do with all this?

87
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,456
It hasn't even been that long since you opened the cafe.

88
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:02,516
- Gosh... 
 - Geez!

89
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,476
So what a**hole is responsible for this, anyway?

90
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,076
Do you have any suspicions?

91
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:12,806
I mean, I made so many enemies working as an attorney.

92
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:16,636
I'm sure the police will find the culprit.

93
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,216
I found this inside there.

94
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,576
Nothing went missing, right?

95
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:27,796
I don't think so.

96
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:37,116
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

97
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,746
Hey, you came.

98
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:43,056
- What did the police say— 
 - I told you not to go anywhere and just stay in my room!

99
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,776
Why are you yelling?

100
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:50,646
I'll clean up here, so you go upstairs and rest.

101
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:53,876
Why would you clean up here? It's my cafe.

102
00:08:55,246 --> 00:09:00,446
By the way, sorry about my stay in your room last night.

103
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:05,146
After all this is over, I'll really make sure never to bother you again.

104
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:10,796
Stay at my place for a few more days, at least until we catch the culprit.

105
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:14,946
That would be so uncomfortable.

106
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,986
Besides, where would you stay then?

107
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:20,716
I can sleep wherever, whether on the floor or in front of the door.

108
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:21,676
So just stay at my place.

109
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,316
You don't even have a place to go right now.

110
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:24,976
Hey, even if that was the case,

111
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:28,446
how can you say that we sleep in the same room...

112
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:32,286
Hey, we don't know what that a**hole might do by coming by your place.

113
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,456
Do I leave you alone?

114
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,226
You said not to bother you.

115
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:38,436
- I'll take care of myself so— 
 - You're bothering me when I worry about you!

116
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,046
Did I ask you to worry about me?

117
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,456
Besides, you said men and women are different.

118
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,436
You kicked me out, saying we couldn't drink together at night.

119
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:46,456
Sleeping in the same room?

120
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,936
Are you saying this because it's nothing to you?

121
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,076
Yeah. Of course, it's nothing to me.

122
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:55,566
You and I... well...

123
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,146
we're pretty much like family!

124
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,546
Brother and sister.

125
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:00,856
Whoa! Oh, my gosh.

126
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:02,886
Brother and... wh-what?

127
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,936
I mean, for you and me...

128
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,226
aren't we pretty much like family?

129
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:08,676
Fa... mily?* 
  (Sounds like the f-word) 

130
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:09,696
Yeah, family.

131
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,486
Family?

132
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,356
What f***ing family!

133
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,266
Fine! I'll sleep there, yeah. I'll just stay there!

134
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,676
I've done it once! What would stop me from doing it twice?

135
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,456
At this rate, why don't we

136
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:24,186
just sleep in the same bed under the same blanket!

137
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:27,580
Yeah, let's just sleep in the same bed under the same blanket!

138
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:30,236
- Mom! 
 - You, girl...

139
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:31,976
What did you just say?

140
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:35,806
You're not even married, and you're talking about the same bed, same blanket?

141
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:37,006
You come over here!

142
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,426
- Mother... 
 - Come here! Come over here!

143
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:43,196
It's not like that, Mom! He told me to sleep over at his place first!

144
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,186
Besides, what age are we living in

145
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,396
that people have to be married to sleep together...

146
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,126
You come over here.

147
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:52,046
You're dead today!

148
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,796
Come over here!

149
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:55,626
Come here!

150
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:59,086
Come over here!

151
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,886
- Mother! Mother! 
 - Get over here.

152
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:05,386
   
 (Gajok means family in Korean) 

153
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:11,016
   

154
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,756
Jeong Ho!

155
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:26,196
Are you going to take responsibility for my Yoo Ri?

156
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:27,756
What do you mean by that, Mother?

157
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:30,606
Yoo Ri is your responsibility!

158
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:36,346
Jeong Ho, your sense of humor hasn't changed a bit.

159
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:40,816
It couldn't compare with the unchanging nature of your beauty, Mother.

160
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,426
Jeong Ho, your good taste in women is also the same.

161
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,236
Thank you.

162
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,356
I did hear that you were the landlord here.

163
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:51,016
But no matter how comfortable you are with each other, if you sleep over once or twice,

164
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:54,126
and something happens between you two...

165
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:55,666
I'd be happy about that!

166
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,106
Oh, come on!

167
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,296
I understand your sentiment, Mother.

168
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:02,076
But you know that our relationship isn't like that.

169
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,916
And regarding yesterday...

170
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,396
it was just too crazy for me to take her home.

171
00:12:12,536 --> 00:12:15,546
Yeah, what is all this going on here?

172
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,426
Come on. Stop it!

173
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:26,156
There's no more space on the table! How are we supposed to eat all this?

174
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,446
It's been a long time since my daughter's come home!

175
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,186
What's wrong with overfilling the table for once?

176
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:31,086
- I'm home! 
 - Welcome home!

177
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,116
Hello!

178
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:34,326
Oh, you're here, Yoo Ri?

179
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:36,076
Have you been well?

180
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:38,696
 They've been together... 

181
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:42,516
for about... 14 or 15 years.

182
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,666
My stepfather is a really good person.

183
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,016
I've lived away from home in the dorms since college

184
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:55,256
so whenever we meet, it's just a tad bit... awkward.

185
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:58,606
 If you spend all night playing games, when do you find time for studying? 

186
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:00,906
Gosh, I don't know who he takes after in this regard.

187
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,176
Who could it be? It's probably you.

188
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:05,676
Do you think games are easy then?

189
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,726
That's what I mean!

190
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:11,196
It must be so nice to be optimistic.

191
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:12,916
All right. Everyone, eat up.

192
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,476
Eat.

193
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:17,376
Don't just eat the meat.

194
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:29,336
Mom, do you still wear that ring?

195
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:32,346
Of course, it's the ring that your father gave me.

196
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,426
Why?

197
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:40,596
Does it make you upset to see that

198
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:42,456
I'm living a happy life without your dad?

199
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:45,546
What do you mean, upset? What do you take me for?

200
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:51,946
We made a promise when your dad and I put these rings on.

201
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:55,326
That we'll live happily ever after.

202
00:13:56,006 --> 00:14:00,026
I'm going to keep that promise until the day I die.

203
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,726
- Mom... 
 - What's wrong?

204
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:13,596
You're all grown up, and yet you're still clinging to me...

205
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,146
   

206
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:31,906
So this was filmed by a dash cam in a vehicle near the cafe around 10:20 p.m.

207
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:35,126
You said you left after 11 p.m., right?

208
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,566
Can you identify the person here?

209
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:43,776
   

210
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:48,306
Or do you have anyone you could think of?

211
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:53,506
I mean, this is just purely my own opinion,

212
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:57,256
but it doesn't appear that this crime was merely a simple break-in

213
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:59,476
or an act of terrorism.

214
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:03,156
Rather, it feels more like a warning.

215
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:16,476
Did you kill the dog? 
    

216
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:19,106
 Hey, how could you kill the dog? 

217
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:21,346
Why would you kill an innocent animal?

218
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:24,806
You bastard. In this world, there's no

219
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:27,266
such a thing as a bad dog—

220
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,086
Geez, this guy scares me.

221
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:31,636
And I did some investigating, as you mentioned.

222
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:35,096
The leader of the work team from the subcontracting company

223
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:37,586
who died in the fire at the warehouse in Hwacheon was...

224
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,576
Attorney Kim Yoo Ri's father.

225
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:40,866
What?

226
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,936
   

227
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:51,156
What the hell.

228
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,926
What an interesting turn of events! 
    

229
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,616
But even for someone like me,

230
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:03,366
I don't feel right about destroying everyone in the family.

231
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:09,786
   

232
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:12,776
- Kim Yoo Ri. 
 - That son of a b****.

233
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:18,016
That crazy son of a b****. How dare he kill a doggy!

234
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,516
You just wait.

235
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,576
The SOBs who mistreat those weaker than they are

236
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:25,896
will only wake up they're caught, skinned, and deep-fried in s*** water. Son of a b****!

237
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:31,886
You're laughing?

238
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:35,296
I mean, the way you're acting.

239
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,626
It's so you.

240
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:45,316
In any case, it couldn't be them, right?

241
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:48,586
Dohan Construction wouldn't have done this just for someone like me.

242
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:49,756
Right?

243
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:52,316
I'm just being paranoid, right?

244
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:00,346
I'll give you a ride. Let's go home.

245
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,526
- You're going back to your mother's house, right? 
 - No.

246
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,186
I already rested for a few days.

247
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:06,376
I need to clean up the cafe and start taking customers again.

248
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:09,346
Eun Kang said he had to turn away several customers yesterday.

249
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:15,156
Then I'll come to your place in the evening.

250
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:18,356
What's the matter with you?

251
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:20,596
I thought you said that I'm bothersome and annoying!

252
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:22,296
You said to quit bothering you!

253
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,536
Then why do you keep...

254
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:28,666
being nice to me like that?

255
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:33,416
This is not being nice to you. This is fulfilling a duty.

256
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,886
If you look at the contract,

257
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:38,006
in the case that the tenant experiences an act of thievery or terrorism,

258
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:39,706
the landlord is supposed to provide support.

259
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:43,626
Is sleeping at the tenant's place included as part of providing support?

260
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:51,866
I don't want to leave you by yourself, Kim Yoo Ri.

261
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:58,616
How much more do I have to say in a roundabout way?

262
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:08,306
Who does he think he is to not leave me alone...

263
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:11,206
What's he going to do otherwise?

264
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:14,656
Oh, no. Don't suck on that.

265
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,416
It's okay.

266
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,776
Oh, hello...

267
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:20,946
Dr. Park, hello.

268
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,306
Hello, Attorney!

269
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:23,966
I—

270
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:32,856
A stroll?

271
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:36,126
You did this because you thought I wouldn't come if you told me to come in for a session, right?

272
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:38,006
It's not therapy.

273
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:39,416
Why don't you just think of me as...

274
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:43,476
a neighborhood friend to go on walks with?

275
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:47,396
Because I don't want to just have a doctor-patient relationship with you, Attorney.

276
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,546
I didn't want to be a patient, either. That's great.

277
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,236
Doctor!

278
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:54,886
Then I'm only telling you this not because

279
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:57,526
you're a psychiatrist but as a neighborhood friend.

280
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:58,786
What are you doing?

281
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:01,766
How can you open up about everything when we just decided to be friends?

282
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,276
Just listen!

283
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:07,876
The day before yesterday, I didn't say something to the police and Jeong Ho.

284
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:09,436
What is it?

285
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,866
Tell me about it.

286
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:14,676
The tenant before me, who used to run a tarot cafe.

287
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:17,296
Did you hear about how he saw a ghost?

288
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:19,966
Yes, of course. I have heard about that.

289
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,166
I'm not too sure, either, but...

290
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,516
I think I also saw that ghost that night.

291
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:28,496
Do you know that large mirror next to the kitchen?

292
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:29,786
At first,

293
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:34,476
I thought it was just my reflection because it was so dark.

294
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:36,696
But it turned out it wasn't.

295
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,216
 You know, the stairwell behind the mirror? 

296
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:45,766
 There was a little child standing there. 

297
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:55,506
Doctor! Doctor! Breathe, breathe!

298
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:03,966
I'm sorry about that.

299
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:07,026
I'm a bit weak when it comes to things like ghosts.

300
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:08,546
So then...

301
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:12,446
you must have been scared all that time you were at the cafe.

302
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:15,046
But for some reason,

303
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:19,176
it felt like that child was a bit taken aback by me as well.

304
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:23,756
In fact, it felt more like the kid was afraid of me.

305
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,756
So instead of just feeling afraid...

306
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:31,456
Doctor, you just thought to yourself that I was weird, right?

307
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,676
No, it's not that.

308
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:38,106
I was seriously considering if I should ask a shaman I know to perform an exorcism.

309
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:41,696
What? Do you have a shaman you keep in touch with?

310
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:46,146
Of course. I believe that everyone should have at least one trustworthy psychiatrist, attorney,

311
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,476
and shaman they can meet with.

312
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:50,526
I knew it.

313
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:53,416
Doctor, we vibe well together.

314
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,526
We do?

315
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:57,056
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

316
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:10,096
Are you seriously picking a fight with me?

317
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:13,176
Don't make me repeat myself.

318
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:21,076
 Whoa, whoa. Don't give it to me. 

319
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:25,956
 Hello. I am Kim Seung Woon, and I have been appointed as the 45th Chief Prosecutor of the Central District. 

320
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:30,416
 The prosecution receives the power to prosecute from the people. 

321
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:34,436
 I will not stand for any corrupt acts of power that threaten a just society 

322
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:40,426
 and will act on behalf of the disadvantaged of our society— 

323
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:46,136
It's been a while since you've seen your parents, right?

324
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:53,106
Call them and pay them a visit sometime.

325
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:56,526
Don't you know you should treat them well while they're still around?

326
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:59,606
After my father passed away,

327
00:21:59,606 --> 00:22:02,906
I kept thinking about the things I didn't get to do for him.

328
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,996
So you too...

329
00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:08,196
Don't think that every parent-child relationship is like your family.

330
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:15,906
Then why don't you just tell me how things are in your family?

331
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,366
When you quit your job as a prosecutor,

332
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:24,356
I don't know what happened with your father.

333
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:26,596
But he's still your father, no matter how much you hate him.

334
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,256
Don't be so sure. You don't even know anything.

335
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:35,476
Hey! How can you say—

336
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,796
What happened?

337
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:46,036
You're so much trouble.

338
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:47,606
Come here.

339
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:49,436
Jeong Ho!

340
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:52,276
- Hey! Let go of me! 
 - Just stay still for a moment!

341
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:54,686
- I told you to let go of me! 
 - S***!

342
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:56,886
Are you a tuna fish? Why are you flopping around so much?

343
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:59,636
Why do you keep carrying me like a princess? Who do you think you are?

344
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:00,976
Just because I got hurt a little like this,

345
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:02,766
you think I can't walk from there to here?

346
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:05,546
You chipped your toenail. You shouldn't be complaining so much.

347
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,386
You've really outdone yourself.

348
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:18,916
Whether I break my toenail or crack my head,

349
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:19,986
don't you...

350
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:22,296
don't you dare touch me!

351
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:24,136
I'm really confused these days!

352
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:28,636
If you keep being nice to me whenever I'm in trouble...

353
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:31,166
you're really going to regret it.

354
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:41,661
So if I keep being nice to you...

355
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,796
what are you going to do about it?

356
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,707
Tell me!

357
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,897
What are you going to do about it?

358
00:23:54,841 --> 00:24:00,581
♫  I guess I recognize your laughter  ♫

359
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:06,580
♫  She's waking me up with that pretty smile  ♫

360
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:10,671
♫  You make me smile  ♫

361
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:13,561
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

362
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:17,751
♫  I wonder if you know that I feel this way  ♫

363
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,481
 Jeong Ho! 

364
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:21,371
 Hey! Let go of me! 

365
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:25,561
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

366
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:27,461
 It's okay. 

367
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:28,731
 Yoo Ri, it's okay. 

368
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:30,531
 You and I... well... 

369
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:31,961
 we're pretty much like family! 

370
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:35,371
 Brother and sister. 

371
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:39,811
Brother and sister, my foot.

372
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,400
   

373
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,941
Boss! Good morning!

374
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,011
Joon, did you see my wallet?

375
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:01,421
I'm pretty sure I left it here yesterday.

376
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:03,471
Oh... that...

377
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,771
The one with the leopard print, right?

378
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,181
I don't know...

379
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:14,031
Gosh, where is my head...

380
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:17,671
Because of that Kim Jeong Ho, I've been out of my mind.

381
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:19,951
Yeah, I'm not in my right mind.

382
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:24,141
Attorney, you're open for business today, right?

383
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:26,371
Yes, of course!

384
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,771
This is the mother of Yi Seul's friend from kindergarten.

385
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:31,581
She said she needed a consultation for something.

386
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,551
And I wanted to help out with the cleaning.

387
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:35,701
What do you mean, cleaning?

388
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,571
Have a seat! Come this way, please.

389
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:42,861
Yi Seul, play over here.

390
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:45,441
I'll help out.

391
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:03,691
What brings you here today?

392
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:08,791
I want to apply for a restraining order against the man living next door.

393
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:13,651
I think that man is stalking me.

394
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:19,041
Could you tell me in detail how you felt threatened by him?

395
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,631
Whenever I go outside with my child,

396
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:24,411
I can sense that he's stealing glances at us through the window.

397
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:28,341
Sometimes, it seems like he's snapping pictures of us.

398
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:31,811
I feel like he's being paid by my child's father to do this...

399
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,851
We're in the middle of filing for divorce.

400
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:42,611
When did this start?

401
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:45,291
This has been going on for over two years!

402
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:50,051
Is there any way I can force him to move out?

403
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:52,231
Hello!

404
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,151
Get me an iced caramel macchiato

405
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,171
with two pumps of syrup and topped with whipped cream.

406
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:07,720
- Hey, Bae Joon. 
 - Kongjui and Patjui!

407
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:09,951
Do you guys still read this?

408
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:12,211
Ahjussi, have you read this, too?

409
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:16,181
You think Kongjui's stepmom was really bad, too, right?

410
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,561
No need for words. Yeah, she was really bad.

411
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,101
First, that's assault.

412
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,021
According to Article 260, Clause 1 of the Criminal Code,

413
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:23,791
it's battery.

414
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:27,101
That is, hitting someone is not the only thing that constitutes assault.

415
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:30,611
Anything that causes someone to get hurt is considered assault.

416
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,141
Here's your coffee.

417
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,731
What is this?

418
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:38,101
He said, just drink what you're given.

419
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:40,141
Enjoy your drink!

420
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:43,621
And then, there's another problem.

421
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,551
Abuse.

422
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:48,121
For example, she gives Patjui a metal hoe while plowing the fields

423
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,541
while giving Kongjui a wooden hoe to make her suffer.

424
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,271
Or taking only Patjui to a feast while leaving Kongjui behind at home

425
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,381
and making her pour water into a broken urn.

426
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,611
Discrimination like this is all considered abuse.

427
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:01,901
Then what's the number for that?

428
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,091
Huh? Number?

429
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,831
The law code thing you said before.

430
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:09,311
Oh, abuse is in Article 273 of the Criminal Code.

431
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:14,461
All right. Have a nice day!

432
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:19,401
- Is this fun? 
 - No.

433
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,861
- It's not fun? 
 - No.

434
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:22,421
Hey!

435
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:24,221
All right, let's go.

436
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,621
Are you close friends?

437
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,900
   

438
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,380
   

439
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,240
   

440
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:54,191
If no discussions take place by two months before the expiry date of a contract,

441
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,481
that contract is automatically assumed to be renewed.

442
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:59,861
Thus, your landlord... When was it again?

443
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:01,651
- Three weeks ago! 
 - So if three weeks ago,

444
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:03,821
he notified you about raising the rent...

445
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:05,131
This isn't going to work!

446
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:07,501
Looks like the line is a little long, so you'll have to wait.

447
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,521
Please be patient.

448
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:15,211
- How much did we sell? 
 -16,000.

449
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,991
Mine aren't selling...

450
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:22,461
- You guys are hungry, right? 
 - Boiled egg, steamed sweet potato?

451
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,711
Fried sweet potato?

452
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,791
Aigoo! Don't worry about it!

453
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,011
The purpose of your blog post

454
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:29,851
is not in slandering the business involved

455
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,701
but rather in the public interest.

456
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:33,431
Then it cannot be considered defamation.

457
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:35,921
Here is the coffee you ordered.

458
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:37,641
Please enjoy your drink.

459
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,411
Boiled eggs, steamed sweet potato.

460
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,751
Rice puffs for 3,000 won.

461
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:42,241
Try it.

462
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,831
- Rice puffs for 3,000 won. 
 - Take one.

463
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,341
Come on, ladies!

464
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:48,791
You can't do this in someone else's business!

465
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,451
This is considered an obstruction of business!

466
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:56,821
You're not going to sell anything besides drinks anyway...

467
00:29:56,821 --> 00:29:59,111
While people are waiting,

468
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:02,171
they're going to get hungry, right?

469
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,901
Let's have a symbiotic relationship!

470
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:07,311
I'll give you ten percent of the profits as a location fee.

471
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,391
Fifteen percent!

472
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,091
Deal?

473
00:30:11,091 --> 00:30:12,951
Deal!

474
00:30:12,951 --> 00:30:16,601
♫  More than anyone else  ♫

475
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:20,221
♫  I think I love you a little bit more  ♫

476
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:23,831
♫  I think I ended up loving you  ♫

477
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:26,571
♫  Continuously  ♫

478
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:34,071
♫  More than myself  ♫

479
00:30:45,231 --> 00:30:47,171
But Hyungnim...

480
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,711
How are you, at your young age,

481
00:30:49,711 --> 00:30:53,801
living everyone's dream life as a landlord?

482
00:30:57,531 --> 00:31:00,681
Please share some important tips on life!

483
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:02,061
Why?

484
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:05,671
You seem to be living fairly well yourself.

485
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:09,351
I want to have success and have it easy for a long time.

486
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:10,991
I really want an easy life.

487
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:15,191
Wearing a tracksuit and doing nothing all the time like you, Hyungnim!

488
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:18,291
I bought this with the money I earned by working.

489
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:20,601
Come on now.

490
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,701
Really? Doing what?

491
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:30,461
Hyung!

492
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:32,461
Hyung, Hyung! I won't tell anyone! Please!

493
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:34,361
Hyung, what is it?

494
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:35,981
Who are you? What do you think you're doing?

495
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,501
Hyung, Hyung! Why? What's the matter?

496
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:39,971
This punk was hiding and spying on our cafe!

497
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:42,161
- What? 
 - Who the hell are you?

498
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,161
Yeah, who the hell are you? Tell us, please!

499
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:13,501
What kind of legal advice were you looking—

500
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:16,531
What that ahjumma told you earlier are all lies!

501
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:18,141
Wh-Whom?

502
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:20,771
You know, that ahjumma who came by here with a girl this small.

503
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:21,921
What did that ahjumma say to you?

504
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:23,921
She said I'm her stalker, right?

505
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:25,261
 The man next door. 

506
00:32:25,261 --> 00:32:28,441
 I think he's stalking me. 

507
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:35,311
If you followed her here since then and watched us...

508
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:37,971
it's not like we have no reason to be suspicious of you.

509
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:41,141
I wasn't stalking that ahjumma.

510
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:46,081
I'm just watching her.

511
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,821
Watching her?

512
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:50,371
I'm telling the truth!

513
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:53,831
There are so many suspicious things about her.

514
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:56,211
We think you're more suspicious.

515
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:57,911
I—

516
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,521
You know the bathroom smell?

517
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,131
From that ahjumma's balcony,

518
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:05,561
some strange stench kept coming from her place over into our apartment.

519
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:07,291
And we were getting bugs, too.

520
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,941
So I went over to her place to complain about it.

521
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:15,231
And when her door opened, I saw it clearly.

522
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:22,031
In that house, there's another child.

523
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:23,921
It's not that she had only one child.

524
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:25,931
She had two.

525
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:28,451
But the strange thing is,

526
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:31,061
that ahjumma never takes the other child around.

527
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:33,771
She always takes... is it Ji Ah?

528
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:35,461
She only takes her around.

529
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:37,751
That's why I watch her all the time.

530
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:40,091
- Do you have proof? 
 - Proof—

531
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:42,691
Oh, look at this.

532
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:44,931
Here.

533
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:50,501
She always ran away when I took pictures of her, so I don't really have a good picture.

534
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:54,941
That other child always comes out at night and roams around alone.

535
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:58,091
She must be so frustrated to be doing that.

536
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:17,481
 Oh, yeah, and you know that stray dog? 

537
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:20,951
 She was very close to that dog Nureongyi. 

538
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:39,691
 I found this in there. 

539
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:51,131
There!

540
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:01,751
Am I the only one who doesn't get what this is about?

541
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,441
I think...

542
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:07,091
this child has been going in and out of our building.

543
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:08,091
What did you say?

544
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:10,401
I think she came into the empty upper floor

545
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,331
and has been hiding out in our cafe's stairwell.

546
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:14,901
What do you base that on?

547
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,761
Me...

548
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,161
I think I saw her.

549
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:22,691
I was in such shock then, so I thought I saw it wrong.

550
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:25,481
I didn't think it was really a person...

551
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:30,181
You said you've reported this family for child abuse before, right?

552
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:38,221
Why don't you explain this?

553
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:39,831
I mean...

554
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:42,921
- when we dispatched and checked them out, 
 - And then?

555
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:45,771
- her house was somewhat messy... 
 - Yeah, then?

556
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:49,081
- I saw nothing that said child abuse took place. 
 - I see...

557
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,391
She didn't have any visible injuries, either.

558
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:51,671
I see...

559
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:53,411
The child couldn't even go to school because she was sick,

560
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:55,491
and yet she was roaming around at night all alone.

561
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:57,051
And yet you saw nothing that said child abuse?

562
00:35:57,051 --> 00:36:00,591
I mean, is it abuse only if you get beaten with purple bruises?

563
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,001
Negligence.

564
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,691
It's when a parent or guardian does not provide food, clothing,

565
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:08,441
shelter or does not take care of the child.

566
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:11,701
Just by looking at this photo,

567
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:15,671
it says this child is an abused child!

568
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,321
Get it?

569
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:22,081
This seems to be the most justifiable reason. What do you think?

570
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:25,691
I mean, we're just recognizing the fact that she's roaming at night like that.

571
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:26,641
Move.

572
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,881
Then!

573
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,851
Let's dispatch right away with us.

574
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:33,591
We're supposed to be dispatched with a social worker.

575
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,831
You'll have to wait a bit...

576
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:37,221
What do you mean wait?

577
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:50,541
You can't come in!

578
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,181
No!

579
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:55,581
No! Get out!

580
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:56,561
Don't look!

581
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,461
Don't look!

582
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:00,271
Don't look!

583
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:02,381
Don't look, don't look!

584
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:04,241
Get out!

585
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:07,401
Get out!

586
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:12,541
Don't look...

587
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,740
Don't look!

588
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:18,361
Where's your second child?

589
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:23,331
Ma'am, where is she?

590
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:24,911
I...

591
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,811
I don't know, either...

592
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,671
What do you mean you don't know? What—

593
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,441
How many days has she been missing?

594
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,211
Huh?

595
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:40,341
Sir...

596
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,171
I...

597
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:44,471
I didn't hit her.

598
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,961
I...

599
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,651
never hit her.

600
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:52,941
She kept stealing money,

601
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:55,131
so I tried to teach her a lesson.

602
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:58,631
I did this just once to teach her a lesson...

603
00:37:58,631 --> 00:38:00,351
I'm sorry...

604
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:04,171
Ji Ah, do you know where your sister is?

605
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:12,324
Please believe me!

606
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:15,164
Please...

607
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,581
Believe me!

608
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,780
   

609
00:38:58,744 --> 00:39:00,951
What are you going to do with Ji Ah?

610
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:04,671
I just reached the child's father so he's on his way.

611
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:07,731
Whether he knew about this or not, he let this happen to this point.

612
00:39:07,731 --> 00:39:09,911
And you're going to have him take the child?

613
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:13,021
But it's better to be with family than go to a facility...

614
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:16,331
What did you just say?

615
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:20,421
Ms. Yang Soo Mi, you'll have to go down to the station with us.

616
00:39:20,421 --> 00:39:22,711
Ji Ah will stay with her father for now...

617
00:39:22,711 --> 00:39:24,001
No!

618
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,951
I can't send her to that moron!

619
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:28,421
Ji Ah! Ji Ah!

620
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:31,281
Wait...

621
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,701
Get away! Don't touch my Ji Ah!

622
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:36,141
Don't you...

623
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:38,251
Don't you dare touch my child...

624
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,161
I'll kill you all!

625
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:42,091
Ma'am!

626
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:45,561
Don't mess with my child!

627
00:39:47,691 --> 00:39:49,411
It was you, huh?

628
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:51,901
It was you, huh?

629
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,181
You planned all this, huh?

630
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,921
You plotted with that moron and are trying to take away my child.

631
00:39:57,921 --> 00:39:59,251
Mom!

632
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:01,930
I'll kill you all!

633
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:03,435
Let go of the knife!

634
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,633
Let go of the knife!

635
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:10,715
Kim Jeong Ho!

636
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:14,355
It's okay.

637
00:40:27,782 --> 00:40:29,155
Okay, you're all done.

638
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:30,565
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

639
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:32,405
Thank you, Doctor.

640
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:34,375
Are you okay?

641
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:39,935
So why did you step forward like that? The cop was there!

642
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:44,655
How can you expect not to get wet when you're standing next to a storm?

643
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:47,605
What are you talking about?

644
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:55,895
How about the child?

645
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:59,575
Her name is Soo Ah. Yoon Soo Ah.

646
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:02,375
She's been gone for two days already.

647
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:08,055
As you said, she probably snuck out of that window on the balcony.

648
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:11,605
She ran away, risking her life, and came into our cafe,

649
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,625
and I had no idea...

650
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:30,125
Do you have your medicine?

651
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:35,200
♫  After the long rain passed through  ♫

652
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:43,120
♫  That seemed like it would never stop  ♫

653
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:51,320
♫  I think of the expression on your face you could not hide  ♫

654
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,545
♫  I fall into deep thoughts  ♫

655
00:41:55,545 --> 00:42:01,965
♫  Empty streets, my heart disturbed  ♫

656
00:42:01,965 --> 00:42:09,400
♫  I don't think it's dry from the rain yet  ♫

657
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:16,775
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

658
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:22,935
♫  Like the snowfall from early dawn  ♫

659
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:24,815
The police are out looking for her.

660
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:26,475
They'll find her soon.

661
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:31,020
How far could that little child go?

662
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:37,775
Makes me angry, Jeong Ho.

663
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:42,380
I know.

664
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,850
   

665
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,365
Director Jeong,

666
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,185
I was wondering if you could look into something for me.

667
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,835
No, not about that.

668
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:56,925
A child is missing right now.

669
00:42:56,925 --> 00:43:00,885
Hongsan Police Station is the local precinct.

670
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:03,385
The child's name is Yoon Soo Ah.

671
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:05,745
Soo Ah.

672
00:43:05,745 --> 00:43:08,255
 Prosecutor, at 11 a.m., 

673
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:12,225
 I'll meet you at Golden Path, which is on the tenth floor of the Daehan Building. 

674
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:27,565
When you called me yesterday,

675
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,845
he happened to have summoned me then...

676
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:35,005
Then have a nice time, the two of you. It's been a while.

677
00:43:43,265 --> 00:43:45,015
So this is how you exercise your power these days, huh?

678
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:48,425
Unless I do this, I can't even see the face of my one and only son.

679
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,535
What could I do?

680
00:43:50,535 --> 00:43:52,325
Have a seat.

681
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,425
You even avoid your mom's calls.

682
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:09,025
Are you going to cut the ties between parent and child forever?

683
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:12,795
I didn't take even the underwear you paid for when I moved out.

684
00:44:12,795 --> 00:44:15,965
I guess you still haven't gotten the message?

685
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:18,485
That's not the only thing I gave you, though.

686
00:44:18,485 --> 00:44:20,265
That's why I don't do anything.

687
00:44:20,265 --> 00:44:25,985
I don't want to use anything you gave me.

688
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:40,065
But I guess doing this won't cut the family ties.

689
00:44:40,065 --> 00:44:44,945
When Mother married you, she packed up her things and left the Dohan family.

690
00:44:45,665 --> 00:44:48,945
But still, as a son-in-law of the Dohan family,

691
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:50,715
you still got promoted as the chief prosecutor.

692
00:44:50,715 --> 00:44:54,475
You must be using me as an excuse for your life.

693
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:57,045
If you think I'm that wrong, then correct the wrong and take me down.

694
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:58,865
Then what could I do?

695
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:00,785
You speak of prosecution reformation in front of people,

696
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:03,405
yet you overlook your in-law's corruption. If I take after you,

697
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:07,205
I'd just end up being a hypocrite no matter what I do.

698
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,165
I'll just get going.

699
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:17,165
Sit down.

700
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:20,165
Eat before you go.

701
00:45:21,335 --> 00:45:23,525
I'm sorry.

702
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,955
I don't think I could eat.

703
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:37,245
I can't refuse the Chief Prosecutor's request when I'm just a mere investigator.

704
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:40,275
And it's not just any request, but he wanted to see his son.

705
00:45:40,275 --> 00:45:42,245
- It was such a humane— 
 - How about what I asked you?

706
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:45,305
Of course, I have it. Here you go.

707
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:49,735
That mother has a record of abusing her children three years ago.

708
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:52,965
Yes. So the children were at a shelter temporarily

709
00:45:52,965 --> 00:45:55,285
and lived with a foster family for about six months.

710
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,855
Then the charges against the mother were suspended

711
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:01,575
and the children were returned to their family of origin.

712
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:07,985
Ahjussi...

713
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:13,325
It's because I have something to tell the lawyer unni.

714
00:46:38,055 --> 00:46:40,095
Ji Ah,

715
00:46:40,095 --> 00:46:44,665
didn't you come over to say something to me?

716
00:46:46,925 --> 00:46:48,975
Last time,

717
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:51,855
that ahjussi in a tracksuit

718
00:46:51,855 --> 00:46:55,195
said you're a lawyer, so

719
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:57,325
if I have any difficult problems,

720
00:46:57,325 --> 00:47:02,105
I can look for you and ask you for help.

721
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:05,275
That's right, Ji Ah.

722
00:47:06,795 --> 00:47:08,325
I wonder what kind of

723
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:13,325
difficult problem Ji Ah has that you came to see me.

724
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,765
I...

725
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:20,475
know where Kongjui* went to. 
  (From Korean folk tale, a Cinderella-like figure) 

726
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:22,995
Kongjui?

727
00:47:22,995 --> 00:47:27,205
As in Kongjui and Patjui*? That Kongjui? 
  (From Korean folk tale, a daughter of stepmom) 

728
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:31,725
I see.

729
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:37,515
So, Ji Ah, you know where Kongjui is.

730
00:47:37,515 --> 00:47:39,825
But...

731
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:42,625
if I tell you that,

732
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:47,175
Kongjui has to come back home.

733
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:50,365
Even though Patjui and...

734
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:54,335
Patjui's mom will continue to torment her.

735
00:47:57,455 --> 00:47:59,955
Our Ji Ah...

736
00:47:59,955 --> 00:48:01,615
You're afraid that

737
00:48:01,615 --> 00:48:06,875
Kongjui might have to return to a scary home if we found Kongjui.

738
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:10,015
But Ji Ah,

739
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:12,985
don't you think Patjui was scared, too?

740
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:16,535
Watching Kongjui get into trouble all the time,

741
00:48:16,535 --> 00:48:20,545
I'm sure Patjui was so scared that she'd be in trouble too.

742
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:22,355
Right?

743
00:48:41,145 --> 00:48:43,535
Children who are victims of abuse

744
00:48:43,535 --> 00:48:47,295
have not experienced another world besides the one with their family.

745
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:51,725
So they usually don't realize that they're being abused.

746
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:55,525
The fact that the person who should love them the most is hurting them.

747
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:58,595
How could a child understand that easily?

748
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:07,505
Unni said she'd go first, and if she finds Uncles' house,

749
00:49:07,505 --> 00:49:10,305
she said she'll come back for me.

750
00:49:10,305 --> 00:49:12,425
Uncle?

751
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:15,375
When we lived there, we didn't get in trouble

752
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,975
and ate yummy food every day.

753
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:21,965
Then Ji Ah, do you know where Uncle's house is?

754
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:23,555
I don't know.

755
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:26,135
But Unni said...

756
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:28,975
it's far there...

757
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:32,725
so she said she needs to money to go there.

758
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:36,145
 Have you seen my wallet? 

759
00:49:36,145 --> 00:49:37,545
 I'm sure I left it here yesterday. 

760
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:40,415
 She kept stealing money... 

761
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:43,535
 I did this just once to teach her a lesson. 

762
00:49:43,535 --> 00:49:45,695
 I'm sorry... 

763
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:48,305
I think Soo Ah took my wallet.

764
00:49:48,305 --> 00:49:50,915
I looked, and right before I reported the card lost,

765
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:54,005
I noticed that it was used in a market in the area. So I'm headed there.

766
00:49:54,005 --> 00:49:55,075
Where is that?

767
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,805
342-4 Gangyeon-dong.

768
00:49:56,805 --> 00:49:57,885
Gangyeon-dong?

769
00:49:57,885 --> 00:50:01,135
If it's Gangyeon-dong, it's near their foster parents' home.

770
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:02,135
Foster parents?

771
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:06,495
Yeah, I guess the two of them were sent to a foster family for about six months.

772
00:50:06,495 --> 00:50:08,335
Then "Uncle's house" means...

773
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:10,745
I think she was talking about that foster family.

774
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:12,385
342-4 Gangyeon-dong.

775
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:15,055
I'll tell the police now and head over there.

776
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,185
I'll meet you there.

777
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:18,435
But...

778
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:21,855
Soo Ah and Ji Ah, who have lived outside of their family, found out.

779
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,545
That they could run away.

780
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:26,685
That their home is not the only world.

781
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:29,125
- Hello, Sir. 
 - Hi. 
    

782
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,305
By chance, did this girl stop by here a few days ago?

783
00:50:31,305 --> 00:50:32,455
- That way? 
 - Yes.

784
00:50:32,455 --> 00:50:34,405
Did you find out anything?

785
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:37,305
Have you seen this child?

786
00:50:37,305 --> 00:50:39,325
No.

787
00:50:39,325 --> 00:50:42,805
Hello, by chance, have you seen this child?

788
00:50:42,805 --> 00:50:44,585
Let's go there.

789
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:47,055
Wow, it's so fun!

790
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:51,965
Wow! I'm going on again!

791
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:56,155
Soo Ah!

792
00:50:58,235 --> 00:51:00,375
Soo Ah!

793
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,475
Yoon Soo Ah!

794
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:04,105
This spot might not be it, though.

795
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:07,195
No, he said he definitely saw her coming this way.

796
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:08,955
Soo Ah!

797
00:51:08,955 --> 00:51:11,255
Yoon Soo Ah!

798
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:13,245
Soo Ah!

799
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:17,725
- Yoon Soo Ah! 
 - Kim Yoo Ri.

800
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:18,475
What did they say?

801
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,835
I guess the foster family moved.

802
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:24,105
So they're looking around their current address.

803
00:51:25,845 --> 00:51:27,765
But haven't found anything yet...

804
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:39,245
- Let's go home for now. 
 - No.

805
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:41,705
I reported my card lost three days ago already.

806
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:44,415
I'm sure Soo Ah hasn't eaten anything since then.

807
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:47,495
I had no cash in my wallet, either. We have to find her soon.

808
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:48,845
Soo Ah!

809
00:51:48,845 --> 00:51:51,075
- Yoon Soo Ah! 
 - Hey—

810
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:53,705
Yoon Soo Ah! Soo Ah!

811
00:51:57,585 --> 00:51:59,925
Yoon Soo Ah!

812
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:01,935
Soo Ah!

813
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:08,205
What are you doing?

814
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:11,665
Searching for someone with your foot like this?

815
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:13,915
This is nothing!

816
00:52:13,915 --> 00:52:18,405
Had I reported to the police on the day I saw Soo Ah, this wouldn't have happened.

817
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:21,185
I was rambling on about seeing a ghost and whatnot...

818
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:29,485
We've got the police looking for her.

819
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:34,955
You don't need to add your self-blame on top of it.

820
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:52,495
Soo Ah!

821
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:55,865
Soo Ah!

822
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:00,415
Soo Ah, I won't go closer to you.

823
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:02,605
I'll stay right here.

824
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:17,125
Oh, yeah...

825
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:19,325
I know you, Soo Ah.

826
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:21,965
But you don't know me, huh?

827
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:24,175
I'm Kim Yoo Ri.

828
00:53:24,175 --> 00:53:26,415
The owner of this cafe.

829
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,665
I know.

830
00:53:28,665 --> 00:53:30,625
The pretty unni.

831
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,925
You know me?

832
00:53:35,775 --> 00:53:37,985
Soo Ah, what's wrong?

833
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:39,885
I'm...

834
00:53:39,885 --> 00:53:41,795
I'm sorry...

835
00:53:41,795 --> 00:53:44,195
What are you sorry for?

836
00:53:45,465 --> 00:53:47,735
Is it because of the wallet?

837
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:49,255
Soo Ah, it's okay!

838
00:53:49,255 --> 00:53:51,665
I'm not angry at all!

839
00:53:51,665 --> 00:53:52,975
For real.

840
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:57,465
I'm fine as long as you bought some yummy food with that.

841
00:53:57,465 --> 00:54:00,165
I'm not angry at all. Really.

842
00:54:03,215 --> 00:54:07,845
My Soo Ah, I heard you were headed to your uncle's.

843
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:13,405
Do you want me and this ahjussi to take you to your uncle's?

844
00:54:13,405 --> 00:54:16,445
Do you know my uncle?

845
00:54:16,445 --> 00:54:23,195
I'll buy you tasty food and take you to your uncle's safely.

846
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:26,075
Come here.

847
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:36,925
I'm going to go home.

848
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:41,365
You don't have to go home, Soo Ah.

849
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:44,295
You get scared when you go home.

850
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:49,335
I have to go and get my younger sister.

851
00:54:49,335 --> 00:54:54,535
Without me, Ji Ah will get into trouble instead.

852
00:54:55,465 --> 00:55:00,095
My Soo Ah... are you afraid that Ji Ah will get into trouble?

853
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,025
Is that why you came home?

854
00:55:05,195 --> 00:55:07,715
Good girl, Soo Ah.

855
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:10,345
But Soo Ah,

856
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:12,295
if you want...

857
00:55:12,295 --> 00:55:14,375
you and...

858
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,165
Ji Ah together...

859
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:20,165
you don't have to go home again. I can help you.

860
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:23,805
Just like the Uncle's house that you stayed at last time,

861
00:55:23,805 --> 00:55:26,765
so that you can go to a safe and warm place...

862
00:55:26,765 --> 00:55:29,765
I can help you.

863
00:55:29,765 --> 00:55:32,555
Would you like that, Soo Ah?

864
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:39,495
Let's go get Ji Ah with me. Come over here.

865
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:56,115
♫  I endured and struggled through the day  ♫

866
00:55:56,115 --> 00:55:58,185
 We found this out later. 

867
00:55:58,185 --> 00:56:04,145
She had a bicycle lock around her neck and lived while trapped on the balcony all day.

868
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:06,225
 When her mom fell asleep, 

869
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:10,565
 she snuck out through a window and came outside. 

870
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:13,945
♫  This too shall pass  ♫

871
00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:17,885
♫  Walk with me  ♫

872
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:25,160
♫  Let's breathe deeply and cry it out  ♫

873
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:32,015
♫  I will stay by your side now  ♫

874
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:35,835
♫  I will hold your hand  ♫

875
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:41,255
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

876
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:46,755
 I guess she came out like that every night and snuck into Yoo Ri's cafe. 

877
00:56:46,755 --> 00:56:53,380
♫  Be brave and just like you did before  ♫

878
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,635
♫  Look at me and smile  ♫

879
00:56:56,635 --> 00:56:58,755
 We have no customers. That's why we're here like this. 

880
00:56:58,755 --> 00:57:02,395
 I said I'd open it, but he didn't want to. 

881
00:57:02,395 --> 00:57:03,715
Why is it me?

882
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:05,135
Because we're friends.

883
00:57:05,135 --> 00:57:08,415
♫  This too shall pass  ♫

884
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:10,695
 When we asked her later, 

885
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:16,545
she said because it was warm.

886
00:57:16,545 --> 00:57:18,865
That cold stairwell.

887
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:23,465
♫  I will stay by your side now  ♫

888
00:57:23,465 --> 00:57:26,555
Soo Ah, drink it.

889
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:31,295
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

890
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:33,935
- Soo Ah! 
 - Soo Ah!

891
00:57:33,935 --> 00:57:37,485
Uncle!

892
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:44,505
♫  Be brave and just like you did before  ♫

893
00:57:44,505 --> 00:57:48,225
♫  Look at me and smile  ♫

894
00:57:48,225 --> 00:57:54,075
♫  The glance that is like the light  ♫

895
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:59,825
♫  You're looking at me, who feels much better  ♫

896
00:57:59,825 --> 00:58:08,750
♫  Just like that, you can stand up like you're doing now  ♫

897
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,325
Don't cry...

898
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:18,525
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you all right?

899
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:22,175
Soo Ah, don't cry.

900
00:58:22,175 --> 00:58:24,760
Don't cry.

901
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,925
 When the intimate world of family crumbles, people think 

902
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,855
they've also broken down irreparably.

903
00:58:35,855 --> 00:58:40,795
But the family is only a part of you.

904
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:42,835
They're not your everything.

905
00:58:42,835 --> 00:58:45,705
♫  Look at me and smile  ♫

906
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:47,955
 At times, no matter how much you love them, 

907
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:51,090
 you have to pursue happiness independently of each other. 

908
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,880
 At times, you have to escape them in order to find a way. 

909
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:11,635
   

910
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:14,095
 At a construction site in Gyeonggi-do, 

911
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:16,315
- I'm here. 
  - a tower crane broke down... 

912
00:59:16,315 --> 00:59:19,755
Gosh, I thought I was going to die while abstaining from alcohol.

913
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:24,005
 Dohan Construction had six workers die last year as well from a tower crane accident. 

914
00:59:24,005 --> 00:59:26,345
You threw money at the Ministry of Employment and Labor and the industrial complex.

915
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:28,455
The Prosecutors' Office has sniffed everything and is investigating all that.

916
00:59:28,455 --> 00:59:30,025
And what now?

917
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,075
The tower crane breaks down?

918
00:59:32,075 --> 00:59:35,295
How come everything you do falls flat on your face?

919
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:39,135
Well, the nature of cover-up is like that, you know.

920
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,265
When I have to bury something, then I have to create trouble.

921
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:44,385
If I have to bury another, cause another trouble.

922
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:45,435
Bury, then cause trouble. Bury, then cause trouble.

923
00:59:45,435 --> 00:59:48,065
But you know... not to worry.

924
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:51,075
That chief prosecutor is our family.

925
00:59:51,075 --> 00:59:51,985
Could anything happen?

926
00:59:51,985 --> 00:59:54,855
Did you ever see Kim Seung Woon listen to us?

927
00:59:56,705 --> 00:59:58,015
Aigoo, my blood pressure...

928
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,985
Aigoo, my blood pressure...

929
01:00:02,275 --> 01:00:05,575
In any case, they will follow the tracks, like the sweet potato stems.

930
01:00:05,575 --> 01:00:07,235
Don't let me get mixed up in it.

931
01:00:07,235 --> 01:00:09,385
Be sure to take care of it at your level. Got that?

932
01:00:09,385 --> 01:00:11,305
Yes, got it...

933
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:13,485
- Father! 
 - You, you!

934
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,245
I told you not to call me that!

935
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:17,295
- Daddy? 
 - Y-You!

936
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:18,965
But come on...

937
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:23,155
You're even taking a part of my liver yet you won't let me call you father.

938
01:00:23,155 --> 01:00:24,925
That's too mean.

939
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:30,985
Chairman, did you sleep well?

940
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:32,565
How do you feel?

941
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:33,805
All the numbers look good.

942
01:00:33,805 --> 01:00:36,045
Hurry up and operate on me if you're going to.

943
01:00:36,045 --> 01:00:38,015
How long will you lock me up in here?

944
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,365
All that's left is your surgery now.

945
01:00:40,365 --> 01:00:41,775
Your son is ready as well.

946
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:44,385
I said he's not my son!

947
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:46,695
Why keep saying "son, son"?

948
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:50,445
Y-You laugh?

949
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:52,535
This bastard...

950
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:08,125
 If you don't escape them in time, you may continue to be miserable. 

951
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:11,005
So if your family or anyone for that matter

952
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:14,165
cause misery for you, run away.

953
01:01:14,165 --> 01:01:18,445
Because of idiots who cannot distinguish between love and violence,

954
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:21,585
you should not be miserable forever.

955
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,370
   

956
01:01:54,155 --> 01:01:55,925
Aren't you leaving?

957
01:02:09,495 --> 01:02:15,105
♫  I guess I recognize your laughter  ♫

958
01:02:15,105 --> 01:02:17,785
♫  She's waking me up with that pretty smile  ♫

959
01:02:17,785 --> 01:02:21,355
Let's just stay like this for a moment.

960
01:02:22,885 --> 01:02:24,315
Hey...

961
01:02:24,315 --> 01:02:26,095
Why...

962
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:28,180
Don't live in misery.

963
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:31,090
♫ Do you know I am like this? ♫

964
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:34,520
Did I hassle you once again?

965
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,410
♫  In the blowing wind  ♫

966
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,550
No, it's okay.

967
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,615
♫  My heart  ♫

968
01:02:42,615 --> 01:02:45,975
It's okay to hassle me over stuff like this anytime.

969
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:48,785
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

970
01:02:48,785 --> 01:02:54,495
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

971
01:02:54,495 --> 01:03:01,675
♫  Like the wind, it blows without ending  ♫

972
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:03,535
I want to kiss you.

973
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:07,095
- What? 
 - Should I repeat it?

974
01:03:07,095 --> 01:03:09,820
- I want to kiss— 
 - Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

975
01:03:11,575 --> 01:03:14,705
You and I... I told you...

976
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:15,825
Brother and sister.

977
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:18,205
We're like family.

978
01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:22,980
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

979
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,550
♫  I wanna fall in love  ♫

980
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,355
I don't want to be family with you.

981
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:30,625
I want to be someone else to you.

982
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:33,995
Well, that's...

983
01:03:33,995 --> 01:03:37,770
not something you could become just because you want to...

984
01:03:38,635 --> 01:03:43,135
♫  Like that night sky  ♫

985
01:03:51,545 --> 01:03:54,600
♫  Like the spring breeze  ♫

986
01:04:03,825 --> 01:04:08,535
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

987
01:04:08,535 --> 01:04:14,215
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

988
01:04:14,215 --> 01:04:20,265
♫  Like the wind, it blows without ending  ♫

989
01:04:20,265 --> 01:04:24,225
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

990
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:29,140
♫  The wind blows toward me  ♫

991
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:37,425


992
01:04:37,425 --> 01:04:42,625
♫  Like the spring breeze  ♫

993
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:45,375
♫  You know, I like you  ♫

994
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:48,865
   

995
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:49,965
 Wait, wait, wait, wait! 

996
01:04:49,965 --> 01:04:52,285
 Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! 

997
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,285
 Y-You! What are you doing? 

998
01:04:54,285 --> 01:04:56,795
 I really hate to confuse people. 

999
01:04:56,795 --> 01:04:57,645
 Hey! 

1000
01:04:57,645 --> 01:05:00,635
 You do that when you're 99% sure about the other person's feelings. 

1001
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,505
 - Can I kiss you? 
 - What the hell? 

1002
01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:04,945
 Who pursues a person so rudely? 

1003
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:05,985
 I love it so much. 

1004
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,635
 How can we play with her... 

1005
01:05:07,635 --> 01:05:09,295
 - Get over here! 
 - Hey, Yoo Ri! 

1006
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:10,845
 Oh, no. Kim Yoo Ri! 

1007
01:05:10,845 --> 01:05:13,935
 That Kim Yoo Ri. Is she yours? 

1008
01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:18,395
 Don't mess with people around me. 

1009
01:05:18,395 --> 01:05:21,200
♫  More than you...  ♫
