1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,508
   

2
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:35,178
So from the middle,

3
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:39,098
slowly circle your way outward.

4
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:41,098
Slowly, do it slower.

5
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:43,300
Welcome...

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,500


7
00:01:16,848 --> 00:01:23,248
 Therefore, the court declares Defendant Lee Pyun Woong not guilty. 

8
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:35,308
Oh, wow.

9
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,608
Well, this...

10
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:40,398
I had this bouquet made with the most beautiful flowers I could gather,

11
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,738
but... in front of you, Attorney...

12
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:46,018
they're just pieces of grass...

13
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,168
Just throw this out.

14
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:54,298
I'll introduce myself for the first time.

15
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:58,688
I am the CEO of Dohan Construction, Lee Pyun Woong.

16
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:06,748
Lee Pyun Woong...

17
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:08,668
Excuse me.

18
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:14,858
Hey! What the...

19
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:16,638
Prosecutor!

20
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:20,858
How are you here, Prosecutor?

21
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:38,338
Wow, this coffee is... ridiculously good.

22
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:41,758
Attorney, you didn't add any drugs to this, right?

23
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:47,018
Why did you come to our cafe?

24
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:52,588
You came by our company last time

25
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:56,688
so I was planning on coming by to say hello.

26
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:02,148
I seem to remember that you sent someone last time to "say hello."

27
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:07,178
You must have mistaken someone else for me.

28
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:14,858
I mean, there must be many people who would want to get to know you

29
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:20,208
seeing... how beautiful you are and...

30
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,588
- how well you do your job... 
 - What's your purpose for being here?

31
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:25,568
Man, that was good timing. I almost overstepped the line!

32
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,908
So the reason why I came was

33
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:33,968
because I wanted to ask Attorney Kim to come work for me.

34
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:36,198
I personally came for this.

35
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:40,078
I am quite sincere when it comes to hiring talented individuals.

36
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,208
You're already getting consultation from Hwang and Goo,

37
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,738
and I know that you have excellent lawyers working for your company.

38
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:46,588
But you pretty much crushed them all...

39
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,508
Those excellent, talented individuals.

40
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,578
Whenever someone crushes me,

41
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:53,078
I really want to make that person my own.

42
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:57,038
And that's why I also came to you, Prosecutor Kim, right?

43
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:04,038
What are you saying right now?

44
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:06,008
When Prosecutor Kim was in the Special Prosecution Unit,

45
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:08,438
there was a time when he thoroughly investigated Dohan Construction.

46
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:10,878
So when I heard that he quit his job,

47
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,868
I immediately sought him out and begged him to work with me. Isn't that right?

48
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:23,388
In any case, what do you think, Attorney Kim?

49
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,108
About working with me?

50
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:33,018
CEO, there'd be no chance I'd work for Dohan Construction, even if a knife is held to my neck.

51
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:36,148
Why not? Because it's the company that killed your dad?

52
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,388
Of course, I would at least do that much research

53
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,138
since it's a matter of bringing someone to my side.

54
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:45,468
But that happened because your father did something wrong!

55
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,378
Hey! Hey! Let go of me.

56
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,608
Where do you think this is that you dare step foot in here?

57
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,998
How dare you make sloppy threats like that!

58
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,988
Wait, wait, wait.

59
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,188
Hey, come on.

60
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:09,018
Jeong Ho, what do you mean by "threats"? I really meant it.

61
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,538
I came by to sincerely ask her to work with me.

62
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:15,008
- What kind of BS is that? 
 - I know, right? What kind of BS is this?

63
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,218
Oh, my bad.

64
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:20,858
But Jeong Ho, I thought about it really hard after you came by.

65
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:23,478
I guess the history between you two began all the way back in high school.

66
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:30,138
Does that mean you liked that girl all the way from high school...

67
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,838
Oh, my. What is this?

68
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:37,278
What? Is that why you're so against Dohan Construction?

69
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:41,928
Because it's the company that killed the father of the girl you love?

70
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:44,738
Say one more word, and I'll kill you.

71
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:49,428
S***, I'm getting death threats from my f***ing nephew.

72
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:51,548
But Jeong Ho,

73
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:55,558
do you think Attorney Kim will like you

74
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:02,338
even after finding out what messed-up family ties we have?

75
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,578
Oh, CEO!

76
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,588
You!

77
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,438
Hey, am I bleeding?

78
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:15,058
Yes...

79
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:19,848
Man, these gangster bastards.

80
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:26,268
Remember. You started this.

81
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:38,758
What did that son of a b**** say?

82
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,548
Let's sit down first and talk.

83
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:43,118
Let me smash all of this first.

84
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:46,808
I think I just got done in by him, right?

85
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:48,828
I got done in by that crazy bastard, right?

86
00:06:48,828 --> 00:06:51,478
Why is that so important?

87
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:56,348
Oh, Boss! Are you okay?

88
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,933
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri.

89
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,834
Breathe! Breathe deeply.

90
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,878
Wait, you have a fever.

91
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:07,668
Everybody has a little bit of excess body heat.

92
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:11,168
This isn't going to work. Let's go home. Don't work today.

93
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:14,148
What he said about you investigating Dohan Construction when you were a prosecutor...

94
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:16,058
Is that true?

95
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:20,528
Is that the reason why you quit your job as a prosecutor?

96
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,358
No.

97
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:29,088
It's not?

98
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:39,328
   

99
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:43,968
   

100
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:49,968
Is she all right?

101
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,008
No.

102
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,988
Not at all.

103
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,258
What are you doing right now?

104
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,418
I feel like I just became weak.

105
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:02,138
It is in these moments that I need to reinforce myself.

106
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,878
Let go. Let go! I am the boss! Let go!

107
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:14,068
Let go of me! Are you not letting go?

108
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:16,648
38.7 degrees Celsius*. 
  (101.66 degrees Fahrenheit) 

109
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:18,328
If your fever rises, you need to go to the ER.

110
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:19,468
Yes, Boss.

111
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:22,218
Please listen to us. Your face...

112
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,678
looks like a tiger.

113
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:28,008
Lie down, lie down!

114
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:36,418
Just because that moron came by, I end up lying down sick like this...

115
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,668
This hurts my pride...

116
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:42,268
There's no need for you not to get sick from seeing that bastard.

117
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,748
If I come back later and your fever didn't drop,

118
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:55,868
I am going to drag you to the hospital.

119
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,088
That's nice of you...

120
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,238
Makes me want to misconstrue that...

121
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:03,378
Dragging! I'm going to be dragging you.

122
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:05,848
I'll watch over the cafe for you,

123
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:10,018
so just shut your mouth and rest, please!

124
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:27,158
 When Prosecutor Kim was in the Special Prosecutions Unit, 

125
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:30,588
 there was a time when he thoroughly investigated Dohan Construction. 

126
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:47,438
I really don't know what he's thinking...

127
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:57,778
 Try reading it. 

128
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:00,508
 You'll probably find it entertaining, too. 

129
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:15,228
All right. Put something underneath the pot!

130
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:18,108
- Put something underneath. 
 - Okay, okay.

131
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:20,868
Okay, let's take a look.

132
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,888
Oh, my God, that looks delicious!

133
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,628
- Let me try some, too. 
 - It came out well.

134
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,268
- That looks good. 
 - So...

135
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:34,078
if he's a prosecutor 
  (T/N: the word prosecutor sounds similar to swordsman) 

136
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,198
do you mean someone who does kendo?

137
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:38,328
No, no. A prosecutor.

138
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:40,358
Like when we say prosecutor and judge.

139
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,548
Whom?

140
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:44,578
- The landlord living on the rooftop? 
 - Yes!

141
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:49,128
I really almost believed you!

142
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:54,538
Gosh, stop saying crazy things like that!

143
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:56,418
It's true.

144
00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:58,078
Here! Take a look at this.

145
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,488
He entered law school at the top of his class at a young age.

146
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,138
He even graduated from the training institute at the top of his class...

147
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:05,088
He is pretty much a legend.

148
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:11,698
But then why...

149
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:15,438
is he wearing a tracksuit and living like that?

150
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:19,238
So to the staff of the district office...

151
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:22,198
"You motherf***er! Do I look like a f***ing b**** to you?"

152
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,008
"You do your job like that? Are you looking down on me?"

153
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:25,628
"This bastard must think I'm a f***ing retard!"

154
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:28,708
"He keeps acting like I'm ignorant, this f***ing bastard."

155
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,398
And like that, you picked up the printer and threw it on the floor.

156
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,688
And after that, "This little s***!"

157
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:36,268
"He keeps thinking I'm dumb!"

158
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:37,898
"Maybe I'll just kill you all!"

159
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,798
"Tell your manager to come out here!"

160
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:41,248
Saying things like that,

161
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:44,708
you continued to pour out verbal abuse. Is that right?

162
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,068
Y-Y-Y-Yes...

163
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:51,698
First, based on Article 311 of the Criminal Code, this would be considered contempt.

164
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,688
Also, based on Article 136 of the Criminal Code, it would be obstruction of performing official duties.

165
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:58,708
Finally, based on Article 366 of the Criminal Code, it would also constitute property damage.

166
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,368
I am really regretting my actions.

167
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,568
You think you can be forgiven just because you regret it?

168
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:05,388
Society isn't kindergarten, you know.

169
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:06,918
Next!

170
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:12,338
You were sued for assault because you poured coffee on your daughter-in-law to be?

171
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:16,668
Come on, it's not like I hit the girl or anything like that!

172
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:19,318
Was the coffee hot?

173
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,768
It was a cold one.

174
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:23,888
- What did she say? 
 - She said it was a cold one, a cold one.

175
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:28,228
That's unfortunate.

176
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:31,608
- If it was a hot one, we could have added the crime of bodily injury. 
 - Wait, what?

177
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:34,678
If you don't want to be sentenced to prison for up to two years or pay a fine of up to five million won,

178
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:38,028
beg on your knees for forgiveness and settle this before it gets to court.

179
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:40,228
Is being a mother-in-law entitle you to do such things?

180
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,498
Next!

181
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:43,768
You drank and drove, and you're acting like you did nothing wrong?

182
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:45,428
Are you blaming alcohol for your actions?

183
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:48,898
Just pay the city hall what they ask of you, whether it be a ginkgo tree or a willow tree.

184
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:50,438
Next!

185
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,168
If you're going to run a business like that, just give it up. Next!

186
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:58,931
- I feel bad. 
 - Extremely bad.

187
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:03,638
Just don't live like that!

188
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:05,098
Next! Next.

189
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,618
Next. Next!

190
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:09,648
- God! 
 - Wow...

191
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:12,168
Even though it was like that, he shouldn't have said it like that.

192
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,188
Both of you, too, please leave!

193
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:15,938
You didn't even buy any coffee while you were here.

194
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:19,448
Geez, my gosh, I'm so tired.

195
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:22,388
Kim Yoo Ri, why are you doing this? Goodness.

196
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:29,638
All right.

197
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:40,258
Nice and warm.

198
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:42,908
When does the boss lady come back?

199
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,888
Is she very sick?

200
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:46,718
Tell her to come back quickly.

201
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:49,318
Even if you say all the right things but say them so rudely like that,

202
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:52,118
this cafe will go out of business.

203
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:54,338
It's going to go out of business.

204
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,098
What is this atmosphere...

205
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:05,538
Hyungnim, you haven't even done this for half the day,

206
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:08,088
and there are already five bad reviews.

207
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,768
"The attorney doesn't take your side but just rebukes you."

208
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:13,558
I'd take their side if I could. I've only told them the facts.

209
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:17,838
"It felt like I was receiving a sentence from a prosecutor, not a consultation."

210
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,078
That was another review.

211
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:22,718
"The way he is wearing a tracksuit for a consultation demonstrates his trashy attitude."

212
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,788
There was this review as well.

213
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:29,218
Hey, Barista! You always seem to speak to me rather informally, without respect.

214
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:33,668
Yes, I don't tend to respect and use honorifics to those who speak to others informally.

215
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:35,718
Oh, really?

216
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:39,378
I also don't use honorifics with people with criminal records.

217
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,998
Okay, everyone! Let's just stop here!

218
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:43,918
Oh, wow! These eggs are here!

219
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:46,378
Eggs. Let's eat eggs.

220
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:50,148
Do you guys do consultations today?

221
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:16,538
   

222
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,058
So you sold a fishing rod in your house

223
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:32,468
on a bargaining app without permission for 30,000 won.

224
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:35,468
But it turns out it was worth two million won, is that right?

225
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,698
Yes...

226
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:39,858
Since you sold an object that is not your own,

227
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:44,618
based on Article 329 of the Criminal Code, you would be considered guilty of theft.

228
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:47,328
But the owner of the fishing rod was your father, right?

229
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,538
Yes.

230
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,851
In a case like that, the Special Exception for Family Relatives applies,

231
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,531
so you wouldn't have any legal problems-

232
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,258
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

233
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,888
Where is she going again?

234
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,368
Man, where is she going!

235
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,438
Wow! Where are you going?

236
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:08,338
Hey, your boss escaped and is heading somewhere again!

237
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,618
Even if the Boss does that, you should not leave your post!

238
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:13,698
Hey! I'm here so that I can let your boss rest!

239
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:15,448
- If not for that, why would I be here doing this? 
 - Whatever, whatever!

240
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:17,258
Ahjussi!

241
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:20,618
That boss is not important right now!

242
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:22,708
What are you going to do about the fishing rod?

243
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:27,428
If my dad finds out, I'm going to be dead!

244
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:28,438
Well...

245
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,348
Come on, go back inside. She's crying because of you, Hyungnim.

246
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,318
Was I the one who sold the fishing rod?

247
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:34,418
   

248
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,578
CEO, what is this? Who wrote it? 
    

249
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:43,828
   

250
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,978
Who wrote it?

251
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:50,888
My employees suspected you first.

252
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:54,178
But looking at your face, it appears that is not the case.

253
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,748
Are all the contents in here true?

254
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,778
The pen name of the author is Whee-seul-Blower.

255
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,608
A whistleblower.

256
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:07,838
Because it is a novel, how much of it you believe is up to you.

257
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,178
But you never know...

258
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,278
if someone who was an insider really wrote it.

259
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:19,408
These are the pictures taken by someone following the publishing company's CEO.

260
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:23,218
He used to run a big private investigation business in Munrae-dong,

261
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:26,018
but he shut down his detective agency in 2018

262
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:28,428
and started a publishing company.

263
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:31,538
But before that, he was once charged with fraud,

264
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:34,698
and the prosecutor on the case was Prosecutor Kim Jeong Ho.

265
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:38,198
I found him...

266
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:43,588
Our whistleblower.

267
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:48,288
   

268
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,518
Give back my fishing rod.

269
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:18,038
They say that the contract between you and me is void, Ahjussi!

270
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:19,708
What are you talking about?

271
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,988
You wrote it on the Carrot World post!

272
00:18:21,988 --> 00:18:24,188
"Absolutely no refunds!"

273
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,628
Life is like that! Once you play your hand, you can't take it back!

274
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,698
Wait, wait. Hold on a minute.

275
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:31,348
If the cards were distributed incorrectly from the start,

276
00:18:31,348 --> 00:18:36,218
isn't it a bit embarrassing to be talking about not taking back cards that you've played?

277
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,898
What did you just say?

278
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:40,718
Article 104 of the Civil Code of the Republic of Korea states,

279
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:42,728
"Any legal action that has blatantly become unfair"

280
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:45,938
"due to the party's plight, rashness, or inexperience shall be considered invalid."

281
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,938
Also, Article 105 of the Civil Code states, "When a minor participates in a legal act,"

282
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,968
"they must receive the approval of their legal representative."

283
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:55,128
"Any legal act that violates the provisions of the preceding paragraph... can be revoked."

284
00:18:55,128 --> 00:18:58,268
So what my hyungnim is saying is

285
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,268
the bargaining contract where this eight grader

286
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:03,488
sold you a two million won fishing rod for 30,000 won

287
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:06,728
is blatantly unfair and, therefore would be invalid!

288
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,948
And since no consent was given by her legal guardian,

289
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,528
this contract can be revoked at any time!

290
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,048
That's what he's saying.

291
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,758
Good job. You did well.

292
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:17,728
I guess her uncles know something about the law.

293
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,218
Yes, we know something about the law.

294
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:23,458
- And how many fishing rods... one, two, three, four... 
 - Eleven.

295
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,138
Eleven rods.

296
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:28,118
According to Article 18 of the Waterfront Fisheries Act,

297
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:31,558
people fishing in the Han River are only allowed to use less than three fishing rods per person.

298
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,768
You know you're participating in illegal activities, right?

299
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,718
Wait a second!

300
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,808
Is this even a fishing permitted zone?

301
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,071
Are you allowed to cast your rods?

302
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:42,141
Did they say you can catch fish here?

303
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:48,458
Ahjussi, you really are a lawyer!

304
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,598
I totally doubted you at first.

305
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,758
Hyungnim, how do you even have the Waterfront Fisheries Act memorized?

306
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,768
Once something enters here, it never leaves.

307
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,438
What the heck. You're so snobbish.

308
00:19:57,438 --> 00:19:59,478
I do hear that a lot.

309
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:08,488
Don't do this...

310
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,058
Hurry up, push him already!

311
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:14,318
Hey!

312
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:16,828
- Ahjussi! 
 - Hey!

313
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:18,048
- What do we do? 
 - Don't!

314
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,998
It's cold!

315
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,309
What do we do?

316
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:25,533
Hey, you guys!

317
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:28,477
This is a no-swimming zone! What do you think you're doing!

318
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,767
We're just playing together.

319
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,247
If you have a problem, report us then.

320
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:35,207
It's not like that. It looks dangerous, and we're worried about you guys.

321
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:38,797
"It's not like that. It looks dangerous, and we're worried about you guys."

322
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:40,307
Did you just mock what my hyung said?

323
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,767
"Did you just mock what my hyung said?"

324
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:46,087
That little punk...

325
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:54,307
Stop bullying your friend,

326
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:56,577
and play while keeping the regulations, okay?

327
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:58,307
Who said we're bullying him?

328
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,897
- We're just all playing together. 
 - We're all friends.

329
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:03,567
You see, this is why old blabbermouths are a problem.

330
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,027
This is not because we're older—

331
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,207
Seriously?

332
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:11,127
If you want to lecture, go to a school or an academy.

333
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:13,047
- This rude little punk! 
 - Hey, hey!

334
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:15,067
Hey, what did you just say?

335
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,607
You guys don't know how scary the law could be!

336
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,537
- Jeong Ho, Jeong Ho! 
 - Why?

337
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:21,597
You're going to hit a minor?

338
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:27,987
Let's go, Ahjussi. It's already late.

339
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,047
- Let's go. 
 - What, you think I won't hit you, you punk?

340
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:31,967
- Come on, Jeong Ho! 
 - You think I won't hit you, this bastard!

341
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,067
Geez!

342
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,997
Let's go, let's go.

343
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:43,977
Hey, Hyung, what are you doing? Let's go quickly!

344
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,457
Let's just go.

345
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:47,490
Hey, Min Gyoo, shall we go in the water again?

346
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:55,847
Geez!

347
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,397
Hyung, should I just go and create some trouble?

348
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:59,847
- Should I teach them a real lesson? 
 - No, hold it, Jeong Ho!

349
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:02,617
I gave them a firm warning.

350
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:04,467
Geez!

351
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,677
- Hyung, you were suppressing your anger a lot, right? 
 - Yes, I was really holding a lot of it in.

352
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:10,297
Do you know those guys?

353
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:13,717
I almost got acquainted with them because of you ahjussis.

354
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:17,817
I mean, what if they start picking on me at school, what are you going to do about that?

355
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:20,037
Hey, come to us right away if that ever happens!

356
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:23,047
And you think you could resolve that situation?

357
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:25,027
Give me the fishing rod!

358
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,497
Move! Geez!

359
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:29,987
What the heck is this?

360
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:32,697
We did help her, didn't we?

361
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:34,147
I know, right?

362
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:38,747
Kim Yoo Ri, you sure are running a worthwhile business!

363
00:22:38,747 --> 00:22:41,447
So worthwhile! Really!

364
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,557
 - Hi.  
 - Mom.

365
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:04,557
Where is Dad's case record?

366
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:05,777
Inside the wardrobe.

367
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:08,197
 It's probably in the drawer under the comforters. 

368
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:10,367
 So why are you suddenly looking for your dad's case record? 

369
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:13,067
I just have to check for something.

370
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:14,517
 It's a black notebook. 

371
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:17,477
 All the phone numbers are in the back. 

372
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:30,237
 Are you Lee Won Goo? 
   

373
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,328
Do you remember my father?

374
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:37,818
Well, right before the accident happened,

375
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:40,398
I was assigned to another site...

376
00:23:40,398 --> 00:23:41,608
I know that.

377
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:43,880
What I wanted to ask you is...

378
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,828
 People don't always die just because there's a fire. 

379
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:52,248
 People were focused on how the fire had started, but 

380
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:56,408
 the truth was actually beyond all that. 

381
00:23:56,408 --> 00:24:00,048
"The reason so many people died is because of the fire, but"

382
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:02,008
"there were other reasons as well."

383
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:05,118
I heard something like that recently.

384
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:11,948
Young Lady, there was a fire in the workplace.

385
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:15,098
Then what would the people do?

386
00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:17,368
- They would put out the fire. 
 - What if the fire doesn't go out?

387
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:18,928
Like there is smoke everywhere.

388
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:20,248
Then what do you do?

389
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:22,668
- Then they would probably run away. 
 - Right?

390
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:28,158
But the exits are all blocked because of equipment.

391
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:32,458
That's why more people died.

392
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,508
To say that people died because of the fire...

393
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:38,858
Or to say that people died because they couldn't escape the fire.

394
00:24:39,918 --> 00:24:41,718
It seems like a minor difference,

395
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:45,108
but for people like me working in safety management...

396
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,228
that's a major difference.

397
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:50,598
But none of that was mentioned anywhere...

398
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:53,098
and I don't understand why they made it seem like

399
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:56,928
Chief Kim was responsible for killing people by starting a fire.

400
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:13,808
 Come on, just stay still for a second! 

401
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:15,328
 Wow... 

402
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:17,318
 Wow... 

403
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:19,768
 Goodness. Geez. 

404
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,768
 Gosh, man... 

405
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:27,508
 But Dad, what's with your face? 

406
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:29,218
 What do you mean, what's with my face? 

407
00:25:29,218 --> 00:25:32,478
 It's your grandmother and grandfather's fault! 

408
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:36,308
 Hey, but at least when we made you, 

409
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:38,528
 I did the best that I could. 

410
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:40,118
 Come on, stop joking about it. 

411
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:43,328
 Why is it like that? Did you get hurt? 

412
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:46,068
 A spark flew on my face while doing some welding. 

413
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:48,058
 It's not a big deal. 

414
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,418
 Hey, Yoo Ri. 

415
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,228
 For the job that Daddy does... 

416
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:03,218
 Daddy needs to face dangers so that other people are safe. 

417
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:04,648
 You'll see later on. 

418
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,478
 The things that I've worked on, 

419
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:10,358
 they'll never break. 

420
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,928
 Wow. 

421
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:23,158
I couldn't get in contact with you all day.

422
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:25,898
Where were you all this time?

423
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:33,518
Hey... Wh-What's wrong?

424
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:37,048
Hey, Jeong Ho.

425
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:41,388
They say it's not my dad.

426
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:45,028
What are you talking about?

427
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:47,608
They say that people died not because of my dad,

428
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:52,858
but because they couldn't escape when a fire broke out.

429
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:57,658
Because they couldn't escape...

430
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:00,158
That's why they died.

431
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:04,808
They say it's not my dad's fault.

432
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:08,768
Well, that's... obviously not your dad's fault.

433
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:14,218
Did you, by chance... think until now...

434
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:19,718
I wasn't able to have faith in my dad.

435
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:23,608
Even though it wasn't my dad,

436
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:28,828
I wasn't able to put my belief in my dad...

437
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:32,308
What should I do? I feel so sorry for my dad...

438
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:36,588
I'm so sorry to my dad, I don't know what to do...

439
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,978
I think I made the mistake... of assuming that I knew everything.

440
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,128
That I knew what she was thinking,

441
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,548
or how much she was hurting.

442
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:18,368
Even though I didn't even know a fraction of what she was feeling.

443
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:41,548
♫  Your figure passes me by  ♫

444
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:48,618
♫  Days that were like a dream to me  ♫

445
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:50,428
A long time ago,

446
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:54,518
Se Yeon said something like this.

447
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:58,238
"If you look at someone while muting their voice,"

448
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,248
"you can know their true feelings."

449
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:05,738
When I mute your voice and look at you,

450
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:08,438
I see everything...

451
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:12,488
That I am... precious to you.

452
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:21,628
So... I think maybe I can be satisfied with that.

453
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:25,218
And that's why... if I just wait a bit longer,

454
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:29,158
I feel like you might just naturally draw near to me.

455
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:35,908
I think of us

456
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:41,058
as not meant to be.

457
00:29:41,058 --> 00:29:44,318
- Why? 
 - The fact that I am with you...

458
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:51,818
I really... hate myself.

459
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:54,228
Why do you hate that so much?

460
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:57,808
Whenever I am with you,

461
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,218
I become cowardly.

462
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:07,348
Then you could just not become cowardly.

463
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:14,848
- How? 
 - Well...

464
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,218
Well...

465
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:20,748
that's for you to figure out.

466
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,608
You're right.

467
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:27,728
That's something that I need to figure out.

468
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:33,538
♫  Don't smile at me  ♫

469
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:41,348
♫  Stop your footsteps in this dark road  ♫

470
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:45,448
♫  Don't get hurt  ♫

471
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:51,098
♫  And stop fading more and more  ♫

472
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:55,328
♫  Like a warm laughter  ♫

473
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:58,278
♫  Directed toward me again  ♫

474
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:13,488
 If you do find something that proves Inspector General's connection to Dohan Group, 

475
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,598
 what do you plan to do after that? 

476
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:18,688
 If you think I'm that wrong, then correct the wrong and take me down. 

477
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:22,568
 Then you could just not become cowardly. 

478
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:42,618
   

479
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:47,938
   

480
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:51,088
   

481
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:53,118
   

482
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:14,598
Y-You're here again today, H-Hyungnim.

483
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,328
Yeah, Kim Yoo Ri will take today off as well.

484
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:19,018
Hyungnim, by chance, this isn't some highly strategized plan

485
00:32:19,018 --> 00:32:21,578
to bring our cafe down or something, is it?

486
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:26,438
What do you mean? I think it's going down nicely without my help.

487
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:30,298
True. We may have many customers, but our sales aren't great...

488
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:33,328
Whoa, Hyungnim! The suit fit you've got going today...

489
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:36,088
Whoa, you look great!

490
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:40,748
Some moron said that I'm ill-mannered and questioned my tracksuit yesterday...

491
00:32:40,748 --> 00:32:43,228
So I decided to dress up today.

492
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:12,478
Hi, Dad.

493
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:14,708
Your daughter is here.

494
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:18,718
   

495
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:22,648
Don't you miss your daughter? How could you stand it?

496
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:32,688
I'm living bravely even though I miss you, Dad.

497
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:37,378
Although I get dumped by a guy, I eat well,

498
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:41,288
and even if I rage at the world, I dress in pretty clothes.

499
00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:55,448
I'm doing fine, right?

500
00:33:57,158 --> 00:34:00,078
Please tell me that I am, Dad...

501
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:16,448
Hello!

502
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,388
Hello!

503
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:34,508
One Americano, please.

504
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:37,188
 Who said we're bullying him? 

505
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:38,628
 We're just all playing together. 

506
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:40,828
 We're all friends. 

507
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:51,348
If you're here for a consultation, you can go in now.

508
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,448
It's empty right now.

509
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:09,778
Haven't we met before?

510
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:15,298
You seem strangely familiar.

511
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:19,698
In any case, ask me if you're curious about anything.

512
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:25,078
If one commits a crime before he turns 14, he goes to juvie and not to prison.

513
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:26,798
Is that right?

514
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,778
"Criminal Code, Article 9."

515
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:33,478
"The act of a person who has not reached the age of 14 will not be punished."

516
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:38,388
But if he commits a felony,

517
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:44,478
- is it still the case? 
 - What kind of felony?

518
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,308
Well, just a felony.

519
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:49,458
A felony.

520
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:54,408
There's no such thing as "just" a felony.

521
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:58,138
Murder, robbery, larceny, assault.

522
00:35:58,138 --> 00:35:59,808
Which one?

523
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:01,758
I'll just look it up.

524
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:04,288
Oh, wait.

525
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:09,248
For criminal minors, they're not punished no matter what they do.

526
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:12,198
Protective custody, community service,

527
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:14,548
probation or transfer to a juvenile detention center.

528
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,998
You can be subject to a protective disposition.

529
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:21,488
But since it's not a sentence, it won't go on your record.

530
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:24,848
Anything else you want to know?

531
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:31,038
What's this?

532
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:33,278
I didn't order this, though...

533
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,358
Still, eat it.

534
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,918
Eat, eat.

535
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:44,748
In this place, the barista serves food based on how he reads your face.

536
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:46,788
Do you know what sloppy management is?

537
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,158
That's how this place is.

538
00:36:56,918 --> 00:37:00,558
If you're okay, go ahead and talk comfortably.

539
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:02,408
After coming out of juvie,

540
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:08,038
can you still take the GED, go to college, and get a job?

541
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,028
Juvenile detention isn't a prison.

542
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:15,548
It's a special education center run by the DOJ.

543
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:20,668
So you can, of course, do the things you just mentioned.

544
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:23,408
It sounds like you have no care in the world.

545
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:27,078
Being branded a criminal is a scary thing.

546
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,828
Going to college and getting a job?

547
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:31,108
Do you think it'd be as easy as it sounds?

548
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:33,718
Hey, I'm saying it's possible theoretically.

549
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,528
You should tell him the reality.

550
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,598
Thank you.

551
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:43,668
Goodbye now.

552
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:45,388
Hey...

553
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:49,018
Because of you...

554
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:53,508
Hey, Buddy!

555
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:56,858
What's your name?

556
00:37:57,588 --> 00:37:59,088
Kim Min Gyoo.

557
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,028
Min Gyoo.

558
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:04,828
I live on the rooftop of this building.

559
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:09,818
If you have any other questions, come by anytime.

560
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:34,118
Did he just leave for the day?

561
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:35,348
Yes.

562
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:37,508
I think so.

563
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:40,218
Who will brew coffee, then?

564
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:43,618
Well, then, since we don't even have customers...

565
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:45,390
shall we end it?

566
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,540
   

567
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,518
Call it a day?

568
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,838
Just go home!

569
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,248
You punks, seriously?

570
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:07,728
What do I do now...

571
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:11,378
Geez, seriously...

572
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:21,708
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri, let's just close down the cafe.

573
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,158
What? Not this again.

574
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:26,288
You're leaking your money all over the place.

575
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:27,928
He goes home without saying anything.

576
00:39:27,928 --> 00:39:29,568
He serves food no one ordered.

577
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:34,668
I went to see my dad today.

578
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:38,568
I went there and cried my eyes out that I'm starving.

579
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:40,918
Make me some food.

580
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:07,513
Thank you for this food!

581
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:15,763
You're a good cook, too. Why is that?

582
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:18,093
Well, you just have to follow the recipe.

583
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:19,983
Why can't I do that?

584
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:24,413
Except for how annoying you are, you'd make the best husband. 
  (Because he's good in everything, and he knows it) 

585
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,163
So why are you so quiet all along?

586
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:32,983
Because I make you feel so uncomfortable,

587
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:36,663
you won't say you're not going to talk to me, are you?

588
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:42,263
This isn't like the Last Supper or something, is it?

589
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:45,423
- It's not. 
 - That's good then.

590
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:55,323
I've been mulling over things.

591
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,873
I can't leave you.

592
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:06,933
Especially now that I know that a**hole Lee Pyun Woong is hanging around you,

593
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:11,373
even if you beg me to get lost because you can't stand the sight of me,

594
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:15,483
I just can't leave you.

595
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:18,813
You're beating around the bush and eventually getting to the point, right?

596
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:21,263
I'm extremely nervous right now.

597
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:25,283
Could you jump right to the point?

598
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,973
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

599
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:31,553
But for me to go to you,

600
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:35,993
there are quite a few things I need to take care of.

601
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,760
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

602
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,903
♫  I send my heart  ♫

603
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:47,273
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

604
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:49,163
So please...

605
00:41:49,163 --> 00:41:50,473
♫  I want to fall in love  ♫

606
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:51,713
wait for me a little bit.

607
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:54,763
♫  With you  ♫

608
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:57,683
Must I wait?

609
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,313
You can't just come to me now?

610
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:03,733
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

611
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:04,773
Not right now.

612
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:09,703
Even if I asked you why, you won't answer me, huh?

613
00:42:09,703 --> 00:42:12,813
Then answer just this one!

614
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:16,203
"Wanting to come to me"...

615
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:17,753
means that...

616
00:42:17,753 --> 00:42:22,193
- you also... 
 - Yes.

617
00:42:22,193 --> 00:42:23,803
It means I like you, too.

618
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:27,223
♫  It must have been love, the look of love  ♫

619
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:29,890
That's what I mean.

620
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:33,723
♫  I keep seeing you in front of me  ♫

621
00:42:33,723 --> 00:42:36,753
♫  I think of you wherever I go  ♫

622
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:41,230
♫  I wonder if she knows how I feel  ♫

623
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,763
What? Wh-Where are you going?

624
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:43,983
I'm going home.

625
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:45,803
If I stick around this late at night with you,

626
00:42:45,803 --> 00:42:47,383
forget about waiting for you and whatnot. Can't do it.

627
00:42:47,383 --> 00:42:50,343
Let's try to keep a distance from each other after sunset.

628
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:52,503
Revive that contract you wrote last time.

629
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,273
H-Hey...

630
00:42:54,273 --> 00:42:56,003
P-Please calm down.

631
00:42:56,003 --> 00:42:58,633
No. I'm leaving. I'll go home and analyze.

632
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:00,343
I'm going to be happy thinking about

633
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:03,253
since when you started liking me and what you just told me.

634
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:08,803
♫  Like the wind, it blows without ending  ♫

635
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:12,420
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

636
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:17,450
♫  Like that night sky  ♫

637
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:21,293
 Wow, it's good. Try the radish kimchi. 

638
00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:23,113
 You're eating too hard. 

639
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:24,373
Aigoo, what are you doing?

640
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:27,723
Your friends have been waiting for you since earlier.

641
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:29,423
Eat a lot!

642
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:30,823
 Thank you! 

643
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:33,643
Give me a minute. You're hungry, huh?

644
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,563
Hey, Min Gyoo. You're here.

645
00:43:37,563 --> 00:43:40,643
Where did you go? You didn't even pick up your phone.

646
00:43:40,643 --> 00:43:43,883
- Please give us more radish kimchi. 
 - Okay.

647
00:43:47,613 --> 00:43:50,183
Your grandma's a good cook.

648
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:54,013
How much does she make per day?

649
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:57,343
Don't mess with my grandma.

650
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,463
Our Pee was a f***ing devoted grandson.

651
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:02,763
Please stop...

652
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:07,883
You want to f***ing hit me, huh?

653
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:10,453
Hit me.

654
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:12,073
Hit me once.

655
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:13,563
Hit me.

656
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:15,793
I said hit me.

657
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:23,133
Hit me.

658
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,000
Hit me!

659
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,100
I said hit me!

660
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:36,173
Hey, you recorded it, right?

661
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:44,213
Starting now, it's a two-way assault, okay, Min Gyoo?

662
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:50,603
 A**hole! 

663
00:44:50,603 --> 00:44:52,333
 Did you really hit me just because I asked you? 

664
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,813
 What a crazy punk! 

665
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:55,643
 Geez... 

666
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:15,513
Hand over 30% of the sales starting tomorrow, Min Gyoo.

667
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:20,463
If you don't bring it to me on time,

668
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:23,893
the entire school will get to see your video.

669
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:25,673
Do you understand?

670
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,693
Do you want me to kill them for you?

671
00:46:01,203 --> 00:46:06,603
If you want, I can kill them for you.

672
00:46:13,493 --> 00:46:14,723
How can I help you?

673
00:46:14,723 --> 00:46:16,383
Three Americanos, please.

674
00:46:16,383 --> 00:46:17,163
Sure. Iced, right?

675
00:46:17,163 --> 00:46:19,163
Boss, which one out of these two?

676
00:46:19,163 --> 00:46:21,213
- Both of them over here. 
 - Oh, both?

677
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:23,103
Press the button, and get the drip.

678
00:46:23,103 --> 00:46:24,783
If you pour it in here again, isn't it an espresso?

679
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:26,093
Really?

680
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:27,243
I don't know, either.

681
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:31,013
Wow... the one and only barista fails to show up to work...

682
00:46:31,013 --> 00:46:32,693
Things going well at the cafe, right?

683
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:35,453
If you have time to get sarcastic, come and make some coffee.

684
00:46:35,453 --> 00:46:37,273
Why should I?

685
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:41,943
Ahjussi!

686
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:44,363
Ahjussi, did Kim Pee come by?

687
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:46,203
- Kim Pee? 
 - Kim Pe–

688
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,653
I mean, Kim Min Gyoo. Kim Min Gyoo.

689
00:46:48,653 --> 00:46:50,193
Kim Min Gyoo...

690
00:46:50,193 --> 00:46:51,773
He came by here yesterday. Do you know him?

691
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:53,153
I told him to come here.

692
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:54,733
I think something terrible happened!

693
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:56,593
He didn't come to school today.

694
00:46:56,593 --> 00:46:59,883
What did he say to you when he came by yesterday?

695
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,963
 Who said we're bullying him? 

696
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:04,513
 - We're just all playing together. 
 - We're all friends. 

697
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:06,033
 After coming out of juvie, 

698
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,533
 can you still take the GED, 

699
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,083
 go to college, and get a job? 

700
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:11,713
 It sounds like you have no care in the world. 

701
00:47:11,713 --> 00:47:13,693
 Being branded a criminal is a scary thing. 

702
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:15,013
 Going to college and getting a job? 

703
00:47:15,013 --> 00:47:17,533
 Do you think it'd be as easy as it sounds? 

704
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:19,863
Where is Seo Eun Kang right now?

705
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:23,453
Kim Jeong Ho!

706
00:47:23,453 --> 00:47:24,763
What's going on right now?

707
00:47:24,763 --> 00:47:26,933
Explain it to me, Jeong Ho!

708
00:47:26,933 --> 00:47:28,963
Explain it.

709
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,253
A victim of campus bullying came by the cafe yesterday.

710
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:35,267
Why, why, why? What's going on?

711
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:38,917
- And? 
 - I think Seo Eun Kang followed him.

712
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:41,853
"I think." You're just suspecting it.

713
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:42,973
He did follow him out.

714
00:47:42,973 --> 00:47:46,983
And Seo Eun Kang didn't come to work and that boy didn't show up at school, either.

715
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:49,093
- So what about it? 
 - You don't know?

716
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:51,833
Don't you know what Seo Eun Kang did?

717
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:57,473
Don't assume things recklessly.

718
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:09,843
Is he not picking up?

719
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:12,413
No. It's ringing, but he won't pick up.

720
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:13,563
Keep calling him.

721
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:16,593
- Did you text him? 
 - He's not reading my text.

722
00:48:18,123 --> 00:48:19,293
Hey, Student.

723
00:48:19,293 --> 00:48:20,883
How close are you to Min Gyoo?

724
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:22,603
I don't even know Kim Pee's number.

725
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:26,743
So why do you keep calling him "Pee, Pee" when he's got a perfectly fine name?

726
00:48:26,743 --> 00:48:28,993
Oh, other kids call him that.

727
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,083
I guess it just became a habit.

728
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,173
He once peed in school.

729
00:48:33,173 --> 00:48:34,633
Although it wasn't his fault.

730
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:37,553
Min Gyoo, I bought all these beverages. You should drink them.

731
00:48:37,553 --> 00:48:38,683
 Drink it! 

732
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,873
 There's this guy Hong Ji Hoon. He's been infamous since his elementary days. 

733
00:48:41,873 --> 00:48:45,953
 Kim Min Gyoo totally got picked on by his posse. 

734
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:48,003
 They forced him to drink all kinds of drinks 

735
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:50,743
 and tormented him by not letting him go to the restroom all day at school. 

736
00:48:50,743 --> 00:48:52,543
 If he begged, they'd make him do some weird things. 

737
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:55,103
 They wouldn't let him go home early even if he wanted to. 

738
00:48:56,013 --> 00:48:58,633
Wait. Were those guys we met at Han River those guys?

739
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,473
They're very vicious!

740
00:49:00,473 --> 00:49:04,403
Another kid was victimized by them last year and transferred to another school.

741
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:08,483
And the teachers don't know about this?

742
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:09,573
Not sure.

743
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:12,913
Even if they knew, they probably couldn't do anything.

744
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:21,953
It's here.

745
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:28,323
He didn't come home last night.

746
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:30,333
Did he call?

747
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,813
I went to the police station,

748
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:37,953
and they said I have to wait a day to report him missing.

749
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:41,823
He has never done this before.

750
00:49:45,543 --> 00:49:50,403
 If one commits a crime before he turns 14, he goes to juvie and not to prison. 

751
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:51,223
 Is that right? 

752
00:49:51,223 --> 00:49:52,703
 After coming out of juvie, 

753
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:54,643
 can you still take the GED, 

754
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:57,623
 go to college, and get a job? 

755
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:59,853
How old is an eight grader in Korean age?

756
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:02,443
Fifteen years old.

757
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:06,183
Ma'am, when is Min Gyoo's birthday?

758
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:08,263
It's tomorrow.

759
00:50:10,563 --> 00:50:11,923
Why report to the police?

760
00:50:11,923 --> 00:50:14,073
We know nothing for sure right now.

761
00:50:14,073 --> 00:50:16,413
We're supposed to report when there's suspicion. It's too late when we know for sure.

762
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,363
What are you suspicious of right now?

763
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:21,923
Even if the two of them are together, Eun Kang wouldn't do anything risky.

764
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:24,103
- I know that. 
 - Seo Eun Kang is a criminal.

765
00:50:24,103 --> 00:50:25,883
He gathered all the guys who bullied his sister,

766
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:28,603
trapped them in a warehouse and set it on fire!

767
00:50:49,203 --> 00:50:50,833
In the end, no one got hurt,

768
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,683
and Eun Kang himself opened the door before anyone got hurt.

769
00:50:55,863 --> 00:50:57,413
Still, nothing is changed.

770
00:50:57,413 --> 00:50:58,913
The two of them disappeared together

771
00:50:58,913 --> 00:51:02,913
and Seo Eun Kang is the perfect person to egg Min Gyoo on.

772
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,353
Hey, Ah Yeong.

773
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:09,643
I don't know where Kim Min Gyoo is, but

774
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:13,053
I found out where Hong Jin Hoon and his posse are.

775
00:51:16,263 --> 00:51:19,063
Oh, th-there? Where is that place?

776
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:31,313
I thought I'd just kill myself and went up to the rooftop one day.

777
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:35,993
But I couldn't do it.

778
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:41,993
Even if I die, those crappy videos will still be around.

779
00:51:41,993 --> 00:51:44,473
So I thought, let's kill those a**holes.

780
00:51:44,473 --> 00:51:46,573
Even if I die,

781
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:49,753
those a**holes will pick on another kid and do the same thing!

782
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:53,003
So getting rid of those a**holes...

783
00:51:54,003 --> 00:51:58,273
is doing some good for the world.

784
00:52:01,983 --> 00:52:03,973
 Eun Mi, please! 

785
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:04,743
 Emergency! 

786
00:52:04,743 --> 00:52:06,713
 - Eun Mi, wake up, please! 
 - I'm sorry! 

787
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:08,233
 The family can't go in. 

788
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,800
 Eun Mi! 

789
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,513
 My plans haven't changed. 

790
00:52:14,223 --> 00:52:16,653
 Once I get out of here, 

791
00:52:16,653 --> 00:52:20,093
 I'll kill all those bastards. 

792
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:23,873
 I want to defend you and help you get your sentence reduced as much as possible. 

793
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,573
 If you don't change your mind, I can't help you. 

794
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:27,943
 Then don't help me. 

795
00:52:27,943 --> 00:52:28,963
 Eun Kang... 

796
00:52:28,963 --> 00:52:32,093
 Do you know what those bastards did... 

797
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:36,143
 to my sister? 

798
00:52:36,143 --> 00:52:38,503
 Do you even know! 

799
00:52:38,503 --> 00:52:41,563
 If your family dies like that, 

800
00:52:41,563 --> 00:52:44,523
 do you even know how that makes you feel? 

801
00:52:47,103 --> 00:52:51,053
♫  I will stay by your side now  ♫

802
00:52:51,053 --> 00:52:54,533
♫  I will hold your hand  ♫

803
00:52:54,533 --> 00:53:01,400
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

804
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,020
♫  If some time passes  ♫

805
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:04,593
 Why can't I? Why? 

806
00:53:04,593 --> 00:53:05,873
 Why can't I kill those a**holes? 

807
00:53:05,873 --> 00:53:09,433
 Why? Why? Why? Why can't I kill them! Why? Why? Why? 

808
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:13,253
♫  Be brave and just like you did before  ♫

809
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:17,653
 If I get rid of those dirty a**holes from this world, I'm not the only one benefiting. 

810
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:20,743
 I don't know why you can't kill them! 

811
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:22,663
 What? 

812
00:53:22,663 --> 00:53:26,663
 I've also wanted to kill someone. 

813
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,383
 No. 

814
00:53:28,383 --> 00:53:30,393
 I still want to kill him. 

815
00:53:30,393 --> 00:53:33,073
 We barely managed to find my dad's body. 

816
00:53:33,073 --> 00:53:36,903
 But the reason I'm not chasing after those bastards with a dagger is 

817
00:53:36,903 --> 00:53:40,093
 because I'd get hurt. 

818
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:42,783
 My dad's beloved... 

819
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,013
 I, who take after my dad... 

820
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:50,553
 can't let myself get hurt. 

821
00:53:50,553 --> 00:53:54,003
 So Eun Kang... 

822
00:53:54,003 --> 00:53:56,303
 Think through this with me. 

823
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:59,673
 I'll protect you so you don't get hurt. 

824
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:01,833
 Let's think this over together. 

825
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:07,443
♫  Just like you did before, look at me and smile  ♫

826
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,513
Hyung.

827
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:13,613
Hurry and leave now.

828
00:54:13,613 --> 00:54:16,233
Hurry and leave, Hyung!

829
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:18,123
Hyung!

830
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:32,763
What are you doing, Hyung?

831
00:54:41,023 --> 00:54:42,383
Listen up.

832
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:44,683
Stick your head out by the window

833
00:54:44,683 --> 00:54:46,403
and jump off of it before it becomes too dangerous for you.

834
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:49,613
We're on the second floor. You may hurt your legs but won't die.

835
00:54:50,503 --> 00:54:53,673
When the police arrive, say those bastards locked you up in here

836
00:54:53,673 --> 00:54:56,133
and set it on fire.

837
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:59,233
I'll testify as the witness to this incident.

838
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:02,113
It's your choice.

839
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,343
Don't get hurt by spacing out.

840
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,463
Get out on time.

841
00:55:53,593 --> 00:55:55,753
Be sure to get out.

842
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,483
Be sure.

843
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:07,423
 Min Gyoo. 

844
00:56:09,623 --> 00:56:11,063
Where is he now?

845
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:13,123
Geez...

846
00:56:13,793 --> 00:56:15,263
Is there a fire?

847
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:16,483
Hey.

848
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:18,203
Did Kim Min Gyoo, that a**hole, do this?

849
00:56:18,203 --> 00:56:21,453
Run. Hey, run away for now.

850
00:56:39,393 --> 00:56:41,763
Min Gyoo, please...

851
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:43,723
Please...

852
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:21,103
I'm in front of an abandoned building 234-3 in Hongsan-dong.

853
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:23,913
I think there's a fire inside. Please hurry over!

854
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:27,523
There's only one student who's injured.

855
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:28,863
Hey!

856
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,373
What happened?

857
00:57:30,373 --> 00:57:32,143
Are you okay?

858
00:57:32,143 --> 00:57:34,123
You!

859
00:57:34,123 --> 00:57:36,653
What the hell did you do?

860
00:57:40,713 --> 00:57:45,263
I'll say those guys locked up Min Gyoo in there and started the fire.

861
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:48,663
Then all the campus bullying will become explosive.

862
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,993
And I'll say I was with you all along, Attorney.

863
00:57:57,993 --> 00:57:59,273
Hey!

864
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:02,273
You started all this! So you take responsibility for it!

865
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:16,993
Then so be it.

866
00:58:18,263 --> 00:58:19,293
Eun Kang...

867
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:22,923
I tried to come up with a way where no one gets hurt.

868
00:58:22,923 --> 00:58:24,993
I guess my answer sucked, huh?

869
00:58:24,993 --> 00:58:27,923
 I'll protect you, so you don't get hurt. 

870
00:58:27,923 --> 00:58:30,403
 Let's think this over together. 

871
00:58:30,403 --> 00:58:31,913
"I guess my answer sucked, huh?"

872
00:58:31,913 --> 00:58:33,313
Hey, you crazy bastard!

873
00:58:33,313 --> 00:58:35,823
What are you doing with a child? You're an adult!

874
00:58:35,823 --> 00:58:38,603
If they check your criminal record, everything will come out!

875
00:58:38,603 --> 00:58:40,773
Do you think other people are stupid?

876
00:58:40,773 --> 00:58:45,223
Because of those thugs, you just got mixed up in it!

877
00:58:47,453 --> 00:58:50,063
Now that I got mixed up in it,

878
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:53,893
he doesn't have to handle all that by himself anymore.

879
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:30,623
I saw these guys dragging him in there,

880
00:59:30,623 --> 00:59:31,953
and I kept watching them because I got nervous.

881
00:59:31,953 --> 00:59:35,913
Not too long later, I saw smoke come out from that window over there.

882
00:59:35,913 --> 00:59:39,023
And those guys ran out of there.

883
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:43,073
And that boy over there jumped off the second-floor window later by himself.

884
00:59:51,183 --> 00:59:54,853
What happened inside the building?

885
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:11,413
Those guys locked me in there and started the fire.

886
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:14,653
So I jumped out of the window.

887
01:00:23,593 --> 01:00:29,033
So what brings you out to this remote spot at this hour, sir?

888
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,213
Sir?

889
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:37,813
Were you alone?

890
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:47,943
- Yes– 
 - No.

891
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:50,523
He was with us.

892
01:00:53,050 --> 01:01:00,100


893
01:01:02,443 --> 01:01:15,433
♫  After the long rain passed through that seemed like it would never stop  ♫

894
01:01:15,433 --> 01:01:23,743
♫  I think of the expression on your face you could not hide  ♫

895
01:01:23,743 --> 01:01:27,833
♫  I fall into deep thoughts  ♫

896
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:34,363
♫  Empty streets, my heart disturbed  ♫

897
01:01:34,363 --> 01:01:38,653
♫  I don't think it's dry from the rain yet  ♫

898
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:42,093
   

899
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:47,143
 By chance, in your future plan, if there's even a remote chance that you'd regret this... 

900
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:50,333
 How dare you say ignorant or not to someone else's child! 

901
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,863
 I'll figure out our game plan again. 

902
01:01:51,863 --> 01:01:54,223
 Whose crazy idea was this? 

903
01:01:54,223 --> 01:01:57,273
 - From the get-go, I– 
 - It was my idea. 

904
01:01:57,273 --> 01:01:59,153
 He's a total crazy nut. 

905
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:02,793
 I think it'd be better to just get rid of her while we're at it. 
   

906
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:04,973
 Come to the address I'll text you right now. 

907
01:02:04,973 --> 01:02:06,513
 Kim Jeong Ho got dragged somewhere. 

908
01:02:06,513 --> 01:02:08,323
 Blow it up! 

909
01:02:08,323 --> 01:02:09,796
 Boom! 

910
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:14,600
♫  It would be so nice if I could  ♫
