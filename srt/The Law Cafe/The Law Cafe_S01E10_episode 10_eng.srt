1
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:33,116
   

2
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,750


3
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:06,326
Yoo Ri! Yoo Ri!

4
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:07,876
Kim Yoo Ri!

5
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,326
Yoo Ri!

6
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:13,076
Is anyone there?

7
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:15,746
Please help us!

8
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:17,366
Yoo Ri!

9
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:20,416
Is anyone there?

10
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,096
Please help us!

11
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:24,336
Please help!

12
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:26,316
Yoo Ri!

13
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,866
Kim Yoo Ri!

14
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,796
Hurry...

15
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:41,586
Kim Yoo Ri.

16
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:49,006
Yoo Ri...

17
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:27,906
- Isn't there something off about this? 
 - This was how I ate it since I was young.

18
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,416
Oh! Boss, you woke up.

19
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,476
Boss, what's my name?

20
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:36,006
Yeah, what's Hyung's name? And what's mine as well?

21
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:39,266
Eun Kang... and Joon...

22
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,706
And how many fingers are these?

23
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:44,086
I-I don't think that's how you do it, Hyung...

24
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:47,076
I don't know about that. J-Just answer me.

25
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:48,496
It's two fingers.

26
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Oh. Her head is fine, I guess.

27
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,726
No, no. Stay still.

28
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,306
Stay lying down.

29
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,550
Boss, you almost got into big trouble!

30
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,860
What happened?

31
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,340
I don't know if he was drunk or something,

32
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,433
but some crazy bastard hit you with his car and drove away.

33
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:10,310
So Hyungnim Jeong Ho went pale as a ghost and was going berserk.

34
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,320
Don't even bring it up again. That hyungnim is scary now to me.

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,544
Where is he right now?

36
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,144
Is this really conducting a proper investigation?

37
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,414
- Hey! Cut it out! 
 - Is that right?

38
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:21,644
Please, come on.

39
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:23,214
Is there nothing more you can do?

40
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:24,654
Come to your senses, Kim Jeong Ho!

41
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,374
Someone almost died!

42
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:29,184
There are so many CCTVs in South Korea. How is it possible that you can't find the perpetrator?

43
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:33,634
Sir, we're doing everything in our power to find him, so please give us some time.

44
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,433
You guys who are supposedly doing everything you can,

45
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:38,974
how could you merely put out a watch on the victim for personal protection and tell us to just wait?

46
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:40,054
This is going to work. Come out.

47
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,974
- No, wait! 
  - I said to come out!

48
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,454
Hey! You're not in your right mind now.

49
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:46,844
This is an obstruction of official duties!

50
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:48,274
They are doing this intentionally!

51
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:49,944
- I saw him! 
 - I said okay!

52
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:53,104
We're doing our best, too, so come on!

53
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:56,114
You doing this isn't going to change anything!

54
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,274
I want to catch the perpetrator just as quickly as you do so for now,

55
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:02,744
for now, please calm down!

56
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,864
Hey! Hey!

57
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:08,244
Hey, where are you going now!

58
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:10,574
Man, he's driving me nuts!

59
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,774
You have a fracture on your right hand.

60
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,524
And on your left hand, you've injured a ligament,

61
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,024
so you need to have a cast on both hands for the time being.

62
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:24,864
Still, it's a relief that this is the extent of your injuries.

63
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:29,224
But how do I go to the bathroom if both my hands are like this?

64
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:30,774
I suggest using a bidet.

65
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:32,024
How about my pants?

66
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,974
Who's going to pull down my pants?

67
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,654
Like this?

68
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,234
What's this?

69
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:42,374
You need to take it all!

70
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,794
This is mine. It's mine, right?

71
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:46,824
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

72
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:48,284
Oh, dang it!

73
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,564
So when is Kim Jeong Ho going to come?

74
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,344
You know that I don't like carrots!

75
00:04:52,344 --> 00:04:55,944
Just eat without being picky! You're always deficient in Vitamin A.

76
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,604
Here.

77
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,361
- What about Kim Jeong Ho? 
 - Why do you keep looking for him?

78
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,561
It's better that Jeong Ho is not around.

79
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,681
He was making such a commotion, my goodness.

80
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,971
Even I, who gave birth to you, wouldn't act like that.

81
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:13,581
I got even more frightened because of him!

82
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:23,917
You son of a b****!

83
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:26,848
Why, you nephew son of a b****?

84
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,738
You trash son of a b****...

85
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:30,578
Are you even human after doing something like that?

86
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:33,288
You bastard! Just because last time we drank

87
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,698
and put on a show, you greet me with a fist again?

88
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:38,178
That little...

89
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:39,348
Come over here, you son of a b****!

90
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:40,808
Stop this, please.

91
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,608
You!

92
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,748
You son of a b****.

93
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:53,158
I'm really going to kill you.

94
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,138
Why?

95
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,038
What's that?

96
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,468
Did something happen to Attorney Kim again?

97
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:03,958
Whenever you get agitated like this,

98
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,658
it turns out it's always because of Attorney Kim.

99
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,728
You bastard...

100
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:10,108
He's so easily readable.

101
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,498
Right?

102
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,258
Do something about him.

103
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:16,818
Raise him up.

104
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:24,738
How old was I again when that happened?

105
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:28,938
The woman who gave birth to me died.

106
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:33,718
That day, do you know what happened?

107
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,098
Hey! Quit it for a sec. I'm talking right now!

108
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:42,068
So what happened was...

109
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,868
Nothing!

110
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,998
The day before...

111
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:54,358
And the day before,

112
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,278
there were no signs of it happening.

113
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:58,008
So I came to the realization.

114
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,738
Oh, losing something that you have

115
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:05,668
happens when you don't expect it... suddenly!

116
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,748
Like this! You didn't expect that, did you?

117
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:11,558
It happens suddenly like this.

118
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,548
Hey.

119
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:23,018
Jeong Ho. Don't let down your guard.

120
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:33,148
My target... is not Attorney Kim, it's you.

121
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:22,018
 I'm sorry... for loving you 

122
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:25,678
 even though I don't deserve to. 

123
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:34,018
 I'm sorry that I deceived you... 

124
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,528
 for so long. 

125
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,228
Why are you outside? You'll catch a cold.

126
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:54,608
Your face...

127
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,718
What happened?

128
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:00,008
You're a patient.

129
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:02,228
- Let's go inside. 
 - It must hurt...

130
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:03,798
Are you okay?

131
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:06,888
Let's talk to the doctor and get it treated.

132
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,618
Who are you worried about now?

133
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,978
Should you be worried about someone like me?

134
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,428
You got hurt because of me!

135
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:18,798
You ended up like this because of me!

136
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:20,134
Why is this because of you?

137
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:24,034
You think that a car racing through an empty neighborhood street like that was a coincidence?

138
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:28,434
Do you think it was a coincidence that the car was unregistered without a traceable license plate?

139
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,844
Yoo Ri...

140
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:34,384
Hey, Yoo Ri. Kim Yoo Ri.

141
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,944
Please don't worry about anyone else. You should worry about yourself!

142
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,194
Just worry about yourself!

143
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:56,744
♫  The cold wind brushes by my shoulder  ♫

144
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:59,034
♫  on a night which only evokes painful memories  ♫

145
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:01,634
I'm okay.

146
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,044
Kim Jeong Ho.

147
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,924
♫  Do you remember? You approach quietly  ♫

148
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:07,504
I'm telling you, I'm okay.

149
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:11,074
♫  when you take my hand  ♫

150
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:15,374
♫  the frozen tears flow.  ♫

151
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,434
What do you mean, you're okay?

152
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:27,224
♫  Can you understand how I feel? Can you feel it?  ♫

153
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:32,094
♫  Can you look at me with warm eyes?  ♫

154
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:35,654
♫  It is like my long awaited refuge.  ♫

155
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:37,214
Please...

156
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,234
Please, don't ever get hurt again.

157
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:43,244
♫  Stay still and lean on me  ♫

158
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:46,004
Because I feel like I'm going to die when you do.

159
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,514
Okay.

160
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,644
I won't ever get hurt again.

161
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:04,614
♫  Do you listen and look for me?  ♫

162
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:07,020
♫  Please tell me more.  ♫

163
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,850
♫   I want to hear about even the painful wounds  ♫

164
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:19,004
♫  of your past which I don't know yet.  ♫

165
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,354
Oh, my goodness! What's wrong with you?

166
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,554
- Get up. 
 - I'm sorry.

167
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:44,894
I'm sorry, Mother.

168
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:47,164
It's not like you did anything wrong.

169
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,994
Why are you kneeling?

170
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,304
I am sorry.

171
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:59,974
You read me wrong.

172
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,674
I'm not that weak of a person.

173
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:06,454
My Yoo Ri isn't that fragile, either.

174
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,844
Goodness...

175
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:16,434
There's something that I passed down to my daughter.

176
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:19,254
A shining beauty and strength.

177
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:25,434
So... you don't have to agonize so much.

178
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:42,024
   

179
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:46,974
   

180
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:53,104
What do you mean, go to your house? You must be crazy!

181
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,634
It's easier to commute back and forth from the cafe,

182
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:56,314
and I can continue to keep an eye on you.

183
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:59,254
Just because I let you get behind the wheel, you think you're the king?

184
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,834
I told you, I'm going to handle things by myself!

185
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:05,424
Yeah, Hyungnim. Judging by the sound of her voice, it seems she's back to full health.

186
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:07,874
What are you able to do by yourself with your hands like that?

187
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:10,064
Then what about you? Then w-what can you do for me then?

188
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:13,044
Are you going to l-like give me a bath or something?

189
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:15,434
I'll try to do whatever I'm capable of.

190
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:19,034
What do you mean, you try to do whatever you're capable of! You're out of your mind!

191
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:34,534
Here.

192
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,014
Once I clean up the cafe,

193
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:39,434
my mom said she was going to come up to be with me, so, please!

194
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:40,794
Stop making a big deal out of this.

195
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:43,384
Then just stay with me until then.

196
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,644
Why is he like that?

197
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:53,524
Hyungnim.

198
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:57,104
Does this look like a love fight only in my eyes?

199
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,864
It's irritating to be watching it.

200
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,494
What right do you have to be doing this?

201
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:04,334
With what right are you confining me?

202
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,664
Confinement?

203
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,034
If this is not confinement, then what is it?

204
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,544
I told you, I'll take care of myself!

205
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,974
Whether Lee Pyeon Woong comes after me with a knife to kill me

206
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,874
or comes racing toward me in a car,

207
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:16,234
I'll take care of myself.

208
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,854
So mind your own business and let me be.

209
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:19,774
Yoo Ri.

210
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:23,064
No matter what you say, I have no plans to let you be by yourself.

211
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:25,174
So stop wasting your energy and let's go inside together.

212
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:26,784
Excuse me...

213
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:30,324
I'm sorry to interrupt while you guys are fighting...

214
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:34,214
I tried to make my presence known a while ago,

215
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:35,994
but I just couldn't find the right timing.

216
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:37,134
Mom...

217
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:39,514
M-Mom?

218
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,904
Mom?

219
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:43,584
Hello...

220
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,364
You're the girl that I've only heard about.

221
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:48,044
We finally meet.

222
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,564
It's nice to meet you, Yoo Ri.

223
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:51,134
Oh, yes...

224
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,334
B-But, how are you here, Mom?

225
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:56,114
Me? I left home!

226
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:04,174
"How did I not know anything while things got to this point?"

227
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:07,394
When I said that, he replied, "I didn't want you to worry."

228
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:10,154
So, I said,

229
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,354
"I didn't know you thought so little of me like this!"

230
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:15,734
"This has to do with my father, my husband, and my son!"

231
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:19,944
"How could you hide something like this from me unless you took me for a fool?"

232
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,614
With that, I came out.

233
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:24,524
After that, where could I go?

234
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,604
But now that I'm here,

235
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:29,334
I see that there's another person who's been hurt

236
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,974
by my son, my husband, my father...

237
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,234
and my half-brother.

238
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:41,374
Having seen you, Yoo Ri, we really shouldn't forgive these men, right?

239
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:46,194
But, Mom... then where are you planning on staying for the time being...

240
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:49,574
Yeah. I'm planning on staying in your room.

241
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:55,734
But it's good to be able to see my son again, who's been avoiding me,

242
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:57,884
and also see Woo Jin.

243
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,764
Woo Jin, could you prescribe me some sleep medication later?

244
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:02,174
I haven't been able to sleep well these days.

245
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:03,444
Oh, of course, Auntie.

246
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:05,134
Just come by the hospital later!

247
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:06,474
Okay.

248
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:09,864
I think I've introduced myself enough now.

249
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:14,104
Who are you, with your sparkling eyes?

250
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:16,034
I am a part-timer of this cafe!

251
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:18,094
T-This is the first time I'm seeing a chaebol* family. 
  (Wealthy family who owns conglomerates) 

252
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:20,674
He's a honeybee, a honeybee.

253
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:23,764
This is the first time he's seen a chaebol family and someone with a criminal record.

254
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:26,414
This hyungnim, whose specialties are sarcasm and iciness,

255
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,584
is the barista of this cafe.

256
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,564
Boss, this was made with red ginseng. It's good for your health.

257
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:35,554
- Drink it. 
 - Oh, it's good for your health? Hurry up and drink up!

258
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:38,214
I'll drink it on my own.

259
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:39,844
Be careful.

260
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:43,934
You didn't get to eat because you were being discharged from the hospital.

261
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:47,124
Cut it out. Your mom is here.

262
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:50,524
I'm fine.

263
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,394
Yeah, she's fine. Eat this side with a lot of eggs first.

264
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:56,034
Open wide!

265
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:59,124
Yeah, like that. Good, good!

266
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,494
I'll do it myself!

267
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:05,964
Don't you have any indoor slippers?

268
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:07,334
Oh, indoor slippers...

269
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,504
I'll get you some new ones.

270
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:12,634
And if there's anything else you need, just let me know.

271
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:16,124
I've also put out a new toothbrush in the bathroom, so you can use that.

272
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:24,904
I'm trying to decide whether I should tell you

273
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:26,654
"You must have gone through a lot up to this point"

274
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:29,834
or to tell you

275
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:34,484
"I feel bad for myself for having a son like you."

276
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:40,824
If you didn't come by last time crying before leaving,

277
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,244
I wouldn't have forgiven you, either.

278
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:50,394
But if I were to hate you as well,

279
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,634
I really wouldn't have anyone left, Jeong Ho...

280
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,844
Mom.

281
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:02,844
Please give me a hug, Jeong Ho.

282
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,804
   

283
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:33,024
I heard that you came by several days to get a consultation.

284
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,494
With what question did you visit us?

285
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:38,464
I have a question regarding inheritance.

286
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,474
My mother passed away a while back.

287
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:42,434
And my father is currently in the hospital.

288
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:43,944
But his condition is not very good.

289
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,484
Oh, okay.

290
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:50,314
But recently, it turns out my father left a will to my oppas without telling me.

291
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:51,844
He gave the company to my oldest oppa,

292
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:54,394
the Seocho-dong house to my second oppa,

293
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:56,144
and for me...

294
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:58,754
merely the property in our hometown.

295
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:00,874
I've been the one to care for his health for the past several years.

296
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:05,254
It doesn't make sense that he would pass on all of that to just my brothers!

297
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:08,474
I couldn't just sit there doing nothing, so that's why I came.

298
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:13,664
A lot of people mistakenly believe that a will determines everything regarding inheritance.

299
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:15,024
There's something called a distributive share,

300
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:16,664
where regardless of the will,

301
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:20,824
there's a minimum share that is guaranteed by law to be distributed to each family member of the deceased.

302
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:25,094
Also, for you, Ma'am, because you've been caring for your father for quite some time,

303
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:28,864
you can also potentially get that acknowledged for your elective share. ( TN: When the remaining parent dies, the children each are entitled to a proportionate share of the assets.) 

304
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:37,724
I apologize that you've had to come by multiple times.

305
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,804
So is there nothing that I can do right now?

306
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:45,074
Well... because your father hasn't passed away yet...

307
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,584
How about you try to resolve this by talking with your family members?

308
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:50,604
If this could have been resolved by talking with them, I wouldn't have come to an attorney!

309
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:54,164
I will make sure I get every portion that I deserve!

310
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,014
Have a nice day.

311
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:04,004
I mean, a parent is dying... Is money what's important?

312
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,674
Don't you think she's a bit too much?

313
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:09,434
But when it comes to the issue of inheritance,

314
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:11,304
it is a problem that everyone goes through

315
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:14,354
regardless of the quantity of the accumulated wealth.

316
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:16,104
I know that, but...

317
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:17,994
seeing people fight over things like that,

318
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:21,134
makes me disillusioned with people.

319
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:24,294
I guess you've only met honorable people in your life.

320
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:28,344
For me, fighting over things like that seems befitting to people like us.

321
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:30,460
He's not wrong.

322
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:35,504
Sheesh, hyungnims are always so pessimistic.

323
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:39,864
You didn't, by chance, tell her that you were going to represent her in a lawsuit, right?

324
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,804
If things go wrong, inheritance problems even lead to knife attacks.

325
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:45,524
I don't know about anything else, but this needs to be handled by an attorney specializing in it.

326
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:47,174
God! I know that too!

327
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:49,994
Also, I understand you have difficulties controlling yourself,

328
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:53,810
but sticking your nose in other people's business... could you please stop doing that?

329
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:59,474
No matter what the situation is, you always go for the double Point card.

330
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,624
Why would you take the Light card, instead?

331
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,174
My Light card isn't the problem.

332
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,414
The problem was that you said Go, Noonim.

333
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:06,424
There was nothing on the table to take. Why would you say Go?

334
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:09,894
That's why Eun Kang Hyung took the double Point card!

335
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,334
Hey, hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

336
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:13,394
Just let me be!

337
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:15,714
You can't have this shake. Get on my back.

338
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:18,634
They're really putting on quite a show.

339
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:21,154
Yeah.

340
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,274
It's so ridiculous.

341
00:21:22,274 --> 00:21:25,694
If anyone else sees them, they might think she injured her leg.

342
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:28,184
Geez, she really doesn't listen.

343
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:29,744
Kim Yoo Ri!

344
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,404
Since the accident,

345
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:35,404
Hyungnim Jeong Ho is... how do I describe this...

346
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:37,704
overprotective of the boss.

347
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,544
It's called being extreme!

348
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:42,214
People with kids don't even act like that.

349
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:47,444
So you're saying you would like to come to a settlement, right?

350
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:49,294
I would like to–

351
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:55,694
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

352
00:21:57,414 --> 00:21:59,474
Are you okay?

353
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:02,194
Man...

354
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:05,504
She looks a bit tired. Why don't you hurry up and finish quickly?

355
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:07,204
Get out!

356
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,674
I'm so sorry.

357
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:12,454
♫  I must like you, more than anyone else  ♫

358
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:14,014
Ignore me.

359
00:22:14,014 --> 00:22:16,884
- Just do your thing.  
 - Go inside and close the curtains.

360
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,534
I did just before.

361
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:20,244
But he opened it again.

362
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:23,514
♫  Maybe I love you, more today than yesterday  ♫

363
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:27,004
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Give that to me.

364
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,914
Hey, your Boss can't use her hands right now!

365
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,964
She shouldn't be doing anything! What are you doing?

366
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,434
Are you okay?

367
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:35,224
I told you to just sit still.

368
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:38,014
What... I was cleaning too!

369
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:42,214
How should I put this... I can understand how Jeong Ho hyungnim feels, but—

370
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:45,464
He should know when enough is enough! We can't do our work!

371
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:49,414
What do you mean you can't do your work, though, Hyungnim?

372
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,274
You don't need to know.

373
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:55,814
So I've been curious about this for a while now.

374
00:22:55,814 --> 00:22:59,284
Do you, by chance, like the boss?

375
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:03,894
This guy... forget it.

376
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:08,624
Or perhaps does he like Hyungnim Jeong Ho? Oh, my—

377
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,874
Just go in and do your work.

378
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:16,134
My mom washed it two days ago!

379
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:18,744
If your hair is on the oily side, then shouldn't you wash it at least once a day?

380
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:20,664
How often someone decides to wash their hair

381
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:23,204
is something that should be decided solely by that person alone.

382
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:26,134
Don't you know about a person's right to self-determination of the disposition of their life and body?

383
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:27,554
It's a constitutional right!

384
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:29,954
You don't have the right to infringe on someone else's rights.

385
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,984
The smell coming from the top of your head,

386
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,394
based on Article 35 of the Constitutional Law, which expresses

387
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:35,634
the right of a person to live in a healthy and pleasant environment,

388
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:37,234
is infringing on that very right.

389
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:39,404
Then leave! You can leave then!

390
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:42,464
Then get away from the smell from my head!

391
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:52,334
How long are you planning to keep making a fuss like this?

392
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,844
Until you're safe.

393
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:56,274
I told you, I'll take care of my own safety.

394
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,064
I think you must be misunderstanding something.

395
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,574
I haven't forgiven you.

396
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:04,754
You deceiving me for 17 years...

397
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:07,934
When I think about how you would have felt as you did that,

398
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,124
it just hurts.

399
00:24:11,124 --> 00:24:13,184
So I decided to forgive you.

400
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:16,244
Because if I hate you, it hurts too much.

401
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:20,984
But... We can't do our work!

402
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:25,894
How can I be like this with you, knowing how my dad passed away?

403
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:28,304
♫  That's okay too  ♫

404
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:32,374
To be like this with you as if nothing happened... it pains me.

405
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:37,644
So... please stop this and leave.

406
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,954
♫  Let's breathe deeply and cry it out  ♫

407
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:43,174
- Yoo Ri— 
 - I'm begging you.

408
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:45,104
Please just leave.

409
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:52,204
♫  I will stay by your side now  ♫

410
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:55,904
♫  I will hold your hand  ♫

411
00:24:55,904 --> 00:25:02,454
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

412
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:06,804
♫  Once some time passes  ♫

413
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:13,624
♫  Be brave and just like you did before  ♫

414
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:18,144
♫  Look at me and smile  ♫

415
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:19,784
Can you come straight to...

416
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:24,604
Yoo Ri's house?

417
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,604
♫  I will stay by your side now  ♫

418
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:28,674
Kim Yoo Ri.

419
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:32,314
♫  I will hold your hand  ♫

420
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:35,134
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

421
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:36,994
It's okay, it's okay.

422
00:25:38,314 --> 00:25:39,834
It's okay, it's okay.

423
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:45,884
♫  Once some time passes, be brave  ♫

424
00:25:45,884 --> 00:25:48,524
Yeah, cry. Cry it out.

425
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:54,714
♫  And just like you did before, look at me and smile  ♫

426
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:59,474
But... is it okay for you to leave your baby at home to be here?

427
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,864
You're my baby, too.

428
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:04,654
I feel sorry for not knowing earlier that you were hurting like this.

429
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:08,374
Why are you trying to make someone cry again?

430
00:26:09,894 --> 00:26:12,164
You're very scared, right?

431
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:14,204
It's okay.

432
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:17,144
Consultations or whatever, I'm so scared that

433
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:20,384
I want to quit everything and stay hiding at home...

434
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:22,354
Yeah.

435
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:25,594
And I'm also so angry that

436
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:28,314
I want to get in my car right now and crash it. But...

437
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:32,964
I'm going to endure it.

438
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,834
If I break down, then I'll be losing.

439
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:39,114
I refuse to show that to him.

440
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,424
Of course. You need to endure.

441
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:43,194
You can do it!

442
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:59,714
- Looks like you're getting a massage. 
 - Get out!

443
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:01,664
Where do you think this is that you think you can come in here?

444
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:02,844
Get out.

445
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:06,484
You bastards... Where do you think this is that you think you can come in here?

446
00:27:06,484 --> 00:27:09,114
And Father, you need to relax as well.

447
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:12,014
You're going to collapse again at this rate.

448
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:14,144
Crazy bastard...

449
00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:16,154
I shouldn't have brought someone like you in!

450
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:18,834
Again, again! You're saying things that you don't really mean.

451
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,574
You've profited so much from using me.

452
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:25,344
The fact that you're alive like this is thanks to me!

453
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:30,244
At this shareholders' meeting,

454
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:33,934
the idea of dismissing you as the chairman came up, Father.

455
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,364
I mean, I, too,

456
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:39,594
don't want to steal Dohan Group away from you like this, Father.

457
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:42,764
Well...

458
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:48,244
I'll reconsider...

459
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:52,304
if you start treating me like a son from now on.

460
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:57,234
There's no one in the world who would take in a monster as a son!

461
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:00,944
A monster...

462
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:05,004
Well, of course...

463
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:07,384
Seeing how the person who made me...

464
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,834
is disgusted by me...

465
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,284
That would make me a monster.

466
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:16,724
Watch your health.

467
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:19,564
If you don't want to get eaten up

468
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,354
by your monster son.

469
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:31,894
Also, a gift for you.

470
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:49,264
That crazy bastard...

471
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:55,974
- This is everything? 
 - I did well, right?

472
00:28:55,974 --> 00:29:00,124
Damn it. How many illegal car businesses are there in South Korea that this is all you can find?

473
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:02,844
I found something for you that even the police couldn't find.

474
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:05,254
How do I go through every single one when there are so many?

475
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:08,004
Then you could narrow your search to the junkyard brokers!

476
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:10,884
Geez, I'm starting to get really sad.

477
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:13,514
You said you already knew who was responsible anyway!

478
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:16,444
You can't do anything with just having a feeling. You know that!

479
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:20,424
Keep searching.

480
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:35,324
What's this... Tsk, tsk.

481
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:44,034
Come into Dohan Group right now!

482
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,834
I told you last time as well, but

483
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:49,674
I have no ties with Dohan Group.

484
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:53,284
Is that why you did this?

485
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:56,774
 While the connection between prosecutors and Chairman Lee Byung Wook of Dohan Group 

486
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:58,204
 is currently under investigation, 

487
00:29:58,204 --> 00:30:01,504
 there are conversations taking place internally within the Group 

488
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:04,234
 regarding dismissing Chairman Lee Byung Wook for stirring up trouble. 

489
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:08,214
I don't know what tricks Lee Pyeon Woong has been playing behind my back,

490
00:30:08,214 --> 00:30:11,304
but it seems everyone is leaning toward him.

491
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:12,774
I'll pass on my shares to you,

492
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:15,664
so just join the company whether it's the legal team or another team.

493
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:18,624
If you're a man, you should have at least some ambition!

494
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,034
I'm sorry but, I really don't have that type of ambition.

495
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:29,524
So are you telling me that you're going to just watch as everything falls into his hands?

496
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:37,314
You and your father are the same.

497
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:40,804
What I'm saying is that both of you aren't able to take advantage even when you're given the opportunity!

498
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:42,694
Even that bastard Kim Seung Woon...

499
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:45,544
He told me to not touch you or your mother.

500
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,954
At that time, I agreed because he kept bothering me about it,

501
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:51,224
but how dare he tell me to not touch people who are in my bloodline!

502
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,874
Isn't that right?

503
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:56,274
What... are you talking about?

504
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:58,174
When I told him I was going to take you guys,

505
00:30:58,174 --> 00:31:00,514
that's when he started cooperating with me.

506
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:02,434
When he first became part of my family,

507
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:05,274
I suppose he had that kind of resolution innately.

508
00:31:05,274 --> 00:31:07,674
You should also consider this carefully.

509
00:31:09,474 --> 00:31:11,644
What in the world are you doing here?

510
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:14,784
Is this what you should say to your father, seeing him for the first time in 10 years?

511
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:17,334
Why are you at my son's house?

512
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,834
He's your son but also my grandson.

513
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:23,314
- Hey, Jeong Ho. Just go upstairs. 
 - There's no need for that.

514
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:27,264
Jeong Ho, you should just consider well about what I told you.

515
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:42,144
I'll explain everything.

516
00:31:42,144 --> 00:31:46,514
No, it was my fault...

517
00:31:47,524 --> 00:31:50,354
for having that old man come to this place.

518
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,904
Hello!

519
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:28,064
Hello!

520
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:34,184
Attorney.

521
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:36,634
Is something wrong?

522
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:41,844
My older brother got  my dad's handwritten will and even got it notarized.

523
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:43,484
I see. Really?

524
00:32:43,484 --> 00:32:46,214
I just can't let them do this to me.

525
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,884
I'll hire you and handle it properly.

526
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,444
Gosh, but in matters like this,

527
00:32:52,444 --> 00:32:55,024
you should probably work with an estate lawyer...

528
00:32:55,024 --> 00:32:57,724
I did meet with other lawyers, but

529
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:00,614
they're so businesslike and dealt with me from a distance.

530
00:33:00,614 --> 00:33:02,654
I didn't like any of them.

531
00:33:02,654 --> 00:33:06,594
I'd like to have you handle it for me.

532
00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:11,244
- Under the circumstances, there isn't much you can— 
 -  Where is she! 

533
00:33:11,244 --> 00:33:12,804
Come out right now!

534
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,984
Sister-in-law!

535
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:17,964
What brings you here, Oppas?

536
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:21,014
I wondered where you've been roaming around lately, leaving Father alone.

537
00:33:21,014 --> 00:33:23,364
I guess you've been seeing a lawyer.

538
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:26,004
While Father is still alive? You must be crazy.

539
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,434
Acting as if you're such a devoted daughter for nursing him a bit.

540
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:30,854
I knew you'd do this.

541
00:33:30,854 --> 00:33:35,684
Since you two were plotting so much, I'm just trying to claim my rights.

542
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:37,054
Your rights?

543
00:33:37,054 --> 00:33:38,944
What rights?

544
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:40,644
What did you do exactly?

545
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,864
How about you, Oppa?

546
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:43,864
What else did you do besides making the company fail?

547
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:47,124
- How dare you. Have you really lost it? 
 - Hold it!

548
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,104
What kind of improper behavior is this!

549
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:50,754
Who the hell are you to butt in, ahjumma?

550
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:53,364
Who the hell do you think you are!

551
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:58,204
Are you the attorney?

552
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:00,444
What did you say to entice my sister?

553
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:02,814
Did you say you'd get her as much as possible?

554
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:04,134
That's right!

555
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:06,404
I plan to take as much as I can.

556
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:08,624
- So get ready! 
 - Sister-in-law!

557
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:11,104
Of course, your brothers will give you what you deserve.

558
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:12,774
You stay out of it, Unni!

559
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:16,074
There is no way my father's assets will end up in your hands!

560
00:34:16,074 --> 00:34:19,564
How dare you push her away! Have you really lost it?

561
00:34:19,564 --> 00:34:21,554
- Hey! 
 - Please don't!

562
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:22,954
Are you crazy?

563
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:24,814
Please stop this!

564
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:26,974
- You must be crazy! 
 - Please stop!

565
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,524
You're dead meat today!

566
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,324
- How dare you! Come here! 
 - Please don't!

567
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:33,604
Oh, my gosh! What's going on here?

568
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,414
- A family feud! 
 - Why are they fighting?

569
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:36,514
Over inheritance.

570
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:39,414
- Shouldn't we call the police? 
 - No.

571
00:34:39,414 --> 00:34:41,844
I'll try to stop them.

572
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,894
What are you doing? Stop it!

573
00:34:45,894 --> 00:34:46,814
Please don't!

574
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:49,064
Listen up, everyone!

575
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:51,684
If you keep this up, I'll call the police!

576
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:54,204
Go for it, man!

577
00:34:55,704 --> 00:34:57,244
It's not going to work.

578
00:34:57,244 --> 00:34:59,504
- Pull Boss out. 
 - Okay.

579
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:02,584
Please stop!

580
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:05,354
Step back. Back, back off.

581
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:08,654
- What the hell! 
 - You'd better stop this.

582
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:10,764
Stop this! Stop it!

583
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:13,854
What do you think you're doing?

584
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:21,184
What the?

585
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:27,974
What the hell are you doing in this sacred cafe!

586
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,014
Fight outside if you want to fight.

587
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:38,844
More and more, I think the Barista is so cool.

588
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:40,444
Pull yourself together.

589
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:43,164
It's not easy...

590
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:54,614
I'm really sorry for displaying such behavior.

591
00:35:54,614 --> 00:35:56,774
Don't worry about it.

592
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:01,684
You must think I'm being shallow, but

593
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:06,904
I'm an ordinary person who's usually not that greedy.

594
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:12,814
During the IMF, my father's company struggled a lot.

595
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:14,444
As a result,

596
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:19,864
I had to give up going to college and helped out my father's business.

597
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:25,364
So, I was finally able to go to college in my 30s.

598
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:34,864
It's a special item.

599
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:36,674
I thought you might need it.

600
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:39,084
Thank you, Eun Kang.

601
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:50,364
I thought you might need it.

602
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:51,494
And?

603
00:36:51,494 --> 00:36:54,034
So you went to college, then what happened?

604
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:57,784
The family of the man I was going to marry at the time

605
00:36:57,784 --> 00:36:59,684
opposed me because

606
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:03,104
I said I wanted to study instead of having a baby.

607
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,134
Because of their opposition, I couldn't even get married.

608
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:08,234
They're totally stuffy.

609
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:11,834
Good riddance! Why bother marrying into a family like that?

610
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:17,994
And after that, my mother fell ill.

611
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:21,254
I took care of my mother.

612
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:23,724
All the family thought it was a given.

613
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,604
Even I did.

614
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:29,364
Since I'm not married and don't have any kids,

615
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:31,274
and since I'm a daughter...

616
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:33,734
Since I'm a woman...

617
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,404
but then...

618
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:40,974
But your mother was sick for too long, I see...

619
00:37:42,924 --> 00:37:45,434
It says so on your face.

620
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,634
She was bedridden for 10 years.

621
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:53,554
 Mom. 

622
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:55,134
 Have some tangerine. 

623
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,824
 You like tangerines. 

624
00:37:56,824 --> 00:37:58,124
 Mom! 

625
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:00,664
 - We're here! 
 - I'm here, too! 

626
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:03,004
 Aigoo, you look good, Mom. 

627
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:08,954
 Until the day she passed, she called out for my oldest brother. 

628
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:13,714
She couldn't even see and asked for my brothers so desperately.

629
00:38:13,714 --> 00:38:16,184
It's the same right now.

630
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:18,734
I'm the one nursing him.

631
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:23,644
But my father wants to pass on his assets only to my brothers.

632
00:38:23,644 --> 00:38:25,354
But you know...

633
00:38:25,354 --> 00:38:28,874
I'm the one who worked at my father's business

634
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:32,044
and who took care of my mother during the time my family struggled the most.

635
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:34,104
No one told me to do it.

636
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,104
Being sacrificial? That?

637
00:38:36,104 --> 00:38:37,924
Yes, I did it on my own.

638
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:42,904
But since I continued to live like a fool like that,

639
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,694
everyone treats me like a fool.

640
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:52,334
So I'm trying not to be like that this time around.

641
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:56,354
I understand.

642
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:58,944
You're doing the right thing.

643
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:16,494
If your goal isn't to take the most of your father's inheritance

644
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:21,884
but to receive a fair amount of your inheritance and your elective share.

645
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,874
I'll help you.

646
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:25,814
Really?

647
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,304
You made the right decision!

648
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:31,954
Right on! There's nothing she can't do with your help, Attorney!

649
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:35,134
She's very famous, you know.

650
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:37,674
- Then, to commemorate, let's toast! 
 - Cheers.

651
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:41,184
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

652
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:47,454
 When I told him I was going to take you guys, 

653
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:50,124
 that's when he started cooperating with me. 

654
00:39:55,074 --> 00:39:57,094
 In the end, it was all you. 

655
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,484
 Whatever you say... 

656
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:00,454
 I have no regrets about the decision I made back then. 

657
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:06,954
 I don't know what it is you're striving to protect but I don't think it's the law. 

658
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:23,704
Mom!

659
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:25,604
Mom?

660
00:40:34,754 --> 00:40:38,400
♫  Going on a pheasant hunt!  ♫

661
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:44,104
♫  Pheasant, pheasant, pheasant, pheasant, going on a pheasant hunt!  ♫

662
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:45,880
♫  Hoiya!  ♫

663
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,730
♫  Hoiya!  ♫

664
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:51,994
♫  Hoiya!  ♫

665
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:57,584
That jerk, that jerk, that jerk!

666
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:59,404
That jerk...

667
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,424
What are you all doing?

668
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:12,434
Is it you?

669
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:16,533
Causing my sister here to shed tears?

670
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:17,733
Mom...

671
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:19,978
He looks like my son...

672
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,067
But my son would never do that.

673
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:24,037
Mom!

674
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:28,443
Hey, how can you drink when your arm is like that?

675
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:31,133
See? This is how he is, Unni!

676
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:32,823
- Un— 
 - Whenever he sees me,

677
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,863
he tries to lecture me all the time!

678
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:38,533
He gets all angry and he tries to control me!

679
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:41,163
You can't see a guy like that!

680
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:45,063
That's all because his family didn't teach him well!

681
00:41:45,063 --> 00:41:49,403
Why? I like guys like him.

682
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:53,053
That's why your life sucks.

683
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,903
You should pick and choose what you like.

684
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:57,163
You'd better watch it!

685
00:41:57,163 --> 00:42:00,343
Don't let my sister shed tears! Do it right!

686
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:01,863
Got that?

687
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:05,223
My unni is so cool! Great job!

688
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,870
Good job!

689
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:11,093
All right.

690
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:13,243
Oh, my. Aigoo.

691
00:42:13,243 --> 00:42:17,133
How could that fit perfectly in your hands?

692
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:22,753
Give me a moment. I'll mix it for you.

693
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:29,683
Hyung, this is no time for you to be mixing makguksu.

694
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,823
Well, you know, the alcohol is perfectly ripened.

695
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:36,083
So tasty. You want a drink?

696
00:42:38,543 --> 00:42:42,703
Mom. Mom, try to stand on your legs.

697
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:46,743
Gosh, no one gets wasted like this at your age!

698
00:42:46,743 --> 00:42:48,963
Be careful. Careful, careful.

699
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:52,783
It's been a while since I heard my son nagging.

700
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:55,823
I'll get you a glass of water.

701
00:42:57,763 --> 00:43:01,993
Son, I'm sorry.

702
00:43:02,643 --> 00:43:05,313
Why would you be sorry, Mom?

703
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:10,983
My son must've struggled a lot by himself.

704
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:31,353
Now that I've met his mother, it feels real to me.

705
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:33,223
What does?

706
00:43:33,223 --> 00:43:38,383
The fact that Jeong Ho is Dohan Group's grandson.

707
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:43,263
Oh, yeah. You're in the same place.

708
00:43:45,763 --> 00:43:47,703
Dr. Park.

709
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:52,423
Do you think sins are inherited?

710
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:57,003
I mean, money and debts

711
00:43:57,003 --> 00:44:01,083
aren't the only things we inherit from our parents.

712
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:03,303
Our personalities,

713
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:05,573
habits,

714
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:09,193
and we even inherit illnesses.

715
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:13,803
I wonder how much of ourselves is in them.

716
00:44:13,803 --> 00:44:16,933
I just thought of that.

717
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:25,383
But do you think children could be truly free from the parents' sins?

718
00:44:25,383 --> 00:44:28,543
If one grew up with the privileges

719
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,533
that derived from the parents' wrongdoings...

720
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:35,493
I'm sure he grew up with pain and confusion as well.

721
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:40,853
If sins are inherited, I'm sure the guilt is passed down as well.

722
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:43,843
Why the talk of guilt-by-association in 2022?

723
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:46,693
The faces and behaviors may resemble the parents,

724
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:50,123
but there is a vast difference between parents and children.

725
00:44:50,123 --> 00:44:53,303
They can't understand each other even if they live together.

726
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,093
Don't you think so?

727
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:59,263
Once the child is all grown up, you have to see them as a stranger.

728
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,793
Whether they turn out well or not, you just can't control each other.

729
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:06,713
That's what I'm saying.

730
00:45:08,563 --> 00:45:12,703
So, don't overgeneralize everyone.

731
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:18,923
I may not know much, but I'm sure he struggles a lot, too.

732
00:45:25,383 --> 00:45:29,333
Unni, I like you.

733
00:45:30,883 --> 00:45:32,533
You smell good.

734
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,503
Gosh, ticklish. Ticklish, ticklish, ticklish.

735
00:45:34,503 --> 00:45:39,273
Gosh, it's ticklish! Don't, don't, don't!

736
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,703
You go home.

737
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,223
I'll just see you fall asleep.

738
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:51,713
Go home! I'm not drunk.

739
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:54,353
You're drunk. You are.

740
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,563
See?

741
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:03,923
I'm perfectly fine.

742
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:08,973
You're drunk.

743
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:13,673
Don't you dare seduce me just because I'm drunk.

744
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:16,283
See? Just now...

745
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:19,883
your smile was so cool... you...

746
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:28,193
You...

747
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:30,523
What you said last time...

748
00:46:30,523 --> 00:46:33,043
Tell it to me again.

749
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:36,793
I just heard it in passing, then.

750
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,593
What you said...

751
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:42,173
Tell it to me again.

752
00:46:43,923 --> 00:46:48,373
Saying that I love you?

753
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:53,003
♫  Love must be coming   ♫

754
00:46:53,003 --> 00:46:55,860
♫  My heart must keep  ♫

755
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,590
♫  looking for you  ♫

756
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:05,143
♫  When I think about you  ♫

757
00:47:05,143 --> 00:47:08,300
♫  The spring that resembles you   ♫

758
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,470
♫   comes to my heart  ♫

759
00:47:11,473 --> 00:47:14,263
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

760
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:17,463
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

761
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:20,403
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

762
00:47:20,403 --> 00:47:23,880
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

763
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:28,820
♫   Tonight when the stars shine  ♫

764
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,130
♫  with you filling my arms  ♫

765
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:36,133
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

766
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:39,533
Right now...

767
00:47:39,533 --> 00:47:41,783
I'm holding myself back with all my might.

768
00:47:41,783 --> 00:47:44,193
♫  Tonight when you are shining  ♫

769
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:47,223
Not now, but...

770
00:47:47,223 --> 00:47:51,413
when you could truly forgive me...

771
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:53,663
Then...

772
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:56,473
When would that be, though?

773
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:00,963
When would such a day come?

774
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:02,563
When is that going to be...

775
00:48:02,563 --> 00:48:06,793
♫  On your lips  ♫

776
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:09,033
When is that going to be...

777
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:12,313
♫   I'll place a kiss full of love  ♫

778
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:15,043
♫  Because it's my love for you  ♫

779
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:18,133
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

780
00:48:18,133 --> 00:48:21,073
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

781
00:48:21,073 --> 00:48:24,733
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

782
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:50,153
 Saying that I love you? 

783
00:48:53,953 --> 00:48:55,063
No...

784
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:57,333
There's no way that I could be such a provocative person.

785
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,623
Yeah... There's no way.

786
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:02,173
I smelled bean sprout soup,

787
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:05,133
so I thought maybe she's finally going live like a human being.

788
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:07,443
Or so I thought.

789
00:49:12,513 --> 00:49:15,753
But when I saw that you were here, I was a bit taken aback.

790
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:18,153
But it's so nice to see you.

791
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,033
I'm sorry, Mother.

792
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:24,473
I know it's not ideal, but I couldn't leave her alone because I was worried.

793
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:26,493
No, it's all right! I'm actually grateful,

794
00:49:26,493 --> 00:49:29,383
since I don't have to worry as much because of you.

795
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:32,083
Oh! Mother!

796
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,143
You're going to put those in now? Shall I put them in later?

797
00:49:34,143 --> 00:49:36,413
For what?

798
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,333
Is this a home?

799
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,313
Is this the home of a human being?

800
00:49:48,313 --> 00:49:49,643
I agree with you, yes.

801
00:49:49,643 --> 00:49:51,823
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed...

802
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:56,203
I try not to get angry, but I just can't control myself when I'm here.

803
00:49:57,373 --> 00:49:59,623
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

804
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,893
Oh, Mother.

805
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:06,463
I... will be on my way then.

806
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,483
Oh, okay.

807
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:09,243
Jeong Ho, you've got a lot on your hands.

808
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:13,513
That problem of a girl chugging alcohol even when both her wrists are broken.

809
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:16,133
I don't know who she takes after.

810
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:18,023
I'll be on my way.

811
00:50:18,023 --> 00:50:19,863
I heated the soup so please it before it gets cold.

812
00:50:19,863 --> 00:50:22,543
Okay. Thank you!

813
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:27,203
That was so embarrassing...

814
00:50:27,203 --> 00:50:29,313
Girl! I can see you!

815
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:31,373
Is your house a secret garden?

816
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:34,083
Everything is blooming in there!

817
00:50:42,503 --> 00:50:45,293
I guess you are human too and know what's embarrassing?

818
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:48,423
You shouldn't be so like that to Jeong Ho.

819
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:51,853
I know... that I shouldn't be doing that.

820
00:50:53,403 --> 00:50:56,523
There isn't... anything between you two, right?

821
00:50:56,523 --> 00:51:00,063
I entered through the door in the morning, and Jeong Ho was cooking soup over there.

822
00:51:00,063 --> 00:51:01,903
How surprised do you think I was?

823
00:51:01,903 --> 00:51:04,213
What if there is something between us? What, what are you going to do about it?

824
00:51:04,213 --> 00:51:05,573
I would be so happy!

825
00:51:05,573 --> 00:51:08,673
I would have to post up a placard in our neighborhood or something.

826
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:12,913
Mom, you really have no problem with Jeong Ho?

827
00:51:12,913 --> 00:51:14,213
What's wrong with Jeong Ho?

828
00:51:14,213 --> 00:51:16,443
Where can you find someone like Jeong Ho?

829
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:20,603
You can say that even after seeing on the news whose son he is?

830
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:28,023
Are you still not able to forgive the world for your dad's death?

831
00:51:28,863 --> 00:51:31,533
You speak as if you could, Mom.

832
00:51:33,863 --> 00:51:38,563
Your dad only passed away unfairly.

833
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:44,843
Gosh, there probably wasn't anyone like him who always had a smiling face.

834
00:51:45,973 --> 00:51:49,993
But, if someone like that

835
00:51:49,993 --> 00:51:53,693
only leaves behind a sense of injustice,

836
00:51:54,873 --> 00:51:58,253
then your father would really feel that to be unfair, even in death.

837
00:52:02,463 --> 00:52:04,773
You're right.

838
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:07,413
My dad also passed on to me

839
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:09,933
beauty, humor,

840
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:12,503
perseverance, and boldness.

841
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:13,923
Yeah.

842
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:17,433
That's all left in our bodies.

843
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:22,943
So don't live as an unfairly wronged person, Yoo Ri.

844
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:26,713
♫  I will hold your hand  ♫

845
00:52:26,713 --> 00:52:32,643
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

846
00:52:32,643 --> 00:52:37,483
That... would be what your dad would want least for you.

847
00:52:37,483 --> 00:52:49,723
♫  Be brave and just like you did before, look at me and smile  ♫

848
00:52:49,723 --> 00:52:50,903
Doctor!

849
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:52,443
Please come here!

850
00:52:52,443 --> 00:52:54,683
Dad! Don't go!

851
00:52:54,683 --> 00:52:56,003
Dad, please don't!

852
00:52:56,003 --> 00:52:58,213
Dad! Dad!

853
00:52:58,213 --> 00:53:01,073
Check the patient's eyes.

854
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:02,723
Dad...

855
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:03,843
Dad...

856
00:53:03,843 --> 00:53:05,563
♫  Let's breathe deeply and cry it out  ♫

857
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:11,153
 So don't live as a unfairly wronged person, Yoo Ri. 

858
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:17,413
 That would be what your dad would want least for you. 

859
00:53:17,413 --> 00:53:23,473
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

860
00:53:23,473 --> 00:53:26,193
- Ms. Hui Yeon. 
 - Attorney...

861
00:53:26,193 --> 00:53:27,983
What do I do...

862
00:53:27,983 --> 00:53:30,923
My brothers won't pick up their phones...

863
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:33,733
What do I do...

864
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:41,393
♫  And just like you did before, look at me and smile  ♫

865
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:43,883
 

866
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:45,343
Ms. Hui Yeon!

867
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,583
Attorney!

868
00:53:49,803 --> 00:53:51,923
I'll try calling them.

869
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:53,963
Don't worry.

870
00:54:01,893 --> 00:54:04,213
Wow.

871
00:54:04,213 --> 00:54:08,523
Now she's calling using an unknown number?

872
00:54:08,523 --> 00:54:12,533
Are you really going to be throwing away all the furniture?

873
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:16,153
Is it really okay for you to get rid of all your father's stuff and start construction like this?

874
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:17,653
It's not a problem.

875
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:22,713
There's no way my dad will ever be coming back here anyway.

876
00:54:22,713 --> 00:54:25,123
Sir, it seems like you're going to have to come here for a second.

877
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:26,893
Okay.

878
00:54:26,893 --> 00:54:28,413
Shall we go?

879
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:29,743
Why? What's the issue?

880
00:54:29,743 --> 00:54:31,543
I think you're going to have to see it.

881
00:54:31,543 --> 00:54:33,373
What...

882
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:57,733
Dad...

883
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,453
Dad...

884
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:04,333
No, Dad. Don't speak.

885
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:08,633
I know everything, so you don't have to say anything.

886
00:55:08,633 --> 00:55:12,543
I'm sorry, Dad! I was wrong...

887
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:14,853
I won't accept anything, so, please...

888
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,563
Don't leave me behind!

889
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:20,763
Dad...

890
00:55:20,763 --> 00:55:23,353
Dad...

891
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,483
Dad... Dad!

892
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:28,973
It made me think a lot about my dad.

893
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:33,353
I didn't get to say a final goodbye like that.

894
00:55:34,893 --> 00:55:39,703
My father passed on a lot of things to me.

895
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:44,373
But I realized I've been covering all of that with a sense of being unfairly wronged.

896
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:48,683
So I knew that I needed to

897
00:55:48,683 --> 00:55:51,093
go through with meeting him, despite having pushed it back for so long.

898
00:56:24,543 --> 00:56:28,893
You know that I am Jeong Ho's friend, right?

899
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:32,193
Article 155, Clause 4 of the Criminal Code,

900
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:35,943
"There shall be no punishment imposed for a person who commits the crime of destroying evidence"

901
00:56:35,943 --> 00:56:38,593
"for a relative or a family member."

902
00:56:38,593 --> 00:56:40,323
The statute of limitations had passed,

903
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:43,373
but destroying evidence for one's father-in-law and brother-in-law

904
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:46,473
is not even punishable by South Korean law.

905
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,403
It makes no sense, doesn't it?

906
00:56:50,203 --> 00:56:53,863
To you I've got nothing I can say besides that I'm sorry.

907
00:56:53,863 --> 00:56:57,773
I'm sorry, but I'll be the only one talking.

908
00:56:57,773 --> 00:57:00,463
If only you didn't omit the evidence,

909
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:04,493
the incident wouldn't have been made out to have been caused by my father's mistake.

910
00:57:04,493 --> 00:57:09,283
Then my mom wouldn't have had to waste several years in lawsuits trying to get my father's case acknowledged as an industrial accident.

911
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:13,763
Then my mom wouldn't have had to collapse from working day and night because we had no money.

912
00:57:14,853 --> 00:57:20,343
Why did my family have to suffer the consequences of ahjussi's wrongdoing?

913
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:23,373
I am really sorry.

914
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:26,683
But you know what's more unfair?

915
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:31,103
"Even if the court isn't able to always make the right judgment,"

916
00:57:31,103 --> 00:57:34,013
"the court follows the right procedures."

917
00:57:35,093 --> 00:57:37,533
I believed what you said at that time, ahjussi,

918
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:41,323
and thought to myself that you tried your best as a prosecutor.

919
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:46,313
And even when the world disappointed me, I lived my life working hard.

920
00:57:47,193 --> 00:57:48,863
Although it's too late,

921
00:57:48,863 --> 00:57:52,443
- I will do all that's in my power to compensate— 
 - And so...

922
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:57,103
All that I've fought and endured felt so false that I wanted to break down.

923
00:57:57,103 --> 00:58:01,033
But it turns out that in every moment that I grit my teeth and endured,

924
00:58:02,323 --> 00:58:05,023
there was Jeong Ho.

925
00:58:06,073 --> 00:58:10,823
Did you know that the punishment that you didn't receive, ahjussi...

926
00:58:10,823 --> 00:58:13,373
Jeong Ho has been receiving it instead?

927
00:58:14,383 --> 00:58:18,753
Did you know that the forgiveness that you haven't sought...

928
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:21,853
Jeong Ho has been seeking in your place.

929
00:58:58,553 --> 00:59:00,923
What's the matter?

930
00:59:00,923 --> 00:59:05,293
I made my decision.

931
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:12,623
Even though sins are not inherited, a sense of unfairness does get inherited.

932
00:59:12,623 --> 00:59:18,263
But I don't want to be unhappy for the rest of my life because of this.

933
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:23,563
And I don't want this to be the reason why I can't go to you.

934
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:27,383
So I'm trying to resolve it.

935
00:59:28,613 --> 00:59:31,133
The feeling of unfairness that I've inherited...

936
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:33,943
The guilt that you've inherited...

937
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:37,703
Let's get rid of that together.

938
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:42,063
How?

939
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:44,713
Let's bring the people who did what was wrong to court,

940
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:49,713
and make sure that nobody ever goes through what my dad went through.

941
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,543
Do you want to try this together?

942
01:00:15,663 --> 01:00:17,463
I'd love to.

943
01:00:18,813 --> 01:00:20,483
Let's try it.

944
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:28,900


945
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:33,233
♫  So many awkward days  ♫

946
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:37,033
♫  between you and me  ♫

947
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:44,790
♫  I want to protect you now  ♫

948
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:51,373
♫  I must like you 

949
01:00:51,373 --> 01:00:58,790
♫  more than anyone else  ♫

950
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,343
♫  I guess I've come to like you  ♫

951
01:01:02,343 --> 01:01:13,123
♫  Maybe I love you, more today than yesterday  ♫

952
01:01:13,123 --> 01:01:15,233
♫  I guess I've come to love you more now than back then  ♫

953
01:01:15,233 --> 01:01:17,853
   

954
01:01:17,853 --> 01:01:19,103
 It's a business agreement. 

955
01:01:19,103 --> 01:01:23,633
 Until the Lee Pyun Woon situation gets resolved 30 cm is about... this much. 

956
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:25,323
 Then I also have a condition. 

957
01:01:25,323 --> 01:01:26,573
 What are you doing all the way here? 

958
01:01:26,573 --> 01:01:29,833
 We're... here to screw with you. 

959
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,653
 Sorry! 

960
01:01:31,653 --> 01:01:33,643
 How are you going to repay them? How! 

961
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:35,673
 I know that you like me. 

962
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:38,003
 Answer me. From when did you start liking me? 

963
01:01:38,003 --> 01:01:40,373
 It's after you said you liked me. 

964
01:01:40,373 --> 01:01:41,613
 That's a lie, isn't it? 

965
01:01:41,613 --> 01:01:44,073
 Stop lying to me, Kim Jeong Ho. 

966
01:01:44,073 --> 01:01:45,283
 I like you. 

967
01:01:45,283 --> 01:01:49,283
 It was you from the beginning, and it's only, always been you. 

968
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:53,738
♫  I must like you, more than anyone else  ♫
