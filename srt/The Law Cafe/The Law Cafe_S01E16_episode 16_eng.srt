1
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,370
   

2
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,160
Get him!

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,950
Kim Jeong Ho!

4
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,470
Let go!

5
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,770
Hold still!

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,700
Hey...

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,010
Are you Jesus or something? Why defend that a**hole?

8
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,870
Hospital... Let's go to the hospital first.

9
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,840
How is Mother? Is she okay?

10
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,633
See?

11
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,173
I told you...

12
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,923
I'd keep the promise I made to you.

13
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:10,003
Jeong Ho!

14
00:01:10,643 --> 00:01:12,023
Jeong Ho! Jeong Ho...

15
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,183
Jeong Ho...

16
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:16,233
Come over here. Here!

17
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:17,623
Hurry.

18
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:29,343
   

19
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,513
Hello.

20
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,463
How's Jeong Ho?

21
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,213
He's still in surgery.

22
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,483
Luckily, the wound isn't too deep.

23
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,633
What about Yoo Ri? Is she okay?

24
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,253
She's probably somewhere holding her breath.

25
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,143
Yoo Ri.

26
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,173
Yeah?

27
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:51,813
You're here.

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,080
Fortunately, there wasn't much damage to the internal organs

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
so we just needed to stitch up his peritoneum.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,130
The surgery went well.

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,410
I think he'll just be hospitalized for a few days for observation,

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,550
Thank you.

33
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,450
Thank you.

34
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,370
It's okay.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,320
He said the surgery went well.

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,310
It's okay. Don't worry.

37
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,640
Kim Jeong Ho is not going to die.

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,580
Everything will go well.

39
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:50,070
I think this was the first time...

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,820
I've never worked in such a dynamic workplace.

41
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,030
So...

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,430
on normal days,

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,410
whenever I'm next to the boss, how can I put this...

44
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,940
It's feels like like facing a storm.

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,700
But even so,

46
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,780
this particular time topped everything else.

47
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,960


48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,020
Hyungnim!

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,340
Just stay there. I'll take care of it.

50
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,950
All right.

51
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,680
Hyungnim. H-H-How do you feel?

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,620
I wonder if it hurts this badly to come back to life from near death.

53
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,380
Whoa, seriously.

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,610
When you first arrived at the hospital, I really thought you might pass away like this

55
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,220
and so I was so scared...

56
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,970
Were you just scared?

57
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,090
What about holding my hand and praying for me?

58
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,140
Of course, I did!

59
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,440
I held hands with the Boss and prayed for you.

60
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,130
The two of you were holding hands?

61
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,230
Come on, Hyungnim!

62
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,080
But is it okay for me to see where you got stabbed?

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,030
Here?

64
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,990
Hey, Honeybee...

65
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,930
Has your ability to read the situation stopped developing?

66
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,280
It's just that I've never seen anyone who's been stabbed before.

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,850
I just got out of surgery!

68
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,490
Then how about after it heals up a bit?

69
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,570
Jeong Ho!

70
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,990
Hey!

71
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,740
You're lucky that your wound was shallow.

72
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,360
It could have ended really badly for you!

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,080
I know. Of all the people in the world, I wouldn't have thought that

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,770
Hyungnim would get stabbed...

75
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,370
Why? I thought he would get stabbed one day.

76
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,650
Hey.

77
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,000
What is your impression of me?

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,220
Are you okay, Jeong Ho?

79
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,050
Should I ask them to give you a bit more painkillers?

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,290
No, I'll be fine if I just don't talk and be still.

81
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,180
Why don't you stop acting tough and just take some?

82
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,180
- Yeah, you should. 
 - Yeah, Hyung. Just take some.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,890
Oh, the Boss was awake while we were sleeping.

84
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,910
She said if something went wrong with you, she'd go and kill Lee Pyeon Woong.

85
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,370
So she went to the police and threw a fit there before she passed out.

86
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,220
   

87
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,190
 Oh, Hyung? 

88
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,900
 He left a while ago. 

89
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,780
 Didn't he come back yet? 

90
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:36,260
Hello.

91
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,540
Did Patient Kim Jeong Ho go in for a test?

92
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,940
♫  The cold wind brushed my shoulders  ♫

93
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,930
Kim Jeong Ho!

94
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,360
♫  on a night which only evokes painful memories  ♫

95
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,020
♫  Do you remember? You approach quietly.  ♫

96
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,490
♫  When you take my hand  ♫

97
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,120
♫  the frozen tears flow.  ♫

98
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,230
You supposedly didn't get any sleep last night.

99
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,400
Are you okay?

100
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
♫  Can you understand how I feel?  ♫

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,580
♫  Can you feel it?  ♫

102
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,360
♫  Can you look at me with warm eyes?  ♫

103
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,330
♫  It is like my long awaited refuge./i&gt; ♫ 

104
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,850
I'm sorry for having you go through what happened yesterday.

105
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,900
As a result of what happened this time,

106
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,620
if you decide that you no longer want to see me or my family again—

107
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,240
Please don't say stuff like that.

108
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,760
How can I live without seeing you?

109
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,560
Did you think that I would like it

110
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,720
if you go around and fix everything by yourself?

111
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,110
Did you think I would say, "Thank you for saving my mom"?

112
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,210
Jeong Ho...

113
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,770
why don't you know that when you hurt,

114
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,220
I hurt even more?

115
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,680
So, please...

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,970
please don't get hurt anymore.

117
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,460
♫  My heart is shedding happy tears. ♫

118
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,900
Okay.

119
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm sorry for everything.

120
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,530
From now on, stop hurting by yourself

121
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,960
and stop trying to fix everything on your own.

122
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,820
Promise me.

123
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,170
Okay. I understand.

124
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,390
I promise.

125
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,540
I love you, Jeong Ho.

126
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,840
I love you.

127
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,170
I love you.

128
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,750
I love you.

129
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,010
♫  Look at me with warm eyes.  ♫

130
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:11,000
♫  You're my last refuge.  ♫

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,650
♫  Carefully open it  ♫

132
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,620
♫  Can you feel my heart?  ♫

133
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,960
   

134
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,666
   

135
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,500
 Going into hiding after the case of sexual favors at the Gwangpyeong villa was revealed, 

136
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,610
 Dohan Construction's CEO Lee Pyeon Woong was arrested by the police late last night. 

137
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,930
 Even in the process of being apprehended, he held a hostage 

138
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,470
 and was finally arrested after two hours confronting the police. 

139
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,320
 Lee was not only charged with the sexual favors incident at the Gwangpyeong villa, 

140
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,550
 but also with embezzlement, breach of trust, and instigating murder. 

141
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,940
 Thus, it appears difficult for him to avoid a severe sentence. 

142
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,240
 The prosecution is saying that the details of the case... 

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,910
What are you looking at that for? You saw it all live.

144
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,220
 The concrete evidence... 

145
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,430
Let's go.

146
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,840
 They say there's no possibility he would receive a light sentence. 

147
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,610
Hey, Jeong Ho.

148
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,650
Oh, how did you guys come here?

149
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,690
"How did you guys come here?"

150
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,800
Woo Jin!

151
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,390
What should I do about a son who doesn't call even when he gets stabbed in the stomach?

152
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,930
Gosh, it's not like I can give him a beating...

153
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,800
He's already pretty beat up...

154
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
I didn't call because I was afraid you would be worried, Mom.

155
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,870
We need to worry! We're your parents!

156
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,680
How do you feel?

157
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,570
I'm doing better than I thought.

158
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,640
And is your mother okay as well?

159
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,130
Yes. I think she might be discharged from the hospital before Jeong Ho.

160
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,650
Okay.

161
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,870
That's really good to hear.

162
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,840
While that bastard Pyeon Woong was doing all of this,

163
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,730
what was I doing...

164
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,060
Come on, Mom. Don't uselessly blame yourself for it. It has nothing to do with you.

165
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,090
How can it have nothing to do with me when you got hurt like this?

166
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,960
Well, you guys have your conversation.

167
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,310
I'll be on my way...

168
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,600
Yes, I'll be on my way as well.

169
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,800
No, it's okay. You guys stay.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,340
If I'm here, you won't be able to rest.

171
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,080
So I'll leave.

172
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,190
Take care of yourself.

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,650
Do you want to go home?

174
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,010
When your son is in that state?

175
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,130
Even if he seems uncomfortable,

176
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,200
what good will come of you avoiding him first?

177
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,620
Hyung, go out there and stop them...

178
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,140
Hey, I already received so much scolding. You want me to go and stop them?

179
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,400
- I'll get in trouble again. 
 - Let's stop here.

180
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,930
How long are you going to keep doing whatever your want like this?

181
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,190
Don't you think about Yoo Na?

182
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,340
What?

183
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,730
Do you think I don't think about Yoo Na?

184
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,440
I am thinking about Yoo Na! I am!

185
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,820
So give me some time to think!

186
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,980
Can't you do that thinking with me?

187
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,070
You said you didn't want to think it through with me.

188
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,810
You said you regret living with me.

189
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,080
I've never said anything like that.

190
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,790
How's it any different from you saying that?

191
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,900
This is not why I came back to life...

192
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,930
Isn't that your friend Se Yeon's voice?

193
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,210
Yes. It's Se Yeon and Jin Ki.

194
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,420
   

195
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,250
It seems that resolving both of your problems first

196
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,250
would make things clearer for me as well.

197
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,380
For you?

198
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,600
For you, what?

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,500
There's something like that.

200
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,610
Let's see if either of your situations provides legal standing for a divorce.

201
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,930
Hey. I just said that out of anger. Do you think I really came to you for a divorce?

202
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:39,130
I know. Still, think of it as punishment for daring to even speak of a divorce, and listen to me.

203
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,470
For me, it wasn't out of the heat of the moment.

204
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,920
So tell me.

205
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,270
This is a precedent case on divorce and alimony.

206
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,000
If one spouse has been extremely maltreated by the other spouse

207
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,770
That is

208
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,260
when the individual in a marriage unilaterally receives from one's spouse

209
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,000
assault or abuse, or serious affront where forcing

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,550
the individual to continue their marriage relationship would be cruel.

211
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,830
Also, when there's a serious issue that would make it difficult to continue their marriage.

212
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,400
That is

213
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,010
when the marital relationship has been irretrievably broken

214
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,820
and continuing the marriage becomes an unbearable pain for one spouse.

215
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,540
You did well to come to me

216
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,480
before the issue festered to the point

217
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,500
where being together became an unbearable pain.

218
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,330
Also, my philosophy is to resolve issues before they reach court.

219
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,650
So what are you going to do for us?

220
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,760
 First, we're going to do some retail therapy. 

221
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,790
 Retail therapy? 

222
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,690
- I was looking at this, too! 
 - Oh, really!

223
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,180
It's pretty.

224
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,240
Whoa.

225
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,500
It suits you so well.

226
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,510
It's pretty.

227
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,760
- Thank you. 
 - Oh, thank you.

228
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,770
Thank you.

229
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,070
 Once you fill your brain with some dopamine from spending money, 

230
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,320
 your situation seems a bit different. 

231
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,490
How is it? Doesn't your situation seem a bit different?

232
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,050
No. I can't really tell.

233
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,690
Then eat more.

234
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,110
Everyone seems to be saying that the baby should be raised by the mother.

235
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,560
A baby... can be raised by someone who is freer and more capable.

236
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,400
If your husband is willing to support you like that,

237
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,470
what's the problem?

238
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,920
Honestly, getting hurt by what your mother-in-law said is more of a problem.

239
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,110
Don't you think you should openly talk to Jin Ki about that first?

240
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,950
You still haven't talked to him about that?

241
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,530
Come on! Why can't you say anything?

242
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,160
"Your mom said this to me."

243
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,720
"What she said makes me sad, and I can't deal with it."

244
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,800
Honestly, I'm afraid...

245
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,430
of how he might react.

246
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,500
Will Jin Ki take my side?

247
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,990
There's no other way to know apart from saying it and finding out for yourself.

248
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,760
 You know, right? 

249
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,900
 If you know, tell me why Se Yeon is acting like this. 

250
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,150
 Well, your mom... 

251
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,780
 It seems she has spoken to Se Yeon harshly. 

252
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,500
 What did she say to her? 

253
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,500
 "If it wasn't for me, do you even have a mother to ask?" 

254
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,370
 "You don't even have your mother here..." 

255
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,450
 "You're being greedy trying to raise a child and work at the same time." 

256
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,030
 I think she's spoken to her like that. 

257
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,090
I'm sorry for making you hear that.

258
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,720
I'm sorry for causing heartache, my darling.

259
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,180
I know Mother said that because she was upset, too.

260
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,650
There's no need for you to try to understand everything, Honey.

261
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,800
- I'll take care of it, so— 
 - What...

262
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,010
made me so sad was that

263
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,510
what Mother said made me angry

264
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,020
but nothing she said was wrong.

265
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,810
What part?

266
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,860
That you've broken my wings?

267
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,250
You love making food for people,

268
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,420
but you're home all day, making baby food for Yu Na.

269
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,440
I don't know if I have the right to have you keep sacrificing yourself like this.

270
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,270
No!

271
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,200
Honey.

272
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,430
Making food that will go into our Yu Na's mouth

273
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,190
is more important than making food at the restaurant!

274
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,810
That's why I'm doing this.

275
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,810
If it really becomes too much for me to handle, then I'll make sure to tell you, Honey.

276
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,280
Right now is not the time.

277
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,210
Also, you can't break my wings

278
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,410
in the first place, Honey. Because...

279
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,550
I'm a beast with no wings. Look.

280
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,960
You want to see it?

281
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,430
I can't!

282
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,940
You laughed.

283
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,850
Honey.

284
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,440
Se Yeon.

285
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,180
You are my future and my wings, Honey.

286
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,200
You or Yoo Na not being happy is what breaks my wings.

287
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,950
Yoo Na will grow up really quickly.

288
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,100
The ahjummas that I met at the playground told me that

289
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,910
preschool, kindergarten, school...

290
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,380
It will pass by so quickly, to the point we'll miss it so much.

291
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,930
I'm okay. So let's just endure a bit longer, okay?

292
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,810
I'm sorry.

293
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,750
No, I'm sorrier.

294
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,820
Thanks.

295
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:50,460
I don't know when was the time I spoke more than two sentences with him.

296
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,370
It seems that you two need to have a conversation first somehow.

297
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,480
Even if it leads to an argument, a conversation—

298
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,250
I want to, whether it leads to a fight or not.

299
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,240
But how can I talk to a man who's always trying to avoid everything?

300
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,330
Then I guess we'll just have to physically

301
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,550
tie you guys together.

302
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:28,839
Honey, let's have a talk.

303
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,659
What talk?

304
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,739
If you'll bring up divorce again, I have nothing to say.

305
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,589
Father, I'm sorry.

306
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,309
What in the world are you doing!

307
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,889
I'll come back tomorrow for the handcuffs.

308
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,789
Have a good time together.

309
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:18,499
We're not like kids playing around. What is this?

310
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:22,549
I needed to resort to this to have a conversation with you that lasts more than two sentences.

311
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,859
I told you it's natural.

312
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,679
As a middle-aged couple who already raised their child,

313
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,289
what more do we have to talk about?

314
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:31,949
Are you asking this...

315
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:34,679
because you really don't know what we should talk about?

316
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,409
I thought if you find out everything,

317
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,239
you would be in agony.

318
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,569
And I didn't want to see you like that.

319
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:45,609
Look at what happened to our family as a result!

320
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:49,089
Father and younger brother both became monsters,

321
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,779
and Jeong Ho ran around trying to catch them

322
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,739
and ended up showing up before me being wounded!

323
00:21:55,969 --> 00:22:00,249
My father, my younger brother, and my son are like this...

324
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,939
If you abandon me, too,

325
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,569
what do you expect me to do?

326
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,969
Why would I abandon you?

327
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:09,799
I did all this so I wouldn't lose you and Jeong Ho.

328
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:15,599
But now, you can't even lift your head to look at Jeong Ho or me!

329
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:49,319
- What are you doing? 
 - Well, I felt like I needed to be doing this.

330
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,589
Just look.

331
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,959
Should we go?

332
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:10,289
Let's go.

333
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,269
Come on, stop it.

334
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,609
I think I found my answer.

335
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,689
It turned out to be guilt.

336
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:42,639
The reason... we can't look at each other anymore.

337
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:47,919
I told him that we should live

338
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,269
each of our lives in our own place with a repentant heart until

339
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,089
we can look at each other without shame.

340
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,849
And he said that he understood.

341
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:01,249
That means...

342
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:05,849
For now, we decided to separate.

343
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,829
What's this?

344
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:32,979
A gift to celebrate leaving the hospital.

345
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,709
If that's the case, I should be the one to give you a gift.

346
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,009
It's so pretty.

347
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:45,139
I told you I'll pick you up at the hospital.

348
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:49,089
Well, I couldn't wait that long. I just missed you so much,

349
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,019
so I just came by myself.

350
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,879
So, while I wasn't around,

351
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,939
looks like you were pretty busy with my mom.

352
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:10,419
I remember you two were fighting and yanking your hair out.

353
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,619
When did you guys get so close?

354
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,969
She came to me for consultation last time.

355
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:20,569
I know.

356
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,329
I heard it all.

357
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:31,369
So, it'd be hard for her to stay with my father, right?

358
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:38,869
Why are you getting all sad about this? I'm their son.

359
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:42,379
Just because. I feel kind of bad about it.

360
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:51,220
♫  After the long rain  ♫

361
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,229
♫  which seemed like it wouldn't cease passed 

362
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:58,749
Well, thanks... for thinking of us and trying your best.

363
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:06,909
♫  I'm lost in the thought of your expression   ♫

364
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:08,899
♫  which you couldn't hide  ♫

365
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:09,719
 Sorry. 

366
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,319
 All right. Let's not do it. 

367
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,349
 I don't like it if you don't like it. 

368
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:15,309
 Going forward, 

369
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:19,069
 I'll never make a promise to you that I couldn't keep. 

370
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:21,559
 See? 

371
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,149
 I told you... 

372
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,949
 I'd keep the promise I made to you. 

373
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,949
Daughter.

374
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,639
It's been a while since I got to lie down with you.

375
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,909
Mom, would you want me to get married?

376
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:04,639
Get up for a second.

377
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:08,289
Jeong Ho is asking you to marry him, huh?

378
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:09,799
Right?

379
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,529
I knew it.

380
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:16,169
So what did you tell him?

381
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,449
That I don't want to.

382
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:21,179
Why not?

383
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,589
Well, things are great right now...

384
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,899
but it will eventually change.

385
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:33,569
Mom, even though Dad couldn't keep his promise to be with you all your life,

386
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,399
how were you able to make another promise, again?

387
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,029
Weren't you scared?

388
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:43,349
What doesn't change forever?

389
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:49,349
It wasn't that I thought things won't ever change and live happily ever after,

390
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,799
but regardless of the end,

391
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,579
I thought that I wanted to go on the journey with him.

392
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,809
Seeing all those changes with him

393
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:03,139
and experiencing everything together.

394
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:11,149
Daughter. There's no need to complicate things.

395
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,049
A field of flowers is nice,

396
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,609
but if he's the one you want to travel a field of dung or thorns,

397
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:19,959
then you go with him!

398
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:25,739
I'll be right back.

399
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:26,839
Where are you going at this hour?

400
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,609
Go to bed first!

401
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,679
Oh, yay!

402
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:46,069
I thought wrong, Jeong Ho.

403
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:49,059
It wasn't about promising to never change.

404
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:55,249
- What did you say? 
 - It was about wanting to see and experience all the changes together.

405
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:58,329
Oh, yes! That's it. That's what it was about!

406
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:00,309
 So, what I'm trying to say is, 

407
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:01,659
 where... 

408
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,429
where are you right now?

409
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:09,779
Kim Jeong Ho!

410
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,909
Weren't you with your mother?

411
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:18,629
I had... something to tell you.

412
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,469
What? What's the matter?

413
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,839
I thought about it.

414
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,289
I want to try everything with you.

415
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,399
Be disappointed because you failed to keep your promise,

416
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,799
fight with you because of differences in how we think,

417
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,749
separate out of the heat of the moment,

418
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:40,089
and have a tearful reconciliation. I want to try it all.

419
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:43,049
Must we go as far as separating?

420
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,469
Unless we both face sudden death at the same time and day,

421
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:48,079
there'll always be a separation of some kind.

422
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,439
But... even if there is an end to us,

423
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,479
and as a result of our end,

424
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:58,379
even if we become sad and miserable,

425
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:03,039
if it's with you,

426
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,009
I want to go on the journey.

427
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:08,690
♫  Tonight when the stars shine  ♫

428
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,060
♫  with you filling my arms  ♫

429
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,769
So...

430
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,219
marry me, Jeong Ho.

431
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:20,810
♫  Tonight when you are shining  ♫

432

♫  with you filling my arms  ♫

433
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:26,979
In an age where people live up to a hundred,

434
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:28,989
have you seriously considered whether the

435
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:31,889
custom of marriage is still valid before making your decision?

436
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:34,469
Yeah.

437
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:38,499
One will have obligations of cohabitation, support, and cooperation,

438
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:42,989
not to mention it is a social covenant to share one's wealth and labor.

439
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,509
You're asking me to marry you knowing all this?

440
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,729
Yeah.

441
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:52,069

♫  Depite the heavy rain  ♫

444
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:58,719
This is not a dream, right?

445
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,920
Probably not.

446
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,900
♫  for me it's always you  ♫

447
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,859
Okay.

448
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,589
Let's get married.

449
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:17,909
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

458
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,140

459
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:32,190

460
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:39,140

461
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:46,190

462
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:53,150

463
00:32:53,150 --> 00:33:00,190

464
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:07,170

465
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:13,719
Try this.

466
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:21,739
Since we're getting married, I'd like you to think about this.

467
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:25,109
Of course, about the life we'll live together,

468
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:28,939
as well as your life without Kim Yoo Ri as well.

469
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:32,739
What are you talking about?

470
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:36,349
A person could disappear all of a sudden.

471
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:40,209
So I don't think we should be everything to each other.

472
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:43,649
Even without me, I hope you have something you want to do.

473
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:47,709
I hope there is something that raises you up.

474
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,239
You know, even if someone doesn't tell you to,

475
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:54,129
something that you'd want to do like crazy, staying up all night.

476
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,339
How do I find something like that?

477
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:06,149
Think carefully about what it is that you truly want.

478
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:19,559
Prosecutor, over here!

479
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,339
I said I'm not eating.

480
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,779
I don't even have time to eat these days.

481
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,679
But still, you should eat.

482
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,679
It's good. Try it.

483
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,579
How is your wound?

484
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:34,049
It aches a bit at night.

485
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:39,419
But in any case, are there talks of special prosecution coming up?

486
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:43,739
Geez! Lee Pyeon Woong has been into all sorts of things. Not just one or two.

487
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,479
But you know a few allegations are solid,

488
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:50,009
but we lack evidence.

489
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:53,809
Don't feel weak about it and investigate him intensely and press charges.

490
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:57,669
Also, do a thorough job and do it justly so that other guys

491
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:00,189
can't get delayed prosecution or get probation.

492
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,979
Don't just put everything on our shoulders...

493
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:05,439
I hear they're hiring new public prosecutors.

494
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,229
Why don't you come back to the Prosecutors' Office?

495
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:13,139
I mean, you quit working as a prosecutor because of the Chief Prosecutor, to begin with, no?

496
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:16,579
The Chief Prosecutor stepped down when the truth was revealed.

497
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,009
Hey, you, man...

498
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:21,609
You have no more excuses to loaf around anymore.

499
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:34,879
Yoo Ri.

500
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:38,449
Is it necessary for us to meet with him?

501
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:40,589
Let's go in.

502
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:53,249
Do you think you'll die just because you bang your head on the wall like that?

503
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:55,369
Gosh, of course.

504
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,339
I knew you'd come and see me, Attorney Kim.

505
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:04,459
So is my defense going well?

506
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:06,739
You asked me last time.

507
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:08,989
The law has never been on my side.

508
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:10,649
So why do I live like this?

509
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:12,119
I came here to give you an answer to that question.

510
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,289
Whoa, what an honor!

511
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:18,379
That you even remembered my question.

512
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:21,069
I went through my father's death when I was younger

513
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:25,649
and felt that the law was ridiculous, and I resented it.

514
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:28,889
So I opened up the law books to blame everything on it.

515
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:32,709
But there were so many Chinese characters and the words were so difficult.

516
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:36,109
It felt so unfair that I couldn't understand what it was saying.

517
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,709
So I ended up studying them with my mom.

518
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:45,019
But once I understood the law books and case studies,

519
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:51,289
tons of dilemmas that couldn't be answered simply were written in there.

520
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:54,179
I'm talking about extremely intense dilemmas.

521
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,999
So I do not dislike the law.

522
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,919
I just hate morons like you.

523
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,909
People who are only looking for easy answers.

524
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,789
People who don't know where to direct their anger

525
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,589
so they destroy other people along with themselves.

526
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:13,179
But the law also gives chances to people like you.

527
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:14,509
So

528
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:19,339
find someone a lot more expensive than me and go to trial.

529
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:23,459
Someone who'd get paid lots of money and does his best to defend you.

530
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,269
It's such a precious right.

531
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:27,989
You should have the right to exercise that precious right.

532
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:29,379
Then

533
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:32,269
I'm done talking, so I'll be going.

534
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:41,459
Jeong Ho.

535
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:48,529
Aren't you scared that I might do something to that pretty Attorney Kim?

536
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:53,699
Even in here, there are many things I could do.

537
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:00,059
Doesn't it make you mad?

538
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:02,079
Are you pissed?

539
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,369
Just kill me.

540
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,899
You said you're like me, too.

541
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:09,769
Why do you leave me to be punished by the law?

542
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:16,399
It's true. The law is too good for you.

543
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:20,749
Trash like you don't deserve to be judged by the law.

544
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:25,379
But do you know why our society doesn't kill you and leave you be?

545
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:29,249
Because they don't want to dirty their hands.

546
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:34,709
In the past, I wanted to hit rock bottom and play with you.

547
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,439
But I no longer want to play in the mud.

548
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:43,619
You just play in here by yourself.

549
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,869
I'm off.

550
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:49,869
Hey.

551
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,199
Hey!

552
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,939
Hey, Nephew! Hey!

553
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:57,069
Hey! Hey!

554
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,229
The law is so flawed.

555
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:03,649
That's why a guy like that was able to roam around the world freely all this time.

556
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:08,619
And that's why they can't punish someone like my father.

557
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:09,919
I know.

558
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,919
Yet you still do not dislike the law?

559
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:15,519
If I didn't like it, do you think I would've studied such a difficult field?

560
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,459
Gosh, why do you like something with so many loopholes?

561
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:22,199
That's why I dig into the loopholes in the law

562
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,889
and instead of releasing perpetrators,

563
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,239
I help out people who are victimized by those loopholes.

564
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:33,609
In any case, the work that people do can never be perfect.

565
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:37,219
So people should also plug those loopholes. Don't you think?

566
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:01,759
It's nice.

567
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,239
Hyungnim!

568
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:10,429
That suit fits crazy good on you!

569
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:11,799
Oh, yeah?

570
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:12,909
Wow, looking good.

571
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,179
Hyung, it's not just regular black.

572
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,999
I think it's Kim Jeong Ho black.

573
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,649
- Do I look okay? 
 - Yes.

574
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:21,529
I'll go charismatic in a black shirt.

575
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:23,939
So charismatic.

576
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:25,799
Gosh, but...

577
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,499
if you go back to being a prosecutor,

578
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:29,849
I'm going to miss you wearing your tracksuit.

579
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,169
Who says that I'm going back to being a prosecutor?

580
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:33,929
What?

581
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:35,719
Isn't that why you're buying a suit?

582
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,129
No, I'm not.

583
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:40,019
This is for starting a new line of work. How should I say it...

584
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,829
It's like my coat of armor, sort of speak?

585
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:44,409
I have no intention of going back to being a prosecutor yet.

586
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,899
Then, what are you going to do?

587
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:54,299
For now, I'd like to plug the loopholes in the law.

588
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:58,899
Shouldn't you go back to school, too?

589
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:01,759
You should prepare for the bar as well.

590
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,399
Oh, well...

591
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:07,149
I'm not too sure about it yet.

592
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,859
Yes, Honeybee.

593
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,119
Just do whatever you want to do.

594
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,739
But I also think I can't go on doing only what I want to do.

595
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:20,639
I'm sure someday,

596
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,969
you'll get to find something that raises you up.

597
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:25,999
So when too many thoughts go through your head,

598
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:30,049
just leave it to yourself in that moment.

599
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:44,629
   

600
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:05,159
Welcome, we're the Law Cafe.

601
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:09,569
Well...

602
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:16,229
I think I learned lots of things that I couldn't learn from books while working here.

603
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:19,349
So I bought a sofa on the internet.

604
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,029
They sent me the wrong product.

605
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:24,269
But I was so busy. So was it three days?

606
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:26,949
I called them three days later

607
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:31,099
and they said they couldn't give me a refund since I had used it already.

608
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:33,459
There's always people like that. Listen carefully.

609
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:37,109
In this instant, based on consumer protection laws for e-commerce,

610
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:39,399
if the product was delivered in error,

611
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:42,169
the consumer has 30 days from the day he finds out

612
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:46,209
of the error to cancel the transaction.

613
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:47,679
Oh, really?

614
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,339
Go home and contact the business right away.

615
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:54,709
Her boss won't even let her eat while working her part-time job.

616
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:57,399
She's still growing. Why haggle over food? That's so sad.

617
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:59,849
Geez, that boss is no good.

618
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:04,679
Boss said that he wrote into the contract that there is no mealtime.

619
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:06,509
So I should follow what it says...

620
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:08,199
Even if that says in the contract,

621
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:13,649
if it violates Labor Standards Act, that contract is nullified.

622
00:43:13,649 --> 00:43:17,289
 Just for hearing about what their rights are from the lawyer, 

623
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:20,309
 people go home feeling much more relieved. 

624
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:23,839
Seriously...

625
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,809
Why do you think there's a cooking direction?

626
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:27,489
It's a cooking direction because you're supposed to cook it as it says.

627
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:29,029
Never mind cooking directions and whatnot.

628
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:32,539
We need to be flexible when we're making eight of them at the same time.

629
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:34,919
But if we have too much water,

630
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,659
the amount of water being evaporated will be less.

631
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:38,789
So if we follow the cooking direction as is, it'll taste bland.

632
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:42,169
Then we should put less water. Why put bean paste?

633
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:45,049
I said this is my secret recipe!

634
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:48,369
That's why your ramen was so good, Eun Kang.

635
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,567
What? Did you two eat ramen together?

636
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:51,799
Yeah. Last time.

637
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:53,499
- During the day or at night? 
 - Night snack.

638
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:54,709
The two of you at night?

639
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:57,859
You just have to put all the ramen and boil it.

640
00:43:57,859 --> 00:43:59,479
We should have a barbecue.

641
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:02,309
Why eat ramen coming all the way out here?

642
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:07,179
Hyungnim, but still, isn't it nice to come outdoors first time in a while

643
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:09,319
and breathe fresh air?

644
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:12,039
Camping sure feels nice.

645
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:14,569
It's been four minutes and 30 seconds since we put in the noodles and soup mix.

646
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,269
I think it's time to turn off the fire.

647
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:19,179
Doctor, that's when you're making just one.

648
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:21,279
Then, you should've called me. Why didn't you?

649
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:23,539
Because you weren't there.

650
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,489
It says the flavor comes to life with one spoonful of diced garlic.

651
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:28,449
About this much?

652
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,489
That's not one spoonful...

653
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:32,769
The flavor is coming to life.

654
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,729
Why not put mugwort, too? So they'd become human.* 
  (Referring to Korean folktale) 

655
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,379
Why is this so tasty?

656
00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:03,669
Should I make you one more for people over there?

657
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:05,859
Yes, yes. One more.

658
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,349
What's this?

659
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:11,379
 If you meet people you can have good discussions with, 

660
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:14,549
 you will find a better solution. 

661
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:18,829
   

662
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:23,069
 And even with passage of time, 

663
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:27,539
 I learned that there are wounds that don't heal. 

664
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:32,929
However, I learned that our job is to plug

665
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:35,979
such loopholes in the law.

666
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:39,029
    
 But...

667
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,099
of all places,

668
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,509
why do you...

669
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:46,369
want to intern at a public service foundation?

670
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:50,289
Because I want to confirm that the law is not for

671
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:54,339
protecting the haves, but that it exists to embrace

672
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:56,909
ordinary people leading their lives.

673
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,039
Wait a minute.

674
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,199
Where d-d-did you say you worked at?

675
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:08,709
Oh, it's the Law Cafe.

676
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:12,359
It's a cafe that gives legal consultations.

677
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:15,689
 Sirs! 

678
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,149
 Time to go! 

679
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,449
 It must be time. Let's go. 

680
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:21,649
 Let's go with it. 

681
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:22,919
You!

682
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:25,169
That dimwitted caddie?

683
00:46:25,169 --> 00:46:27,869
That CEO at the golf course?

684
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:30,039
You!

685
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:32,549
Oh, hello!

686
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:38,099
What brings you here at this hour right before your important day?

687
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:45,479
I thought we could have some beer together.

688
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:05,029
You'll come tomorrow, won't you?

689
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:07,909
I'm not sure if I'm qualified to be there.

690
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,529
I wonder...

691
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:13,469
if I'm disturbing you guys' peace on a good day.

692
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:17,679
We'd be more disturbed if you didn't come so just come.

693
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:28,669
I think I take after you more, Father.

694
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,749
Trying to resolve any issues by myself,

695
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,769
or not being able to...

696
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:40,229
share what's on my heart and wrestling over it foolishly.

697
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:47,449
Maybe that's why I liked Yoo Ri.

698
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:51,039
Because she says everything so honestly.

699
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,769
I guess that looked so adorable to me.

700
00:47:58,059 --> 00:47:59,509
Is that how Yoo Ri is?

701
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:00,899
Of course!

702
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:03,739
She doesn't know how to hide anything.

703
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:09,619
So I'm going to try to change as well.

704
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,639
I also hope that

705
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,189
you lay down what's weighing your heart

706
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:18,729
and be at peace.

707
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:27,219
Be sure to come tomorrow.

708
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:50,979
Wow, I think we picked the wrong day. What do we do?

709
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:52,759
Are you okay?

710
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:57,549
I can't stand it, Se Yeon.

711
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:58,799
I have to go again.

712
00:48:58,799 --> 00:48:59,959
Undo this for me.

713
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:02,299
What are you talking about? You just went to the restroom.

714
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:05,549
- Hurry up! 
 - No, no, no! It's all in your head. Look, look.

715
00:49:05,549 --> 00:49:07,699
Try mind control.

716
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:11,119
Yoo Ri.

717
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,469
Mother.

718
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:14,869
How come you're so nervous?

719
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:19,479
Just say so if you have a change of heart even now.

720
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:20,359
Excuse me?

721
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:22,789
Gosh! What are you saying, Mother?

722
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:24,929
No, I mean, if she thinks she's going to regret it,

723
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,219
I'm just telling her not to feel pressured.

724
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:29,789
Gosh, if you're going to say stuff like that, just hold this.

725
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:32,259
Deep breaths, Mother.

726
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:34,499
Attorney unni!

727
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:38,129
Wow, you're so pretty, Unni!

728
00:49:38,129 --> 00:49:41,679
You look like a princess out of a fairytale. Right?

729
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,079
Congratulations.

730
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,409
Thank you.

731
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:48,149
But are you really marrying that tracksuit oppa?

732
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:50,959
You did think through this, right?

733
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:53,229
Who are you?

734
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:58,989
The bride is so pretty!

735
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:00,529
How about me? Me?

736
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:02,769
Gosh, I hope the buffet is good.

737
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:04,339
I wonder if the food will be tasty.

738
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:06,269
Hyungnim, did you come here to eat?

739
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,069
Feel the wind.

740
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:09,739
The rain?

741
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:11,889
No way!

742
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:14,580
No way. Don't jinx it. No, no, no...

743
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,559
Thank you! 
 - Congratulations. 
    

744
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,659
Hello!

745
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:26,189
The bride's party, right?

746
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,889
Thank you!

747
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:30,179
Hello.

748
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:31,439
Please write it down here.

749
00:50:31,439 --> 00:50:34,980
Two meal tickets.

750
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,830
♫  Protect  ♫

751
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:39,219
Aigoo, hello!

752
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:42,539
Aigoo, long time no see.

753
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:49,779
♫  More than anyone else I must like you more  ♫

754
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:53,229
Hello.

755
00:50:53,229 --> 00:50:55,689
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

756
00:50:55,689 --> 00:50:58,909
- Hello. 
 - Four tickets?

757
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:01,219
Song Hwa, you made it.

758
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:03,339
Eat a lot.

759
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:05,069
See you later. Bye.

760
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:08,069
- See you later. 
 - Bye.

761
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:09,619
The meal tickets.

762
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:12,559
- Yes. 
 - Hello.

763
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,899
We'll soon begin the wedding ceremony for the groom Kim Jeong Ho and the bride Kim Yoo Ri.

764
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:23,140
All the guests, please take your seats.

765
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,080

766
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:33,150

767
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:38,210

768
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:43,000


769
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,709
When are you getting married?

770
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:45,810
Who knows?

771
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:51,120
Thank you for watching "The Law Cafe"

772
00:51:53,529 --> 00:51:55,739
Don't be nervous.

773
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,779
- Please have a seat. 
 - Okay.

774
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,479
Nervous, huh?

775
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:17,459
Are you here to jeer me on?

776
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:20,249
No. To congratulate you.

777
00:52:21,669 --> 00:52:23,649
Be happy.

778
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:26,359
I'm sure you'll be happy.

779
00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:48,229
Now?

780
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:51,099
Time! Hold it. Her tummy trouble.

781
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:52,889
We'll now...

782
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:54,699
- start the wedding ceremony for... 
 - Jin Ki!

783
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:57,369
- for Kim Jeong Ho and Kim Yoo Ri. 
 - Geez!

784
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:11,449
We might have rain soon, so we'll cut to the chase.

785
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:14,239
Let's meet the stars of this day first.

786
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:16,349
The happiest man of the day.

787
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,269
Please welcome the groom Kim Jeong Ho with a huge round of applause.

788
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:21,619
Groom, enter!

789
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,599
Next, our true star of the day.

790
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,649
The most beautiful bride.

791
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:51,539
Let us welcome Kim Yoo Ri with a huge round of applause.

792
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:54,069
Bride, enter!

793
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:01,079
Oh, Bride?

794
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,869
Where are you, Bride?

795
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:05,759
Was our applause not loud enough?

796
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:07,499
Bride?

797
00:54:07,499 --> 00:54:09,279
- Is she a no-show? 
 - Where did the bride go?

798
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,289
She's making the groom feel desperate.

799
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,209
She's here!

800
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:20,769
She's here!

801
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:24,669
Yes, I'll address her once again.

802
00:54:24,669 --> 00:54:27,499
Bride, enter!

803
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:38,689
♫  I like you so much that I am filled with you  ♫

804
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:45,819
♫  Passing beyond brilliance, I like you  ♫

805
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:48,299
♫  I mean it truly  ♫

806
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:55,089
♫  I am happy because I have you  ♫

807
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:59,059
I'll be officiating this wedding. I'm the CEO of the law firm Hwang and Goo,

808
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:01,559
Hwang Gap Seong.

809
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:06,629
The bride begged me not to ramble on any nonsense.

810
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:12,179
So I prepared it like this...

811
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,169
Oh, yes...

812
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:23,659
Well, since the weather isn't too great, I'll make this quick.

813
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:27,349
Seeing these two people, who are very rare in our legal field

814
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:30,359
getting together and even getting married,

815
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,279
well, what shall I say...

816
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:35,739
Makes me think everyone has their other half somewhere.

817
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:38,109
I'm overwhelmed with emotions.

818
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:42,379
Yes...

819
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:46,279
Bride Kim Yoo Ri...

820
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:50,159
is the boldest lawyer out of the ones I know

821
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,200
and the most thriving person who lives however she hopes to.

822
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,279
So I'm not too worried about her.

823
00:55:55,279 --> 00:55:59,279
But my only worry is for this handsome

824
00:55:59,279 --> 00:56:01,379
groom standing next to her.

825
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:02,939
But after hearing their story,

826
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:07,419
I learned that the groom is just as bold as the bride.

827
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,389
Well honestly speaking,

828
00:56:15,389 --> 00:56:17,869
I always felt that

829
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:21,849
it was heartwarming to have at least one attorney like Attorney Kim Yoo Ri

830
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:26,999
in this tough and heartless world.

831
00:56:31,149 --> 00:56:33,519
All the guests who are with us today,

832
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:38,619
I'm sure you feel the same way, and that's why you're all here with us.

833
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:41,129
Now,

834
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:44,369
for these two people who are starting out anew,

835
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:50,219
I'd like to ask one thing of them as someone who has lived a life before them.

836
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:51,909
By chance, if...

837
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,669
they were to have a first birthday for their baby,

838
00:56:53,669 --> 00:56:58,299
and if they insist on doing it outdoors like this,

839
00:56:58,299 --> 00:57:01,589
please avoid the typhoon.

840
00:57:02,229 --> 00:57:04,219
Thank you!

841
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:14,039
Thank you for your words, CEO Hwang Gap Seong.

842
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:15,489
Even though they knew the typhoon was coming,

843
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:19,209
the bride and groom couldn't postpone the wedding, not even a day.

844
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:24,359
Next, they will recite the letters they wrote for each other.

845
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,839
Bridegroom, please go first.

846
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,969
Even if no one makes me do it,

847
00:57:31,969 --> 00:57:36,229
I found someone who makes me pour out all of me 17 years ago.

848
00:57:36,229 --> 00:57:38,349
I won't say that you're my everything

849
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:42,199
and that I'll never change for the rest of my life.

850
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:44,609
But I just...

851
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:47,479
became who I am because of you.

852
00:57:47,479 --> 00:57:49,619
If there's anything good in me,

853
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:52,279
it's all because of you.

854
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:57,989
So let's not be afraid of the future that will approach us, Yoo Ri.

855
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:00,909
Oh, my goodness!

856
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:04,559
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

857
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:09,779
You said this to me before.

858
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:14,199
That you don't think we're meant to be together.

859
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,669
But I believe we are meant to be.

860
00:58:16,669 --> 00:58:18,169
If it weren't for that,

861
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:23,049
how could every moment we're together be so much fun?

862
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:24,689
When you think about it,

863
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:29,829
you were always the one for me and you were the only one.

864
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:32,789
I'm sorry for realizing that so late.

865
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:37,719
I love you, Jeong Ho.

866
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:42,379
Until the moment my heart seizes, I will love you.

867
00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:46,609
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

868
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:49,739
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

869
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:53,060
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

870
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:57,330
♫  Tonight when the stars shine  ♫

871
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:01,330
♫  with you filling my arms  ♫

872
00:59:01,339 --> 00:59:06,740
♫  I'll be with you always and forever  ♫

873
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,350
♫  Tonight when you are shining  ♫

874
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:14,340
♫  with you filling my arms  ♫

875
00:59:15,859 --> 00:59:20,759
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

876
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,839
 One, two, three! 

877
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:35,069
I don't know which path to take, but

878
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:37,499
for now...

879
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:40,759
I will fall in love.

880
00:59:40,759 --> 00:59:45,369
I realized that being in love with a good person shows me to go down a good path.

881
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:47,689
   

882
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:50,669
Gosh, it's so long.

883
00:59:50,669 --> 00:59:53,199
What are you trying to find out?

884
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:54,229
What's that?

885
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:58,169
You can't resist buying it once you taste it. It's rice-pop.

886
00:59:58,169 --> 01:00:00,849
Gosh, I couldn't even sleep at night.

887
01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:02,869
Take a look at this! Rice-pop!

888
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:04,540
Okay!

889
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,129
Here comes rice-pop!

890
01:00:09,129 --> 01:00:10,479
Are you here for a consultation?

891
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:11,949
Oh, yes.

892
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:14,499
Which one would you like?

893
01:00:14,499 --> 01:00:16,149
   

894
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:20,519
What's spicy flavor and what's mild flavor?

895
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:25,489
   

896
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:27,029
I see.

897
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:28,459
Pay for the coffee first

898
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:31,489
and get your number for the person you want to receive consultation from.

899
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:34,599
Yes, got it.

900
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:40,489
Here's rice-pop!

901
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:48,769
I couldn't even sleep at night because of that...

902
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:50,959
It's so hard...

903
01:00:50,959 --> 01:00:52,309
If that's the case,

904
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:54,789
you know there's a psychiatrist upstairs of the building.

905
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:56,799
The doctor is wonderful.

906
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:59,339
Why don't you stop by there later?

907
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:06,219
- As for your issues at work you just mentioned, 
 - Yes.

908
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:10,769
I think it'd be good to discuss it at the private investigator agency next door.

909
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:12,529
Okay.

910
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,369
   

911
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:22,939
Hi, welcome!

912
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:27,589
Gosh, you can come to me from the get-go with whatever you're struggling with.

913
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:29,619
Sit. Have a seat.

914
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:34,319
And the coffee is much tastier here.

915
01:01:37,509 --> 01:01:39,269
So what's going on?

916
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:42,859
   

917
01:01:42,859 --> 01:01:45,939
So are you really going to do that?

918
01:01:45,939 --> 01:01:50,319
Now that we're married, one of us has to make money.

919
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:53,259
Why? Did I say something wrong?

920
01:01:53,259 --> 01:01:56,149
Never mind. Let's wrap it up.

921
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:00,879
Something that keeps you up at night.

922
01:02:00,879 --> 01:02:03,949
You have no idea, even though you've gone to see a very good shaman.

923
01:02:03,949 --> 01:02:07,839
If you have such a dilemma, come see us at the Law Cafe.

924
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:12,749
- At the cost of a cup of coffee, we'll hear you out. 
 - Hear you out!

925
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:18,169
♫  IIt was from the start.  As for me,  ♫

926
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:19,949
♫  an unexplainable feeling  ♫

927
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:20,989
Is that right?

928
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:22,119
I don't know!

929
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:24,500
♫  In front of you  ♫

930
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:29,060
♫  I'm afraid to find out how you feel about me  ♫

931
01:02:29,069 --> 01:02:32,500
♫  So many thing between you and me  ♫

932
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,360
♫  Many awkward days ♫

933

♫  Now I want to take care of you  ♫

934

♫  I must like you. ♫

♫  More than myself  ♫

943
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:35,210
