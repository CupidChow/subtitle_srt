1
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,510
   

2
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,587
 There will be more suspicions if you don't tell us more! 

3
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:40,357
 Please make way! 

4
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:49,107
Champagne?

5
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:59,280


6
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,717
   

7
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,840
What is this?

8
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,477
In, in, in, in, in your eyes...

9
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:20,647
There's, there's, there's, there's sensuality there.

10
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,827
There's sensuality there.

11
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,787
   

12
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,887
Why is he suddenly calling me?

13
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,347
Yes, CEO?

14
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:45,847
You said you'd take care of it.

15
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:47,497
You said you'd take care of it.

16
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,117
What is this?

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,197
Hey, CEO Lee!

18
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,827
Well...

19
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,760
Aigoo, you called me so suddenly...

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,060
I came in the middle of dinner.

21
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,960
What is it regarding...

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,670
Oh, do you guys not know him?

23
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,540
Despite his appearance, he's actually CEO Hwang of Hwang &amp; Goo.

24
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,360
Say hello.

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,190
Do you think I'm in the mood to say hello right now?

26
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,580
What are you going to do about this?

27
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,800
God, Assemblyman, you need to...

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,490
calm down a little.

29
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,390
Calm down?

30
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,290
How do you expect me to calm down?

31
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,640
I, Choi Yeo Hwan, am being crapped on by everyone!

32
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,070
Whose crap was it in the first place...

33
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,300
We just have to respond well.

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,690
Look at celebrities!

35
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,270
Although they get into scandals, they all return just fine.

36
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,900
Yeah, he's right.

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,940
Things like this can happen when you're in politics.

38
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,740
And besides, you're the victim in what happened today, Assemblyman.

39
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,090
That secretary b****...

40
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,870
She's cheeky.

41
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,280
I'll just sue her for defamation and show her how scary the law could be.

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,920
I have a bit of rhinitis.

44
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,970
Cheers!

45
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,150
You all did well today.

46
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,990
Were you already called over there?

47
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,890
Wow, they're fast.

48
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,590
Hey! What are you going to do now?

49
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,560
Well, what are you going to do, CEO?

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,460
You're not by any chance going to take their side this time, too, right?

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,390
CEO, you're a villain that can be restored.

52
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,660
But you go a bit further with this,

53
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,320
then you're going to end up in flaming sulfur when you die!

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,330
Hey! Just hang up.

55
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,100
Geez.

56
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,380
All right! Since everyone worked so hard today,

57
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,620
shall we feast today?

58
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,470
Your food is out!

59
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,770
Please enjoy the food!

60
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,580
Let's recharge.

61
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,550
You guys did well!

62
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,220
Everyone, you did well!

63
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,910
Thank you.

64
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,660
"Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan sued for sexual harassment of his secretary."

65
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,820
"The two faces of Assemblyman Choi were revealed to everyone."

66
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,860
It's spreading like crazy.

67
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,220
There's already a news article on it!

68
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,620
This is only the start,

69
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,800
so let's not get too excited.

70
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,620
But I'm already excited!

71
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,630
Oh, it's delicious.

72
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,030
 So Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan opened up a press conference. 

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,680
 Although he acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with his secretary, 

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,560
 he claims that it was a consensual relationship 

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,940
 and that there was no use of authority or force. 

76
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,580
 He also claimed that Secretary Choi threatened him looking for monetary appeasement, 

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,630
 and so he tried to end the relationship, 

78
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,820
 which led to the recent incident exposing him. 

79
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,000
 Looking at the text messages that Assemblyman Choi revealed, 

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
 it was primarily about business matters. 

81
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,250
 Any private conversations found in the messages seem to show that the secretary... 

82
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,040
How is it that gold digger framing doesn't change even after all this time?

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,140
It's such a cliche, a cliche!

84
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,640
 So she responded with a thank you 

85
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,930
 and sent a smiling emoticon. 

86
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,700
What are you doing?

87
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,350
I'm screen-capturing slanderous comments.

88
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,970
I will gather them up and sue them all.

89
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,350
You did explain everything carefully to Song Hwa, right?

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,140
Even so, she probably got quite a shock from all this.

91
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,310
Yes, Song Hwa.

92
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,490
Oh, my. Really?

93
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,450
Yes, yes. Okay.

94
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,200
Why? What happened?

95
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,050
It seems like Yi Seul got into a fight in kindergarten.

96
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,350
- I think I'm going to need to head over there. 
 - No, no.

97
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,930
You should just work.

98
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,690
I'll go.

99
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,410
So to get this straight,

100
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,250
Soo Bin claims Yi Seul hit her first,

101
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,550
and Yi Seul claims that Soo Bin hit her first. Is that right?

102
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,230
Yes. It just so happened that the fight took place where the CCTV couldn't capture.

103
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,670
The other kids say that Yi Seul started hitting my child without cause!

104
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,330
Hey, Yi Seul.

105
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,190
Soo Bin's testimony right now

106
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,520
matches up with what the other kids witnessed and seems to be credible.

107
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,660
When something like this happens, before adults start assuming things,

108
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,960
it's best if you tell us honestly what happened.

109
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
I believe I was being fair and just.

110
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,850
Ahjussi, you said last time

111
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,530
that Hansel and Gretel killing the witch was fair and just.

112
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,620
That they were not going to be punished.

113
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,840
Well, it's not "fair and just."

114
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,690
It's "self-defense."

115
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,090
But if you want to claim self-defense,

116
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,820
then you need to tell us what Soo Bin did to you first.

117
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,820
I don't want to say it.

118
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,470
This kid must take after her mother,

119
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,630
seeing how she lies so readily—

120
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,750
You're a liar, just like your mother!

121
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,400
- Hey! 
 - Oh, my.

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,650
Oh, my. Oh, my! Look at this kid.

123
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,360
Is she still not going to apologize after all this?

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,330
If she's going to be like this, we can't attend the same kindergarten!

125
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,270
Of course, there needs to be an apology.

126
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,870
Since exercising violence is wrong.

127
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,050
Hey, Yi Seul.

128
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,260
Even if others say bad things about your parents,

129
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,900
it's the rules of this society that you can't hit them for it.

130
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,620
Although it's regrettable,

131
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,900
this cannot count as self-defense.

132
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,750
However, children aren't punished, even if they do wrong.

133
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,100
However, it's different for adults.

134
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,460
What did you say?

135
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,650
"This kid must take after her mother, seeing how she lies so readily..."

136
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,100
Yi Seul, you should apologize to Soo Bin.

137
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,400
And Soo Bin's mother, you should come with me to the nearest police station.

138
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,580
When we get there,

139
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm thinking of debating whether what you just said counts as contempt and defamation.

140
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,690
   

141
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,770
- Who did you say it was? 
 - Baek Geon Man?

142
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,300
Baek Geon Man?

143
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,850
That bastard is the head prosecutor for the case?

144
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,120
Just my luck. But what can I do about it?

145
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,570
Baek Geon Man...

146
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,400
Maybe it's for the better!

147
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,360
Any prosecutor on this case would be on Lee Pyeon Woong's side

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,180
and would try to end this case without listening to what happened.

149
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,290
It's better that it's a familiar face.

150
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,030
The head prosecutor for this case is our college sunbae.

151
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,730
Oh, I see.

152
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,520
So shall we do it now?

153
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,700
We really have to do this, right?

154
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,430
Of course!

155
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,380
We...

156
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,250
- Can do it! 
 - Can do it!

157
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,640
We can do it!

158
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,550
So what you're telling me is,

159
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,250
he slid his hands under your skirt,

160
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,180
and he groped your thighs.

161
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,190
What was the shape of the skirt you were wearing that day?

162
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,010
It was an A-line skirt,

163
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,310
and the length was down to my knees.

164
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,040
I see.

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,380
So it was the perfect style to lift up.

166
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,400
Why didn't you just wear pants then?

167
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,480
- Investigator? 
 - Yes?

168
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,840
These are all things that the police have already asked.

169
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,420
Did your dog accidentally eat the investigation recording?

170
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,810
Why do you keep asking the same things?

171
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,330
I'm trying to see if the testimonies are consistent.

172
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,870
Because it's important to see if anything changes in her testimony.

173
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,280
And when I take a look here,

174
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,910
after the start of the molestation,

175
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,110
you continued to work for him for over a year.

176
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,540
But if you didn't like it, shouldn't you have reported it right away?

177
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,090
- Why did you wait until after all this time... 
 -  Investigator!

178
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,410
What do you want this time?

179
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,140
Even if you say the same thing, the way you say it can change everything.

180
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,350
Why do you keep talking in such a disrespectful manner?

181
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,510
It's okay, Attorney.

182
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,000
Reporting an assemblyman seemed like such a scary task.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,090
And if I quit my job,

184
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,750
I couldn't see how I could continue to take care of my child,

185
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,160
so I thought that maybe things might improve if I waited a little longer...

186
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
I'm glad you said that.

187
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,620
If I take a look at your work hours, Song Hwa,

188
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,150
whenever your child was sick,

189
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,230
or when something happened at the kindergarten,

190
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,170
I noticed that you came to work later and left work early.

191
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,720
So if you look at it another way,

192
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,940
don't you think the workplace has been treating you favorably?

193
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,930
Wh-What are you trying to say?

194
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,250
- Investigator! 
 - What now! What do you want again?

195
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,860
Let's hear what the victim has to say!

196
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,800
What does your question have anything to do with the molestation case?

197
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,860
If I want to figure out their true relationship,

198
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,240
all of this is necessary for the investigation!

199
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,160
Okay, okay, then. Did you check all the work schedules of others in the Assemblyman's office?

200
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,130
We gave you all the files for it.

201
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,850
Before you speculate about whether Song Hwa received special benefits,

202
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,540
can't you check all the files that we've given you? Huh?

203
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,940
If you just flip through a couple pages, the work schedules are all here!

204
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,890
We've looked through all this and handed it over to you.

205
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,810
If you take a look, it seems that employees with children

206
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,640
were able to arrive at and leave work flexibly.

207
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,610
It's not just Song Hwa who received special benefits.

208
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,190
Since things are like this,

209
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,330
who would try to report being victimized?

210
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,160
You asked before, right?

211
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,790
Why she didn't report it right away to the police?

212
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,470
It appears you've answered your own question.

213
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,370
Then shall we move on to the next question?

214
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,790
Geez.

215
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,920
You're still the same, Kim Yoo Ri.

216
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,930
Baek Geon Man?

217
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,450
He's one of those types that I hate the most.

218
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,060
He's garbage.

219
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,620
Aigoo, Prosecutor. I thought I wouldn't get to greet you

220
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,610
and have to just talk with the investigator before heading out.

221
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,280
But you came out for us.

222
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,530
I mean, I heard you're the attorney on the case.

223
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,390
I should come out.

224
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,950
Baek Geon Man is... how should I put this...

225
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,020
would you understand it if I described him as non-recyclable trash?

226
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,500
Oh, my, I've really become a cultured person.

227
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,000
I've really softened what I wanted to say.

228
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,750
 Baek Geon Man! 

229
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,920
 Whoa, what the... 

230
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,580
 What the hell! 

231
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,290
 He's dead, that bastard. 

232
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,010
 Baek Geon Man. 

233
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,120
 Y-Y-Yoo Ri! 

234
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,930
 How... 

235
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,510
 Y-Yoo Ri! 

236
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,800
 Hey, Yoo Ri! 

237
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,210
 Yoo Ri! Yoo Ri! 

238
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,700
 Yoo Ri! 

239
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,500
 Yoo Ri! Wait. Listen to me. 

240
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,820
 So it's true. 

241
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,020
 That I'm not even your second, but that I'm your third. 

242
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,860
 Am I even your third? 

243
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,690
 What are you talking about? 

244
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,020
 - You! This guy! 
 - What the? 

245
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,460
 This... this guy! 

246
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,980
 - This guy! 
 - What are you doing! This is so embarrassing. 

247
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,970
 This guy isn't all there yet! 

248
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,450
 Let go! 

249
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,630
 - Let go! You're not letting go? 
 - Gosh, this is embarrassing! 

250
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,920
 Stop it. Stop it! 

251
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,250
Why?

252
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,130
What?

253
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,290
So, Sunbae.

254
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,510
Could you please not look at me as if you were reminiscing about the past?

255
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,730
Because it's making me angry.

256
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,900
So I guess I'm still a painful memory to you.

257
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,030
No, you're not!

258
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,220
Sunbae, to me, you are... like a piece of lettuce stuck between my teeth. An embarrassing memory.

259
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,400
Well, in any case,

260
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,550
the fact that I've hurt you makes me feel

261
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,900
sharp pangs of pain sometimes.

262
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,000
Maybe it's rotten lettuce, seeing how there are sharp pangs.

263
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,300
But you two,

264
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,230
you're still sticking together even now.

265
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,170
You're not, by any chance, still putting on a show for others, are you?

266
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,740
Like you guys,

267
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,330
you pretended you guys were dating because of me.

268
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,010
So... did you get married?

269
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,910
Let's not get curious about things like that!

270
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,750
I guess you haven't yet.

271
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,370
And you're still tailing her around, right?

272
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,280
Seeing how you're talking so well,

273
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,480
I guess you've healed well from the blows I've dealt you.

274
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,570
I think your memories are slightly distorted.

275
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,250
Wasn't it you who got beat up?

276
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,330
 - Let go. 
 - No, you let go first! 

277
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,030
 - You let go first, you bastard! 
 - Let go at the same time, on the count of three. 

278
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,920
 One, two, three! You didn't let go? 

279
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,280
 This is why you're a problem! 

280
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
 Hey! You! 

281
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,130
 Hey! Let go! 

282
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,830
 You've only entered the school before me. 

283
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,020
 Stop moving around! 

284
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,610
It's embarrassing for us, so let's stop going through our past memories,

285
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,690
and let's talk about the case on hand.

286
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,630
You probably already know this, but

287
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,130
there's no point in prosecuting this case in this state.

288
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,890
If there was a single proper piece of evidence,

289
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,310
maybe it would be possible.

290
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,790
Did you even consider prosecuting this case in the first place?

291
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,760
I know.

292
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,190
We'll gather more evidence,

293
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,900
so just prosecute this case fairly and justly.

294
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,670
Hey, Yoo Ri.

295
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,430
Do you think that guy knows what "fair and just" is?

296
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,790
Seriously?

297
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,870
Geez, that guy...

298
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,340
- "That guy"? 
 - Yeah, that guy.

299
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,770
I'm your sunbae, you bastard.

300
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,320
Sunbae, my foot. Hey.

301
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,860
I'm much more your senior if we talk about the Research and Training Institute class!

302
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,240
We live in a country where we respect our elders!

303
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,610
Respect our elders, my foot.

304
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,580
Gosh, this is so embarrassing! Stop it, both of you!

305
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,360
D***, that little a** son of a b****...

306
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,030
He hasn't changed one bit.

307
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,970
My fist is crying out for your face.

308
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,150
   
 See me for a moment. 

309
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,250
 I think it will be something you need to hear. 

310
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,760
Oh, you're Kim Jeong Ho, right?

311
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,790
Yes, that's me.

312
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,680
Well, I'm Oh Hye Sun.

313
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,600
I came here with an introduction from Chairman Lee.

314
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,310
By chance, did you come here not knowing what this meeting was about?

315
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,940
What is this meeting about?

316
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,580
This is a blind date.

317
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,610
A blind date?

318
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,370
Oh, well...

319
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,630
Since we met like this anyway,

320
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,850
- should we at least have some tea— 
 - I'm sorry.

321
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,190
I don't want to be rude, but...

322
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,930
I think there was a mistake.

323
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,930
- What... 
 - I'm sorry to have wasted your valuable time.

324
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,700
She's the eldest daughter of the chairman of Taesung Group.

325
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,600
Although she's still young,

326
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,350
she's smart. So I thought of you.

327
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,210
I will respectfully decline.

328
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,700
In the future, I hope that nothing like this happens again.

329
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,050
It doesn't have to be the girl you met today.

330
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,450
However, that attorney girl is not it.

331
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,920
I think you must be gravely mistaken,

332
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,990
but I have no plans on listening to you, Chairman,

333
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,480
in regards to whom I date or not.

334
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,850
It seems like you've been digging through things related to Pyeon Woong.

335
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,850
That bastard is not an easy guy to handle.

336
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,300
You may abide by the rules with your plans and methods,

337
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,460
but that bastard doesn't.

338
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,920
So, don't be like that,

339
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,730
and marry someone who's befitting of your capacity.

340
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,800
Do you think a neighborhood cafe is befitting of who you are?

341
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,530
You need to play in bigger waters.

342
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,130
I'm already doing great things. In a fun and enjoyable way.

343
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,860
You're just fooling yourself.

344
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,740
Aigoo.

345
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,580
Welcome.

346
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,700
 So did you get married? 

347
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,990
 It doesn't have to be the girl you met today. 

348
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,070
 However, that attorney girl is not it. 

349
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,212
Hey, Do Jin Ki.

350
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,722
How did you propose to Han Se Yeon?

351
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:37,442
Well, I did it at the hotel in Boracay...

352
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,782
Why? Are you going to do it?

353
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,432
Well...

354
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:45,652
I... bought this without even knowing her size...

355
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,152
Oh, my God...

356
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:48,712
Oh, my God, Bro!

357
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,802
Why are you calling for the God you don't even believe in?

358
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:53,362
So you're going to marry Kim Yoo Ri?

359
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:57,042
I know it hasn't been long since we started dating, but...

360
00:20:57,042 --> 00:21:00,762
you already know... hat there's nobody else for me.

361
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,052
You...

362
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:05,692
What are you going to say? No, when are you going to do it?

363
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,792
Well, for the timing of it...

364
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:14,732
I'm thinking of telling her after this case gets resolved.

365
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,842
You...

366
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:18,592
Have you thought enough about this before deciding on this?

367
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:21,282
Marriage is not something you can do just because the two of you want to.

368
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:22,982
There's the issue of the parents of both sides.

369
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,612
Even when everything's ready, marriage is not an easy thing.

370
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:28,302
I've thought about this sufficiently.

371
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:32,502
This guy really means it. Okay then.

372
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:33,742
Then I'll help you.

373
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,162
- I'm actually really good at doing events like this. 
 - Yeah, yeah, you are!

374
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,252
I'm the one who was able to move Han Se Yeon's immovable heart.

375
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:39,872
That's why I trust you.

376
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:41,502
So tell me what you want.

377
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:44,232
First, not too over the top but not too light.

378
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:45,232
Okay.

379
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:48,522
A bit traditional and sincere.

380
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:50,662
Traditional and sincere.

381
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:55,172
And I can't miss out on the essentials by chasing something radical or new.

382
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,572
Yeah, that wouldn't be good.

383
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:59,662
Classic, but not too cliche. You know what I mean, right?

384
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:02,242
You know me. I can't handle cringe things.

385
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:04,052
Like suddenly singing,

386
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:08,052
or putting up a lot of balloons where there are a lot of people.

387
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:11,432
And saying, "Surprise!" after creating a mood.

388
00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:12,802
Just thinking about it makes me cringe.

389
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:14,622
I really don't like things like that. You know what I mean, right?

390
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:15,742
I don't know what you mean.

391
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:18,472
You do you. I don't think I can.

392
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,432
Tell me about it after you do it.

393
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:21,952
Fighting.

394
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:25,062
Hey. I'll do whatever you say.

395
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,162
Thank you for this food.

396
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:35,382
Enjoy it.

397
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,222
We're calling all your coworkers

398
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:46,912
based on the list you gave us.

399
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:50,962
No one is coming forward, right?

400
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:54,102
I thought so.

401
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:59,122
Helping me out means they're turning their backs on the Assemblyman.

402
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:01,472
That's not an easy thing to do.

403
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,882
I'm okay, Attorney.

404
00:23:07,882 --> 00:23:10,082
Even if no one comes forward,

405
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:12,362
even though that happens,

406
00:23:12,362 --> 00:23:15,272
I don't regret having started this.

407
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:19,382
If I didn't fight,

408
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:24,172
I probably would still be stabbing myself.

409
00:23:24,172 --> 00:23:26,412
Because I'm such a fool,

410
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,682
because I'm so weak...

411
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:32,352
I'd keep thinking if all that happened

412
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,512
because I didn't handle the situation well.

413
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:41,132
I feel like I could live now after having been able to escape from those thoughts.

414
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:45,902
So I will continue to fight.

415
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,682
So, don't you worry about me, Attorney.

416
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,772
Hey, you're here.

417
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,492
Hey...

418
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:02,512
Where did you go?

419
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,832
Wh-Where did you go?

420
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,702
I met with Song Hwa.

421
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:09,462
I said where did you go.

422
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:15,542
I went on a blind date.

423
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,532
What?

424
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:19,002
My grandpa– No...

425
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:23,412
Chairman Lee... said he had something important to say, so I went.

426
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:25,872
And it turned out to be a blind date.

427
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,342
I went there without knowing, but

428
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:32,762
I'm still sorry about it.

429
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,152
I didn't want to hide it from you.

430
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:40,292
It's okay. You could go on a blind date.

431
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:43,752
It won't make sense if there aren't any pressures like that at our age.

432
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:46,262
Wait...

433
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:49,762
So you don't feel anything when I said I went on a blind date?

434
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:51,002
You said you didn't know you were going on a blind date.

435
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:52,792
I mean...

436
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,152
But still, I'm your lover.

437
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,132
Whether I went there knowing about it or not, you should be angry—

438
00:24:57,132 --> 00:24:59,282
Wait, must you check this right now?

439
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,602
- I have to check stuff like this right away. 
 - Who is it?

440
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:03,572
Baek Geon Man.

441
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:05,382
- Asking me if I'm sleeping. 
 - "Are you asleep?"

442
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:07,392
He's always sending stupid things like this.

443
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:09,772
- "Are you asleep"? 
 - I should block his number.

444
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:11,192
Kim Yoo Ri.

445
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:13,702
Think carefully as to why it doesn't make you mad

446
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:15,602
about me going on a blind date.

447
00:25:15,602 --> 00:25:17,682
Jeong Ho! Jeong—

448
00:25:29,282 --> 00:25:33,382
 I'm doing this so we can be happy together for a long time. 

449
00:25:33,382 --> 00:25:35,382
 Starting at some point, 

450
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:37,562
 whenever I see something like this, 

451
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,622
 you'd be the first one to come to my mind. 

452
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:43,382
 I like you. 

453
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:46,472
 It's always been you 

454
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:48,702
 and you were the only one. 

455
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:08,552
   

456
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:16,742
   

457
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:29,762
 Who's there? 

458
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,622
How can I help you?

459
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:38,562
We've been trying to reach you over the phone.

460
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,502
 Don't come looking for me again! 

461
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:53,182
There are lots of disgusting things you experience in life.

462
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:59,492
When I was a new recruit in the military,

463
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,312
there was a petty sergeant who was a total pervert.

464
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:05,162
In the beginning, he'd touch me as if he was just playing around.

465
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:07,252
Then later, he'd come over when I was sleeping at night

466
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,792
and rub against me and touch me...

467
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,122
So...

468
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:20,002
what happened to that a**hole?

469
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:24,052
Whether it's good or bad,

470
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:27,862
there were quite a few... victims he did that to.

471
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:30,422
So along with my senior officers,

472
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:33,562
we told the squad leader directly.

473
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:36,492
The military police came in right away.

474
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,742
I heard his life hit rock bottom after that

475
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,662
but I never saw him again.

476
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,402
It was so fortunate.

477
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:54,502
So what I want to say to you is that it's tough alone, but

478
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:59,042
if we speak up as a group, things could change.

479
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:06,842
Just this once.

480
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:09,352
Can't you just hear us out?

481
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:22,102
The time I worked there didn't overlap with Choi Song Hwa's employment there.

482
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:24,262
But what I went through is similar to what happened to her.

483
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:28,592
He'd touch my butt and my waist when people weren't around.

484
00:28:28,592 --> 00:28:31,912
He had said the same thing when I said I wanted to quit.

485
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:33,922
"Do you want a raise?"

486
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,492
"Is that what you're after?"

487
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:38,202
He's such a son of a b****!

488
00:28:40,942 --> 00:28:42,492
I'm sorry.

489
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:45,342
Makes me so angry just hearing about it.

490
00:28:46,632 --> 00:28:49,892
But I don't have any evidence, either.

491
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:52,602
Just some notes I took in my diary.

492
00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:56,502
By chance, did you write them on the days his criminal behaviors took place?

493
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:57,842
Yes.

494
00:28:57,842 --> 00:29:00,832
That could be used as evidence!

495
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:03,232
If I were to speak up,

496
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:05,332
do you think something would change?

497
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:07,112
Of course!

498
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:14,002
But... it's not something I could ask of you so easily.

499
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:30,442
♫  On your small hunched shoulders  ♫

500
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:31,952
I'm sorry.

501
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:34,902
I don't know why I'm doing this...

502
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:37,972
I'm so sorry...

503
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:40,052
I thought...

504
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:43,942
it was something I went through alone.

505
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:48,952
But seeing you like this brought out feelings all of a sudden...

506
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:52,172
I'm so sorry...

507
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:54,372
Why are you so sorry?

508
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,422
It must be your specialty for you to apologize.

509
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:57,992
I'm sorry...

510
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,602
♫  This too shall pass  ♫

511
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:04,552
♫  Walk with me  ♫

512
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,482
♫  Let's breathe deeply  ♫

513
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:10,382
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

514
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:14,572
Why is this noona apologizing...

515
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:18,412
♫  I will stay by your side now  ♫

516
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:20,732
I'll help you.

517
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:24,142
- Please don't cry. 
 - No...

518
00:30:24,142 --> 00:30:29,122
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

519
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:31,662
♫  Once some time passes  ♫

520
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,912
 Me, too. 

521
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:37,882
 It's a confession that this also happened to me. 

522
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:40,902
It was such a huge consolation.

523
00:30:40,902 --> 00:30:42,132
And...

524
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:48,442
how sad it is that so many "Me, too" are living in this world.

525
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:51,962
When I saw Song Hwa, who felt so sorry

526
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:56,672
feeling consoled by watching someone else's pain,

527
00:30:59,032 --> 00:31:01,142
my heart also...

528
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:04,852
moved first time in a long time.

529
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:12,462
   

530
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:26,872
Thank you, Eun Kang.

531
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:31,282
I heard it was you and Joon's doing.

532
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,242
I found my reason.

533
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:44,322
Why I want to continue to be good to you.

534
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:48,882
Because you keep crying...

535
00:31:51,752 --> 00:31:56,012
Whenever I see someone cry, I feel like my heart is stifled.

536
00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:58,882
But I don't know when, but

537
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:04,082
whenever I see you, my heart felt stifled.

538
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:14,412
So unless you hate it,

539
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:17,662
I wish you could just let me be good to you.

540
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:39,832
When Lee Gi Ryong's interview goes out,

541
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,822
the public opinion will flip around again.

542
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:43,212
But before that,

543
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,122
our goal is to have those people who were at the villa

544
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:49,942
turn against Assemblyman Choi.

545
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:54,232
So that we can put Assemblyman Choi away.

546
00:32:57,712 --> 00:32:59,892
Wow, I guess you're not too busy.

547
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:02,482
You don't have too many cases?

548
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,652
Are you here to pick a fight?

549
00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:09,012
It looks like you're snooping around here and there.

550
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,912
Are you aspiring to get into politics?

551
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,572
The prosecutor position looks good on the outside

552
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:16,242
but yeah, it's too tough, isn't it?

553
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,062
You did come here to pick a fight.

554
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:23,532
I heard you quit working as a prosecutor and live as a jobless bum.

555
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:25,862
- Are you bored? 
 - But...

556
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:27,832
if you want to get into politics,

557
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:31,252
do you think you'd have a greater chance than in this case?

558
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:33,302
Leave, man.

559
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:36,962
You looked over it, so you know this.

560
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:39,732
The people you have to call in for material witness...

561
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:42,072
Lee Pyeon Woong of Dohan Construction, Kwon Jae Shin of Sedong Daily News,

562
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:43,862
and even Chief Prosecutor Park Joo Tae.

563
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:45,782
Sexual favors, improper solicitations,

564
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:47,892
giving and accepting bribes, embezzlement, dereliction of duty,

565
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:50,272
and even violation of Political Fund Law.

566
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:54,742
Think about how all the things that these a**holes did would get exposed.

567
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:58,302
Choi Song Hwa is a victim of this case but also a witness.

568
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:02,102
She's the only witness who saw those f***ers gathered in one place.

569
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:04,052
If this is exposed properly,

570
00:34:04,052 --> 00:34:07,512
letting the world see your face is a piece of cake.

571
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:17,172
Are you really sure about this case?

572
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:22,182
Hey, you're not the type to jump into an investigation by listening to someone else.

573
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:24,272
- I'm not. 
 - Right.

574
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,542
Just because I egg you on,

575
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:29,542
you're not naive enough to bring an indictment on someone for something small.

576
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,412
Of course not.

577
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:33,742
All right. Then...

578
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:37,642
who do you think will become the star of this case?

579
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:40,522
Choi Yeo Hwan?

580
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:42,942
- Choi Song Hwa? 
 - No...

581
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:45,572
- Lee Pyeon Woong. 
 - No! Why don't you get it?

582
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:50,412
The star of this case will be you. You!

583
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:55,682
The role of a just prosecutor.

584
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:57,622
Don't you want to be one?

585
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:02,422
From what I heard...

586
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:07,132
the prosecutor who was assigned to the case is pretty ambitious, I guess.

587
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:10,492
From the look of things, I think there will be an indictment.

588
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:12,312
As for Assemblyman Choi's case,

589
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:15,212
I think you should take your hands off of it, CEO.

590
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:18,302
I believe that's the safest way to go.

591
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,472
Well...

592
00:35:25,112 --> 00:35:27,502
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

593
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:28,752
I have to drive... okay...

594
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,872
Yes, thank you.

595
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:33,542
Well...

596
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,822
and...

597
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:38,592
To mention additionally,

598
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:40,402
well...

599
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,422
to take on a case like this is a bit...

600
00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:43,372
How should I say this...

601
00:35:43,372 --> 00:35:46,192
Does it seem too disgusting and vulgar and stuff?

602
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:48,832
Yes, I guess, well...

603
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,872
not exactly, but...

604
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:53,982
It tastes good.

605
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:56,042
Well, it's okay...

606
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,672
You shouldn't have to do it if you don't want to.

607
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:03,972
Then CEO Hwang,

608
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:06,802
you can take care of Attorney Kim.

609
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:09,092
- What? 
 - You know...

610
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:10,962
I left her alone because I thought what she was doing was funny.

611
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:13,532
But I'm totally f***ed.

612
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:16,922
Then either take away her lawyer license

613
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,222
or... yeah, right!

614
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:21,882
That's right! Frame with something

615
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:24,552
and put her away behind bars, that Attorney Kim!

616
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:26,192
That sounds so fun! I—

617
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:29,542
I'd want to go visit her in prison. That'd be so fun!

618
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:31,812
Well, CEO...

619
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:35,572
Our Hwang and Goo isn't a firm that does that type of work...

620
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:38,012
Then come here.

621
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,612
Yes?

622
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:45,272
CEO Hwang, why do you say no to this and that and everything...

623
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:48,972
What then? What are you saying you'll do then?

624
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:52,702
CEO... CEO... it hurts...

625
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:03,062
CEO?

626
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:05,542
I'll break it off...

627
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:07,892
With whom?

628
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,092
With your wife?

629
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:11,722
Not her!

630
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:15,042
He's a total psycho. That f***ing a**hole...

631
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,732
 I can't do this anymore. I'm too scared. 

632
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:21,152
I think it's too late to split safely.

633
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,042
Will you be okay with that?

634
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,812
It's the earliest when you think it's too late.

635
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,562
 That's what you said. 

636
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:30,642
No.

637
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:33,392
It's a little too late for you, CEO.

638
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,532
Never mind.

639
00:37:36,532 --> 00:37:41,752
Yoo Ri, what do I need to do first?

640
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:55,872
There they are.

641
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:01,472
 He wakes up from his sleep at the mention of a golf bet. 

642
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,852
 You can pretend to play, right? 

643
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:09,142
Well, you're such a good golfer.

644
00:38:09,142 --> 00:38:11,182
Aigoo...

645
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:14,952
CEO Hwang.

646
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:16,862
You kept your players a secret from me.

647
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,812
You didn't bring the professionals, did you?

648
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:21,052
They're young.

649
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:23,072
Oh, yes, well...

650
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:24,572
They're my hoobae lawyers.

651
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:27,302
Oh, yes, say hello. This is President Kwon of Seodong Daily News.

652
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:29,512
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

653
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:39,922
Talk to him.

654
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:42,052
Stay put.

655
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,852
President!

656
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:48,522
By chance, do you remember what happened in CEO Lee Pyeon Woong's villa?

657
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:50,072
What are you talking about...

658
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:52,552
CEO Hwang, what's going on?

659
00:38:52,552 --> 00:38:54,402
W-Well... uh...

660
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:57,732
I wanted to speak with you without anyone around us

661
00:38:57,732 --> 00:38:59,972
so I asked CEO Hwang for a favor.

662
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:01,392
Who the hell are you guys?

663
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:04,222
We're Choi Song Hwa's attornies.

664
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:05,672
Choi Song Hwa?

665
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:07,482
Who's th—

666
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:14,072
Oh, I see...

667
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:16,552
No wonder. I thought you looked familiar.

668
00:39:16,552 --> 00:39:19,422
You guys were with that girl at that time.

669
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:22,582
Is there any more to say about that case?

670
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:25,012
All you have is her statement.

671
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:28,302
What if I said we have another victim?

672
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:32,022
If that victim's interview is revealed,

673
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:34,052
the public opinion will turn around in no time.

674
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:36,352
Then someone will try to stop that out of fear of that happening.

675
00:39:36,352 --> 00:39:39,422
Then you all have to get together and break the law again.

676
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:42,172
But it's not like you can stop all that from being exposed even if you try in this day and age.

677
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,032
That's right.

678
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:45,622
Even if you plug the hole in the dam that's about to burst with your finger,

679
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:47,032
you'd be the first one to crush and die.

680
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:49,942
Gosh, you guys. Why are you talking so complicated?

681
00:39:49,942 --> 00:39:51,752
So that these guys are saying is

682
00:39:51,752 --> 00:39:53,922
if you continue to hang out with Assemblyman Choi,

683
00:39:53,922 --> 00:39:56,112
you might get s*** water splashed.

684
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:58,622
- So they're saying you should watch out... 
 - No, no.

685
00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:00,602
Each person should watch out for himself.

686
00:40:00,602 --> 00:40:03,002
I'm saying don't commit any additional crimes.

687
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:04,742
If you're a genuine journalist,

688
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:07,442
I'm sure you'll treat both sides of the story fairly and balanced.

689
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:09,372
No way you wouldn't do that...

690
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,282
I'm a little embarrassed, having said everything I needed to say.

691
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:15,862
This is bad manners, but we'll get going first.

692
00:40:15,862 --> 00:40:18,242
- Joon? 
 - Yes!

693
00:40:18,242 --> 00:40:20,332
- Oh, wait... 
 - Good evening then.

694
00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:21,972
- Aigoo... 
 - Let's go!

695
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:23,492
Aigoo, it was tough to book this tee time...

696
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:25,642
- We'll just have to play. 
 - CEO, aren't you coming?

697
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:27,732
Aigoo, you'll have to play alone.

698
00:40:27,732 --> 00:40:29,222
Enjoy your time.

699
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:31,622
No, no, no, wait for me!

700
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:34,552
- Let's go! 
 - Go!

701
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:36,272
- Let's go! 
 - Goodbye!

702
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:39,132
Hey! You guys!

703
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:45,172
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you! Good night!

704
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:47,822
- Another perfect day. 
 - How come a caddy is so good?

705
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,812
I can usually do that...

706
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:54,472
So, Yoo Ri...

707
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:58,002
Do you like churches or city views and stuff like that?

708
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:00,962
What in the world are you talking about?

709
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:02,912
Don't say that.

710
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,192
A city view.

711
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:06,832
A church.

712
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,362
Or an idyllic scenery.

713
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:10,612
Pick one out of these three.

714
00:41:10,612 --> 00:41:12,022
What are you talking about out of the blue?

715
00:41:12,022 --> 00:41:14,112
Just tell me.

716
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:19,042
I like all of them.

717
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:20,772
Just pick one. One.

718
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,552
I'd feel different depending on my mood that day.

719
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:24,722
What's this...

720
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:27,242
Is it like a psychology test or something?

721
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:30,982
Yeah, right. Well, I guess it's kind of like that.

722
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:33,402
Then...

723
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:34,992
An idyllic scenery.

724
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,552
- Oh, really? 
 - Yeah.

725
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:39,582
- Okay. 
 - What is it?

726
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,652
What's the result?

727
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:45,992
I mean...

728
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:48,862
are we all going down together at this rate?

729
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:51,922
Of all things, it's because of a woman.

730
00:41:51,922 --> 00:41:53,032
On top of that,

731
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:55,412
there are numerous people who Assemblyman Choi

732
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,132
sexually harassed, whether it be women or men.

733
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,452
What are your thoughts, Prosecutor Park?

734
00:42:02,502 --> 00:42:07,962
The prosecutor who is assigned to this case is totally unpredictable.

735
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:11,372
I'm trying to wait it out and reassign it, but...

736
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:13,612
See? They're digging into what happened at the villa.

737
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:16,642
We should have a plan.

738
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,782
- A package for Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan. 
 - Oh, okay.

739
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:35,342
   

740
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,272
 If we're not careful, we'd get grouped with him 

741
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:44,292
 and be treated like sexual predators. 

742
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:46,112
 Prosecutor Park, if our relationship is revealed 

743
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:47,352
 and get investigated for 

744
00:42:47,352 --> 00:42:49,542
 anti-graft law or something, it'd cause you a headache. 

745
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:53,662
 I knew something like this was bound to happen to Assemblyman Choi. 

746
00:42:53,662 --> 00:42:56,172
 What are you going to do, CEO Lee? 

747
00:42:57,712 --> 00:42:59,322
 Well... 

748
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:02,792
 I should look for a way to get rid of him quietly. 

749
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:06,232
 I don't think I'd be able to accompany him too far, though... 

750
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:13,012
I've given them so much money...

751
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:15,432
Those a**holes!

752
00:43:22,362 --> 00:43:24,472
Come on, Chairman!

753
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:27,432
How could CEO Lee do this to me?

754
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:29,522
Dohan Construction and CEO Lee,

755
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:31,532
I'm the one who grew the company thus far all this time! Me!

756
00:43:31,532 --> 00:43:35,382
So why did you mess around with people who work under you?

757
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:37,342
No matter what you say, Chairman,

758
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:40,192
I won't go down alone like this!

759
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:45,622
As for the sexual harassment charges, just come clean and get punished for it.

760
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:48,852
While going through the trial and all that, a year or two will pass by in a breeze.

761
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:50,022
Chairman!

762
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:52,462
Once you get out of prison, I'll take care of you. So go.

763
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:57,642
- What? 
 - Instead, get rid of Lee Pyeon Woong for good.

764
00:43:58,372 --> 00:43:59,542
What are you saying—

765
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:03,102
When a dog bites a person, it's put aside.

766
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:05,332
That Pyeon Woong...

767
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:07,652
He's just gone way too far.

768
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:38,372
Assemblyman, what are you doing?

769
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:41,702
Assemblyman...

770
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:45,772
Let's stop this and why don't you hop in?

771
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:48,352
I'd like to get off work, please!

772
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:15,842
So, do you admit to the charges against you regarding Choi Song Hwa and Lee Gi Ryong?

773
00:45:15,842 --> 00:45:18,832
If loving and cherishing her is a crime,

774
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:21,312
I guess it is, then.

775
00:45:21,312 --> 00:45:25,492
Since she didn't adamantly refuse me,

776
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:27,722
from my point of view,

777
00:45:27,722 --> 00:45:31,872
I just assumed that we both liked each other.

778
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,052
Song Hwa!

779
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:39,002
If saying "Don't do this" isn't a refusal, then what exactly is refusing you?

780
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,872
Did I have to pull out a Eunjangdo* and stab my heart 
  (A small silver dagger women carried to protect their chastity in old Korea) 

781
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:45,542
for you to think, "Oh, I guess she hates it"?

782
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,522
- Secretary Choi... 
 - Then I'll tell you now.

783
00:45:48,522 --> 00:45:51,902
I gagged even if I got a whiff of your cologne

784
00:45:51,902 --> 00:45:55,562
and I hate the touch of your hand worse than a bug crawling on me!

785
00:45:55,562 --> 00:45:57,822
I hate it so much that I could die!

786
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,442
Do you get it now?

787
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:20,032
All right.

788
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:23,842
So you admitted to the charges regarding Choi Song Hwa and Lee Gi Ryong.

789
00:46:23,842 --> 00:46:26,042
And next...

790
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:40,832
What's that?

791
00:46:41,642 --> 00:46:44,972
The real story begins now.

792
00:46:46,322 --> 00:46:49,292
People who need to go home should go

793
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:53,492
and let anyone who should stay out of the room should also go.

794
00:47:00,242 --> 00:47:01,562
What?

795
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:03,712
What are you talking about?

796
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:07,132
This Assemblyman Choi... t-t-this a**hole...

797
00:47:07,132 --> 00:47:09,032
 must've spilled everything at the police station. 

798
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:10,792
So what the hell are you talking about?

799
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:13,692
 He should've just spilled the beans about the sexual harassment. 

800
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:17,892
I think he gave them all the info he's got on us!

801
00:47:19,652 --> 00:47:21,652
 A search and seizure warrant will be issued soon. 

802
00:47:21,652 --> 00:47:25,332
 So clean up the stuff you need to put away. 

803
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:35,062
The Gwangpyeong villa list?

804
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,952
What the hell is this all about?

805
00:47:37,952 --> 00:47:40,252
President, that's...

806
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:42,312
Well, it's nothing important.

807
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:46,202
How the hell are you going to clean this up?

808
00:47:46,202 --> 00:47:48,652
Geez, let go of this. D***...

809
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:50,552
President, if someone else heard you,

810
00:47:50,552 --> 00:47:53,612
they'd think I dragged you to the villa, tied you up,

811
00:47:53,612 --> 00:47:56,712
and forced all that stuff on you.

812
00:47:56,712 --> 00:47:57,512
What?

813
00:47:57,512 --> 00:48:01,042
Besides, you should be the one doing the cleaning up.

814
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:05,542
That's why I gave you money, alcohol, women, men, everything! S***!

815
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:09,092
What the hell! You a**hole!

816
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:13,812
Whoa, hey...

817
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:19,182
 Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan admitted to the charges of sexual harassment on his secretary 

818
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:20,742
 and turned himself in. 

819
00:48:20,742 --> 00:48:24,672
 However, new facts were revealed while investigating this case 

820
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:28,232
 prompting the prosecution to expand its investigation. 

821
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:33,192
   

822
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:44,302
Additionally, through the victims' testimonies,

823
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:47,132
we were able to confirm that CEO Lee Pyeon Woong

824
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,762
of Dohan Construction invited Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan

825
00:48:49,762 --> 00:48:55,222
and other influencers in the political, business, media, and judicial fields

826
00:48:55,222 --> 00:49:00,292
to a villa that he owned to provide sexual favors and bribes...

827
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,682
The role of a just prosecutor?

828
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:09,242
"The prosecution will investigate this case thoroughly"

829
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:11,542
"and will not leave a speck of suspicion."

830
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:14,942
"We promise that to the people of this nation."

831
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:23,482
 We will investigate this case thoroughly 

832
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:25,432
 and will not leave a speck of suspicion. 

833
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:28,852
 We promise that to the people of this nation. 

834
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,042
This is daebak.

835
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:33,932
Isn't that prosecutor totally awesome?

836
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:41,912
You went through a lot all this time.

837
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,652
Thank you for your help.

838
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,542
I think I can do a good job.

839
00:49:53,592 --> 00:49:55,752
Thank you so much, Attorney.

840
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:58,202
You're very welcome.

841
00:49:58,202 --> 00:50:02,332
You're always welcome, Song Hwa.

842
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,172
Welcome.

843
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:08,762
I know...

844
00:50:23,342 --> 00:50:28,342
You know we've never been on an official date, right?

845
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:29,582
Whoa.

846
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:31,702
You're right.

847
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:42,342
Sorry. When I focus on work,

848
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,202
I usually can't pay attention to anything else.

849
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:47,702
So my ex-boyfriend—

850
00:50:51,912 --> 00:50:53,472
So he was sad about it, huh?

851
00:50:53,472 --> 00:50:54,762
Just like me, huh?

852
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:56,822
No. That's not what I meant.

853
00:50:56,822 --> 00:50:59,312
I think that's what you meant.

854
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:04,562
I guess you tend to cover up your fault with another wrongdoing, huh?

855
00:51:05,252 --> 00:51:06,742
Sorry.

856
00:51:09,312 --> 00:51:10,492
It's okay.

857
00:51:10,492 --> 00:51:14,982
I'm a very generous lover, unlike the men you used to date.

858
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:16,552
I don't think so.

859
00:51:16,552 --> 00:51:19,542
You were very scary just now.

860
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:28,662
In any case, we'll go on a date tonight no matter what happens.

861
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:31,152
Sounds good.

862
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:47,602
♫  I guess I recognize your laughter  ♫

863
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:53,620
♫  She's waking me up with that pretty smile  ♫

864
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:57,772
♫  You make me smile  ♫

865
00:51:57,772 --> 00:52:00,622
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

866
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:07,190
♫  I wonder if you know that I feel this way  ♫

867
00:52:08,452 --> 00:52:12,390
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

868
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:16,382
♫  I send my heart  ♫

869
00:52:16,382 --> 00:52:21,242
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

870
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:27,002
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

871
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:32,742
♫  Like the wind, it blows without ending  ♫

872
00:52:32,742 --> 00:52:36,982
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

873
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:41,562
♫  Like that night sky  ♫

874
00:52:54,442 --> 00:52:56,552
Where did you get the car?

875
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:59,152
Isn't it cute? I bought it.

876
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:02,292
Why would you buy a car out of the blue?

877
00:53:03,082 --> 00:53:05,682
Because my legs hurt...

878
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,472
Let's go.

879
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,192
Wow, the new car smell...

880
00:53:15,162 --> 00:53:17,562
But don't you smell roses from somewhere?

881
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,302
What?

882
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:21,362
Is it a diffuser?

883
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:27,252
I don't... I don't know...

884
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:32,812
So did you think about it?

885
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:34,232
About what?

886
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:38,522
I mean, about the blind date I went on.

887
00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:40,922
Why it doesn't make you angry?

888
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:44,212
Well...

889
00:53:57,582 --> 00:53:59,462
I've thought about it.

890
00:53:59,462 --> 00:54:03,522
The reason I'm not mad about you going on a blind date is

891
00:54:03,522 --> 00:54:08,122
just because I like you so much.

892
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:11,622
I don't even get jealous over stuff like that.

893
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:14,222
That's how much I like you, Jeong Ho.

894
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:17,552
And I like where we are right now.

895
00:54:18,152 --> 00:54:20,942
Where we are right now?

896
00:54:20,942 --> 00:54:23,342
What do you mean by that?

897
00:54:24,102 --> 00:54:29,282
I mean, you're not going to get down to it and ask me to marry you like Do Jin Ki.

898
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:35,292
If we can get along well like now,

899
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:37,512
I have nothing more to ask.

900
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:03,562
Sir?

901
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:07,742
If you're finished, the dessert...

902
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:09,612
Should I prepare it for you?

903
00:55:09,612 --> 00:55:12,182
   

904
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:21,032
No!

905
00:55:24,062 --> 00:55:26,472
- We won't eat desserts! 
 - Pardon?

906
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:27,802
I said no desserts!

907
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:28,772
No, we won't!

908
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:29,892
You won't have any dessert?

909
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:31,262
I want to eat it.

910
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:32,412
- Please give it to us. 
 - Yes.

911
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,442
No, no, no!

912
00:55:35,242 --> 00:55:36,762
- You can't! 
 - Sir, it's dessert.

913
00:55:36,762 --> 00:55:38,222
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

914
00:55:38,222 --> 00:55:39,772
- The dessert... 
 - We won't eat the dessert.

915
00:55:39,772 --> 00:55:41,912
- I said I'll eat it. 
 - Yes.

916
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:44,072
- I don't eat sweets. No sweets. 
 - Excuse me?

917
00:55:44,072 --> 00:55:46,342
We-We had enough to eat j-just now.

918
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,162
This place...

919
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:49,582
This place's desserts aren't that good.

920
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:51,492
- Then I'll eat it by myself. 
 - Okay...

921
00:55:51,492 --> 00:55:54,422
- Let's leave. Let's go. 
 - Why—

922
00:55:54,422 --> 00:55:56,562
What's wrong with him?

923
00:55:57,502 --> 00:55:58,882
I'm sorry.

924
00:55:58,882 --> 00:56:00,822
I'm sorry.

925
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:12,792
Hey...

926
00:56:16,568 --> 00:56:18,008
CEO!

927
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:19,598
You must rush.

928
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:23,168
You must leave the country before they put a travel ban on you.

929
00:56:27,198 --> 00:56:29,218
What is it?

930
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:31,228
What is it?

931
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,408
What's this?

932
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:41,398
I had someone trail Assemblyman Choi.

933
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,478
When was this?

934
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:47,048
Looks like he paid a visit to Chairman Lee before he turned himself in.

935
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,268
So...

936
00:56:54,388 --> 00:56:58,018
my father is the one who threw me under the bus.

937
00:57:47,608 --> 00:57:49,828
Hi, Father.

938
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,728
You're acting strange tonight.

939
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:01,278
What?

940
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:03,778
Did you buy a piano too?

941
00:58:03,778 --> 00:58:05,608
It's pretty.

942
00:58:17,218 --> 00:58:20,908
It's okay. I'm not in the mood tonight.

943
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,318
What's wrong with you tonight?

944
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:26,068
Talk to me.

945
00:58:35,398 --> 00:58:38,088
I'm very serious about you,

946
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:41,738
but I don't think you feel the same way.

947
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:56,388
Sorry.

948
00:58:56,388 --> 00:59:01,578
Actually, I've been distracted all day today.

949
00:59:03,038 --> 00:59:07,468
After that happened to Lee Pyeon Woong, I thought I'd feel relieved.

950
00:59:07,468 --> 00:59:09,808
But it wasn't like that.

951
00:59:11,008 --> 00:59:15,408
I thought the bitter resentment I had in my heart would melt a way a little bit, but

952
00:59:16,028 --> 00:59:18,238
it didn't.

953
00:59:19,678 --> 00:59:21,638
You know...

954
00:59:22,488 --> 00:59:24,938
ever since my father passed away,

955
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:27,738
I always felt like I was being chased by something.

956
00:59:27,738 --> 00:59:31,488
Do you know the feeling where the minutes and seconds go by so quickly?

957
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:35,628
I felt like that all along.

958
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:42,708
But when I'm with you,

959
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:46,498
the time passes by very slowly.

960
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:52,388
Makes me wonder if that's what being peaceful means.

961
00:59:53,338 --> 00:59:58,218
I love each and every day I spend with you, Jeong Ho.

962
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,418
I'm happy.

963
01:00:21,408 --> 01:00:23,668
I know...

964
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:26,818
I'm rushing into this

965
01:00:28,088 --> 01:00:31,658
and I know you're not quite ready yet, but...

966
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:36,308
even if I ask myself a hundred, a thousand times,

967
01:00:37,888 --> 01:00:40,288
my answer is still the same.

968
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:55,948
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

969
01:00:55,948 --> 01:00:59,968
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

970
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:02,460
Marry me, Yoo Ri.

971
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:07,898
♫  When I think about you  ♫

972
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:14,458
♫  The spring that resembles you comes to my heart  ♫

973
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,208
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

974
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:20,208
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

975
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:23,228
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

976
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:26,640
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

977
01:01:28,108 --> 01:01:34,908
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

978
01:01:34,908 --> 01:01:40,188
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

979
01:01:40,188 --> 01:01:47,920
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

980
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:52,940
♫  Will you tell me you love me?  ♫

981
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,058


982
01:01:57,058 --> 01:01:59,718
   

983
01:01:59,718 --> 01:02:02,433
 Marriage isn't that easy. 

984
01:02:02,433 --> 01:02:03,582
 Break up with my son! 

985
01:02:03,582 --> 01:02:05,538
 - Hey! 
 - Mom! 

986
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:07,078
 Mom, Mom, Mom! 

987
01:02:07,078 --> 01:02:10,118
 Do you want to live together? Just move in together. 

988
01:02:10,118 --> 01:02:12,508
 What kind of person is Attorney Kim's mother? 

989
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:14,838
 - Die! 
 - Where are you? 

990
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:16,198
 Mom! 

991
01:02:16,198 --> 01:02:17,868
 You have to come alone. 

992
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,638
 I'll find your mother no matter what it takes. 

993
01:02:20,638 --> 01:02:23,538
 I told you I don't make promises I can't keep. 

994
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:25,258
 I promise you. 

995
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:29,100
♫  It's always you for me  ♫
