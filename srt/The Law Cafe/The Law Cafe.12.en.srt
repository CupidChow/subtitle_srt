What does that matter, whether it's been one day or one hour?

71

I feel a little shy about letting other people know about it,

76
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,807

I couldn't pay you much attention because I was busy with work.

Yeah! That's it.

96
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,027

00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,837
Hyung, you can't figure it out even after seeing her all this time?

166
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,697
Kim Yoo Ri has no fear in the world.

167
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,797
Oh, wait. No. Actually, there is something she's afraid of.

168
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:38,067
The attention of others.

169
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:41,117
How others would see us and how others would—

170
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:44,067
Oh, there was a mosquito on you.

171
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,007
Hyung.

172
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:56,227
Is there a problem?

173
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,237
Yeah...

174
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:59,837
You didn't look too good since earlier...

175
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,947
Is something wrong?

176
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:04,517
No, what could possibly be wrong?

177
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,497
Let's go.

[The Law Cafe]

180
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:10,547
The food turned out well today as well.

181
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:11,577
- Yeah, Hyungnim!
- Isn't it good?

182
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,597
Oh, is the soup good?

183
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,017
Eat up!

184
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,907
Eat up.

185
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,207
What else do you want to eat?

186
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,907
Oh, oh, okay. Here, here.

187
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,287
Here, you should eat a lot of meat.

188
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,297
Then what will Ms. Chae eat?

189
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:26,307
She hurt her arm before.

190
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,967
She's still in recovery. In recovery.

191
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,947
Eat up.

192
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:36,377
But where did the doctor go?

193
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,677
I don't see him today.

194
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:40,007
Well, when I saw him in the morning,

195
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,997
maybe he's dealing with some issue, but his face was pale

196
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:46,167
- and didn't look good.
- He must have gotten indigestion again.

197
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,477
He gets indigestion really easily.

198
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,107
Give it to me. I'll do it.

199
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,437
The laver...

200
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:59,447
Here. Okay, eat!

201
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,427
- Good.
- Right?

202
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,687
So savory.

203
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,907
Oh, yeah. It's savory.

204
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,137
It's savory.

205
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:18,057
It's savory. Try it.

206
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,297
Try tasting it.

207
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,817
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

208
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,547
Yeah, you guys probably enjoyed your food.

209
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,707
Did they decide to start dating?

210
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:34,757
I've never seen such a public secret dating relationship.

211
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:38,327
They're really making it difficult for themselves.

212
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:44,217
Where did it go?

213
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:46,297
What?

214
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,687
The flower pot over there.

215
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:50,667
Did Eun Kang take it to water it?

216
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,107
I guess he did.

217
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:53,527
Here, drink some coffee.

218
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,267
- Have you tried it?
- Oh, wait.

219
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,157
It's perfect. It's just right.

220
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,077
It's okay, right?

221
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,177
Yeah.

Tissue, tissue... here.

Geez, they're really starting to annoy me.

Will that be enough?

226
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,557
Oh, no! Hyung! You can't do that!

227
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:18,367
No?

228
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,837
We're going to have to clean it up.

229
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,747
Still...
- No, no! Hold it in!

00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,367

Geez! Why are you here now? I called you forever ago!

233
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,927
Are you sure that Kang Do Hyun died?

234
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:41,537
Prosecutor, you told me last time

235
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:45,497
to check all the bodies unclaimed by family relatives.
[Notice of Unclaimed Bodies]

So I was looking through them when I saw this name here.

237
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,677
The date of birth matches too.

238
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:57,577
Geez, it turns out that Lee Pyeon Woong is one scary bastard.

239
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,207
Because he feels like someone might catch up to him,

240
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:02,507
he killed him off to prevent any connections leading to him.

241
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:05,877
I'm going to head to the police, so organize the files for me.

242
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,197
Okay.

243
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:11,097
Who killed whom?

244
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,457
What's this all about?

245
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:20,767
The guy who hit you and drove off.

246
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,177
We thought we had nearly found him.

247
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:24,317
That man died?

248
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,587
Are you telling me that Lee Pyeon Woong just killed that man?

249
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:29,767
We're only saying that there's reasonable cause for suspicion.

250
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,507
This is ridiculous.

251
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,417
Why is he going to such an extent?

252
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,467
Because he's a bastard who knows no boundaries.

253
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,987
Hey, Yoo Ri.

254

We're already commuting to and from work together.

00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,117
What more do you want?

257
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:50,917
I'm just saying that we should be more careful!

258
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,297
Okay. Let's say that we're always sticking together.

259
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:55,637
How long do you think we can keep this up?

Until Lee Pyeon Woong dies?

00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:02,637
I want to be lovers with you.

262
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,467
I don't want you to be my guardian.

263
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:38,527
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry—

264
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,847
When I looked up your interview,

265
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:46,827
you said your dream is for the Law Cafe to be everywhere, like Starbucks.

266
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:48,997
What do you think of me?

267
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:51,317
I'm an attorney as well.

268
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,487
It's you, right?

269
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:53,867
The person I met at the office.

270
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,337
Oh, Attorney!

271
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,707
What a coincidence to meet you here!

272
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,117
Oh, right! Attorney, your cafe was in this neighborhood, right?

273
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,157
Yes, that's right.

274
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:04,007
I've been meaning to contact you...

275
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,347
Oh, were you taking a stroll?

276
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:07,407
Yes.

277
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:11,397
Since we've met anyway, shall we walk together for a moment?

278
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,787
Oh, okay! Sounds good.

279
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,917
So you were part of a public interest foundation at a law firm,

280
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,987
and you left and opened your own legal office?

281
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:22,267
How are you so similar to me?

282
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:25,367
I know. I find it so interesting as well.

283
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,487
So I was thinking,

284
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,987
I do this with my colleagues called "Wish Law,"

285
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:34,537
that is, a public interest lawyers' meeting called "Law that fulfills wishes."

286
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:37,877
Would you be able to come to our meeting once later?

287
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:39,917
We're your fans.

288
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,227
Gosh, you don't mean that.

289
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,627
- Okay!
- Seriously?

290
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,477
I'm so excited!

291
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:49,967
But when I saw you before, you didn't look too well.

292
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,877
Were you dealing with some issues?

293
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:56,177
Oh, I had a little fight with my boyfriend.

294
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:07,397
Here.

295
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,917
So...

296
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:12,737
even before 24 hours passed since you guys started dating, you guys fought?

297
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:16,087
I mean, it's possible with you guys.

298
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:21,347
Do you think it's normal to be so d*** scared like this?

299
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:26,627
I'm scared to just let her walk in the streets.

300
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:29,537
I'm scared that something might happen while walking in the streets.

301
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:32,917
I'm scared that she might suddenly disappear from me.

302
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,337
Or that I do something wrong, and something happens to her because of me...

303
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,107
Seriously, if it were up to me,

304
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:45,417
I want to prevent her from going anywhere or doing anything.

305
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:49,287
I mean, I understand that my situation is like that.

306
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,387
But he's just so anxious about my every single move.

307
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:55,557
But I feel like it's just getting more severe...

308
00:17:57,697 --> 00:17:58,847
Oh, I'm sorry.

309
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:01,797
I'm saying all kinds of things to you, Da Young.

310
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,267
You're so lucky.

311
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:09,357
Excuse me?

312
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:13,017
He must love you very much to be acting like that.

313
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:16,247
Is that so?

314
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:24,487
If there's no madness, anxiety, and fear, how could that be love?

315
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:26,847
They're all part of the whirlpool of emotions you'll experience.

316
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,407
This feeling of anxiety, fear, and going mad...

317
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:32,037
This is normal?

318
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,237
How did you endure this?

319
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:38,667
Now you have Yoo Na as well. Don't you get anxious?

320
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,347
I'm literally spending all my time watching the baby, neglecting my restaurant.

321
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,177
You think I'm not anxious?

322
00:18:43,177 --> 00:18:45,647
And honestly, you're not even at my level to come to me like this.

323
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,787
Do you know the burden of raising a child?

324
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,267
Hyung.

325
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,857

328
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,377
I was calling you. Why couldn't you hear me?

329
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:03,407
Are you already headed home?

330
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:06,577
Oh... well...

331
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,877
Hyung, is something the matter?

332
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,387
There is something wrong, right?

333
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:13,317
What is it?

334
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,637
I think that woman came back.

335
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:51,022
Do you want to come inside before you leave?

336
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,762
Are you not angry?

337
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:58,200
I am angry, but I want to be with you.

338
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:12,502
It's a shame, but I'll just go for today.

339
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,712
I told Hyung I'll be with him.

340
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,102
Suddenly?

341
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:17,662
Yeah.

342
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:21,182
Hyung Woo Jin is feeling a bit anxious.

343
00:20:21,182 --> 00:20:25,352
It's not an impromptu arrangement you came up with in case I came onto you?

344
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,172
I'm telling you now, but I plan to start shyly holding hands,

345
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:32,462
and do everything in order, one step at a time.

346
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,402
What do you mean, do everything in order? In this day and age?

347
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,662
Just mix it up!

348
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:39,332
I'm agreeing to keep our relationship secret from that line of thought.

349
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:42,492
That we do things in order, one step at a time.

350
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,182
We're old enough. What do you mean, do things one step at a time?

351
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,822
I'm not interested in doing anything like that—

352
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:59,532
You don't even know if you can handle it,

353
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:03,172
so don't tempt me.

354
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,682
Kim Yoo Ri, what's wrong?

355
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,372
Why...

356
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,552
Who says I can't handle it?

357
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,762
What's this?

358
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,832
Why?

359
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,632
Do you feel like someone broke into your place?

360
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:46,902
Yeah. I'm sure of it.

361
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:50,102
So you're saying that person made this mess, right?

362
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:53,862
No, I made most of the mess, but...

363
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,602
Although it looks like a random mess, there's a certain method to my madness.

364
00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:59,002
Look at that remote control!

365
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,182
It's in its rightful place.

366
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:01,952
If it were me, I'd never do that.

367
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:04,352
That cupboard door too. I'm sure I left it open this opening before leaving,

368
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,372
and they're closed right now!

369
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,352
What about missing items?

370
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:12,632
I don't know about that yet.

371
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,062
Is this the work of Lee Pyeon Woong, or whatever the name of that bastard was?

372
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,412
Hey, that's not something you should be asking us. That's for you guys to figure out!

373
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:20,182
But why are you already furious?

374
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:23,442
How can I not get furious about this? Something like this happened again!

375
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,142
So what are you going to do about this?

376
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:27,322
What do you mean, what am I going to do about this?

377
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:28,672
Obviously, we'll reinforce the patrol around this place—

378
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:29,882
You think that's going to be enough?

379
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,962
Then what? Should I live with her for the rest of her life?

380
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:33,432
If you would do that, then I would be grateful!

381
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,592
My house got broken into. Why are you guys fighting?

382
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,202
You should go. Dr. Woo Jin is probably waiting for you.

383
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:42,442
Where would I go with all this happening?

384
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,762
So what's going on right now?

385
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:51,292
So there are some strange people

386
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,172
surrounding Attorney Kim Yoo Ri. So I'm looking into it.

387
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,192
There are other people following her aside from us?

388
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:00,632
What?

389
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,432
What's this?

390
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:08,342
Wow, if you think about it, Attorney Kim is really unlucky.

391
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:11,392
How is it that all the guys after her are like this?

392
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:15,082
God d*** it.

393
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:18,342
I really hate it when others mess with what's mine.

394
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:20,332
What should I do about this...

395
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:26,952
How did you come to this conclusion?

396
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:28,572
I can't leave you by yourself,

397
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:31,142
but I also can't leave this hyung by himself.

398
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,232
And you refused to come to my place, so...

399
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:34,912
what other option do I have?

400
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,922
We'll be staying with you for a while.

401
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:42,852
I think she's angry.

402
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:45,902
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri is a public welfare attorney.

403
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,872
What are you doing?

404
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,192
I'm in the middle of taking care of myself. Why?

405
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:08,712
So that I could look prettier in someone's eyes.

406
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:11,772
Where could you possibly get prettier?

407
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:13,042
Oh, my God, you must be crazy!

408
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,892
Why are you getting so fluttery over that?

409
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,972
Now get used to it.

410
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,002
Come outside.

411
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:20,402
Let's have a drink since things turned out like this.

412
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:25,592
"Where could you possibly get prettier?"

413
00:24:25,592 --> 00:24:27,582
Am I liking this or hating this?

414
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:30,302
Drinking like this after so long feels–

415
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:32,812
Here.

416
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,632
All right.

417
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,132
Well...

418
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:46,112
I'm not sure if it's good for me to follow him all the way here like this,

419
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:49,042
but recently, I've been a bit afraid.

420
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,842
Hyung, if it's difficult for you, you don't have to tell her.

421
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,002
Three years ago, I went through a difficult situation.

422
00:24:59,002 --> 00:25:01,902
And I moved my hospital as well as a result.

423
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,812
There was a really tenacious stalker after him.

424
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:08,482
He really went through a hard time back then.

425
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,562
A stalker?

426
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,862
Thank you...

427
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,182
At first,

428
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,262
we met as a patient and doctor at the hospital.

429
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:20,972
Don't worry.

430
00:25:20,972 --> 00:25:22,772
Oh, I'm sorry—

431
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,682
- Oh, my goodness! Doctor.
- Oh, hello.

432
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:27,532
Oh, sorry!

433
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:28,552
Let's eat.

434
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:32,992
At first, she slowly began obsessing over me.

435
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,012
Okay, I'm heading home now.

436
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,312
Did you see my umbrella?

437
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:43,252
No, we haven't.

438
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,122
Later, at every location I went...

439
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,272
Then you should have applied immediately for a restraining order!

440
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:13,232
Of course, he did.

441
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:14,212
But whenever she gets caught,

442
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:16,182
she just pays the fine and keeps doing it.

443
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:17,902
It just so happens that her family is rich.

444
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:18,842
What?

445
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:21,352
I mean, a law to punish stalking exists now,

446
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:22,812
but back then,

447
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:25,942
there were no legal ways to prohibit behavior like that.

448
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:27,342
So after a while,

449
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:29,902
it got to the point where she was breaking into his house,

450
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,372
so she almost got prison time.

451
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:32,952
But this man here

452
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:35,212
decided to write her a letter of non-punishment!

453
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:40,132
I mean, her parents promised me that they would send her abroad.

454
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,522
But then...

455
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:47,642
are you still dealing with the same problem?

456
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:50,442
Well, things were fine for several years,

457
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,282
but recently, it kept feeling like someone was tailing me.

458
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:57,002
- It could just be me being paranoid, but...
- No, no, no.

459
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:59,452
The pattern is way too similar to the last time.

460
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,642
Hyung.

461
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:03,502
If you're thinking of going soft on her because she's a patient or whatever,

462
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,012
you'd better come to your senses about this.

463
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:10,402
She spread weird rumors and caused your hospital to go out of business.

464
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:14,052
Why did you forgive her then? I still can't understand it.

465
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,182
But I mean, I can understand the doctor.

466
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:20,942
If my patient did that,

467
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:24,352
I don't think I could have hated her for it.

468
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,672
It's true that this bastard is following you!

469
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:38,462
What do you mean you were being paranoid?

470
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,712
But didn't you say that the person stalking you is a woman, Doctor?

471
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:43,002
This bastard is a man.

472
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:45,932
No! This woman hired other people to follow him around like this.

473
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,112
I'm 100% positive about this.

474
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:49,892
Who's accepting dirty requests like this?

475
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:53,612
They should have some pride being in this business! They should be demolished.

476
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:56,562
Hyung, are you okay?

477
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:59,072
Yeah. I'm okay.

478
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,982
But if this is from yesterday,

479
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:05,662
isn't she somewhere nearby right now?

480
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,512
Is it a gathering I can't accompany you to?

481
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,252
It's a public interest attorneys' meeting.

482
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:12,782
It's a place filled with attorneys. What could possibly happen there?

483
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:14,212
I'm not saying that particular space is dangerous.

484
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:15,882
There's the travel to and from that place...

485
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:20,022
And so, I decided to meet with that attorney and go there together.

486
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,442
Not only that, I'll be meeting them for the first time.

487
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:26,552
It's not like I can show up with my lover.

488
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,102
Lover?

489
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,012
Yeah, lover.

490
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:32,622
Aren't you?

491
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:36,292
If you say so, then I am.

492
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,042
Then, lover,

493
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,532
although I appreciate your concern,

494
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:42,132
I'll take care and go.

495
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,592
Okay.

496
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,552
Hello.

497
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,202
You arrived on time.

498
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:52,642
I bought you this. I thought you might be thirsty.

499
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:53,642
Please, drink.

500
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:55,722
Thank you.

501
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,782
But, Attorney, you're so pretty today as well.

502
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:08,062
Gosh! No, you're prettier, Da Young!

503
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:10,362
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

504
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,682
Hello.

505
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,712
Hello.

506
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:44,742
Why are you here?

507
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,352
- Yeah... What was I doing again—
- Hey, you!

508
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:50,092
4885!

509
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:51,582
That's you, right?

510
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:52,692
Excuse me?

511
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:54,212
Get out, get out.

512
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:57,052
Oh, the car? Yeah, I'll move out of the way.

513
00:29:58,252 --> 00:29:59,862
Where do you think you're going?

514
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:02,272
Get out! Right now.

515
00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:04,372
Hurry up and get out of the car!

516
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:06,972
Open the door for him so he can get off.

517
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,032
Oh, no!

518
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:12,052
- What, what? What's wrong?
- What should I do?

519
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:15,472
We refer to our files when we have our discussions during our meetings.

520
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:17,232
And it was my turn to get the documents ready.

521
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,052
Yes, and?

522
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:20,592
But I was so excited about meeting with you that

523
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:22,222
I think I left it at home.

524
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:22,982
What should I do?

525
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:25,502
Then how about we go over to our cafe and print them again...

526
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:27,732
No. I live right around here.

527
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:30,252
Can we stop by for a second?

528
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:32,492
Sure. Why not?

529
00:30:34,362 --> 00:30:36,192
Please come in.

530
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:40,052
- Give me a moment.
- Okay.

531
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,402
[Congratulations on your opening, Dr. Park Woo Jin from Bareun Neuropsychiatry]

532
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,372
Where did it go?

533
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,922
[Congratulations on your opening, Dr. Park Woo Jin from Bareun Neuropsychiatry]

534
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,782
How do I look?

535
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:29,202
It looks good on me, too, right?

536
00:31:29,202 --> 00:31:32,302
Let me try on the shoes, too.

537
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:49,542
Is the medicine already working?

538
00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:05,372
I ought to!

539
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,162
Here.

540
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,712
I mean...

541
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:18,242
We were just asked to keep an eye out.

542
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:21,412
Don't you even have any ethics in your work?

543
00:32:21,412 --> 00:32:24,062
She basically outsourced stalking!

544
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:27,332
If that woman told you to watch someone 24/7,

545
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:29,632
didn't you just feel it in your gut? I just ought to!

546
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:32,592
Sir, you know best.

547
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:36,022
It's really tough for us to make a living these days.

548
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:39,632
And how could we turn down work like this?

549
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:42,232
Why are you listening to him? Just report to the police.

550
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:43,632
Hand him over.

551
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:45,522
Sir, Sir...

552
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:48,852
Please... I have two kids to feed.

553
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:50,212
But still.

554
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:52,242
You shouldn't have done that.

555
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:54,602
To you and that attorney...

556
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:57,252
- I'm so apolo—
- Wait.

557
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:58,912
- Attorney?
- Yes!

558
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:01,902
You know, the one who runs a cafe downstairs...

559
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:03,742
What about her?

560
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:07,812
Hurry up and spill it!

561
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:09,642
I'm not sure. She just...

562
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:12,122
told me to keep an eye on her too.

563
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:14,282
They were meeting today too.

564
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:16,382
Who is meeting whom?

565
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:20,952
My client and that lady attorney.

566
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:19,052
Awake already?

567
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,462
Let me see...

568
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,012
9:05 a.m. Coming to the cafe in your car.

569
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:31,572
You give consultations all morning

570
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:35,922
and visit Happy Market at 1:08 p.m. to have lunch with your employees.

571
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:38,312
Resume your consultations at 2 p.m.

572
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:42,702
Have dinner at the cafe at 6:30 p.m. and close the cafe.

573
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:48,162
And then review documents and take care of work until 9 p.m.

574
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:50,782
You live so diligently,

575
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:52,582
don't you?

576
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,992
But I'm so curious about this.

577
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:59,362
No matter how many photos we take,

578
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:02,462
it's not like you can photograph one's heart.

579
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,312
Attorney, which one do you like between two?

580
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,672
It was you, right?

581
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:15,562
The stalker who is after Dr. Woo Jin.

582
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,492
You've heard about me, too?

583
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,242
You really must be close to him.

584
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:28,052
But you know...

585
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:33,552
Attorney, how come you're so pretty?

586
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,512
Is it your eyes?

587
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:41,592
What can I do...

588
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:46,492
to receive love from someone like Dr. Woo Jin?

589
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:50,132
Attorney, please let me know.

590
00:35:56,962 --> 00:36:00,162
The customer is not answering the phone.

591
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:14,212
The customer is not answering the phone.

592
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,212
Where are they?

593
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:26,972
I wouldn't know—

594
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:28,122
Tell me! Where are they!

595
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,212
I'm telling the truth! I really don't know!

596
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:31,702
Calm down, Jeong Ho. I'm sure they're fine.

597
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:33,942
How would you know that, Hyung?

598
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,512
- Tell me her address.
- She must be at her office.

599
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,572
I'll call and ask.

600
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,782
Don't do this...

601
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:52,402
and let me just go now.

602
00:36:52,402 --> 00:36:54,072
Why would Dr. Woo Jin like me?

603
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:57,252
That's your misunderstanding, Da Young.

604
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:01,962
I can tell by just looking at Dr. Woo Jin's eyes.

605
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:08,212
I've imagined ten million times how he would look at the woman he's in love with.

606
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:12,292
How does it feel when Dr. Woo Jin looks at you like that?

607
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,382
It's your misunderstanding!

608
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,702
Don't waste your energy on something so silly, and let me go!

609
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,602
I see...

610
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:22,412
I guess you don't know since your eyes are only on that man.

611
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:25,632
That's why my Dr. Woo Jin's eyes looked so sad.

612
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,592
I have no idea what kind of imagination you've got going there...

613
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,722
It's okay.

614
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:35,562
If he likes a woman like you, I'll become like you and love him.

615
00:37:35,562 --> 00:37:38,322
Do you think doing this is loving him?

616
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,242
I feel like burning up and tormented.

617
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:43,742
If this isn't love, then what? What is it?

618
00:37:43,742 --> 00:37:46,792
It's an obsession. It's violence.

619
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,702
Love isn't selfish like this.

620
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,532
So stop now.

621
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:55,882
For the sake of Dr. Woo Jin, you shouldn't go any further with this.

622
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:02,912
Now that I'm looking at you,

623
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:05,882
your eyes, Attorney...

624
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:08,532
really suck...

625
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:10,732
I think you see me as a joke.

626
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,712
Come on.

627
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:27,612
Are you sure it's here?

628
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:35,632
What the?

629
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,340
She's some kind of lunatic b****.

630
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,550
Hi, Attorney Kim.

631
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,117
Yoo Ri! Kim Yoo Ri!

632
00:38:57,117 --> 00:39:00,087
Are you okay? Open the door!

633
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,637
Kim Yoo Ri!

634
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:03,317
Who is it...

635
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,457
Yoo Ri!

636
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,607
What the?

637
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:11,767
Wh-Who are you...

638
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,237
Okay...

639
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:17,177
This is...

640
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:19,437
What are you doing here?

641
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:23,197
I mean, I heard some crazy lunatic was hanging around you

642
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:27,027
so I came here to rescue you.

643
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:29,167
Like a prince.

644
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,087
That's right.

645
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:34,787
I'll have to rescue Attorney Kim.

646
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:36,657
Pardon?

647
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:38,217
Think about it, Director.

648
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:43,052
If the guy who killed her father shows up in the nick of time and rescues her.

649
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,687
How would you feel if that happened?

650
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:48,127
When Attorney Kim tried to run over me with her car...

651
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:51,717
I'm sure she'd feel similar to how I felt then.

652
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,237
It was a s***ty feeling.

653
00:40:00,627 --> 00:40:05,417
So you shouldn't be nice to just any stranger!

654
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,017
Hey. What the heck?

655
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:13,317
S***. She's fast.

656
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:16,257
She's running away!

657
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,957
But I have no reason to catch her.

658
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:23,337
I'm fine as long as I rescue you, Attorney Kim.

659
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,547
Like a prince.

660
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,127
[Detective Se Yeon]

661
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,527
- Hello?
- Come to the station right away.

662
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,577
Kim Yoo Ri is here.

663
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,397
Taxi!

664
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,407
Hyung, aren't you getting in?

665
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:00,737
You go ahead.

666
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,077
I'll be right behind you.

667
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:03,857
Okay.

668
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:43,947
Doctor...

669
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,707
It's been a while.

670
00:41:47,707 --> 00:41:51,137
I couldn't...

671
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:55,477
stand to be apart from you...

672
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:57,967
That's why I'm here.

673
00:41:57,967 --> 00:42:00,327
Doctor, please...

674
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:04,066
Could you just love me?

675
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:13,604
Yoo Ri!

676
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,324
Jeong Ho.

677
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,014
You son of a b****!

678
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:26,704
Move! Move it!

679
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,194
That son of a b****!

680
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:30,364
What's with you? I'm a witness.

681
00:42:30,364 --> 00:42:31,374
Witness?

682
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,574
Witness, my a**!

683
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:35,794
- Cut the crap, you a**hole!
- It's true.

684
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:40,964
He brought Yoo Ri from that woman's house.

685
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:46,641
You motherf***er, what the hell are you up to!

686
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:48,621
What the hell am I up to?

687
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,641
My nephew speaks so poorly toward me, doesn't he?

688
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:53,781
Please step aside.

689
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:59,301
I really reflected on my actions last time.

690
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:03,741
It made me wonder if it was because I couldn't gain popularity before a big meeting.

691
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:07,491
I really have been renewed.

692
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:08,631
But you know...

693
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,631
I bumped into someone I know today

694
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:13,781
and he said he accidentally saw Attorney Kim getting dragged somewhere.

695
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:15,851
So, you know, I went after her because I was so worried.

696
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,821
And it was such a big mess when I got there.

697
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:19,641
Are you okay?

698
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:23,691
When I look around after being renewed,

699
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:27,541
it makes me wonder why I've made both of you my enemies.

700
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:31,091
So as your uncle, befitting of an adult,

701
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:33,961
I decided to offer a truce.

702
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:37,811
From now on, I'll stop fighting with you guys.

703
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:39,111
Cut the bulls***.

704
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,001
Think of all the things you've done.

705
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,441
You've already crossed the line, you murderer!

706
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:56,731
How could my a**hole of a nephew conspire against his uncle like this?

707
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,581
I'm telling you this clearly.

708
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:06,281
If you guys leave me alone, I'll also leave you guys alone.

709
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:08,381
Got that?

710
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:09,961
Okay?

711
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:13,401
Unni.

712
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,991
Unni!

713
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:17,471
Can I leave now?

714
00:44:20,971 --> 00:44:24,471
I can't believe I still get s*** even after doing a good deed.

715
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:27,051
Even if I help them out...

716
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:30,521
Don't they give out courageous citizens awards these days...

717
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:34,201
How could people help each other out at this rate...

718
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:36,201
Are you okay?

719
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:40,401
How is Dr. Woo Jin?

720
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:42,191
What?

721
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:44,981
We haven't caught that woman yet!

722
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:51,841
Da Young, please stop now.

723
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,681
I came here to end all this.

724
00:44:56,751 --> 00:45:00,671
You're the one who made me do all this, Doctor.

725
00:45:00,671 --> 00:45:03,231
Only you could understand me

726
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:05,911
and everything becomes fine as long as you're with me.

727
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,211
You made me this way, Doctor.

728
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,971
I'll dress, talk, and behave like Attorney Kim Yoo Ri.

729
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:12,961
That'll do it, right?

730
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:16,071
Look at me. I already look similar to her.

731
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:24,541
You must take responsibility for me to the end, Doctor.

732
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,661
I'm your patient.

733
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:31,501
If my patient did that,

734
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,911
I don't think I could have hated her for it.

735
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:39,921
Gosh, you're all angels.

736
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,651
But Doctor,

737
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:48,481
if that person reappeared, do not forgive her again this time.

738
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:49,861
As for me,

739
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:52,961
even if that person is sick, and if that person hurts me,

740
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:55,521
I would never forgive her.

741
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:57,151
When I get confused,

742
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,651
I think of my mom and dad,

743
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:03,311
and people who cherish me.

744
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:07,371
People who would hurt more if I got hurt.

745
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,631
When I do that, things become clearer.

746
00:46:13,431 --> 00:46:16,061
Why do I have to take responsibility for you, Da Young?

747
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:19,471
Everyone takes responsibility for themselves.

748
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:24,971
You've changed.

749
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:28,931
You look at me differently than before.

750
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:33,731
Before, you used to look at me with sadness and pity.

751
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:35,651
You used to see me like that, at least.

752
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:38,321
But there's nothing there now.

753
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,811
There's nothing there.

754
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,341
It's all because of that woman, isn't it?

755
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,391
No.

756
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:45,461
It's because of you, Da Young.

757
00:46:45,461 --> 00:46:48,271
You've made me this way, Da Young.

758
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,351
Please go home.

759
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:52,741
I really don't...

760
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:58,121
want to ever get mixed up with you again.

761
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:17,551
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

762
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:22,971
This world without you is meaningless to me.

763
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:26,391
Da Young!

764
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:53,131
Let's die together, Doctor!

765
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:56,411
That'd be better if I can't have you!

766
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:00,521
Right now we're not dying together...

767
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:03,931
You're killing me, Da Young!

768
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:08,831
Doctor! Doctor!

769
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,241
Hyung! Hyung!

770
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:23,181
Da Young, is this the love that you speak of?

771
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:29,031
The love that I know is liking something she likes alongside her

772
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,511
and watching her choices by her side.

773
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,161
And even if it's too tough for me to love her by myself,

774
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:39,391
it's not letting her know the pain I feel.

775
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:44,661
Because I don't want her to feel any amount of guilt or have her struggle.

776
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:47,971
But you make me ill, Da Young.

777
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:49,591
No. No, Doctor...

778
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:52,081
You cause me to struggle!

779
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:55,641
You make me sick! You drive me crazy!

780
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,521
So please...

781
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:04,651
Please don't ever appear in front of me or people I cherish.

782
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,571
No... No, Doctor!

783
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:10,231
It's not like that!

784
00:49:10,231 --> 00:49:12,141
You have the right to an attorney.

785
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:13,971
You have the right to remain silent.

786
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:15,371
- No. No!
- Take her outside.

787
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:16,981
No! Doctor!

788
00:49:16,981 --> 00:49:18,251
It's not like that!

789
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,011
It's not like that!

790
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:24,481
Doctor! No!

791
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:27,991
♫ Stop your footsteps in this dark road ♫

792
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:29,651
I'm sorry. I...

793
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:32,561
Today...

794
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:35,631
♫ Don't get hurt ♫

795
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:38,431
It's okay, Dr. Woo Jin.

796
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:41,221
Everything is okay now.

797
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:42,471
It's all over.

798
00:49:42,471 --> 00:49:46,271
♫ Like the warm sunlight ♫

799
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:50,401
♫ Embrace me once again ♫

800
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,781
What kind of situation is this now?

801
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:07,171
What else?

802
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,481
It's a hug showing humane love.

803
00:50:09,481 --> 00:50:11,471
You'd never get this type of emotion.

804
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:14,071
I don't think you quite get it, either.

805
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:16,341
Yeah, that's actually true.

806
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:18,251
They're hugging for way too long.

807
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:22,321
♫ We can dream together ♫

808
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,841
Is he asleep?

809
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:29,081
He must be exhausted.

810
00:50:29,081 --> 00:50:31,281
Are you all right?

811
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:33,741
Excuse me, you know...

812
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,111
don't you think it'd be tough for me to rest if you're here like this?

813
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:37,241
No.

814
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:38,661
We'll sit by your side.

815
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,491
Please rest assured and relax.

816
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:42,841
We'll be quiet. Just sleep.

817
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:44,931
Oh, okay.

818
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,291
Kim Jeong Ho...

819
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:32,571
Kim Jeong Ho.

820
00:51:53,171 --> 00:51:54,931
Jeong Ho.

821
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:57,901
Why did you wake up so soon?

822
00:51:57,901 --> 00:51:59,831
You should've slept more.

823
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:03,511
Were you very angry earlier because of me?

824
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:05,911
I'm sorry.

825
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:09,831
The thought that Da Young could be that woman never even crossed my mind.

826
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:13,021
I must be stupid.

827
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:23,071
What do I do?

828
00:52:24,011 --> 00:52:29,561
I don't want to obsess like that woman and give you a hard time.

829
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:35,841
But I'm too afraid.

830
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:37,721
Why?

831
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:42,710
Why are you afraid?

832
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:47,381
I'm afraid you'd fall walking down the street

833
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:51,841
and I wonder if you'd get into an accident while driving...

834
00:52:51,841 --> 00:52:54,341
What if the world...

835
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,981
suddenly takes you away from me?

836
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:00,381
Or...

837
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:03,291
what if you get sick of me

838
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:06,891
and leave me all of a sudden?

839
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:09,381
All of that.

840
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:10,931
Why do you say stuff like that?

841
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:16,331
♫ Like the rain that fell throughout the long night ♫

842
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:20,061
What should I do?

843
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:23,691
Do I make you that anxious?

844
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:27,541
♫ I wish I could look inside your heart ♫

845
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:32,541
I wish you'd trust me.

846
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:35,891
Even if I face an accident or a crisis,

847
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:39,321
that I'd overcome the crisis by myself,

848
00:53:39,321 --> 00:53:42,611
that I'd be able to handle it wisely.

849
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:45,221
So...

850
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,961
I'm scared, too.

851
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:48,411
But what can I do?

852
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:50,551
I just have to trust her.

853
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:53,451
We're talking about Kim Yoo Ri and Han Se Yeon.

854
00:53:53,451 --> 00:53:55,931
Will they let something happen to them and leave us behind?

855
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:59,071
They can never go wrong.

856
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:00,711
I live my life believing in that.

857
00:54:00,711 --> 00:54:05,981
♫ The short shower that didn't seem like that was coming ♫

858
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:09,001
I'll instill trust in you.

859
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:11,891
If you believe in me,

860
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:15,901
I think I can do anything.

861
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:19,651
♫ I fall into deep thoughts ♫

862
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:26,061
♫ Empty place, my heart disturbed ♫

863
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:33,080
♫ I don't think it's dry from the rain yet ♫

864
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:39,351
♫ Like the rain that fell throughout the long night ♫

865
00:54:39,351 --> 00:54:42,021
You could become more afraid because you have it

866
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:46,301
and you could also thirst for it because you don't have it.

867
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:48,561
That could be love.

868
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:49,661
Here.

869
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,491
You don't have to give me the cake.

870
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:53,581
It's okay. It's leftovers.

871
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,231
No, it's okay. Really.

872
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,051
It's really okay.

873
00:54:57,051 --> 00:55:01,281
Ahjussi, do you pity us?

874
00:55:02,051 --> 00:55:03,871
What are you saying, Yi Seul?

875
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:08,391
Other kids say that when someone is nice to you for no reason,

876
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:11,921
it means he pities us.

877
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:14,211
What in the world?

878
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:23,381
Let me pay for it.

879
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,521
Wait.

880
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:42,091
Just a moment.

881
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:53,041
Yi Seul,

882
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,881
the reason I'm nice to you is because you're so pretty.

883
00:55:57,881 --> 00:56:00,091
When adults see pretty little kids,

884
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:04,131
they just want to give them yummy food and be nice to them.

885
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:05,701
It's like that.

886
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:07,981
- Really?
- Yeah.

887
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:10,921
And I also have a very tough time

888
00:56:10,921 --> 00:56:15,331
so I don't have time to feel pity for someone else.

889
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:23,911
If you leave with a misunderstanding,

890
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:26,051
it wouldn't matter to me, but

891
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,361
you'd probably feel down for the rest of the day.

892
00:56:32,751 --> 00:56:34,491
That's why.

893
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,461
Whether it's feeling regretful or empathy,

894
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,981
there are many ways for one soul to recognize another.

895
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:46,351
But more difficult thing than starting to love someone

896
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:49,191
is sustaining that love. Don't you think so?

897
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:52,191
There is nothing worse than wrongly expressed love

898
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:55,541
that causes struggles for someone.

899
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:05,081
I'm here as a legal representative for Park Woo Jin and Kim Yoo Ri victims.

900
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:06,921
I'll make this short.

901
00:57:06,921 --> 00:57:09,791
"There will not be favorable arrangements or agreements like last time."

902
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:12,811
"Going forward until the day you die,"

903
00:57:12,811 --> 00:57:18,081
"in any way or form, please do not approach those two people."

904
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:23,481
Even if I said that courteously, I'm sure you won't understand.

905
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,921
Now, with the violation of enforcement of the stalking punishment act,

906
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:28,021
trespassing, kidnapping, and imprisonment,

907
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:31,761
and even attempted murder,

908
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:36,851
I'll make sure you never get to meet those two people this time around.

909
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,511
In life, you experience things you can't avoid, just like the pouring rain.

910
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,651
Hey, Honey!

911
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:09,291
Why did you leave the umbrella behind?

912
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:11,121
Hi, Mommy! Let's go.

913
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:16,501
- Let's go home.
- Come on. You missed mommy, huh?

914
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:19,261
How could the boss not have purchased an umbrella container?

915
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:21,831
How about you? How can you not even have an umbrella at home?

916
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,421
Oh, Doctor!

917
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,591
I knew we could count on you!

918
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:28,361
Wait, over there. Over there.

919
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:30,611
Please walk me to the bus stop.

920
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:31,481
Over there.

921
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,271
Wait, wait!

922
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:34,901
I'll ask your favor, too.

923
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:36,361
- I hate being cold.
- Wait for us!

924
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:38,381
Wait for us...

925
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,561
Me, too!

926
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:40,581
Me, too, Doctor!

927
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:41,971
Just to my car.

928
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:43,981
- Let's go.
- How can we walk like this?

929
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:46,031
Just keep our heads under and go. Let's go!

930
00:58:46,031 --> 00:58:47,901
Even if standing in the rain,

931
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:51,171
if there are people who'd become an umbrella for you,

932
00:58:51,171 --> 00:58:53,311
although you may get a little wet,

933
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:57,721
I think you may be able to shake it off and stand up again.

You still don't trust me?

937
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,331
I trust you wholeheartedly.

938
00:59:22,331 --> 00:59:26,321
Then do you want to watch a movie before you go?

939
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:28,241
You said let's do things in order.

940
00:59:28,241 --> 00:59:32,521
Since we held hands, we should watch a movie.

941
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:40,491
Then after we see a movie what are we going to do?

942
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:44,071
