00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,429
It's because you kept saying cheers to her, Hyung!

165
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,319
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! Come here and sit down for a sec.

Why, why?

167
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,479
So you two...

168
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,199
What... What happened between you two?

169
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,379
What do you mean, what happened?

170
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,609
I'm asking if you and Kim Jeong Ho reconciled or not.

171
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:34,599
For now, you can think of it as a temporary ally relationship.

172
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,829
Allies, my foot!

173

Yeah, don't make him wait too long if you have feelings for him.

175

He's waited a long time for this.

Where can you find someone like him? Liking you for more than 10 years—

Why?

178

For more than 10 years...

179
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,029
You've been friends for more than 10 years! What more time do you need?

180
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,699
- Yeah, right.
- You go for it if he's the one.

181

That's what I'm saying. Look at us.

While you guys were lost, we've created a tiny human being like this.

00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:03,329
Yeah, Yoo Na. Pretty, right?

184
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:04,619
We made her.

185
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,219
It was pretty simple, actually...

186
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,329
Yeah, don't make him wait too long if you have feelings for him.

He's waited a long time for this.

So... when did you start liking me?

00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:37,089
Wh-Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?

190
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,509
Answer me.

191
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,669
When was it for you?

192
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,539
Well, for me...

193
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,369
It was after you told me that you liked me.

194
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,129
Why?

195
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,279
No, I'm just asking.

196

Come in for a bit before you go.

197

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,359
Thank you for today.

199
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:27,349
I know it wouldn't have been easy to do that to your family.

200
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,229
It's just the first step now.

201
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,989
- Do you want some tea?
- Yeah.

202
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,409
Are you okay with warm tea?

203
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:01,639
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

204
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,289
Oh, sorry.

205
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:20,899
You surprised me...

206
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,869
It's okay.

207
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:27,199
- I wasn't trying to push you away...
- It's okay, Yoo Ri.

208
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:32,679
I'm... okay with continuing to be like this with you.

209
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,159
I just want you... not to be hurt...

or in torment when you come to me later.

211
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,969
I'll wait for you, whether it be for one or two years

212
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:55,089
so take your time in coming when you can come.

213

Here.

223
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,809
Hello, Sir!

224
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,399
Are you moving in?

225
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,529
The vacancy on the second floor.

226
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,899
I decided to use that space from today on.

227
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,839
If there was a vacant space like this,

228
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,999
he should have brought me in quickly.

229
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,839
Don't you think so, Attorney Kim?

230
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,339
It's because he keeps asking to lower the monthly rent!

231
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,769
Geez, I really don't click with that guy.

232
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,389
Are you really going to go with me?

233
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,899
How many times are you going to make me repeat myself?

I told you inheritance issues can lead to knife attacks!

Hey, you b****. Were you the only one to take care of Father?

Although it's bitter to swallow,

259

Isn't this a quote from a poem by Poet Jeong Ji Yong?

Oh, you're right. I remember, Jeong Ji Yong.

Why are you amazed by that?

00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,509
All these lines were in the school textbooks in the past.

Oh. I think you're right!

296
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,519
So I thought of his hometown as well and asked about it.

297
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,729
But they say there's no scenery like that.

298
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:04,859
It's abandoned land, so there's nothing.

What are you saying all of a sudden?

301
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,779
All of these are titles of poems. And every line is a line from a poem.

302
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,359

"I shall await you at the place where the sum of all the ends point."

305
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,709
When it says the sum of all the ends...

306
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:28,739
What about we try adding all the years that these poets died?

307
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:35,279
The year of death for Poet Yi Sang, who wrote "Flower," was... 1937.

308
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,099
The poet, Yi Yuk Sa who wrote "School Tree," died in 1944.

309
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,099
For Kim So Wol, it was 1934.

310
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:44,009
Poet Jeong Ji Yong's year of death was 1950.

311
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,999
And for Poet Baek Suk, it was 1996!

312
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,939
- If we add all of this...
- 8,641.

313
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:52,249
That's incorrect! It's 9,761!

314
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:54,319
I was so close!

315
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:04,209
In any case, if you add the year of death for all of the poets,

316
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:06,129
you end up with a 4-digit number.

317
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,979
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

318
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:11,569
Although I don't know if it's directly related to the safe.

319
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,129
I would have to try it on the safe.

320
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:16,869
But I don't know if my oppas would just let me.

321
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,439
All your oppas are...

322
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,599
They're all right here!

323
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,577
Are we breaking into someone's house?

324
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:39,027
Technically, this wouldn't be breaking in.

325
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:41,927
Since the inheritance is shared property of the heirs for the time being,

326
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,417
it's not illegal since we were invited by Kang Hui Yeon.

327
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:47,107
But I don't think Hui Yeon's oppas would just stand by idly if they find out.

328
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:48,547
Today happens to be the day of burial,

329
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:51,037
so they won't be able to come here today.

330
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,497
- Let's go.
- Okay!

331
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,897
Wait a minute.

332
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:56,537
The two of us will stand here and keep watch.

333
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:58,017
Sounds good.

334
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:10,867
What are you doing?

335
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,887
Don't they dispatch the police if you don't turn the alarm off within 5 minutes?

336
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:15,447
- That's true.
- Where is the safe, again?

337
00:23:15,447 --> 00:23:17,337
In the second-floor study.

338
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:19,837
Let's go!

339
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,577
- Doctor!
- Hurry, go!

340
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:29,847
I heard you need to open some wall?

341
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,227
Wall?

342
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,407
It opened.

343
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,847
9761, 9761!

344
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,967
Why is that wrong?

345
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,157
What the heck?

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,437
Yeah, it's better if we don't go in like you said, Hyungnim.

347
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:17,387
Yeah, we'd suffer like crazy if we went in.

348
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:19,737
Hyungnim.

349
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,307
It's my dream to live in a house like this later.

350
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:25,627
- I wanted to own a building like Hyungnim Jeong Ho, but–
- Hey.

351
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:29,167
- There's a yard–
- I think we're in trouble.

352
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,577
Oh! My phone...

353
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:33,737
Where's my phone?

354
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:34,637
Hyung, where's my phone?

355
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:36,317
How would I know that? Hurry up and find it!

356
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,437
- I think someone took it!
- S***!

357
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,847
Maybe you pressed the wrong numbers?

358
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,497
No, I didn't.

359
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,847
Doesn't a safe usually get hard-locked if you input the pass code wrong too many times?

360
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:55,457
Oh, sorry.

361
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,597
What did I miss...

362
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:02,107
- Yeah, Joon?
- B-B-Boss, why don't you pick up the phone?

363
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:04,927
- W-We're in big trouble!
- Wh-Why?

364
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:06,677
The security company car is coming this way.

365
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,907
- What should we do?
- Already?

366
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,747
Wait.

367
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,437
Is this a five-digit code?

368
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:19,707
What?

369
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,677
Have we missed something?

370
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,157
"Hui Yeon, everyone faces death."

371
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:42,027
"I shall await you at the place where the sum of all the ends point."

372
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:44,227
"Even if this turns out to be my last goodbye in this world..."

373
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:45,937
Isn't this also a line from a poem?

374
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,797
Look it up.

375
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:54,487
Yes, it is a line from a poem!

376
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,017
Poet Yu Chi Hwan's "Happiness."

377
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:59,227
Poet Yu Chi Hwan passed away in 1967, so...

378
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,777
11,728!

379
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:03,017
It's five digits!

380
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:04,637
I'm going to press it!

381
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:11,997
It opened!

382
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,817
What is this?

383
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,257
Look more carefully! Is there anything more?

384
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:42,897
Hey, Joon. We opened it.

385
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:45,017
B-Boss! You need to come out now! Hurry!

386
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,647
The security company employees went in!

387
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,917
We need to leave immediately!

388
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:52,327
I told you, we're fine!

389
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:02,397
Hyung, you don't need to do that!

390
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:03,667
Why is he doing that?

391
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,847
The retreating route is already blocked off.

392
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:09,967
That's the only way to escape.

393
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,477
- I told you we're not in here illegally.
- Be quiet!

394
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,237
Let's go.

395
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:15,847
Why are you guys doing this?

396
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:17,607
Come on.

397
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:21,997
Are you guys crazy?

398
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,267
This is the second floor!

399
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,937
Hyung, stop treating this like a film noir!

400
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,917
But she told us we shouldn't get caught!

401
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,597
Geez, this is nuts.

402
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:31,697
Okay, jump off onto this, Hyungnim!

403
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,357
You think this is going to work?

404
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,817
- Forget it. Whatever. Hurry up!
- It's okay.

405
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:36,897
Just trust me!

406
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:40,567
What are they doing there now? Geez!

407
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,107
Why do I have to do this?

408
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:44,867
We could just tell them and leave.

409
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,697
Geez, we could just tell them and leave.

410
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:51,907
Why are we going to such an extent?

411
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:53,717
D*** it.

412
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:06,807
You... Honeybee!

413
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,727
I-I guess my hands were a bit sweaty...

414
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:10,967
Hey, hurry up and get off.

415
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,367
- Geez, seriously...
- It slipped.

416
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,647
- I need to hold on more tightly!
- Nice.

417
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,447
Dear God, please protect me.

418
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,277
Doctor, why are you doing this?

419
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:31,747
I'm trying to slow down my fall by using air resistance.

420
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:33,417
I see...

421
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,347
Hurry and get up!

422
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:44,577
Yoo Ri! Jump slowly and carefully, okay?

423
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:47,197
You could get hurt! So be careful!

424
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,877
Let's go!

425
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,287
"There's a grass flower scent coming off you that only I can recognize."

426
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:28,037
"Even though I, once small like a dandelion, grow like a dahlia,"

427
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:31,917
"and the red sunset spreads across the evening sky,"

428
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:37,087
"please do not be heartbroken or be too sad."

429
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,607
Another poem...

430
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:44,757
I thought there would at least be 20 billion won in here, but a poem–

431
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:46,667
It's okay.

432
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,317
After sending off my father...

433
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:52,927
I wonder why I was being so spiteful.

434
00:29:52,927 --> 00:29:54,687
I guess...

435
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,807
I just wanted...

436
00:29:56,807 --> 00:30:00,677
confirmation that my father loved me

437
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:04,097
as much as he loved my brothers.

438
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:11,917
And that's why the fact that my father tried to leave me something

439
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,387
is enough for me.

440
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,897
Why?

441
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,477
- Geez.
- Why? What's up?

442
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:38,607
Just as you said, Prosecutor,

443
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:44,027
I called up every single junkyard company that handle and deliver unregistered vehicles.

444
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:47,577
By the time I arrived, it was already in this mess.

445
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:53,517
Right after the driver did that to the attorney, he crushed the car.

446
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,397
Where is this?

447
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:04,797
So as for that, I know it was a man.

448
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,737
But I don't remember much more than that.

449
00:31:06,737 --> 00:31:09,537
It was late at night, too.

450
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,767
Let's see the CCTV footage from that night.

451
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:15,147
Gosh, that's just an empty can.

452
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:18,927
I just picked up what I floated around here and they're just for looks.

453
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:23,897
You don't remember and CCTVs are empty, huh?

454
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:25,137
That's right.

455
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,157
But this man skips honorifics altogether, huh?

456
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,557
Yeah, isn't it quite charming?

457
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:32,047
He's American style.

458
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:33,227
Did you study overseas?

459
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,407
Then I'd understand.

460
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:39,457
I also was sleepless in Seattle, you know.

461
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:43,367
On my way, I noticed so many cars parked along the stream.

462
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,837
They all belong to the junkyard, right?

463
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,937
Right.

464
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:50,687
Right. With so many cars, it'd be tough to remember

465
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:54,517
what car came in last week or what the owner looked like.

466
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:56,377
Yeah, that's right.

467
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:58,787
How could I remember every single one of them?

468
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,587
But you know, there is no way that the

469
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:03,147
city has given permission for the stream area to be a junkyard.

470
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:05,017
- Have you ever heard of that?
- No, I haven't.

471
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:07,597
If I report this for violating Article 33

472
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:09,537
of the River Act, Collection of Permit Fees,

473
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,527
you'll have to pay a generous amount of penalties.

474
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:12,547
How much was it?

475
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,047
Was it 30 million won per vehicle?

476
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:14,997
Thirty million won per vehicle...

477
00:32:14,997 --> 00:32:18,267
Whoa, that's quite a lot of money to pay.

478
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,907
Is that CCTV still empty?

479
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:26,937
The CCTV. I think it recorded what happened that night.

480
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:28,297
I thought it might've.

481
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,167
Bring it.

00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:37,717
He came in in the middle of the night and demanded that I crush the car right away.

483
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:42,367
And then I guess he got hot and took off his jacket.

484
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:47,757
He had tattoos all over his arm...

485
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,637
Gosh!

486
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:56,137

Hey!

491
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:22,687
By chance, is it Jeong Ho who has caught onto us?

492
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:25,217
My apologies.

493
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,997
Hey, then... then what do we need to do?

494
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:32,057
We should hurry up and do something about that bastard...

495
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:35,627
If he spills, it'll get back to me.

496
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:40,407
Hey, if Jeong Ho finds him first...

497
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:45,327
we'd have to do something about Jeong Ho, too...

498

Why be all speechless over just this?

I mean, you've never done this before. That's why.

I said I'd wait for you.

I didn't say I wouldn't do anything.

I thought about it...

514

and realized I've never even bought you flowers that are so commonplace.

- Hello.
- Hi.

Yes, we have them.

00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:16,587
Yes.

555
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:17,947
How much is it?

556
00:37:17,947 --> 00:37:20,027
You don't have to pay.

557
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:21,567
I can't do that.

558
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,587
If you don't treat me as a customer,

559
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:26,507

Gosh, stop confessing your feelings so suddenly.

594
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:49,307

Who's there?

600
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:17,727
You have to pay 1,000 won if you want to take pictures.

601

Ahjumma!

602
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,367
Where did I put this...

603
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,407
I tried to keep it safe...

604
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,677
Here it is. Aigoo...

605
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,707
Oh, Ahjumma used to...

606
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:41,667
live at our house and helped us out with our housework.

607

610
00:41:55,877 --> 00:42:00,697
I should give it to you when you come or else he told me I could have it.

611
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:02,437
But you came just in time.

612
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,237
What is this?

613
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:05,617
I wouldn't know.

614
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:07,827
I don't even know the lock combo.

615
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:11,007
Here. Do what you need to do with it.

616
00:42:16,277 --> 00:42:19,817
Do you think 20 billion won is sitting in here for real?

617
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,807
Why is my heart racing, Hyung?

618
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:24,407
Hey! Who'd put 20 billion won in here?

619
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:26,627
You never know, though.

620
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:30,327
There's a secret combo here, too.

621
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:32,877
Then, could it be that same number?

622
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,057
Daebak!

623
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:36,147
Your father's real gift. Let's open—

624
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:37,527
Hey, hey.

625
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,377
We'll wait for you outside.

626
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:40,757
No.

627
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:43,377
You came all the way here with me.

628
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:45,707
- Let's look at it together.
- 9761!

629
00:42:45,707 --> 00:42:47,947
N-No... 11728.

630
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:49,897
011, 728.

631
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:53,267
011...

632
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,037
- 7...
- 728...

633
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,099
Oh, my God!

634
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:32,442
Look, Hyung!

635
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,802
There is someone who puts 20 billion won in a briefcase!

636
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,899
That briefcase earlier...

637
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:57,499
Suppose it's 35cm horizontal, 20cm vertical, and 10cm height in dimension.

638
00:43:57,499 --> 00:43:59,199
The volume it holds is 7 liters.

639
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,159
The volume of one kilogram of the gold bar is 0.05 liter.

640
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:06,289
Then the current value is 75 million won per kilogram.

641
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:10,499
It's approximately... 10.5 billion won.

642
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:15,609
So when you consider the inheritance tax, even if you deduct this and that,

643
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:19,069
you have to pay approximately 4.4 billion won in taxes.

644
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:24,289
But that kind of money is usually...

645
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:27,409
likely to be an unreported asset.

646
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:31,869
If so, you'll owe money for delinquent tax or unreported profit.

647
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,369
So usually, people don't report it.

648
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:42,939
So we might be at a crime scene right now, not a heartwarming scene!

649
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:45,279
We should decide what to do now then.

650
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:46,909
We should either take a gold bar and keep quiet,

651
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:51,579
or maintain our status as model citizens.

652
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:54,089
If so, I'll definitely—

653
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,679
It'd be a shame to give up my conscience for 70 million won, right?

654
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,879
Should we settle for two gold bars, then...

655
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:04,659
No, that's not it, either.

656
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:07,179
I didn't expect to have this kind of talk in the flower field.

657
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:09,249
Sorry for being so secular in a flower field.

Why are you getting upset?

659

Born in 1949, on November 9th in the lunar year.

00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:39,619
I, Kang Gye Young, am recording my will.

665
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:45,829
First of all, the will I wrote with my sons earlier was coerced.

666
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:51,409
I'd like to express that this recording reflects how I really feel.

Hui Yeon.

668
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:59,799
As my death approaches, there's only one thing I regret.

669
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:04,479
I've always thought you were as delicate as a flower.

670
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:09,759
So rather than encouraging you, I've always told you not to do anything.

671
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:13,829
But seeing you staying by my side until the end

672
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,089
makes me realize you're stronger and more courageous than anyone.

673
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:19,099
My daughter, Hui Yeon.

674
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:24,499
I realize that you're not a flower but fertile and solid soil.

675
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:29,439
If you let the roots grow slowly, you can grow any flowers.

676
00:46:29,439 --> 00:46:32,699
So don't ever be hasty.

I'd like to express that this recording reflects how I really feel...

679
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:06,509
The ones who forced a will out of a testator like this are ineligible for an inheritance.

680
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:08,749
Therefore they don't get a single penny.

681
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:12,289
But since your sister is such a nice person,

682
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:15,549
she suggested splitting the inheritance equally.

683
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:18,339
H-How is this equal?

684
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:19,779
She doesn't even have kids!

685
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:21,369
That's my point!

686
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:24,989
You have children. Do you have to behave this way?

687
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:30,529
What if they learn from you and fight each other to death after you pass away?

688
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:37,039
Debts and assets aren't the only things that are left when you die.

- Not at all.

Well, what will you do with the gold...

694
00:48:03,669 --> 00:48:08,499
I'll report it according to the law and pay tax for it.

I can't burden you all for helping me.

696
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:18,909
It'd be 4.4 billion won.

00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,589
I'm near your parents' house.

807
00:57:17,009 --> 00:57:18,529
What are you doing here?

808
00:57:18,529 --> 00:57:19,959
I was looking for you.

809
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:23,099
I told you not to be alone for a while!

810
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:29,009
I'm sorry.

811
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:31,409
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell—

812
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:34,679
It's not true, is it?

813
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:38,069
You said you came to like me since I liked you.

814
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:40,339
It was a lie, wasn't it?

815
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:45,659
- Why are you suddenly—
- It's like you're a fool.

816
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:49,059
How could you like someone for so long?

817
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:57,523
I don't know who told you what,

818
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:02,942
but don't feel pressured.

819
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:06,592
It's just like a crush that everyone has at that age—

820
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:08,192
You're lying again!

821
00:58:08,192 --> 00:58:11,312
Stop lying to me, Kim Jeong Ho.

822
00:58:18,732 --> 00:58:21,032
What should I do then?

823
00:58:21,652 --> 00:58:24,982
Should I burden you by saying I'm dying to hold you right now?

824
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:27,622
Should I say that I can't wait for the Lee Pyeon Woong issue or whatever,

825
00:58:27,622 --> 00:58:30,902
so we should kiss and spend the night?

826
00:58:30,902 --> 00:58:35,302
If that's how you feel, you should say that.

827
00:58:43,842 --> 00:58:45,702
I like you.

828
00:58:47,772 --> 00:58:54,372
It's always been you and you were the only one.

Will you really be okay?

01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,452
Yeah.

843
01:00:11,452 --> 01:00:13,772
Everything is settled now.

844
01:00:13,772 --> 01:00:14,662
I'll stay the night here.

856
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:52,472
Let's keep our relationship a secret for a while.

857
01:01:52,472 --> 01:01:55,882
I've never seen anyone who's so obviously in a secret relationship.

858
01:01:55,882 --> 01:01:57,552
- I'll—
- No! You can't, you can't!

859
01:01:57,552 --> 01:01:59,792
You think someone broke in?

860
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:02,222
Because I did something wrong, because of me...

861
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:06,662
If I had the power, I won't let you go anywhere or do anything.

862
01:02:06,662 --> 01:02:09,422
I want to be your girlfriend.

863
01:02:09,422 --> 01:02:11,482
I don't want you to be my guardian.

864
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:13,432
Who's meeting with who?

865
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:17,372
If you leave me alone, I'll leave you guys alone too.

866
01:02:17,372 --> 01:02:20,150
