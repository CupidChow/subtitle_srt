1
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:33,978
   

2
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:35,478
Your Honor,

3
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:39,068
the relevant mechanism is a safety plug installed at the entrance

4
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:44,038
so if he entered properly, the machine was supposed to halt.

5
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:49,498
Thus, the accident occurred because the late Kim In Soo violated the guideline

6
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:51,768
and entered through a door other than the proper entrance

7
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:54,998
and while inspecting the machine which was  operating...

8
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,678
Sniff?

9
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,648
A runny nose.

10
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,318
Attorney,

11
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:11,838
do you even know what the baler machine the deceased was cleaning looks like?

12
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,488
Ah-ah...

13
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:18,348
After building cars, they gather metal scraps

14
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:21,608
and compress them into a rectangular-shaped bale.

15
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:23,518
Logically speaking, if one were to clean that machine,

16
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:26,588
don't you think he'd want to stop the machine to clean it?

17
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:28,438
Plaintiff!

18
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:30,608
Please speak when it's your turn to speak.

19
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:33,448
And what is wrong with your attire?

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:43,300


21
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,468
As the plaintiff pointed out so thoughtfully,

22
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:56,148
this accident was caused due to the worker's violation of a very commonsense related guideline...

23
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:57,838
- Your Honor, 
 - S***...

24
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:02,598
the subcontractor workers do not have any authority to stop the production line.

25
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:06,868
That authority lies with the main contractor Kangho Motors.

26
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,498
- Plaint— 
 - On the day of the incident,

27
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:10,978
because VIPs from the main contractor were visiting the factory,

28
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:13,108
an unscheduled cleaning operation for the machine was ordered

29
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:16,938
and despite knowing the danger, the victim was killed while cleaning the machinery.

30
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,758
This case is strictly a deep-rooted systematic problem within the Uljin factory.

31
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:24,948
- The fact that you're turning it into a worker's fault— 
 - Plaintiff!

32
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:26,628
Yes?

33
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:33,118
Did you submit the evidence relevant to the authority of operating that machinery?

34
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,948
Of course.

35
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,118
A's evidence number 35,

36
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:44,548
please review the business agreement between Kangho Motors and NE Systems.

37
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:57,768
   

38
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:59,308
   

39
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:02,268
   
 (Means upright in Korean) 

40
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,438
I'm attorney Kim Yoo Ri.

41
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,068
I work for a Public Service Foundation within a law firm.

42
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:14,288
I offer pro-bono legal services for the underserved in our society or offer legal consultations.

43
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:16,908
I'm in charge of public service lawsuits.

44
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,108
   

45
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:27,538
Attorney, please... Please don't interrupt when the judge is speaking.

46
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:29,768
And when you sit down, it's not like you're a rebellious troublemaker in school.

47
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,168
- Why must you sit so crooked— 
 - Paralegal!

48
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,788
That's because of my scoliosis.

49
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:36,368
And your outfit...

50
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:39,561
- Please, dress in something meek and modest... 
 - Seriously...

51
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:42,996
I only have to look formal. Do I have to look meek and modest too?

52
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:47,066
   

53
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:54,168
   

54
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:03,788
   

55
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,068
CEO...

56
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,438
A bullying case at the workplace, an industrial accident lawsuit,

57
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:22,468
firemen's dangerous job conditions, dying in the line of duty! I acknowledge it!

58
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:23,888
What else is there?

59
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,708
She also recently won a case about Jirisan's toll.

60
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,668
Right! That one!

61
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:34,258
She put aside all other tasks and focused on that case for three months!

62
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:35,998
Thanks to that,

63
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:39,378
although we have lost money,

64
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:42,288
the hikers...

65
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:45,838
each got to save 1,200 won.

66
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:48,768
Because it was an unfair toll charge.

67
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,038
Attorney Kim Yoo Ri, who worked so hard

68
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,518
for the public good and for those who are underserved!

69
00:04:55,518 --> 00:05:00,248
Finally, with this last case,

70
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:04,068
she will...

71
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:06,648
leave our law firm, everyone!

72
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:08,648
Applause!

73
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:10,778
Applause!

74
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,038
   

75
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:18,438
Where? Where are we going?

76
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:20,398
What? This place looks expensive! I'm leaving.

77
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:21,698
You're going to make me pay, right?

78
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:24,408
As expected of you, you can eat the cheapest dish.

79
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,778
- No... 
 - Let's go, let's go.

80
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:27,298
This is your revenge, right?

81
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:29,518
Because of the money I lost?

82
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:30,918
Yes.

83
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:33,518
Aigoo, Assemblyman, we're late.

84
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,918
Say hello.

85
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,498
He invited us to a very expensive lunch today. Party Min's Assemblyman Yoon Joo Han.

86
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:40,128
Aigoo, Attorney Kim.

87
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:43,688
You're much prettier in person than in the news articles.

88
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,588
Oh, yes...

89
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:49,568
I'm not sure why this rare beauty is here.

90
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,868
Well, as for public service lawsuits...

91
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:04,888
Well, it's all good.

92
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:07,838
Changing policies and transforming our society...

93
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,838
We've all been there when we were young.

94
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:13,058
It's all good in words,

95
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:15,968
but it's tough to win those cases after putting in all the work.

96
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,208
And also the preparations are so...

97
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,918
It's such a headache!

98
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:23,738
In any case, the next presidential election is coming up.

99
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:29,498
Our party is also seeking a new face to be our spokesperson.

100
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:32,478
So Attorney Kim, once you leave the law firm,

101
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:34,678
what are you planning on doing?

102
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:37,968
 What is your plan exactly? 

103
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:51,428
I—

104
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,218
I am going to set up a cafe.

105
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:26,098
♫  Unconsciously it seeped in  ♫

106
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:27,788
The backside of the building is better.

107
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:30,578
They built a multiplex in front of the building,

108
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:34,258
so the price of the rent rose exponentially.

109
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,108
Miss, are you an alumnus of Hankuk University?

110
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:40,998
Yes, it's my alma mater.

111
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:44,328
Nothing has changed here.

112
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,008
Here. Here it is.

113
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,638
♫  it won't become dark  ♫

114
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:52,858
It's nice here. Quiet and p-peaceful.

115
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:53,898
And it is maintained well too!

116
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:56,908
The landlord lives on the top floor.

117
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:59,848
I see...

118
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:02,278
♫   They are going to become a radiant memory  ♫

119
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,608
- Shall we go in? 
 - Yes!

120
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:09,588
♫  At this moment now everything about you  ♫

121
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:13,568
♫  Every detail  ♫

122
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,418
   

123
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,898
Oh, my... Miss!

124
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:13,458
My footsteps are rather loud.

125
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,248
You see.

126
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:18,358
You only have to move in.

127
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,368
The interior has been remodeled recently.

128
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:26,518
The man who was running a tarot cafe here had to go overseas suddenly.

129
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:30,298
I will take this place.

130
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:33,848
Do you really not need more time to think about it?

131
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:35,428
No.

132
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,208
   

133
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:44,938
 Cafe? 

134
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:47,688
Yes, Law Cafe.

135
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,318
Wh-What cafe?

136
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:52,128
Law Cafe.

137
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,118
A law coffee house.

138
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:56,088
I'll do legal consultations and also sell coffee.

139
00:09:56,978 --> 00:10:00,698
They say that a lawsuit lasting three years destroys a family.

140
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:03,738
Having spent time in the world of law,

141
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:09,278
I realized that a good attorney resolves your problems before going to court.

142
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:17,478
Resolving your legal problems for the price of a cup of coffee as an out-of-court attorney.

143
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:20,678
What do you think? Do you think it will do well?

144
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:29,278
   

145
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,268
   

146
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:36,658
 And now, the star of today's ceremony. 

147
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,248
 The bride will enter! 

148
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,288
So pretty!

149
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:12,918
Stop crying, my gosh...

150
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:23,308
You're so pretty.

151
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,068
Don't cry. Stop crying.

152
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,108
Se Yeon and Jin Ki

153
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:31,608
were my childhood friends, growing up in the same neighborhood.

154
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,578
Do Jin Ki. He's such an emotional guy.

155
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,588
Who would have thought that the groom would break down in tears like that?

156
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:45,008
I was so embarrassed.

157
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,458
My friends, whom I love dearly...

158
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,768
To Se Yeon and Jin Ki.

159
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:53,298
Se Yeon and Jin Ki!

160
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:55,838
Since the time we met in kindergarten, which I can barely remember,

161
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:58,568
we've been together for thirty years.

162
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:02,308
And to think, you guys are now getting married and leaving me by myself...

163
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,918
Well, on a happy day like this,

164
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:16,398
I am thrilled to be able to be here and congratulate you.

165
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:18,068
You guys...

166
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:22,188
you're still going to hang out with me even though you guys are married, right?

167
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:28,358
Your friend forever, Kim Yoo Ri.

168
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,608
Come on, try to smile a little and face forward.

169
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,308
Thank you.

170
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,208
Kim Jeong Ho!

171
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,648
Kim Jeong Ho!

172
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:59,468
Kim Jeong Ho!

173
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:08,428
Se Yeon, Jin Ki, and this guy.

174
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:09,828
He's Kim Jeong Ho.

175
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:13,998
After he transferred to our high school, the four of us were always together.

176
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,528
But then Kim Jeong Ho, this bast—

177
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,178
He stopped showing up a few years ago.

178
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:23,318
I especially think he's avoiding me.

179
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,878
Why is he like this?

180
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,618
Wow, what a glorious mess.

181
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:08,288
Oh, you came.

182
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:12,128
Come down, you SOB*. Aren't you going to eat? 
  (Literally says "bastard dog") 

183
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:15,328
The landlord should come down, too.

184
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:16,788
Okay.

185
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:21,258
I told that SOB to come down during meal time, but he just doesn't listen.

186
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:22,478
Oh, so cold!

187
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,848
Man, it's already time to eat.

188
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:43,458
My name is Kim Jeong Ho.

189
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,408
I am currently writing novels.

190
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:48,308
On Readipidia, I get about 817 views on average daily,

191
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:52,208
and my novels have been on the Top 50 of the Week list for six weeks straight now.

192
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,198
My income is somewhat of an insignificant amount.

193
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,888
However, I have high hopes for my current project.

194
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:07,238
People in my neighborhood keep referring to me as a jobless, unemployed bum.

195
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:10,468
But technically, a bum means empty-handed.

196
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:14,018
That is, the person has no possessions.

197
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:16,850
All right, eat up.

198
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:20,508
I should go eat now, too.

199
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:23,498
Writing novels won't make you much money.

200
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:27,928
A young man should learn a useful trade and work hard to earn a living.

201
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,548
My goodness, Hyungnim*, you're worrying about the wrong person. 
  (Korean women also call sister-in-laws "hyungnim") 

202
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:36,908
We're the ones giving our money to this young man for our monthly rent.

203
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:38,938
He owns two buildings.

204
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,628
Who's worrying about whom?

205
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,688
Why?

206
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:52,988
I didn't make it salty this time!

207
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:57,448
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily intake of sodium of 2,000 milligrams.

208
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,608
If we calculate this using table salt, that is 5 grams.

209
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:03,108
This would mean about a flat teaspoon's worth of salt.

210
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:06,358
But because we also consume other foods preserved with salts, such as kimchi or salted seafood,

211
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:11,958
we are consuming twice the daily recommended amount, technically speaking.

212
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,808
Your "technically speaking"...

213
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:15,118
There you go again with your nonsense.

214
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:17,898
Don't eat it then. I'm tired of this.

215
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:20,188
I'm only saying these things because they're useful.

216
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,518
For those who consume too much sodium,

217
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:25,208
middle-aged to elderly people over the age of 50

218
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,708
often experience high blood pressure and are at higher risk of getting a stroke or a heart attack...

219
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,508
and can potentially even lead to dementia.

220
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:31,078
Dementia too?

221
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,228
- Really? 
 - Of course!

222
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:33,678
Why are you listening to that?

223
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:34,728
Why not?

224
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:39,948
I think our landlord looks most attractive when he says smart things like this.

225
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:43,928
He's just wasting his smart brains, memorizing useless things like this.

226
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,628
If I had brains like his,

227
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:48,468
I would have already become a judge or a prosecutor.

228
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:51,518
A judge or a prosecutor. It doesn't mean anything.

229
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:54,718
The doctor is here!

230
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:06,328
So did you have many patients today at the hospital?

231
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,118
Yes, we are slowly getting more people.

232
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,608
Oh, okay.

233
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,888
I prepared this.

234
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,608
- Oh, my goodness! 
 - Aigoo!

235
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:14,878
Look. Look at this.

236
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:16,808
If we all agreed to bring at least one dish each,

237
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,448
you could at least make an effort, like the doctor.

238
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:21,638
Instead, you always come empty-handed and just talk smack.

239
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,188
- Looks delicious. 
 - Hey!

240
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:25,208
How dare you take a piece before the elders take one!

241
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,678
Where are elders here? We're all friends.

242
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:29,858
Then I'm your friend...

243
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:30,718
Just eat.

244
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,648
Hey, Friend! Try the stew.

245
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:34,888
- Thank you. 
 - The stew...

246
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,448
It's an informal savings club.

247
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,728
I'm the president of the club,

248
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:40,668
and the club is named after the name of the building, Eun Ha Gye.

249
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:45,608
You can think of the club as a social service for the tenants.

250
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,628
- Oh, well. 
 - Put it down.

251
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,838
By the way, did you see the young lady who came to set up a cafe on the first floor?

252
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,678
She is really pretty.

253
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:07,048
It's where anyone who rents it leaves within a year because something happens to them.

254
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:10,108
I feel so bad for her.

255
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:15,738
Geez, please stop spreading baseless negative rumors like that!

256
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,978
If the space stays unoccupied, the monthly interest on the loans

257
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:21,658
is going to put me on the streets. Oh wait, I won't have to be on the streets.

258
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:22,978
- Give me a point card. 
 - So annoying!

259
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,858
- A point card! 
 - I'm not playing anymore!

260
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,928
Such a sore loser!

261
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:40,708
 But I found that space a bit creepy, too. 

262
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,918
 Like there are weird noises coming from the ceiling. 

263
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:00,998
   

264
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,888
Yes, Ma'am.

265
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:08,378
Yes, I am at the cafe right now.

266
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:10,858
Yes, I will see you in a bit.

267
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,378
Okay.

268
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,850
   

269
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:42,698
I had fun today.

270
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,693
Yes, today went as expected as well.

271
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,443
Hyung, this is a gift for you.

272
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,638
Kim Jeong Ho?

273
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,120
   

274
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:26,932
And what's wrong with your hair?

275
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:29,101
Hey, let go of my hair.

276
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,682
What the... Why does it smell like sesame oil?

277
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:34,492
What did you do to your hair?

278
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,382
Hey, when was the last time you washed your hair?

279
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:39,332
And what's up with the tracksuit? What are you, red pepper paste?

280
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:42,042
Look who's talking! You look like you threw on some straw mat from the Joseon era.

281
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:46,502
Who do you think you are to criticize my vintage, casual, ethnic, high-fashion?

282
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:49,582
Vintage wh-what?

283
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,932
What a coincidence that you already know the landlord.

284
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,272
 I know, right? 

285
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:58,072
Ever since high school and college, so we've known each other for about twenty years,

286
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:02,032
and yet I wonder why I had no idea that my friend of twenty years would become my landlord.

287
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:03,932
- To be exact, it's seventeen years. 
 - You.

288
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:07,802
At Se Yeon and Jin Ki's wedding, why did you leave without even saying hi to me?

289
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:12,362
I was a bit busy that day.

290
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:15,642
My goodness. Busy? What do you mean you were busy?

291
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,052
You're always just sitting around, saying you're writing novels–

292
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,332
Novels?

293
00:21:19,332 --> 00:21:21,822
You? Writing novels?

294
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,892
And you? Running a cafe?

295
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,582
Are you really going to run a cafe here?

296
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:26,657
- Yes. 
 - What about your company?

297
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,102
I quit.

298
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:30,072
Are you crazy?

299
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:34,182
You're the one who quit your perfectly fine job first and are living like a jobless bum.

300
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:36,522
I don't think you're one to talk.

301
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:45,412
Ma'am, let's forget this agreement.

302
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,222
Hey!

303
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,862
Hey, what do you mean?

304
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:51,322
The building in front raised their rent,

305
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:53,572
and the overall rates around this area have increased!

306
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:56,002
From the start, this rent makes no sense.

307
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:58,192
But the last time we talked, you said it was okay like this!

308
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,162
You can't say that after accepting the down payment already.

309
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,392
A provisional contract is still a contract.

310
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:04,642
She's right. Even though you may not have stamped your seal on the contract,

311
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:06,072
if you accepted the down payment for the provisional contract,

312
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:09,192
you can't just cancel the contract on a whim like this.

313
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:10,982
Once the target and sale price are confirmed, and

314
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:12,852
there was an agreement on how to pay the intermediate payment,

315
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,282
even if the formal contract was not written,

316
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:16,832
the sale contract is considered to be fully in place.

317
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,412
According to Article 565, Clause 1 of the Civil Code,

318
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,582
one can cancel a contract by reimbursing double the down payment.

319
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,512
You understand that the double reimbursement of the down payment

320
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,742
is not referring to twice the three million won that I paid

321
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:29,482
but double the down payment written in the actual contract?

322
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,452
If you want, I'll give you that amount.

323
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:32,672
So cancel this contract.

324
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:35,022
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

325
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,252
Kim Jeong Ho!

326
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:39,172
Hey, Landlord! Landlord!

327
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:46,102
Young people nowadays...

328
00:22:46,102 --> 00:22:48,112
They know everything.

329
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:49,592
Hey, Kim Jeong Ho!

330
00:22:49,592 --> 00:22:51,542
Where are you going? I am not done talking to you.

331
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,972
Why are you following me?

332
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,512
Listen to what I have to say!

333
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:56,462
I don't have anything to say to you!

334
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,802
Just leave.

335
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:00,612
I have something to say. Just listen to me!

336
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,452
Don't come.

337
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:03,432
What do you mean, don't come?

338
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,252
I told you not to come.

339
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:07,062
I made myself clear!

340
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:08,772
Why are you coming up?

341
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,312
Just stop for a moment!

342
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,832
What a sight.

343
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:19,742
Hey. Why did you quit your job?

344
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:20,822
Then what about you?

345
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:23,412
Why did you quit the law firm that other people are dying to get into?

346
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:24,582
Didn't you hear what I said before?

347
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:26,322
I quit so I could run a cafe.

348
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,922
That's what I mean! You? Run a cafe?

349
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:31,292
You don't even know the difference between a latte and a cappuccino!

350
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:32,512
Do you know Arabica?

351
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,542
What about Robusta?

352
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,342
I can learn those things over time...

353
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:38,172
Do you think that running your own business is a piece of cake?

354
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:40,842
Take a look here.

355
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:43,812
How many people would come to this corner of the neighborhood to drink coffee?

356
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:47,082
Even if there were, there is a cafe every 100 meters around here.

357
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,522
How would your cafe rise above the competition

358
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:52,592
if you don't even know the different types of coffee beans?

359
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:54,172
I'm also going to provide legal consultations.

360
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:56,142
It's not just any cafe. It's a legal consultation cafe.

361
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:57,632
A legal consultation cafe?

362
00:23:57,632 --> 00:23:59,562
Are you going to provide legal consultations and sell coffee?

363
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,212
Yes!

364
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,212
The fact that there hasn't been a business model like that

365
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:08,372
is because there is a reason for that. Don't you think?

366
00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:10,662
If you really want to be accommodating while providing legal consultations,

367
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:14,752
set up a really nice law firm office with a very high-quality coffee machine.

368
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:23,472
You still have the same bad habit of putting what comes to your mind into action too quickly.

369
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:25,162
Rumination.

370
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:28,182
A person should know how to percolate an idea before bringing it back to the surface.

371
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:31,512
You're not mistaking being rash with being enterprising, are you?

372
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,372
- Are you done? 
 - Even if you go through with this,

373
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,112
this scenario is a perfect recipe for failure.

374
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:37,962
So what? What does that have to do with you anyway?

375
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:40,052
How does that have nothing to do with me? You'll go through a hard time again.

376
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,742
I'll be the one going through a hard time. Why are you getting angry about it?

377
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,102
So to be clear,

378
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:54,572
you're saying you can't go on with this contract because you're worried about me?

379
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:55,612
How did you come to that conclusion?

380
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:57,382
But you don't have to worry about me.

381
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:59,532
I know this neighborhood as well as you do,

382
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,642
and I've been planning this for a very long time.

383
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:03,712
Just because you thought about it for a long time doesn't make it a good plan.

384
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,002
You should reconsider.

385
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,472
You know,

386
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:09,822
I really didn't want to ask you this because it might make me look shallow,

387
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:12,592
but you're not being tacky and acting like this

388
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:16,022
because of our previous relationship, right?

389
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,492
M-Me? Really?

390
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:26,672
That was such a long time ago!

391
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:28,982
Yes, that was such a long time ago.

392
00:25:28,982 --> 00:25:32,512
Why would we be awkward with each other because of it?

393
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:33,782
In any case!

394
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,912
No matter what you say, our contract is considered to be in effect.

395
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:39,952
I really like this space and have no desire to cancel our contract,

396
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,382
so if you must kick me out, do it by the law.

397
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:44,102
I'm leaving.

398
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:45,672
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri.

399
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:47,092
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! Stop right there.

400
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:48,962
Stop right there!

401
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,952
Stress!

402
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,922
Did I like him?

403
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:01,852
No way. We happened to end up going to the same college,

404
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,282
so we were pretty much always together for a while.

405
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:08,222
But then he suddenly filed a leave of absence and passed his bar exam.

406
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:11,302
I thought we naturally grew apart,

407
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:13,912
but when I looked more closely later on,

408
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:18,382
it's not that we drifted apart but rather, he was avoiding me.

409
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:25,902
 "Even in the darkness, So Dan could sense the presence of 50 men surrounding him." 

410
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:29,472
 "It was clear that it was the Great Sky's Black Division." 

411
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:32,622
 "As soon as So Dan unsheathed his sword," 

412
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:36,502
 "they began to come out of hiding, one by one." 

413
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:45,282
 "With a shrill noise, five metal darts flew toward So Dan." 

414
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:47,522
 Clang! Clang, clang! Clang! Clang! 

415
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,272
 How long am I supposed to do this? 

416
00:26:50,272 --> 00:26:52,552
 You said you memorized everything because you read it twice. 

417
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:55,902
 So are you telling me to recite the entire thing? 

418
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:58,782
 You do know that Cheon Re Do is a 29-book series, right? 

419
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:06,742
 But even though I see this every day, it still amazes me every time. 

420
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:11,942
 This brain can memorize an entire 29-martial-arts book series after just one read-through. 

421
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,102
 Let go. 

422
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:15,372
 Hey, let go! 

423
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:18,612
 - I don't want to. 
 - Hey, let go! 

424
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:23,502
 What are you going to do with that brilliant brain of yours? 

425
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:26,602
 You could become a novelist or a medical doctor... 

426
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,442
 A prosecutor or an attorney. 

427
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:30,612
 You can do anything you want. 

428
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:47,352
 Then what are you going to do? 

429
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:00,472
 I told you not to do that! 

430
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,582
 - Sorry... 
 - You're dead! 

431
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:05,352
 - Oh, my God! 
 - Come over here! 

432
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,832
 Don't do it! 

433
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:11,502
♫  Unconsciously it seeped in  ♫

434
00:28:11,502 --> 00:28:21,032
♫  Every little and small moment was collected here and became an ocean  ♫

435
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:25,932
♫  Sometimes it's even turbulent  ♫

436
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:29,682
♫  Even if the darkness falls on us  ♫

437
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:30,972
 Hey, Kim Jeong Ho! 

438
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:32,972
♫  It won't become dark  ♫

439
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:35,602
 - Come on! 
 - What? 

440
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:39,672
 I mean, everybody in our major thinks we're dating. 

441
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:41,622
 I don't have an interest in dating others. 

442
00:28:41,622 --> 00:28:43,942
 And you said that others talking like that is annoying. 

443
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:46,672
 A girl like me isn't too shabby, either. 

444
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:49,532
 You've been beating around the bush for a while. 

445
00:28:49,532 --> 00:28:52,642
 What are you really trying to say? 

446
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:55,062
 You're not by any chance– 

447
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:59,592
 - saying that we should date? 
 - We should date. 

448
00:28:59,592 --> 00:29:03,202
♫  Every detail  ♫

449
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,222
 To be more exact, let's say that we're dating. 

450
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:07,102
 - If you don't want to, forget it then. 
 - Who said I didn't want to? 

451
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:14,232
♫  Because I like you so much my inside is filled by you  ♫

452
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:21,622
♫  Nothing in this world excites me more  ♫

453
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:23,662
 - What are you doing? 
 - People sitting here 

454
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,842
 should sit together and eat together. 

455
00:29:25,842 --> 00:29:26,602
 Say "ah." 

456
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:29,422
 Kim Jeong Ho! 

457
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:31,042
 Are you going by yourself? 

458
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,462
♫  Promise  ♫

459
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:37,022
♫  As much as transcending all boundaries  ♫

460
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:40,522
♫  I love you  ♫

461
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:42,902
♫  I mean it  ♫

462
00:29:42,902 --> 00:29:49,902
♫  I'm happy because I have you  ♫

463
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:01,822
♫  I'm standing next to you I'm humming  ♫

464
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:06,782
♫  I like that you're taking care of me  ♫

465
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:12,002
♫  It feels like I'm flying in the sky  ♫

466
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:21,382
♫  Because I like you so much my inside is filled by you  ♫

467
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:31,962
♫  Nothing in this world excites me more than this feeling  ♫

468
00:30:35,812 --> 00:30:39,002
 Give me a moment. Let me finish this. 

469
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:45,812
 For you, I'm sure you could memorize this one at one glance. 

470
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:48,062
 This is the grief that ordinary people face. 

471
00:30:48,062 --> 00:30:52,922
 No matter how much I look at it, it doesn't register in my brain. 

472
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,032
 Why? 

473
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:06,862
 What? 

474
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:10,042
 Is something wrong? 

475
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,842
 Let's quit this. 

476
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:17,932
 - Quit what? 
 - What we're doing. 

477
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:19,932
 Whatever it may be. 

478
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,162
 But why? 

479
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:29,902
 Just because. 

480
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:31,992
 I don't want to continue. 

481
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,530
   

482
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,882
After getting beat over my head with facts from Kim Jeong Ho for the first time in a while,

483
00:32:21,882 --> 00:32:24,152
my entire body aches.

484
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:26,532
I'm hurting all over, too.

485
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,942
I can overcome this pain only by eating.

486
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:32,032
I mean, it wasn't enough that Kim Jeong Ho was avoiding me.

487
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:34,852
How could he make it so clear as day that he dislikes me?

488
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,192
Hey, why would he dislike you?

489
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:39,232
If that's not it, what could it be?

490
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:41,692
 I don't usually get hurt that easily, but 

491
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:44,412
it hurt a little bit today.

492
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:46,642
Are you listening to me?

493
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:47,842
Yes.

494
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:48,952
Continue.

495
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:50,372
And that too.

496
00:32:50,372 --> 00:32:52,262
He didn't even tell us that he had bought a building.

497
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,672
Did he think we'd take chunks out of it like zombies if he told us?

498
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,012
Am I the only one sad about this?

499
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:59,792
It's not like he ever talked about himself before.

500
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:04,612
Even if he doesn't talk to me, doesn't he talk to you guys?

501
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:06,662
 Hey, talk. You called me. 

502
00:33:06,662 --> 00:33:08,212
Do you want to play video games?

503
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:09,662
No.

504
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:11,682
It's time for my Se Yeon to eat snacks and go to bed.

505
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:12,802
Then let's play after she goes to bed.

506
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:14,600
No. I have to go to sleep when she goes to sleep

507
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,980
so I can get up when she does.

508
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:22,372
Hey, is your life filled with only Han Se Yeon?

509
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:25,732
You shouldn't say that, man.

510
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,132
Is something wrong?

511
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:30,552
I think Yoo Ri called earlier and was talking about you.

512
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,752
Nothing's the matter.

513
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:34,870
Go to sleep then.

514
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,130
   

515
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:45,952
Honey, I cut up all the strawberries.

516
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:47,982
You'll love these strawberries for me, right?

517
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,142
Here are strawberries that Jin Ki cut up.

518
00:33:50,142 --> 00:33:51,952
Which one do you want to eat first?

519
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:01,812
You usually keep an appropriate distance between people.

520
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:09,162
Between Kim Yoo Ri and me, it's best that we stay a little distant.

521
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:17,172
Honestly speaking, I don't know if I could handle Kim Yoo Ri.

522
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:23,182
Kim Yoo Ri is a true crazy nutjob.

523
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:31,762
 Certified mail! 

524
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:34,172
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you.

525
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:41,712
   

526
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,402
   

527
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:47,062
Hey. Do you really want to go at it?

528
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:49,742
 The building owner is power-tripping by canceling the contract all on his own. 

529
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:50,662
We should follow the law!

530
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:51,552
Even if we go by the law,

531
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:54,802
if I pay you double the contract fee, I can cancel it.

532
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,462
You have to pay for damages too.

533
00:34:56,462 --> 00:35:00,972
You unilaterally terminated the contract without a justifiable reason.

534
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:04,022
According to Civil Code Article 565, Clause 2,

535
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,922
you cannot request compensation for damages!

536
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:07,712
Let's fight it out in court.

537
00:35:07,712 --> 00:35:09,612
I'll make it complicated. I'll create havoc for you.

538
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:12,812
I'll make you think renting it out to me would be easier than going through all that.

539
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:14,282
You.

540
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:16,612
You know how tenacious I am, right?

541
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:20,592
Hey, it's not even that nice of a location.

542
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:21,982
Why are you doing this?

543
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:23,622
You can find a better location elsewhere!

544
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,682
 That's it! 

545
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:26,612
The cost for my time in looking for another place...

546
00:35:26,612 --> 00:35:30,002
Prepare to pay for all that!

547
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,102
Hello? H—

548
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,262
Geez, this nutjob! This nutjob! This nutjob!

549
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:52,952
 Please I beg of you. 

550
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:57,082
Just the fact that you frequently had to clean up while the machine was running.

551
00:35:57,082 --> 00:36:00,522
You only have to speak to that fact in court.

552
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:02,322
I mean...

553
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:06,852
if we say that, do you think the company will continue to hire us?

554
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:10,472
Even the unions are ignoring us, subcontractors.

555
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:13,202
And even if we did that, would the dead come back to life?

556
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:16,462
They're simply trying to get money for the damage compensations.

557
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:18,712
Why would we put our necks on the line?

558
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:21,802
This isn't just a simple compensation for damages lawsuit.

559
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:24,152
You know this well.

560
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:29,592
Around 2,000 people die in our country this way.

561
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:32,872
They fall to their deaths, get sucked into machines, or get cut up.

562
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:36,762
What makes me so angry every time I work on industrial accident cases is that

563
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:40,452
if they only installed a safety fence that cost 100,000 won,

564
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:43,392
people wouldn't fall into the furnace to their deaths.

565
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,382
If they would wear simple safety goggles,

566
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:48,792
a metal rod wouldn't have penetrated someone's eye.

567
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,892
You have no choice because it's a dangerous job?

568
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:57,212
In this world, there are lots of countries where people don't have to die while working.

569
00:36:57,212 --> 00:37:00,162
It's not natural for your job to be a dangerous one.

570
00:37:01,272 --> 00:37:03,072
Even in this case,

571
00:37:04,052 --> 00:37:06,462
only if they had followed common sense,

572
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:09,152
it wouldn't have happened.

573
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:20,560
   

574
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,250
   

575
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:50,682
Why are you working so hard when you've already submitted your resignation letter?

576
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:54,752
Because I desperately want to win this case before leaving.

577
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,182
It's no use.

578
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:04,042
Do you think those people at Kangho Motors are slower than you?

579
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:08,332
They've already set the case up as the laborer's error.

580
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:10,992
They're not a corporation for nothing.

581
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,002
I mean, rather than wasting their efforts

582
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,572
and money on the case after the incident,

583
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:18,922
why don't they just follow the rule and do things safely

584
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,202
so such incidents don't occur?

585
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:24,522
They must be doing it that way because the cost of cleaning up

586
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:28,302
after the incident must be cheaper than doing it by the book.

587
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:32,412
That really sucks.

588
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:34,952
Yes, it sucks.

589
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:36,932
It really sucks.

590
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:42,372
But how could someone like you join our law firm that

591
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:46,132
protects those sucky people with all our might?

592
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:51,212
Because you personally selected me.

593
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:53,872
My Buddhist goddess of mercy...

594
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:58,112
Aigoo. That's why I'm carrying my karma here...

595
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,792
I mean...

596
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:02,202
we set up a separate public service foundation for you.

597
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:04,662
Why must you insist on leaving the firm?

598
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:07,152
Are you really going to run a Law Cafe or something?

599
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:09,002
Did you think I was joking?

600
00:39:09,002 --> 00:39:11,342
There are tons of lawyers out there these days.

601
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:14,172
Do you think a lawyer who makes coffee has a competitive edge?

602
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:17,792
Go to any law firm in Korea. They all serve you coffee.

603
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,172
Serving coffee is given.

604
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:21,502
That Luwak or whatever.

605
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:24,952
Some places even serve that cat poop coffee beans!

606
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:30,982
Why do I insist on a cafe?

607
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:33,302
Well, you know,

608
00:39:33,302 --> 00:39:36,662
when things don't go their way or when people struggle,

609
00:39:36,662 --> 00:39:40,572
they either go see a fortune teller or a therapist to divulge their concerns.

610
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:43,952
So I thought, what if there's a lawyer in the neighborhood

611
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:50,622
you can comfortably open up to about your small concerns in detail?

612
00:39:53,982 --> 00:39:56,512
From my life experience,

613
00:39:56,512 --> 00:40:01,312
one's life could fall apart very easily.

614
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:04,652
 The entire building is engulfed in flames. 

615
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:09,442
 What you see on the screen is a construction site for a storage warehouse in Pacheon city. 

616
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:13,732
 The fire department that finished putting out the fire is searching for survivors. 

617
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:17,552
 There are 12 dead so far and 32 injured. 
   

618
00:40:17,552 --> 00:40:20,292
 And among them, three are in critical condition. 

619
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:24,012
 The exact cause for the fire and damages... 

620
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:44,352
   

621
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:46,132
 Mom! 

622
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:54,002
 Yoo Ri, you came. 

623
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:57,312
 Where is Dad? 

624
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:05,712
 Yoo Ri, no! 

625
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:07,072
 No. 

626
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,552
 Why not? I want to see Dad, too. 

627
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,912
 No! No! No, Yoo Ri! 

628
00:41:11,912 --> 00:41:13,042
 Why not? 

629
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:15,642
 I-I have something to tell Dad... 

630
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,552
 Your dad... 

631
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,312
 got injured too much... 

632
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:25,322
 I don't think he'd want to... 

633
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:29,942
 show himself to you like that for the last time... 

634
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:31,472
 Yoo Ri, Yoo Ri, Yoo Ri! 

635
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:33,872
 But I still want to see him! He's my dad! 

636
00:41:33,872 --> 00:41:35,712
 I want to say goodbye to Dad, too! 

637
00:41:35,712 --> 00:41:37,902
 No, Yoo Ri... 

638
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:42,182
 Yoo Ri... 

639
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:50,912
 Dad... 

640
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:59,542
   

641
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:02,232
 And after you fall apart, 

642
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:06,272
all of a sudden, you need the law that you've never even been interested in before.

643
00:42:06,272 --> 00:42:08,842
Very desperately.

644
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:14,892
 Case number 2006-1657. 

645
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:17,932
 The trial for defendant Lee Pyeon Woong for his professional negligence resulting in death 

646
00:42:17,932 --> 00:42:22,402
 and embezzlement and deriliction of duty will commence. 

647
00:42:22,402 --> 00:42:24,032
 Defendant Lee Pyeon Woong, 

648
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:27,522
 while ventilation work was not completed, in the underground cold storage, 

649
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:30,212
 the company ordered Kim and others to work on fusing operation 

650
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:33,392
 and caused twelve workers to die at the location. 

651
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:35,372
 Under the Criminal Code Article 268, 

652
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:37,792
 for the charge of professional negligence resulting in death... 

653
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:41,282
 Although there was a request to rush the task, 

654
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:45,672
 the fact that there was fire danger due to sparks flying during the fusing operation 

655
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:47,542
 is basic knowledge in this job. 

656
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:50,802
 The worker doing the job should've had better judgment... 

657
00:42:56,342 --> 00:43:02,592
 I'm Lo Shan wh-who worked on the fusing operation of the cold storage. 

658
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:06,862
 Lo Shan, did the Chief usually enjoy drinking? 

659
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:11,152
 As in, he had a shot with his meal or something of that nature? 

660
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:12,382
 Yes. 

661
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:17,612
 A-After w-work, h-he'd eat pork belly and... 

662
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:21,802
 You're saying he often drank while eating pork belly after work, right? 

663
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:23,682
 Then on the day of the incident, 

664
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:27,532
 - do you think he could've had a drink while having lunch? 
 - Yes. 

665
00:43:27,532 --> 00:43:31,572
 If so, how do you think the Chief's condition was right before the incident? 

666
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:34,962
 My father who never even drank &lt;

667
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:36,762
became a drunkard after one testimony.

668
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:38,282
And suddenly, from a victim,

669
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,082
he became a criminal who killed his coworkers.

670
00:43:42,082 --> 00:43:46,092
We couldn't change anything in that courtroom that day, but

671
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:49,072
I realized something after I studied the law.

672
00:43:49,072 --> 00:43:51,492
Even before we entered that courtroom,

673
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:56,852
there were numerous opportunities outside of that courtroom.

674
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:03,772
That's why I want to make coffee.

675
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:07,202
   

676
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:10,772
If she sent over a complaint,

677
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:15,742
I should go up against her with a lawsuit.

678
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:18,432
That's right. Let's just go with it.

679
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:26,562
 Kim Jeong Ho... 

680
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:31,472
Geez, I'm even hearing things now.

681
00:44:32,262 --> 00:44:34,882
 Kim Jeong Ho... 

682
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:36,502
 Kim Jeong Ho... 

683
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:37,999
Kim Yoo Ri?

684
00:44:39,406 --> 00:44:40,802
Hey.

685
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:42,072
Hey, what's going on?

686
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:45,412
Hey! What are you doing at someone's home this late at night?

687
00:44:45,412 --> 00:44:46,452
Why? Hey...

688
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:49,942
Hey! What's up? Hey, hey, hey!

689
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:51,602
 Don't come! 

690
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:55,972
- By chance, are you... 
  - Get out! 

691
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,402
Why should I leave my own place?

692
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:12,122
♫  How can I love you, do you know this?  ♫

693
00:45:12,122 --> 00:45:17,192
♫  Can you tell me?  ♫

694
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,000
♫  So my heart can fill in with—  ♫

695
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,882
Gosh, why do all the restrooms require passcodes?

696
00:45:24,882 --> 00:45:28,552
How dare you come in here with your overly sensitive stomach?

697
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:30,412
Hey! No, no! Hey, hey!

698
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:33,002
You can't lie down here.

699
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:39,022
You have no fear! How could you come over to a guy's house after drinking at night?

700
00:45:39,022 --> 00:45:44,832
In this dangerous world, must I be scared of you, too?

701
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,772
Well, not me, but...

702
00:45:54,032 --> 00:45:57,242
Hey, if you're done with your business, go home. Go, go!

703
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:59,992
Tell me the passcode to the store restroom.

704
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:01,802
Next time,

705
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,622
we must do everything to avoid this human rights violation.

706
00:46:04,622 --> 00:46:05,952
It's only for the new tenants.

707
00:46:05,952 --> 00:46:09,012
Of course, I can't tell just everyone.

708
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,942
Are you going to continue this?

709
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:13,422
Tell me the reason, at least.

710
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:16,582
Why are you dying to kick me out of here?

711
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:19,122
I told you. It's clear as day that you'll go bankrupt.

712
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:21,712
And if you move into this building, you'll bother me too.

713
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,962
Don't tell me stuff like that. Tell me the truth.

714
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:28,762
Do you dislike me that much?

715
00:46:33,702 --> 00:46:38,532
Hey, why would I dislike you?

716
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,652
Then tell me.

717
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:47,482
The reason you want to kick me out.

718
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:52,402
The reason you gave up the job you loved so much all of a sudden and live like this.

719
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:56,551
Tonight, let me hear what's in your heart.

720
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:05,362
What are you doing?

721
00:47:06,172 --> 00:47:09,282
The Truth Game.

722
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:14,192
Come on...

723
00:47:14,192 --> 00:47:16,822
Give me a break. What Truth Game? Get out now!

724
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:19,352
No, I don't want to!

725
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:26,622
Come on. Please, please. Don't drink and do this!

726
00:47:26,622 --> 00:47:28,652
S***. You!

727
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:29,992
This is assault.

728
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:32,832
Then how about trespassing and refusal to leave on your behalf?

729
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:37,942
Are you okay?

730
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:41,582
Do you really want me to go home?

731
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:43,872
Of course. Y-You should go. Will you sleep over then?

732
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:47,112
Yes! Why don't we have a drink here and sleep over like we used to back in college?

733
00:47:47,112 --> 00:47:49,442
You crazy nut! Seriously!

734
00:47:49,442 --> 00:47:51,622
Why are you dying to kick me out?

735
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:54,482
I'm just not showing it, but

736
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:57,842
I'm really hurt that you treat me this way.

737
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:05,412
Since a man and a woman should be separated,

738
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:08,022
I'm just saying we should be careful hanging out at night.

739
00:48:08,022 --> 00:48:10,152
Then if I were a man,

740
00:48:10,152 --> 00:48:12,922
would you let me stay if I said I want to drink here and stay over?

741
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:14,382
Of course!

742
00:48:14,382 --> 00:48:16,872
It's not that you dislike me, but it's just that

743
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:20,282
you're kicking me out since a man and a woman should be separate.

744
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:21,982
- You're sure about that, right? 
 - That's right!

745
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,232
Then I'll leave for now.

746
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:26,922
I'll be back during the day.

747
00:48:26,922 --> 00:48:29,332
You have to play the Truth Game then!

748
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:33,202
I never agreed to play the Truth Game.

749
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:01,242
 Don't tell me stuff like that. Tell me the truth. 

750
00:49:01,242 --> 00:49:04,952
 Do you dislike me that much? 

751
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:09,462
   

752
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:11,592
   

753
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,312
   

754
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:38,352
What?

755
00:49:38,352 --> 00:49:39,972
 Hey, Kim Jeong Ho... 

756
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:42,232
Why don't you pick up?

757
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:43,962
 I didn't know it was ringing. 

758
00:49:43,962 --> 00:49:45,332
 Why? 

759
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:48,802
I have a trial today, but I left it at your house.

760
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:50,212
Left what?

761
00:49:50,212 --> 00:49:54,062
The statements from the factory coworkers for the industrial accident case victim.

762
00:49:54,062 --> 00:49:56,312
I really need to have that.

763
00:49:56,312 --> 00:49:58,102
The statements?

764
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:10,892
So why did you drink on the day before the trial?

765
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:13,272
Gosh, seriously.

766
00:50:13,272 --> 00:50:14,872
What time is your trial?

767
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:18,662
2:30 p.m.?

768
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:21,062
   

769
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:24,572
Hey! Why are you telling me that just now?

770
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,832
Geez, seriously!

771
00:50:36,262 --> 00:50:37,962
Excuse me!

772
00:50:45,232 --> 00:50:46,942
Taxi!

773
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:52,532
   

774
00:50:55,392 --> 00:50:57,412
Prosecutor!

775
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:01,692
Oh, Prosecutor! It's been so long!

776
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:02,712
How are you, Section Chief?

777
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:04,612
Gosh, it's the same old for me.

778
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:06,932
My hair did get thicker ever since you left, but

779
00:51:06,932 --> 00:51:08,902
I don't know why, though!

780
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:11,032
- Oh, come on. 
 - Wow...

781
00:51:11,032 --> 00:51:13,142
Who could this be?

782
00:51:15,912 --> 00:51:19,422
It's the one and only upright man, Kim Jeong Ho.

783
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:21,702
You seemed as though you'd completely leave the law behind when you left.

784
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:23,402
What brings you here?

785
00:51:23,402 --> 00:51:25,642
I have a business to take care of.

786
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:28,882
But...

787
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:34,142
even if you look down on this nation's judiciary,

788
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:38,332
as a former prosecutor, showing up to the sacred courthouse

789
00:51:39,952 --> 00:51:42,332
looking like this...

790
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,272
This is not proper, right?

791
00:51:47,372 --> 00:51:49,242
My apologies.

792
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:52,952
But the courthouse I witnessed...

793
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:57,022
wasn't all that sacred, you know...

794
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:02,372
Let's go, Prosecutor.

795
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:03,922
Bye, Sir!

796
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:06,052
Let's go, Prosecutor.

797
00:52:06,052 --> 00:52:07,842
Let's go.

798
00:52:13,412 --> 00:52:16,362
That a**hole hasn't come to his senses yet.

799
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:21,762
Your Honor.

800
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:27,182
I'll submit evidence relevant to the work process guide.

801
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,850
Excuse me.

802
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,652
Kim Yoo Ri!

803
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:36,012
Plaintiff,

804
00:52:36,012 --> 00:52:38,872
instead of statements by the factory workers,

805
00:52:38,872 --> 00:52:40,612
you have requested a witness.

806
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:42,772
Is your witness present?

807
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:45,402
Yes, Sir! Of course!

808
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,770
   

809
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:04,942
What kind of joke are you playing on me?

810
00:53:04,942 --> 00:53:07,722
You would've never come if I asked you to come and watch.

811
00:53:09,962 --> 00:53:12,162
Stay and watch, Jeong Ho.

812
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:15,102
Stay and watch.

813
00:53:27,182 --> 00:53:29,182
This came with you.

814
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:56,252
 Chief, 

815
00:53:56,252 --> 00:54:00,782
 a person struggles when he can't make a living. 

816
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:03,632
 But do you know what he can't live without? 

817
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:07,222
 The hope that things will get better. 

818
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:08,992
 Although things are in the pits now, 

819
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:12,222
 you still hope that things will change someday. 

820
00:54:12,222 --> 00:54:14,412
 That kind of belief. 

821
00:54:22,652 --> 00:54:24,452
 In the beginning, 

822
00:54:24,452 --> 00:54:30,482
 when the widow of Kim In Soo came to our law office, 

823
00:54:30,482 --> 00:54:33,942
 "Gosh, this is a 100% losing fight." 

824
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:36,492
 I thought that, however... 

825
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:38,582
 "If I could win this case," 

826
00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:41,702
 "the life of over 10,000 people who work at Kangho Motors" 

827
00:54:41,702 --> 00:54:43,902
 "could change a little bit." 

828
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:46,642
 I started thinking that, too. 

829
00:54:46,642 --> 00:54:48,402
 And after that, if I didn't take this case, 

830
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:50,682
 if I didn't take this case, 

831
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:53,312
 I felt like I'd be rejecting 

832
00:54:53,312 --> 00:54:57,772
 some type of a beginning of a change for some reason. 

833
00:54:57,772 --> 00:55:02,472
 So I'm extremely apologetic to you, Chief. 

834
00:55:02,472 --> 00:55:05,802
 But I'll pass you the ticking bomb. 

835
00:55:09,192 --> 00:55:12,482
 Will you be okay after rejecting an opportunity 

836
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:14,982
 to bring change? 

837
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:21,782
 Please reconsider just one more time. 

838
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:31,482
In the Kangho Motors factory 2 in Uljin, 
    

839
00:55:31,482 --> 00:55:34,372
I'm the task leader at subcontractor NE System

840
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:38,252
in charge of cleaning and inspecting equipment.

841
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,882
Defendant, please question the witness.

842
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:53,422
Who is the person who ordered the late Kim In Soo to clean the scrap machine?

843
00:55:53,422 --> 00:55:54,732
It was me.

844
00:55:54,732 --> 00:55:58,142
I received a call saying that the executives from the headquarter were visiting.

845
00:55:58,142 --> 00:56:02,102
So I asked Kim to clean the machine.

846
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:07,712
Then did the main contractor order you to clean the machine

847
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,012
in a rush out of schedule?

848
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:14,042
N-No. When...

849
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:17,182
- higher-ups usually visit us— 
 - Then...

850
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:22,262
it was your decision to order the cleaning of the machine.

851
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:27,202
Although you had no authority to stop the production line?

852
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,292
Y-Yes.

853
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:33,272
And since Kim In Soo also knew that he couldn't decide to stop the production line,

854
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:36,242
he violated the guideline and went through what was not a proper entrance

855
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:38,482
to clean the machine.

856
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:39,762
Is that right?

857
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:41,132
Yes...

858
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,082
However...

859
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:47,292
Your Honor,

860
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:51,402
the safety guideline by the main contractor was clear.

861
00:56:51,402 --> 00:56:53,772
Although it was an unfortunate situation,

862
00:56:53,772 --> 00:56:56,582
should even the accidents that were caused by individual worker's misjudgment

863
00:56:56,582 --> 00:56:59,752
while violating the guidelines

864
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:03,542
be compensated by the main contractor?

865
00:57:04,962 --> 00:57:06,742
That will be all.

866
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:11,802
Plaintiff, do you have more questions for the witness?

867
00:57:18,972 --> 00:57:20,432
Chief,

868
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:23,152
based on the main contractor's safety guidelines,

869
00:57:23,152 --> 00:57:25,452
the baler machine is ranked A for its risk level.

870
00:57:25,452 --> 00:57:27,522
It should have a safety sensor that stops the machine

871
00:57:27,522 --> 00:57:30,692
if a human body touches the machine, correct?

872
00:57:30,692 --> 00:57:32,372
Was it installed?

873
00:57:32,372 --> 00:57:34,162
No.

874
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:36,682
And also...

875
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:38,622
to prevent anyone from getting stuck,

876
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,102
it says it needs a fence for protection.

877
00:57:41,102 --> 00:57:42,182
Was that there?

878
00:57:42,182 --> 00:57:44,002
No, it wasn't there.

879
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:46,032
Aigoo!

880
00:57:46,032 --> 00:57:50,822
The guideline is clearly defined, but nothing was in place.

881
00:57:50,822 --> 00:57:55,112
Then if you didn't order them to clean that day

882
00:57:55,112 --> 00:57:59,452
and if the higher-ups saw all the scraps flying around,

883
00:57:59,452 --> 00:58:01,182
what do you think would've happened?

884
00:58:01,182 --> 00:58:04,372
We're a subcontractor, not even a main contractor.

885
00:58:04,372 --> 00:58:07,412
I'm sure they would've replaced us at any given moment.

886
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:11,842
Your Honor,

887
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:14,232
the workers didn't make reckless decisions on their own

888
00:58:14,232 --> 00:58:16,412
but they were cornered into that decision.

889
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:18,362
There is a big difference in that.

890
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:20,712
Because...

891
00:58:20,712 --> 00:58:23,002
cornering someone to do something dangerous

892
00:58:23,002 --> 00:58:27,152
is more malicious than asking someone to do a dangerous task.

893
00:58:33,932 --> 00:58:39,012
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you to make up your mind to come here today.

894
00:58:39,012 --> 00:58:41,912
Thank you so much for everything.

895
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:47,040
   

896
00:58:49,332 --> 00:58:53,172
We also want to turn off

897
00:58:53,172 --> 00:58:57,332
the machines when people are working.

898
00:58:59,232 --> 00:59:02,122
We're not educated enough, so...

899
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,932
even if someone is crushed to death,

900
00:59:03,932 --> 00:59:07,902
we thought it was just one of those things that happened.

901
00:59:08,672 --> 00:59:13,772
And I thought we couldn't change this, but

902
00:59:15,872 --> 00:59:18,122
someone told me that

903
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:23,312
in this world, there are lots of countries where

904
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:26,282
people don't have to die while working.

905
00:59:26,282 --> 00:59:27,932
 You have no choice because it's a dangerous job? 

906
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:29,442
 In this world, 

907
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:31,442
 there are lots of countries where people don't have to die while working. 

908
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,612
 It's not natural for your job to be a dangerous one. 

909
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:37,422
 But do you know what he can't live without? 

910
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:39,502
 The hope that things will get better. 

911
00:59:39,502 --> 00:59:42,252
 You still hope that things will change someday. 

912
00:59:42,252 --> 00:59:44,402
 That kind of belief. 

913
00:59:47,712 --> 00:59:52,262
Well, what I say won't change anything, but

914
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:55,232
please...

915
00:59:56,872 --> 00:59:59,252
I beg of you.

916
01:00:34,762 --> 01:00:37,112
You need to explain yourself.

917
01:00:37,742 --> 01:00:39,402
Well...

918
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:43,142
how I've lived for the last few years,

919
01:00:43,142 --> 01:00:46,152
what I've been doing, and what I want to do in the future.

920
01:00:46,152 --> 01:00:51,422
I thought you should see it for yourself to understand me...

921
01:00:54,252 --> 01:00:57,092
I don't know why you quit working as a prosecutor, but

922
01:00:57,092 --> 01:01:00,572
I pretty much know that you hate everything in this field

923
01:01:00,572 --> 01:01:02,282
so I'm sure you don't want to

924
01:01:02,282 --> 01:01:03,762
see me running some law consultation and whatnot

925
01:01:03,762 --> 01:01:06,622
on the first floor of your building.

926
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:07,742
You know it well.

927
01:01:07,742 --> 01:01:10,372
And you had to call me all this way?

928
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:13,382
I will not bother you!

929
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:14,932
If you sign the contract,

930
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:17,682
you'll never see me, and I'll live quietly as if I'm dead

931
01:01:17,682 --> 01:01:20,282
and sell coffee and provide legal counsel.

932
01:01:21,202 --> 01:01:23,352
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri.

933
01:01:23,352 --> 01:01:26,282
I've known you for seventeen years.

934
01:01:27,002 --> 01:01:29,132
Not be seen and live quietly as if you're dead—

935
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:31,612
You can't do that!

936
01:01:33,502 --> 01:01:35,712
Then come up with rules!

937
01:01:38,749 --> 01:01:41,842
Let's set some rules, so you and I can coexist.

938
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:45,175
You know, we're law professionals.

939
01:01:45,175 --> 01:01:46,775
Right?

940
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:59,402
♫  It was from the start for me, this inexplicable heart  ♫

941
01:01:59,402 --> 01:02:06,652
♫  I was afraid you'd find out how I felt next to you  ♫

942
01:02:06,652 --> 01:02:13,902
♫  So many awkward days between you and me  ♫

943
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:21,820
♫  I want to protect you now  ♫

944
01:02:24,802 --> 01:02:33,990
♫  I must like you, more than anyone else  ♫

945
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,750
   

946
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,362
♫  I guess I've come to like you  ♫

947
01:02:39,362 --> 01:02:46,682
♫  Maybe I must like you, more today than yesterday  ♫

948
01:02:46,682 --> 01:02:50,202
♫  I must love you more  ♫

949
01:02:50,202 --> 01:02:55,642
♫  I guess I've come to love you more now than back then  ♫

950
01:02:55,642 --> 01:02:57,222
What's this?

951
01:02:57,222 --> 01:02:58,642
The rules.

952
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:00,772
You suggested that we do that yesterday.

953
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:14,212
"Article 2, Clause 1."

954
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:20,102
"Party B will avoid using stroll paths, parks, and supermarkets that Party A frequently uses..."

955
01:03:20,102 --> 01:03:24,222
"and must cooperate in keeping A's living conditions as same as before."

956
01:03:27,412 --> 01:03:29,392
"Article 3, clause 1."

957
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:32,302
"Unless B sets an appointment to meet with A,"

958
01:03:32,302 --> 01:03:36,362
"she cannot start a conversation when running into each other in the building"

959
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:39,372
"and B must text A ahead of time when something does come up."

960
01:03:39,372 --> 01:03:41,412
- That's right. 
 - Hey, are you kidding me?

961
01:03:41,412 --> 01:03:45,772
I have made exceptions for crime, disaster, or medical emergencies.

962
01:03:52,202 --> 01:03:54,132
   

963
01:03:54,132 --> 01:03:56,192

"To promote activities for B's cafe,"

965
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:00,722
"if any event calling for more than 30 people is assembled,"

966
01:04:00,722 --> 01:04:02,532
"B must obtain A's permission."

967
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:03,672
Hey!

968
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:07,322
Who the hell do you think you are to violate my right to assembly?

969
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,572
He's always been like that!

970
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:27,112
He's a crazy a**hole!

971
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:36,222
Why am I taking it this far?

972
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:45,722
Kim Jeong Ho!

973
01:04:49,182 --> 01:04:51,082
♫  You must know  ♫

974
01:04:51,082 --> 01:04:54,762
Kim Jeong Ho!

975
01:04:54,762 --> 01:05:00,990
♫  I guess it will wake me up. That pretty smile  ♫

976
01:05:02,162 --> 01:05:05,002
♫  It makes me smile  ♫

977
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:07,842
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

978
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:14,320
♫  Do you know I am like this?  ♫

979
01:05:15,632 --> 01:05:19,560
♫  In the blowing wind  ♫

980
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:23,602
♫  My heart  ♫

981
01:05:23,602 --> 01:05:28,560
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

982
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:34,252
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

983
01:05:34,252 --> 01:05:40,082
♫  You are like the wind blowing non-stop  ♫

984
01:05:40,082 --> 01:05:43,230
♫  Shaking me  ♫

985
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:48,800
♫  You are like the night sky  ♫

986
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:52,402
Because I...

987
01:05:57,712 --> 01:05:59,862
like her.

988
01:05:59,862 --> 01:06:03,372
♫  My feeling toward you  ♫

989
01:06:03,372 --> 01:06:09,510
♫  It must be love. The way I look at you  ♫

990
01:06:10,672 --> 01:06:13,592
♫  I keep seeing you in front of me  ♫

991
01:06:13,592 --> 01:06:16,552
♫  Where ever I go, I think of you  ♫

992
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:22,880
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

993
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:27,960
♫  In the blowing wind  ♫

994
01:06:29,712 --> 01:06:32,182
♫  My heart  ♫

995
01:06:32,182 --> 01:06:37,092
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

996
01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:42,162
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

997
01:06:42,162 --> 01:06:45,192
   

998
01:06:45,192 --> 01:06:49,162
 As soon as Kim Yoo Ri appeared, again– 

999
01:06:49,162 --> 01:06:54,562
 The way the second-floor doctor looks at the lawyer lady is quite serious. 

1000
01:06:55,749 --> 01:06:57,842
 Don't involve your personal feelings into this. 

1001
01:06:57,842 --> 01:07:01,552
 You're the one who can't step away from the past. 

1002
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:06,352
 Actually, I saw a ghost there... 

1003
01:07:06,352 --> 01:07:08,612
 Kim Jeong Ho, watch out! 

1004
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:14,220
 When a person comes close to you, as a reflex, you could close your eyes, right? 

1005
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:17,200
