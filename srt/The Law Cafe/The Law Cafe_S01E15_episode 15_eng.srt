1
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:30,813
   

2
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:42,677
I know... I'm rushing into this,

3
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:47,437
and I know you're not quite ready yet, but...

4
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:52,297
even if I ask myself a hundred, a thousand times,

5
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:56,237
my answer is still the same.

6
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,460


7
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:11,087
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

8
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:13,797
Marry me, Yoo Ri.

9
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:19,947
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

10
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:29,707
♫  When I think about you, the spring that resembles you comes to my heart  ♫

11
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:32,547
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

12
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:35,597
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

13
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:39,133
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

14
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,133
K-Kim Yoo... Kim Yoo Ri?

15
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,567
What? Oh.

16
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:49,733
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,197
I mean, this is so sudden.

18
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:58,667
Even if it weren't so sudden, my answer would still be the same...

19
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,667
Of course, you may have those thoughts.

20
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,397
But you should be even more careful when that happens.

21
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,462
Hey, Jeong Ho.

22
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:09,517
The institution of marriage was made when the life expectancy of human beings was less than 50 years old.

23
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:12,274
In an age where people live up to a hundred and where things are changing,

24
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:15,464
have you seriously considered whether the custom of marriage is still valid

25
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:17,374
before making your decision?

26
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:18,784
Yeah.

27
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:24,724
Marriage, that is matrimony, is a legal act where two people become husband and wife.

28
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:28,033
One will have obligations of cohabitation, support, and cooperation,

29
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:31,774
not to mention that it is a social covenant to share one's wealth and labor.

30
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:35,144
Do you think that I would have asked you without knowing any of that?

31
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:45,014
So does that mean... you are afraid of entering into...

32
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,034
a legally binding relationship?

33
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:51,014
I mean, what I'm trying to say is...

34
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,894
Look at the rising divorce rates!

35
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:56,624
Marriage is not synonymous with happiness.

36
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,114
More than anything...

37
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:07,544
I don't think I'm ready to become family with your family.

38
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,271
Hi, Father.

39
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,651
Why are you here?

40
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:41,541
I-Is anyone outside?

41
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,151
Father...

42
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,800
How could you do that to me, Father?

43
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,371
I don't know about anyone else...

44
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,171
but Father, you shouldn't...

45
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,981
D*** it!

46
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,741
Father, since you made me like this, you shouldn't be like that to me, at least.

47
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:12,471
You should be blaming yourself for trying to take what was not yours!

48
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,531
Father!

49
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:18,061
God d*** it!

50
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:21,791
F***.

51
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:30,401
God d*** it. I guess this isn't going to work.

52
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,981
I guess I'm not cut out for acting.

53
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,231
You crazy bastard!

54
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,101
I thought about this carefully,

55
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,781
and I don't have many regrets.

56
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,201
But the liver...

57
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,661
I'm kind of regretting that.

58
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,131
You know?

59
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:49,581
"Since I'm responsible for his birth,"

60
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,111
"it's fine to take a liver or gallbladder"

61
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:54,131
"and put it in my body,"

62
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,211
"and since I'm responsible for his birth,"

63
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:59,211
"it's perfectly fine to just use him as much as I need him for"

64
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,171
"and throw him away when I don't need him anymore."

65
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:04,281
If I knew that having children was this good, I should have had some of my own!

66
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:07,201
That's right! That's the extent of your utility.

67
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:10,201
If you've realized your place, come to your senses!

68
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,131
CEO, CEO!

69
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,081
CEO! What are you doing?

70
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,291
 CEO! 

71
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,961
-  CEO!  
 - Did you think that I wouldn't have a way to send you off,

72
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,561
if you try sending me off, Father?

73
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:31,821
 CEO! 

74
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,681
I... I'll send you off right now!

75
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,611
You!

76
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,300
 CEO! 

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,900
Chairman! CEO!

78
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:49,167
CEO, we need to go right now!

79
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,700
Where do I need to go?

80
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,111
Our guys know where to take you.

81
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,491
I'm not getting on a boat, right? I don't like riding boats...

82
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:55,631
Father, Father!

83
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,291
Whether you like it or not, Father, you and I are...

84
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,551
we are inextricably tied together by fate!

85
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:04,011
You can't forget that!

86
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,071
I will send our guys.

87
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:18,851
   

88
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:23,531
   

89
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:32,217
Hey, I thought about it while I was putting Yu Na to sleep.

90
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,897
I think Kim Jeong Ho was in the wrong.

91
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,357
It's not that he was wrong...

92
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:41,327
Does he think marriage is child's play? Why would he propose so suddenly?

93
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,057
It wasn't really so sudden...

94
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:46,533
What do you mean, not so sudden? It's true that he rushed at you with the proposal.

95
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,567
But I guess Kim Jeong Ho must have felt a sense of urgency,

96
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,667
seeing how a careful and meticulous guy like him acting this way.

97
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,627
So? What did you tell him?

98
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:57,457
"Look at the rising divorce rates!"

99
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,967
"Marriage is not synonymous with happiness."

100
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,937
That's Kim Yoo Ri for you.

101
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,047
"More than anything, I don't think I'm ready..."

102
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:08,747
"to become family with your family."

103
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:11,877
She really just drove the nail into the coffin, huh?

104
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,977
Although, she's not wrong.

105
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,717
Just living together isn't marriage.

106
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:20,433
That's why I told you to wait until things were ready!

107
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:24,667
Would Kim Yoo Ri's perspective on marriage change if I waited until things were ready?

108
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,917
Well, I guess you're right about that.

109
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:30,567
Just tell her to think about it again and again. You think about it as well.

110
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:34,887
Marriage... It's not that easy.

111
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:40,607
Dating is nice...

112
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,077
Just keep dating.

113
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,327
You want to live together?

114
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:45,847
Then just live together!

115
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:47,837
Becoming a legally binding family...

116
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:51,817
Legally, a de facto marriage is the same as a legal marriage—

117
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:55,697
Becoming a legally binding family... is a complicated matter.

118
00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:58,527
It's very complicated.

119
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:03,267
Then why did you do it if it's so complicated?

120
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:10,517
Because Do Jin Ki... was a guy I wanted to solve that complicated thing with.

121
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:13,447
How are you guys still so into each other like that?

122
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:16,777
Geez, I'm so jealous.

123
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,687
What's up? You don't usually say things like that.

124
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,107
What, am I not human?

125
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,187
I go through hard times, just like everyone else.

126
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,833
Hey, Do Jin Ki.

127
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,873
Is there something going on between you and Han Se Yeon?

128
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,541
Forget it. You just think about it a bit more.

129
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,871
It could be that you're thinking of this too lightly.

130
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,991
   

131
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,684
Yes, Deputy Director?

132
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:23,200
I thought you should know this before you see it on the news.

133
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,509
 An arrest warrant has been issued, 

134
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,334
 but controversy is stirring with the disappearance of CEO Lee Pyeon Woong of Dohan Construction. 

135
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,954
 The police are continuing their search of CEO Lee's villas, 

136
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:37,604
 keeping in mind the possibility that he might be on the run. 

137
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:40,114
 CEO Lee's closest aide, Department Head Han Jo Hwan, 

138
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,414
 also went missing yesterday afternoon... 

139
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:45,034
Are they seriously on the run?

140
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,044
Kim Yoo Ri, where are you? Where... Kim Yoo Ri!

141
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,904
Kim Yoo Ri! Hey, what do we do now?

142
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:56,800
- CEO. 
 - What do we do now?

143
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,154
What if that crazy bastard comes for me?

144
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:01,204
Why would Lee Pyeon Woong come after you, CEO?

145
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:04,584
You've seen how unpredictable he can be and still can't figure it out?

146
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,534
If he thinks things are going down the drain,

147
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:10,334
what crazy thing might he do next?

148
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,754
Oh, gosh! Okay.

149
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,314
Instead of being like this,

150
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,624
shouldn't we hire some security?

151
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:19,954
Please calm down, and let's not worry so much.

152
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,284
He'll be caught soon.

153
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:24,154
Yeah. How long could he keep this up with the size of our country?

154
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:26,914
Are you not worried, even though you've been targeted multiple times?

155
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:28,404
What? Is our nation's police just dawdling around?

156
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:30,674
Why would I worry about something so useless?

157
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,824
God, I've wasted my time coming here...

158
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:35,104
Hey! Start the car!

159
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:30,434
The last location where Lee Pyeon Woong's phone signal was picked up was Chairman Lee's house in Hannam-dong.

160
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:32,114
And around 10:30 p.m. last night,

161
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,514
911 was dispatched to Chairman Lee's residence.

162
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,114
911?

163
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,434
He's currently at the hospital.

164
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,544
Fortunately, he's conscious.

165
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:44,544
That means that the last person Lee Pyeon Woong met was Chairman Lee,

166
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:47,814
but he's currently refusing to provide any testimonies.

167
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,954
 Where do you think this is for you to come here? 

168
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,284
Huh?

169
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,214
Father! Father, Father!

170
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:58,584
Father!

171
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,567
Stop this! What did he do wrong for you to act this way?

172
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,944
If you guys took care of business properly,

173
00:12:02,944 --> 00:12:04,233
do you think it would have gotten to this point?

174
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,704
Stop blaming other people!

175
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:07,733
If it's not you who made Pyeon Woong this way, then who is it?

176
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,154
Honey, stay out of this.

177
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:11,454
Gosh, seriously.

178
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:12,633
Honey!

179
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,300
Honey! Oh, my God!

180
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,130
Blood! Oh, no, what do we do...

181
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,854
Gosh! Seriously...

182
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,384
Hearing what they were saying about riding boats or whatever,

183
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:37,824
it seems like he's trying to escape South Korea.

184
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,744
Using whatever means necessary,

185
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,294
you guys better catch him.

186
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,384
Before he creates any more trouble.

187
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:52,194
Get your wound checked out first.

188
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,954
He will be caught soon.

189
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:56,204
I will have the situation reported to me,

190
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:57,704
so don't get involved.

191
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:00,194
I'll handle myself,

192
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,324
so please take care of Mom, too.

193
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,934
 So I looked into everything you asked me for, Prosecutor. 

194
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:28,494
 The role you're going to play is a Cheongdam-dong jebi. 
 (T/N: jebi - gigolo) 

195
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:30,384
 A very handsome one. 

196
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,054
This is the one I was talking to you about last time.

197
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:41,894
The one who makes a splash in both the hearts and bank accounts

198
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:44,114
of ladies in Gangnam,

199
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,784
Cheongdam-dong's Moolsoojebi* 
  (Skipping Stones) 

200
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,874
He looks the part, right?

201
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,024
It's nice to meet you.

202
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:51,774
I'm Moolsoojebi.

203
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,714
If we're talking about Cheongdam-dong's Moolsoojebi,

204
00:13:55,714 --> 00:14:00,044
I heard he fled to Thailand from Gungpyeong Port a few years ago.

205
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:04,204
I guess you're a bit slow with the news. I came back a while back.

206
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:06,164
I mean, when you use up all of the money,

207
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:08,974
then you need to come back to replenish some of this, you know?

208
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,064
But before I start this job, I have a ritual that I need to do.

209
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:14,734
I need to make sure that I have a boat ride for an escape

210
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,844
to really focus on the job at hand.

211
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:19,344
Oh, yeah.

212
00:14:19,344 --> 00:14:21,934
So how's business nowadays?

213
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,614
It's not like the old days.

214
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,984
And there are more coast guard patrols.

215
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:30,154
- But wasn't there someone who came by yesterday as well? 
 - Yesterday?

216
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:32,564
I mean, he came out on the news.

217
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:35,604
What was it again... D-Dohan Construction's CEO.

218
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:37,594
Supposedly, he's on the run!

219
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,014
He didn't come to you?

220
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:44,524
I told you not to use someone useless like this guy.

221
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:46,794
Let's go to someone who's actually reputable, even if it costs more money!

222
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:49,044
We're all going to die like this. Hurry. Come, come.

223
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:51,544
- Forget you! 
 - Useless?

224
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:54,624
If Gungpyeong Port is economy class, we are business class.

225
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:58,864
I only serve people who are in the upper echelons of society.

226
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,374
That man.

227
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:02,874
He's still in South Korea.

228
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:10,874
How do you know that?

229
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,874
From what I'm hearing,

230
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,864
his underlings prepared a boat and everything for him,

231
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:21,014
but he supposedly pulled out at the last second.

232
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,234
As a result, the police are constantly on the lookout

233
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:26,674
so we can't set sail until he's caught.

234
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:36,594
 You've seen how unpredictable he can be, and you still can't figure it out? 

235
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,564
 If he thinks things are going down the drain, 

236
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,734
 what crazy thing might he do next? 

237
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:45,144
Let's try digging through all the villas, studios, and residences owned by Dohan Construction.

238
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,114
Okay.

239
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:49,704
Looks like I'm about to do a full tour through the eight provinces again.

240
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,394
I mean, if we had a place like this,

241
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:57,104
you should have told me a bit sooner.

242
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,334
Yeah.

243
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:02,534
I'll stay here quietly before heading over there.

244
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,684
- CEO. 
 - Oh, it's cold!

245
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,774
I think you should leave the country on a boat while you still can...

246
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:15,174
D*** it, I told you not to worry.

247
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:20,284
There are a lot of people in South Korea who's going to be in big trouble if I open my mouth.

248
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,734
How did it go with what I asked you to find out for me?

249
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,124
Yes, she's living in Hwayeon-dong in Gyeonggi-do,

250
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:30,344
and it appears that after Kim Yoo Ri's father passed away,

251
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,044
she's remarried.

252
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:34,024
Is that so?

253
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:42,724
That's what makes me think when you say...

254
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:46,184
- So... 
 - Eun Kang, please get me some coffee.

255
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,744
Se Yeon!

256
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:58,044
Could you let me sleep at your place for just a few days?

257
00:16:58,044 --> 00:16:59,744
Of course!

258
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:02,694
What's wrong?

259
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,914
I'm thinking of getting a divorce.

260
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:07,574
What?

261
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:13,524
Peekaboo!

262
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:14,904
She fell asleep.

263
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:16,454
Oh, really?

264
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:32,464
 Hold still. Hold still. 

265
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:34,734
 Hold still. 

266
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,374
 Babysitting Yu Na is difficult, right? 

267
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:44,044
 I'll put in more effort. 

268
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:47,324
 If it's too hard on you, you can just come by once a week. 

269
00:17:47,324 --> 00:17:50,684
 Then my Jin Ki will wither away. 

270
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:53,344
 How much could you possibly do? 

271
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,614
 I do quite a bit, Mother. 

272
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:58,964
 Yesterday, my overnight shift just ended a bit late... 

273
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:01,474
 If you've broken your husband's wings and made him stay at home, 

274
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:03,274
 then you should at least feel sorry. 

275
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:05,364
 How are you so shameless? 

276
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,914
 To be blunt, if it wasn't for me, 

277
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:10,134
 do you even have a mother to ask? 

278
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,704
 You don't even have your mother here... 

279
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:15,314
 You're being greedy trying to raise a child and work at the same time. 

280
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:18,284
 Right? 

281
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:21,884
 Taking a step back from work is the right thing for me. 

282
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,334
 Yeah? 

283
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,204
 This has already been decided. 

284
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,204
 But this is difficult for you, too, honestly. 

285
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:31,274
 You haven't been able to tend to the business that you've worked so hard on, 

286
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,394
 and it's hard for you to watch the baby all day. 

287
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:35,844
 Just be honest and tell me it's tough. 

288
00:18:37,664 --> 00:18:39,664
 What did you tell me when you married me? 

289
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:41,714
 You said you want to keep working no matter what. 

290
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:43,774
 And I promised that I'll make that happen. 

291
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,744
 That's why I'm trying my best, so what's your problem? 

292
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:51,124
 I don't want to hear that I broke my husband's wings to keep him at home. 

293
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,244
 Let's stop this. Forget it. 

294
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,384
 You see. What did I say? 

295
00:18:56,384 --> 00:19:00,224
 I told you that you'd go through a hard time and regret it if you married me. 

296
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:04,374
 You regret it, right? 

297
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,684
 You regret it? 

298
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:13,714
 Oh, you do regret it, huh. 

299
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:21,214
He says he's regretting it already, so what's the point of this marriage?

300
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:22,344
Hey, no!

301
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:25,534
It's not just anyone. It's Do Jin Ki! Why would he regret it?

302
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:28,134
I should have taken off from work from the start.

303
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:32,654
No, that was because you were so close to promotion already!

304
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:36,044
No, I think I just screwed everything up.

305
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:43,794
No, you guys are doing well. I mean it!

306
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:46,904
You guys are just tired. That's all.

307
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:03,024
   

308
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:08,274
Is Do Jin Ki here?

309
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,314
No, Se Yeon is.

310
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:11,874
Han Se Yeon?

311
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:15,284
Why? Is there something wrong between the two?

312
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:17,594
I think the two fought.

313
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:20,104
I'm going to have her sleep at my place tonight.

314
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,454
Hey, Jeong Ho. About us...

315
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:30,364
Let's talk later. It doesn't matter to me.

316
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:32,394
Why doesn't it matter?

317
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:38,234
Hurry up and finish closing up the cafe. I'll take you home.

318
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:01,784
 Marry me, Yoo Ri. 

319
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:05,124
 I'm thinking of getting a divorce. 

320
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:36,744
The drink is a bit hot. Enjoy it.

321
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:44,184
Yes, Se Yeon.

322
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:47,364
The baby just keeps crying and not eating the food.

323
00:21:47,364 --> 00:21:50,124
- Food? 
 - Yoo Na?

324
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,142
Oh, Noonim, you came?

325
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:00,482
U-Unni!

326
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:03,614
 Marry me, Yoo Ri. 

327
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,724
Oh, M-M-Mother...

328
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:09,014
Just call me whatever you're comfortable with.

329
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:10,914
Whether you call me Unni or Mother.

330
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:14,133
I think it's about time she needs a diaper change.

331
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,023
Diapers, diapers, diapers...

332
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,974
To think that Yoo Na was crying because of her diapers...

333
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:23,094
She's definitely a mom, right?

334
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:24,754
Of course.

335
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:28,074
But... Why is she here?

336
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:37,274
Pyeon Woong should be caught soon.

337
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,214
Don't worry about it too much.

338
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:40,904
Yes.

339
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:43,144
I didn't come when you had a lot of consultations to do, right?

340
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,664
No, I don't have that many today, so it's okay.

341
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,994
Honestly, the reason why I came today was

342
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:51,124
because I wanted to ask you something personally.

343
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:58,754
Are you... serious with my Jeong Ho?

344
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:01,404
Wh-What do you mean by serious

345
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:03,504
You know what I mean by that.

346
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:07,244
M-M-Mother, well...

347
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:16,514
I can't ask Jeong Ho,

348
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:20,534
and everyone in the legal world knows our family,

349
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,884
break up with my son!

350
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:40,254
so it would be even more difficult to ask them.

351
00:23:42,194 --> 00:23:44,394
So there was only you.

352
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:52,134
I tried writing up this letter of complaint.

353
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:54,484
A letter of complaint?

354
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:07,844
By any chance, have you ever handled filing for a divorce?

355
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:13,802
   
   

356
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:16,194
Oh, that's nice.

357
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,414
But is it okay for you to close up shop already and hang out like this?

358
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:21,000
If the Landlord finds out, he'll probably nag you a lot again.

359
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,644
If it's not on a day like today, then when would I drink with you guys?

360
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:28,033
You're so good at making excuses.

361
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,133
But then again.

362
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,794
Have you left your home again?

363
00:24:32,794 --> 00:24:35,774
He probably doesn't even know that I've left.

364
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,874
Why are you feeling upset about that at your age?

365
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:41,664
Life is just like that.

366
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:45,484
What, you can't get upset when you're old?

367
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,474
He didn't talk much when we were dating.

368
00:24:47,474 --> 00:24:49,174
Nowadays, he doesn't even respond to me anymore.

369
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:51,384
I wonder why we should keep living together if we're going to be like this.

370
00:24:51,384 --> 00:24:52,624
Oh, my. Oh, my.

371
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,967
The problem with my husband is that he doesn't ever shut his mouth,

372
00:24:55,967 --> 00:25:00,514
but I guess the problem with your husband is that he doesn't ever open his mouth.

373
00:25:00,514 --> 00:25:01,794
What about you?

374
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:03,374
What about your husband?

375
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:05,684
Is he good to you?

376
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:09,664
He died and isn't with me anymore.

377
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:11,764
Oh, really?

378
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:14,224
I don't know what the rush was,

379
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:16,614
but he's left me early.

380
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:20,144
It's already been 20 years of living alone as a widow.

381
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,614
No! Why did you do that?

382
00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:25,364
You should have just plopped down anywhere!

383
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,784
Oh, gosh, I really should have!

384
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:29,974
I should have just plopped down anywhere!

385
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,684
Even if he's next to you, it's a problem.

386
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:41,074
Even if he's not, it's a problem.

387
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:42,224
What do you think?

388
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:46,914
Seeing how we're living brings you to a dilemma, right?

389
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,110
A dilemma?

390
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,960
What dilemma?

391
00:25:53,744 --> 00:25:56,844
I don't know what dilemma you're talking about?

392
00:25:56,844 --> 00:26:01,333
I mean, you know... young people these days say things that they're anti-marriage,

393
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:05,224
and getting married is not the trend anymore.

394
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:07,004
Well, yes, that's true.

395
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:12,104
Still, I give one vote to saying that it's better to having a husband.

396
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,644
Me, too.

397
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:14,844
For me... I vote that it's fine without one.

398
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:16,534
I vote that it's fine without one.

399
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:18,267
Yeah...

400
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:21,257
Do you really vote that it's okay without one?

401
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:26,194
There must have been a time when the two of you were passionate, too.

402
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:29,174
Didn't you guys get married despite the opposition from your families

403
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:33,014
and that's why you guys lived without seeing your families?

404
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:36,784
When I was young, I didn't like having to go to my father's company

405
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:39,244
and following my father's orders.

406
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,954
And I didn't like his ways, either.

407
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:48,064
So I think I escaped underneath his umbrella.

408
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,374
Others say that he's stubborn

409
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:53,454
and not flexible,

410
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:56,874
but I liked how he wouldn't go anywhere unless it was the right path.

411
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:02,704
 But looking back now, 

412
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:07,874
 it turns out that the baggage that I had let go of when I escaped from my father, 

413
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:11,874
 he's been carrying it all in my place all this time. 

414
00:27:15,264 --> 00:27:18,894
So that's why you're going to get a divorce?

415
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,974
Because he only knew the right path and was corrupted by me,

416
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:25,904
so I'm going to let him go?

417
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:30,244
You said that you went underneath his umbrella.

418
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:33,144
When things were hard for you, you hid under his protection,

419
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:36,044
and now you're going to let him go?

420
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:46,074
It's because of people like you, Unni, that I can't make a decision!

421
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:49,584
People making promises that they'll love you forever,

422
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,644
and when things get a bit tough,

423
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:53,094
they say things like, "For your own good,

424
00:27:53,094 --> 00:27:55,434
I'll let you go."

425
00:27:57,144 --> 00:28:00,374
But why am I starting to get a little angry?

426
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:03,054
Is it just my mood?

427
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:04,724
Oh, no. Now, now, now.

428
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,414
It seems like you're pretty drunk right now.

429
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:08,034
Let's hurry up and go inside.

430
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:11,344
Unni! You're a hypocrite!

431
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:14,064
Hypocrite.

432
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:19,654
What did you just say?

433
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:23,204
Hypocrite.

434
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:24,834
You!

435
00:28:30,224 --> 00:28:32,044
Hey, Han Se Yeon!

436
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:37,367
Man, when are you going back home?

437
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,227
Mind your own business.

438
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:42,024
I don't know exactly what's going on,

439
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:44,420
but you know that you're just avoiding the conflict, right?

440
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,970
Leave me alone, so I can avoid it.

441
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:49,984
Hey, Se Yeon.

442
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:51,604
What do you know about anything, girl!

443
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,504
Unni, you don't know love!

444
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:56,064
How does love change like that?

445
00:28:56,064 --> 00:29:01,764
Girl, I'm going to show you what's up today!

446
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:04,434
Unni, you don't know love!

447
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:06,234
You don't know!

448
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:09,214
Aigoo...

449
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,854
Who is that?

450
00:29:11,724 --> 00:29:13,644
Mom!

451
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:15,674
Mom? Mom!

452
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,844
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mom, Mom, Mom!

453
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:19,514
Mom, let go!

454
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:20,884
Let go of me!

455
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,064
- Mom! 
 - Let go! I'll teach that b**** a lesson!

456
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:26,694
Yoo Ri is going to get hurt like this!

457
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,594
You! Are you taking that girl's side?

458
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,244
Mom, I'm not taking sides here.

459
00:29:32,244 --> 00:29:35,724
This is why people say there's no point in raising a son!

460
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,454
Hey! You b****!

461
00:29:37,454 --> 00:29:40,594
Have you tried living for 30 years between guys like this?

462
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:42,804
- What do you know! 
 - No, Mom, Mom, Mom! Stop!

463
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,744
Yeah, I don't know anything.

464
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:48,044
Aside from the fact that your love has changed.

465
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:49,974
Take her away. Mom, please!

466
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:52,134
- We're sorry! 
 - Please, stop! Mom!

467
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:53,474
- Whenever she drinks alcohol... 
 - Mom, let's take a seat.

468
00:29:53,474 --> 00:29:55,034
Please take a seat.

469
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:59,374
Aigoo... D-Do you know how I raised him?

470
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:02,034
How could he take her side...

471
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,554
Hey! Apologize to her!

472
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,814
Han Se Yeon! You're the same!

473
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:08,054
Think about your relationship with Do Jin Ki!

474
00:30:08,054 --> 00:30:10,014
Aren't you the one who's actually regretting it?

475
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:12,974
Relax, Mom! Mom, please calm down!

476
00:30:12,974 --> 00:30:16,154
Girl, you need a beating. Get a beating and come to your senses!

477
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:18,074
Hey, hey! Why are you...

478
00:30:18,074 --> 00:30:19,424
Why are you hitting her for?

479
00:30:19,424 --> 00:30:22,104
- People who act out drunk should get a beating. 
 - Hey! Hey! That hurts. Let go of her.

480
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,654
Let go. Move away, move away.

481
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:25,314
Geez, seriously.

482
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:28,544
You too, Yoo- Yoo Ri, you wake up, too!

483
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:30,404
My arm's broken...

484
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,994
What do you mean broken? It's attached perfectly fine.

485
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:43,634
Here. Drink it.

486
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,924
Is your stomach feeling okay?

487
00:30:52,774 --> 00:30:53,974
M-Mother...

488
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:55,434
Where is your mother?

489
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:59,664
- I should go and kneel— 
 - It's okay. She's sleeping in my room.

490
00:30:59,664 --> 00:31:03,914
It's okay. My mom never remembers anything the day after she drinks.

491
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:08,124
Gosh, in any case...

492
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:10,694
Alcohol is a problem for both of you.

493
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:13,494
Sorry.

494
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,014
Do you know this?

495
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:27,824
My dad said...

496
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:29,844
he'll do...

497
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:33,534
breakdancing at my wedding in front of the guests.

498
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:36,214
So he was practicing it in advance.

499
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:39,884
And then look what happened.

500
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:44,224
He disappeared one day and is never coming back.

501
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:49,354
♫  I think of the expression on your face you could not hide  ♫

502
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:54,274
Rather than disappointing each other by breaking the promise,

503
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:58,294
wouldn't it be better not to make promises?

504
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:03,654
♫  My heart disturbed  ♫

505
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:06,664
I just can't do it, Jeong Ho.

506
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:10,154
Knowing full well that I'd be lying,

507
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,854
I can't make the promise.

508
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:17,954
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

509
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:22,104
♫  Like the snowfall from early dawn  ♫

510
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:24,084
All right.

511
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:27,994
Let's not do it.

512
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:31,874
I don't like it if you don't like it.

513
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:33,724
So don't be pressured.

514
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:37,094
I rushed into talking about marriage.

515
00:32:37,094 --> 00:32:38,994
♫  It would be so nice if I could  ♫

516
00:32:38,994 --> 00:32:43,700
I'm sorry.

517
00:32:49,004 --> 00:32:51,154
I said it's okay.

518
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,214
Going forward,

519
00:32:56,214 --> 00:33:00,804
I'll never make a promise to you that I couldn't keep.

520
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,024
So don't worry.

521
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:08,074
♫  The short shower that didn't seem like that was coming  ♫

522
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:16,544
♫  My heart for you that I could not hide longs for you more  ♫

523
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:20,504
♫  I think of you  ♫

524
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:26,534
♫  Empty place, my heart disturbed  ♫

525
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:28,724
   

526
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:35,914
Mother!

527
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,574
As for yesterday I've wronged—

528
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:40,384
I don't remember what happened yesterday.

529
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:42,284
But do you?

530
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:44,284
Well, I don't...

531
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:46,264
really remember it, either...

532
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:48,114
Then it's fine.

533
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:51,244
To regret what I've done while drunk,

534
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:54,944
I've gotten into way too much trouble while sober in my life.

535
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:58,744
But now that I think about it,

536
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:01,004
you were correct about everything you said.

537
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:06,214
Bringing up divorce after all this time makes me a despicable person.

538
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:09,284
You said you didn't remember it earlier...

539
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:11,774
That's what I'm saying. I don't remember it, but

540
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:15,304
you were right, in any case, Yoo Ri.

541
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:24,644
   

542
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:28,914
Why is Choi Song Hwa's lawyer visiting me?

543
00:34:28,914 --> 00:34:31,184
It's a long story.

544
00:34:31,184 --> 00:34:32,484
Where is Lee Pyeon Woong?

545
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:36,604
Why are you asking me that? You should look for him yourselves.

546
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:39,884
When I checked the call history on your burner phone,

547
00:34:39,884 --> 00:34:42,734
you had talked to Lee Pyeon Woong at least once a day.

548
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:44,784
It's not like you're his secret lover.

549
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:46,024
At this rate,

550
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:49,114
you should both know pretty much everything about each other, no?

551
00:34:49,114 --> 00:34:50,874
What in the hell...

552
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:55,464
I just went along with it only because he kept coming on to me.

553
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:57,914
He's too subpar for me to play with.

554
00:34:57,914 --> 00:35:02,084
There's someone else he hangs around and plays with.

555
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,514
Who's that?

556
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:11,134
Him.

557
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:12,704
The youngest son of the Yushin Group.

558
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:15,334
His name is Oh Yoon Ho. Age 23.

559
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:17,494
They had him in later years.

560
00:35:17,494 --> 00:35:20,554
He was in the States and returned to Korea not too long ago.

561
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:24,924
From the rumors, I heard he hung around the wrong crowd and got into drugs.

562
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:29,074
So the chairman basically dragged him home by his hair.

563
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:49,764
I don't know.

564
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:53,864
Who is that ahjussi?

565
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:57,264
Would you remember only after I hit you like this?

566
00:35:57,264 --> 00:35:59,664
Between violation of narcotics regulations

567
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:01,944
and hiding a runaway criminal,

568
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:04,864
don't you know which one is more of a serious offense?

569
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:12,154
Which crime would your father be angrier about?

570
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:14,064
You really can't make that judgment?

571
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:16,074
Who are you, ahjussi?

572
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,904
What do you do exactly?

573
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:24,004
Fortunately, these ahjussis are not all that interested in you.

574
00:36:24,004 --> 00:36:26,024
I'll ask you again.

575
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:28,314
Where is Lee Pyeon Woong?

576
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:29,984
Lee Pyeon Woong!

577
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:32,164
Find him!

578
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:34,314
 Hurry up and come in and look! 

579
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:38,004
 Over here, over here! Go! 

580
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:42,214
 To the second floor! 

581
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:51,414
D*** it! These punks!

582
00:36:51,414 --> 00:36:54,504
Looks like they already knew about us coming and ran away.

583
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,174
Look into the background of that Director Han or something.

584
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:00,300
Find out why he's going out on a limb to this extent when Lee Pyeon Woong is cornered.

585
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,424
I know, right?

586
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:04,444
Okay. Got it.

587
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,124
What are the police doing and not catching that punk?

588
00:37:14,124 --> 00:37:16,414
This isn't going to work. I'll go up to you tonight.

589
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:19,564
I'm with Se Yeon and Jeong Ho. Why bother coming here?

590
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:22,874
Don't worry about me. I'm being careful.

591
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,854
And speaking of, you should be careful, too, Mom.

592
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:26,894
Okay?

593
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:29,264
Don't you worry about me.

594
00:37:29,264 --> 00:37:32,144
But where is this Yu Chan? He ditched his academy, and I don't know where he's roaming around.

595
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:33,204
I can't stand it.

596
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:36,674
I'll catch him and take him home. Then, I'll head on over tonight. Got it?

597
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:39,864
I see the PC Cafe over there. I'll talk to you later.

598
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:45,204
   

599
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,124
Okay.

600
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:51,104
Excuse me, by chance...

601
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:53,524
This is my son.

602
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:56,124
He's about this tall.

603
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:58,564
He's a sixth grader at Seorim Elementary. He comes here every day.

604
00:37:58,564 --> 00:38:01,584
Well, I don't think he came here today.

605
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:03,444
Really?

606
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:06,284
Gosh, that bastard.

607
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,064
He always causes trouble.

608
00:38:21,474 --> 00:38:23,854
Yeah, what now, Mom?

609
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:26,574
 Hi, Attorney Kim. 

610
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:29,274
Lee Pyeon Woong?

611
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,174
   

612
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:34,884
Where are you right now?

613
00:38:34,884 --> 00:38:39,684
 I was going to keep quiet and stay hidden, but 

614
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:43,854
 your high and mighty boyfriend keeps provoking me. 

615
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,454
I have no choice if I get cornered like this.

616
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:48,754
So hurry up and turn yourself in.

617
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:50,854
Your situation will just get worse if you continue this way.

618
00:38:50,854 --> 00:38:55,684
If you say what I ask for, I'll turn myself in.

619
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:00,474
Attorney Kim,

620
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:03,824
there has to be a reason for me being like this, don't you think?

621
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:05,174
 Aren't you curious about that? 

622
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,434
No, not at all.

623
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:08,514
 My mom... 

624
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:11,014
used to be an actress.

625
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:13,294
 She wasn't famous, though. 

626
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:18,064
She used to play minor roles here and there and caught my old man's eye.

627
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:22,214
Ever since then her life started going down the tubes.

628
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:26,754
Because she had me.

629
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:29,344
But usually...

630
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:31,904
a family would provide money to live on if a mistress had a child.

631
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:35,154
But my old man is very particular.

632
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:38,434
He insisted that I was not his seed...

633
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,014
So he drove her out.

634
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:42,674
 So my mom... 

635
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,844
 went to visit Dohan Group's wife 

636
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:46,344
 in the middle of freezing winter 

637
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:50,074
 with an infant in her arms. 

638
00:39:50,074 --> 00:39:52,504
Saying if they don't take care of her,

639
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:55,974
she'll just kill herself with the baby right there and then.

640
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:58,094
So why are you telling me all this?

641
00:39:58,094 --> 00:40:00,567
What kind of person is your mom, Attorney Kim?

642
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,114
After stomping all over and destroying someone else's life,

643
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:05,134
are you afraid to pay the cost?

644
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:07,574
Do you want to buy indulgence with your misfortune or something?

645
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,064
Attorney Kim,

646
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:11,464
you're understanding with everyone in this world.

647
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:13,154
 And you help everyone. 

648
00:40:13,154 --> 00:40:15,124
 Could you... 

649
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:17,834
try to be understanding of me, too?

650
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,584
I'd be understanding if you're human.

651
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,864
But are you human?

652
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,584
That makes me sad, Attorney Kim.

653
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:33,884
But are you sure you won't regret this?

654
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:34,974
What are you talking about?

655
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:39,554
 Aigoo, the person I've been waiting for is here. 

656
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:42,994
We'll meet again soon, Attorney Kim.

657
00:40:52,654 --> 00:40:54,534
Hey, Se Yeon.

658
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:57,854
Did you confirm the base station?

659
00:40:57,854 --> 00:41:01,454
We've contacted the communication service to locate the source router. So wait a little longer.

660
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:04,374
I'll catch this a**hole today.

661
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,694
Yeah. Where is it?

662
00:41:09,694 --> 00:41:11,924
Gyeonggi-do, Hwayeon-dong?

663
00:41:12,724 --> 00:41:15,734
Isn't that where your mother is?

664
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:19,204
 What kind of person is your mom, Attorney Kim? 

665
00:41:41,962 --> 00:41:43,567
O-Oh, my goodness, Yoo Ri! What do we do?

666
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,487
Wh-What do we do, Yoo Ri...

667
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:02,997
   

668
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,667
Yoo Ri.

669
00:42:08,516 --> 00:42:10,776
I promise you.

670
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:14,466
I'll find Mother no matter what I have to do.

671
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:17,406
And I'll be sure not a hair on her body is hurt.

672
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:20,146
I promise you that I'll rescue her.

673
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:29,516
I said I wouldn't make a promise I can't keep. Right?

674
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:35,566
So trust me, and hang on a little longer. Okay?

675
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:51,936
 So I think I thought these things then. 

676
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:55,026
 We may not be able to keep our promises, 

677
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:58,266
 but the reason we keep making promises is 

678
00:42:58,266 --> 00:42:59,996
 maybe because... 

679
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:03,236
Just keep searching for her.

680
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:05,496
Yeah.

681
00:43:12,896 --> 00:43:16,496
   

682
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:19,636
 Mom? Where are you, Mom? 

683
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:21,786
 Mom! Mom, where are you? Mom! 

684
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:25,186
 - Mom. Mom?
   - You crazy bastard!

685
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,516
 Hey, you nephew bastard! 

686
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:29,266
Hi.

687
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:31,176
Where are you?

688
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:33,376
- Will you come alone? 
 - I said where are you?

689
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:38,426
If you want to find Attorney Kim's mother, you have to come here alone.

690
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:41,606
I got it. Just tell me where you are.

691
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:55,586
 But the reason we keep making promises is 

692
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,086
 maybe because... 

693
00:43:57,086 --> 00:43:59,486
 as we live in the moment, 

694
00:43:59,486 --> 00:44:04,596
 it may be the only way we could hang onto each other. 

695
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:38,056
What?

696
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:41,806
Did you really come alone just because I said so?

697
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:44,566
Hey, my nephew...

698
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:47,366
I thought you were a genius, but it turns out you're stupid.

699
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:50,776
Shut up and tell me where Mother is.

700
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:54,896
Jeong Ho.

701
00:44:54,896 --> 00:44:57,766
When I was little,

702
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:01,966
I used to go to a Catholic church.

703
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,896
I used to pray hard,

704
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:07,886
but He didn't answer any of it.

705
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:12,046
So I thought this way;

706
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:18,566
"Oh, God must be having so much fun."

707
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:21,856
"We're so desperate yet..."

708
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:24,286
"He's not."

709
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:30,896
Don't hurt Yoo Ri's mother and let's just play.

710
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:33,556
You and me.

711
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,336
It'd be fun to have everyone play together.

712
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:37,446
Whether you kill me or not, do whatever you want with me.

713
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:39,796
Just do it to me!

714
00:45:46,676 --> 00:45:52,106
I'll do whatever you want.

715
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,676
What the?

716
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:08,176
Are you really not going to do anything?

717
00:46:08,176 --> 00:46:13,146
Does that mean I could really do what I wanted to do?

718
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:22,726
Bite down.

719
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,676
 What's this? 

720
00:46:56,676 --> 00:46:58,396
 A GPS tracker. 

721
00:46:58,396 --> 00:47:02,886
 Just in case those people try to harm us, too? 

722
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,986
 They'll catch him soon, but 

723
00:47:04,986 --> 00:47:09,066
 I'm giving it to you, really just in case. 

724
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:10,616
 I see. 

725
00:47:10,616 --> 00:47:15,776
 Then if I have this with me, you'll know where I am and what I'm doing? 

726
00:47:15,776 --> 00:47:18,046
 No. Only where you're located. 

727
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,746
 This here... 

728
00:47:19,746 --> 00:47:23,376
 Press this. 

729
00:47:23,376 --> 00:47:26,276
 You can turn it on only when you're in dire need. 

730
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,816
What? Is she awake?

731
00:47:54,136 --> 00:47:56,146
What's that in your hand, ahjumma?

732
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:58,256
See? I told you we should've tied her up.

733
00:47:58,256 --> 00:48:00,736
S***! Ahjumma, let go.

734
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:03,236
Ahjumma, I said, let go.

735
00:48:03,236 --> 00:48:05,966
- This ahjumma is crazy. 
 - Let go.

736
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:16,956
If there's no CCTV, you should look through the black boxes and find her!

737
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:19,766
- We're also— 
 - This is kidnapping indeed.

738
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:21,586
Please do something quickly!

739
00:48:21,586 --> 00:48:24,476
- We're doing our best— 
 - Not just talk. Do something!

740
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:26,756
Gosh, seriously... 
    

741
00:48:26,756 --> 00:48:27,667
Hello?

742
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:30,126
 Why isn't Prosecutor picking up? 

743
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:33,096
 You know the GPS tracker? 

744
00:48:33,096 --> 00:48:34,933
 I guess you wouldn't know. 

745
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:38,536
The GPS tracker that Prosecutor gave your mother, just in case...

746
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:41,012
The signal on that just turned on!

747
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:42,256
 It's near Pyeongtaek Port. 

748
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,016
We're heading over there right now.

749
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:47,406
So tell the cops over there and join us there.

750
00:48:58,086 --> 00:49:00,946
CEO, please stop.

751
00:49:06,136 --> 00:49:08,416
Tell me now.

752
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,866
Where is Mother?

753
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,570
Jeong Ho.

754
00:49:21,546 --> 00:49:23,946
Sorry, let me hit you a little more.

755
00:49:35,966 --> 00:49:36,976
Why?

756
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:40,716
We found the tracker, but not your mother yet.

757
00:49:45,956 --> 00:49:48,186
We looked already.

758
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:51,746
- Yoo Ri! 
 - Mom!

759
00:49:51,746 --> 00:49:53,636
Mom!

760
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:56,556
Disperse! Look around!

761
00:49:56,556 --> 00:49:59,336
- Mom! 
  - Look! 

762
00:49:59,336 --> 00:50:00,926
Mom!

763
00:50:00,926 --> 00:50:03,476
Mom, where are you?

764
00:50:03,476 --> 00:50:05,546
Mom!

765
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:07,346
Mom...

766
00:50:09,646 --> 00:50:12,306
Ow, this hurts so badly...

767
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:17,136
Ow, you vicious a**hole...

768
00:50:17,136 --> 00:50:19,376
Geez, I'm so tired. Hey...

769
00:50:19,376 --> 00:50:21,846
I'm going to the restroom.

770
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:24,116
Be sure to watch him.

771
00:50:38,276 --> 00:50:42,036
So why did you come here without a plan?

772
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:55,926
To talk to you.

773
00:50:57,566 --> 00:50:59,716
Your daughter...

774
00:50:59,716 --> 00:51:01,606
Are you never going to see her again?

775
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:05,046
If you go to prison like this,

776
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:07,936
you'll never see your daughter ever again.

777
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:11,236
You must be doing this because

778
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:15,676
that a**hole Lee Pyeon Woong paid for your daughter's surgery while you were behind bars.

779
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:17,736
Why do you think your daughter got sick in the first place?

780
00:51:17,736 --> 00:51:21,026
Man, what the hell are you talking about now?

781
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:23,806
It's all because jerks like him.

782
00:51:23,806 --> 00:51:27,466
A**holes who f***ing ignore the law and rules.

783
00:51:27,466 --> 00:51:29,886
2016 Do 10294.

784
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:33,716
"Despite the fact that the product was meant to be sold for children,"

785
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:37,466
"the accident occurred because the most basic safety guidelines were not kept."

786
00:51:37,466 --> 00:51:42,136
"It is regrettable when considering children who were victims of this product."

787
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:46,586
That's what was written in your daughter's case ruling.

788
00:51:48,936 --> 00:51:50,736
The law?

789
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:53,446
It sucks. I know that.

790
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:56,816
But do you know what happens if that crumbles?

791
00:51:56,816 --> 00:51:58,946
The buildings crumble...

792
00:51:58,946 --> 00:52:01,526
ships sink...

793
00:52:01,526 --> 00:52:04,806
and kids like your daughter will be in pain.

794
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:09,106
You're picking up the slack for a**holes like them.

795
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:17,066
Please...

796
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:19,376
if you help me even now,

797
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:21,696
then before your daughter is all grown up,

798
00:52:21,696 --> 00:52:25,326
I'll help you, so you can see her.

799
00:52:26,986 --> 00:52:28,946
That person, too...

800
00:52:29,986 --> 00:52:33,666
is precious to someone just as your daughter is to you.

801
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:38,256
Please...

802
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,406
I beg you.

803
00:52:49,006 --> 00:52:51,066
Mom!

804
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:53,246
 Hurry up and spread out! 

805
00:52:53,246 --> 00:52:55,186
 Mom! 

806
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:58,826
 - To the left!  
 - Mom!

807
00:53:00,086 --> 00:53:02,536
Mom, where are you?

808
00:53:07,606 --> 00:53:10,516
   

809
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,156
What's this...

810
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:16,876
   

811
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:21,586
Attorney Kim!

812
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:23,266
Look at this!

813
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,046
Hurry, hurry!

814
00:53:58,646 --> 00:54:01,176
 Over here! 

815
00:54:01,856 --> 00:54:03,836
Mom! Mom!

816
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,316
Song Ok Ja!

817
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:06,986
Mother!

818
00:54:06,986 --> 00:54:08,366
Mom!

819
00:54:08,366 --> 00:54:09,606
 Look over there! 

820
00:54:09,606 --> 00:54:10,876
Mother!

821
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,996
Mom!

822
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,346
 Open it! 

823
00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:20,036
- Mom! 
 - Check it out!

824
00:54:20,656 --> 00:54:22,576
 Mother! 

825
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:25,456
 Mom! 

826
00:54:25,456 --> 00:54:27,456
 Mother! 

827
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:30,256
 Hurry up! 

828
00:54:30,256 --> 00:54:33,406
 Mom! Mom... 

829
00:54:37,836 --> 00:54:39,966
 Yoo Ri! 

830
00:54:39,966 --> 00:54:42,136
 Don't stop! 

831
00:54:42,736 --> 00:54:45,796
 The police are here! Come! Come in! 

832
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:49,326
Over here! Over here!

833
00:54:49,326 --> 00:54:51,626
 Over there! 

834
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:53,336
 - This way! Hurry! Hurry!  
 - We found her!

835
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:55,306
 Hurry, hurry! Found her! 

836
00:54:55,306 --> 00:54:57,386
 - Hurry, hurry!  
 - Mom!

837
00:54:57,386 --> 00:55:00,616
Mother! Mother!

838
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:02,966
Mom...

839
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,886
Mom! Mom!

840
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,166
Mom...

841
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:10,516
Mom, wake up...

842
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:13,826
- Here. 
 - Mom...

843
00:55:13,826 --> 00:55:16,536
Aigoo, thank God...

844
00:55:16,536 --> 00:55:21,550
Mom...

845
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,176
Mom...

846
00:55:23,176 --> 00:55:29,610
♫  It's okay even if you look ruffled  ♫

847
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:33,386
♫  This too shall pass  ♫

848
00:55:33,386 --> 00:55:35,906
Yoo Ri.

849
00:55:35,906 --> 00:55:38,266
Listen to me, and don't be shocked.

850
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:43,036
Lee Pyeon Woong has Jeong Ho.

851
00:55:43,036 --> 00:55:45,766
They're in a confrontation with the police.

852
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:48,386
They say Lee Pyeon Woong is asking for you.

853
00:56:00,686 --> 00:56:03,176
Don't come. Don't come, don't!

854
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:07,966
Attorney Kim!

855
00:56:07,966 --> 00:56:10,766
Attorney Kim! Come over here! Hurry!

856
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:12,306
Kim Yoo Ri...

857
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:15,196
Why did you come here? Hurry up and go!

858
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:23,146
Don't come! Don't! Or I'll stab him!

859
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:41,846
Attorney Kim...

860
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:44,746
How is your mom, Attorney Kim?

861
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:46,286
Is she okay?

862
00:56:46,286 --> 00:56:49,196
What is your reason for taking things this far?

863
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:52,646
Well, I-I've been thinking about it, too.

864
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:57,156
Why... Why do I want to torment Attorney Kim...

865
00:56:57,156 --> 00:57:00,696
To me, you're so mysterious.

866
00:57:00,696 --> 00:57:02,206
I just don't understand you.

867
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:05,356
The law has never been on your side.

868
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:08,686
But the fact that you're helping people using that law is just so...

869
00:57:08,686 --> 00:57:12,106
That's just so f***ing hypocritical!

870
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:12,946
Huh?

871
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:16,106
Does that make sense as a person?

872
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:22,746
So if I hurt people who are precious to you,

873
00:57:22,746 --> 00:57:25,636
I wonder if Attorney Kim would do things according to the law.

874
00:57:25,636 --> 00:57:26,936
I was so curious about that.

875
00:57:26,936 --> 00:57:30,946
So I was going to bring Jeong Ho and your mom

876
00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:34,386
and have you choose only one of the two, but that a**hole!

877
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:37,716
That s***! You traitor!

878
00:57:37,716 --> 00:57:42,276
That a**hole! I'm doomed because of that traitor!

879
00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:46,546
What should I do?

880
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,936
What should I do, so you will release him?

881
00:57:48,936 --> 00:57:50,966
Should I plead with you?

882
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:52,696
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

883
00:57:52,696 --> 00:57:54,906
Just do as usual.

884
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:57,656
Wh-What you had said to me earlier...

885
00:57:57,656 --> 00:57:59,976
You said I'm not even human.

886
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,950
Okay! Then!

887
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,955
Defend me.

888
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,046
I'll be your client, Attorney Kim.

889
00:58:10,046 --> 00:58:11,500
So, starting now,

890
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,867
believe what I say no matter what and pity me.

891
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:21,626
And using the law that you love so much, protect me.

892
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:24,236
I'll do it as long as you let go of Jeong Ho.

893
00:58:24,236 --> 00:58:27,026
I'll be your attorney starting now

894
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:29,926
and accompany you to the police station and to the courthouse.

895
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,966
Really?

896
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:34,896
You really will?

897
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,106
I'll do anything.

898
00:58:37,106 --> 00:58:38,996
Tell me anything.

899
00:58:45,016 --> 00:58:48,386
S***, why is it so easy?

900
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:51,546
What happens to the conviction that you've had all this time?

901
00:58:51,546 --> 00:58:55,136
Not losing any more people I love to you

902
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:57,796
is my law and conviction.

903
00:58:57,796 --> 00:58:59,956
So please let him go.

904
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:02,376
I'll defend you.

905
00:59:07,326 --> 00:59:09,896
You're doing this because you're afraid.

906
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:12,596
You're afraid you'd get blamed for everything.

907
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:17,126
I'll help you, so it won't be unfair to you.

908
00:59:17,126 --> 00:59:18,696
Okay?

909
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:34,866
Gosh, I almost fell for it. Whoa...

910
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:38,566
Attorney Kim, you're good at acting, too. S***...

911
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:40,866
Hey!

912
00:59:59,426 --> 01:00:02,046
Don't come! Don't!

913
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:17,826
Right. But still...

914
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:19,666
thanks to both of you...

915
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:21,926
I had some fun.

916
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:32,106
I know you led a f***ing crappy life, but

917
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:35,116
don't croak in front of me, you a**hole.

918
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:39,623
Hurry up!

919
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:42,386
Get him!

920
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:45,256
Kim Jeong Ho!

921
01:00:46,746 --> 01:00:48,466
Let go!

922
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:50,700
Hey...

923
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,911
Are you Jesus or something? Why defend that a**hole?

924
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:56,806
Hospital... Let's go to the hospital first.

925
01:00:56,806 --> 01:00:57,967
How is Mother?

926
01:00:57,967 --> 01:00:59,997
Is she okay?

927
01:01:02,336 --> 01:01:03,546
See?

928
01:01:03,546 --> 01:01:08,286
I told you I'd keep the promise I made to you.

929
01:01:08,286 --> 01:01:11,976
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

930
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:16,156
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

931
01:01:16,156 --> 01:01:18,796
Jeong Ho!

932
01:01:18,796 --> 01:01:20,576
Jeong Ho...

933
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:26,776
♫  When I think about you, the spring that resembles you  ♫

934
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:30,216
Jeong Ho...

935
01:01:30,216 --> 01:01:33,126
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

936
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:36,146
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

937
01:01:36,146 --> 01:01:39,216
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

938
01:01:39,216 --> 01:01:42,620
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

939
01:01:44,026 --> 01:01:50,896
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

940
01:01:50,896 --> 01:01:56,200
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

941
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:03,670
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

942
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:09,090
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫
