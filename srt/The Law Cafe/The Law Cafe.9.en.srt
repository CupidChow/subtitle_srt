An arrest warrant for Seoul Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seung Woon was rejected early this morning.

73
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:53,988
District Prosecutor Kim is suspected of being lenient toward the Dohan Group, owned by his wife's family–

Hey.

75

...he has avoided arrest for now.

76
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,308
The courts determined that while the criminal charges were justified,

77
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:04,028
it was difficult to prove the severity of the crime that he's accused of merits detention.

78
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:06,728
And since there was no way for him to destroy evidence or flee,

79
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:09,298
they decided to deny the arrest warrant.

80
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,798
Meanwhile, regarding the denial of an arrest warrant for District Prosecutor Kim,

81

A disciplinary committee? Why?

99
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,378
She supposedly violated the Lawyers Act.

I am deeply regretting my actions

128
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,338
regarding how I didn't officially register as an attorney

129
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,608
before providing a consultation to a client at the law firm, Law Cafe.

00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:17,690
I immediately applied to the Lawyers' Association afterward and completed the registration.

00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,218
The contents of what the client came asking about was

132

something that I, and our employee, a student at the Law School at Hankuk University,

133
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:29,568
were fully capable of providing consultation for with our legal knowledge.

134
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:33,628
This consultation did not even lead to legal representation on our part,

135
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:36,518
nor were there any incentives received,

136
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,918
nor were there any resulting changes to the employment structure.

137
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,018
Well, enough of that.

138
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,998
We conclude that Attorney Kim Yoo Ri's disciplinary action will be

139
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:48,558
limited to a reprimand.

Let's adjourn this meeting.

141
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:24,218
Why would you make something that should end with a reprimand go almost to a suspension?

142
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:27,908
Did you decide to pretend that nothing happened?

143
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,468
The only thing that I can do right now...

144
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,168
- is that.
- Don't.

145
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,928
It makes me even angrier.

146

Even just now, in case you mistakenly think you've helped me, I'm telling you now.

The time has come for them to hear things they don't want to hear.

150

I still can't understand.

151
00:09:55,358 --> 00:10:00,018
How could you hide something like that

152
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:01,878

154

For me,

155
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:11,768
every time you pushed me away,

156
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:14,678
I only thought about

157
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:17,388
what I might have done wrong this time.

158
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:20,398

00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:26,548
it's like you've been committing fraud against me for 17 years.

161
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,418
I'm willing to receive

162
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:34,328
- any kind of punishment.
- You should wait then.

163
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:36,978
I don't even have the heart to punish you right now.

164
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:47,200
♫ I think my troubled heart still isn't dry ♫

167
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:20,468
Oh! You scared me!

168
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:23,408
The landlord's usually always sticking around here.

169
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:25,188
- But I don't see him today.
- Shh!

170
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:27,338
It's now forbidden to say Hyungnim's name here.

171
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,458
The taboo words are:

172
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,888
"Seong Woon," "rich family," "prosecutor," "Chief Prosecuotor," "Kim Jeong Ho," "Jeong—

173
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:36,508
It's especially bad if you even mention Hyungnim's name,

174
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:39,128
so you have to be even more careful about that.

175
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,728
Unnis, what brings you here?

176
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:56,098
Attorney lady!

177
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:58,858
Please save us!

178
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,928
Save us!

179
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:14,778
So what you're saying is...

180
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:17,808
You invested in cryptocurrency with the informal savings club's money,

181
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:21,538
- but you're about to lose all of that money.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:26,188
And that informal savings club was formed together with Dr. Woo Jin on the second floor...

183
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:29,368
and with Kim Jeong Ho.

184
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:30,378
Yeah...

185
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:33,698
The landlord said that he would help us save a lump sum of money,

186
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:35,988
so that's why we decided to do it, but...

187
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,548
But how could you use that money for your personal investments?

188
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:44,178
This is all because of... that woman from Hello Hair Salon.

Hello Hair Salon?

00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:48,308
So Hyungnim and I...

191
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:51,968
how could we have even known what cryptocurrency is and invested in it?

192
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:55,118
That woman kept telling us while doing our perm,

193
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:57,968
"Nowadays, you would be a fool to not do something like this"

194
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:00,788
"All the young people make a lot of money doing this."

195
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:03,798
She kept on enticing us like that.

196
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:07,428
At first, we were each putting in only 6 million won.

197
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:11,258
But the profits were like a million or so won for about two months.

198
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,518
So what then?

199
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,788
We invested just a bit more...

200
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:18,538
So exactly how much of it did you put in?

201
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,598
5 million...?

202
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:35,118
- 50 million!
- 50 million?

203
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,018
But this...

204
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,368
The landlord must not know about this!

205
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:44,198
If he finds out, we're in big trouble!

206
00:13:56,998 --> 00:14:01,098
Hyungnim, why do you look so cool even when you look like you're in anguish?

207
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,718
Is it because I know that you're from a rich family?

208
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,868
Even your clothes look different.

209

- It's stunning—
- Stop speaking nonsense.

210
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:13,898
I grew up without any ties to that family.

211
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:17,338
S-S-So then, how did you buy this building then?

212
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,868
You said your parents didn't help you, either.

213
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:26,248
It was out on the auction,

214
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,498
- and it required a lot of loans.
- Nah...

215
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:30,838
But it still wouldn't have been cheap.

If I can't make it work with a prosecutor's salary,

218
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:38,308
and it's not money I inherited from my parents, what could it be?

- I like you, Hyung.

223
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:52,538
At this rate, we might end up losing all the money we put in.

224
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:53,938
Speaking of which,

225
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:58,148
in the beginning, she explained to us how we could check the profits.

226
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:02,528
Those profits are received in this "coin wallet."

227
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,398
So with regards to how we could turn this into cash,

228
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,268
she's left that part out and didn't explain it to us.

229
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:12,138
I mean, how can someone leave out such an important part?

00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:14,008
Yeah.

231
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,488
Such an important part...

232
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:20,818
Deception by omission.

233
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:24,638
Deceiving another person by not sharing an important piece of information,

234
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:27,578
by not sharing an important piece of information,

235
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,198

00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:35,198
Tell me.

But they're all sitting under the profit margin.

Yeah...

And it seems you've had to spend a lot of money.

Your car got wrecked last time, so you bought a new one!

That's true.

301
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,548
So you run a business.

302
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:23,268
- But your business is not doing so well these days, right?
- Yes.

303
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:25,418
Our customer reviews recently have been pretty bad,

saying that they leave after waiting without having received a consultation.

305
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:30,108
How many business owners nowadays are actually doing well these days...

306
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,758
And you have an issue with your health as well.

307
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,868
Your chest feels tight, and it feels like you can't breathe properly.

308
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:38,168
Wow, seriously. Daebak.

309

My goodness, you're really amazing.

310
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:43,498
- Boss, you have a panic disorder.
- Yeah, that's true.

311
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,918
All of that is because of him.

312
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,368
You know that, too, right?

313
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:51,268
That guy you think you know, but then you don't.

So I...don't believe in anything like shamanism.

But this guy was definitely different.

Let's see...

00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,958
I keep seeing two guys.

318
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,868
But there's only one guy in my case.

No, there are two guys.

00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:27,238
Two guys... are fighting over you. It's a mess.

321
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:29,188
Daebak.

322
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:32,038
But it seems like you should avoid both of them.

323
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:33,378
Do I really need to do that?

324
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:35,538
One of those two guys could be okay, though.

325
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,798
Both of them are not good for you...

326
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:41,108
but one of them is especially not good.

327
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:44,688
Geez! Geez! Geez!

328
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:47,248
I see blood.

329
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:49,328
With that guy, you're going to see blood!

330
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,468
What about the other guy?

331
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:56,548
Tears.

332
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,818
The Chairman is asking for you.

333
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:47,258
Has it been 20 years since you've seen your grandfather's face?

334
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,518
Follow me.

335
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:13,238
I heard that... what happened recently involving your father was your doing.

336
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,288
Seeing how you don't have any grit, greed, or ambition,

337
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:20,058
I wondered whom you took after.

338
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,948
"Great Good, Destroy Relative."

339
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:25,488
Seeing how you're willing to part ways with your parents for the greater good,

340
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:28,168
you are definitely Kim Seung Woon's son.

341
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:30,268
It's not for such a grand reason.

342
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:33,478
Then? Is it because of that attorney girl?

343
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:41,402
You thought I didn't care this much about what my grandchildren were doing?

344
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,182
So stop with all this.

345
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:48,792
Now that you've had your fill of fun, join Dohan Group.

346
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,052
What do you mean by that?

347
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:53,372
If you have the wits to destroy someone, you must also have the wits to fix them.

348
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:58,822
- Come inside Dohan Group and cut out what's corrupt and fix what needs to be fixed.
- I will refuse.

349
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:00,842
If you want to gain something,

350
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:03,412
you must also let go of something.

351
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:07,852
Do you know how much you cost me this time?

352
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:12,722
Since you're the one who caused the harm, so you need to be the one to fix it.

353
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,102
Why... why, why!

354
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:22,432
He has a perfectly fine son next to him!

355
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,272
Why! Why...

356
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:28,182
is he trying to make his son-in-law's son his own as well?

357
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:36,312
He should have come to his senses after one of his sons died.

358
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:51,882
That old man won't come to his senses until the day he dies.

359
00:23:57,692 --> 00:23:59,482
What's wrong?

360
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,632
I'll drive you there.

361
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,280
[Talisman]

362
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,322
Hello.

363
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:32,062
What... brings you here?

364
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:36,902
Oh... I wanted to get a consultation from Attorney Kim.

365
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:38,502
I thought it would be fun.

366
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:41,942
Please stop coming here before you get a complaint for stalking.

367
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:47,072
If I ever get a complaint from you, Attorney Kim,

368
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:51,742
it wouldn't be for anything trivial like that.

369
00:24:54,212 --> 00:24:56,182
Attorney Kim.

370
00:24:56,182 --> 00:25:00,192
Do you want to hear the story of my mom?

371
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:02,962
Please leave while I tell you nicely.

372
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:09,112
You see, I...

373
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,892
Today, I...

374
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:15,782
I had something happen to me that made me really angry.

375
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,602
I really thought about causing some major trouble.

376
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:22,492
But I thought maybe I'll feel a bit better if I see your face,

377
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:25,192
so that's why I came.

378
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:30,602
But if you blatantly treat me like a monster, I feel really upset.

379
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:34,922
What are you doing? I'm talking to you right now, and you're on the phone...

380
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:38,142
Like this? Like this?

381
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,222
You're going to be like this?

382
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:44,622
You see. You see! You see! If someone is talking to you honestly and sincerely about something,

383
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,572
You should be listening to them. But instead, you're calling the police!

384
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:51,102
Then... Hey! What did I do for you to call the police?

385
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:53,112
What did I do? Huh!

386
00:25:53,112 --> 00:25:54,382
What did I do!

387
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,672
Stop making a fuss here because you're in a bad mood, and leave.

388
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,992
This is not a trash receptacle for your emotions!

389
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,702
Oh, it's almost here.

390
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,972
Here. The look in your eyes that I like.

391
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:04,932
Yeah?

392
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:07,092
This. God, this here!

393
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,232
Refusing to yield, not knowing your place...

394
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:11,572
Yes, this look in your eyes!

395
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,882
I really like this look.

396
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:17,822
Like it makes me want to show you your place.

397
00:26:17,822 --> 00:26:21,512
How would this look in your eyes change once you know your place...

398
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:23,332
Just thinking about it makes me feel so good!

399
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,402
It makes me so happy!

400
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:27,392
You are free to imagine what you want,

401
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:30,332
but there's no chance I will be clinging to you, begging.

402
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:32,722
We'll just have to watch and see about that.

403
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,402
Shall we see about that?

404
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:36,212
Shall we see about that right now?

405
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,202
Shall we?

406
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:49,342
You! You!

407
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:51,792
Come over here! Come here!

408
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:52,952
Come here!

409
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:54,362
Let go!

410
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,402
Man, that hurts.

411
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:58,582
Oh, my teeth! My teeth...

412
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:02,442
I'm bleeding... I'm bleeding!

413
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:07,092
You. Do that to me one more time.

414
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,372
Do it again.

415
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:12,272
Make it a double nosebleed. Do it, do it!

416
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:15,432
You crazy bastard.

417
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,552
Hey, who is this!

418
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:23,672
- You son of a b****!
- Why did you come now? I was waiting.

419
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:26,452
She was like hitting me and punching me.

420
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:27,752
It hurts so much here.

421
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:30,902
- Jeong Ho. Hey, Jeong Ho!
- Come out. Come out!

422
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:32,242
Yes, the cafe here!

423
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:33,602
Please, Ahjussi! Come quickly!

424
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:37,132
The two are fighting right now! Quickly, quickly!

425
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:40,002
Wake up, you son of a b****! This bastard!

426
00:27:40,002 --> 00:27:41,912
You!

427
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:51,022
You crazy son of a b****

428
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,162
No, there are two guys.

429
00:27:53,162 --> 00:27:57,962
Two guys... are fighting over you.

430
00:27:57,962 --> 00:28:00,392
How dare you!

431
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:03,522
- Ow! That hurts!
- D*** you!

432
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:08,522
I'm telling you, I got hit. She headbutted me, and he slapped me across my cheeks.

433
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,712
You b****!

434
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,802
- Please stop!
- She headbutted me and...

435
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,782
I gave my report as a witness

436
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:18,832
so everything's finished, right?

437
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,852
But somehow, we keep having to come to this place.

438
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:23,032
You b****! Hey, you b****!

439
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:25,472
- You!
- God, this guy...

440
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,922
You guys can arrest them or whatever you want with those two.

441
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:30,402
Please stop this!

442
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:32,352
She headbutted me and...

443
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,962
he slapped me across my cheeks. It hurts so much.

444
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,402
Geez...

445
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,822
I'm sorry.

446
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:02,192
God, I was going to make sure that trash son of a b****

447
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:04,522
never steps foot in here ever again, but...

448
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:06,972
Whether that bastard comes here again or not, that's my business.

449
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:08,802
It's none of your business.

450
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:16,452
Your business... is my business. You know that.

451
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:17,832
Kim Jeong Ho, I'm speechless.

452
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,022
You're acting like we're close now?

453
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,702
You should leave now. I have nothing more to say to you.

454
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,952
You don't want to?

455
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:30,712
Then I'll leave.

456
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:36,892
Please.

457
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,052
Please listen to what I've got to say.

458
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:51,912
I know.

459
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:55,132
You were probably too scared to tell me.

460
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:58,942
And later, you probably couldn't tell me because you feared that I'd get hurt.

461
00:29:58,942 --> 00:30:01,852
And you avoided me because you felt sorry.

462
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:10,792
♫ The thought that you will disappear when I open my eyes ♫

463
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,132
There's something that you don't know.

464
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:14,872
There's more that I don't know about?

465
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:17,092
What else is there that I don't know about?

466
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,562
That...

467
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:24,332
♫ If you are going to leave me ♫

468
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:26,392
I love you.

469
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:30,082
♫ Please don't cry any more ♫

470
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:32,342
Because I thought I wouldn't be able to see you...

471
00:30:34,882 --> 00:30:37,482
Because I was afraid I would never be able to see you forever...

472
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:41,382
I couldn't do anything.

473
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:44,672
Even though it was cowardly of me...

474
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:47,572
I wanted to be able to see you like that.

475
00:30:47,572 --> 00:30:52,482
♫ Don't slowly fade away ♫

476
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,152
I'm sorry...

477
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,752
for loving you

478
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,612
even though I have no right to.

479
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:18,332
♫ I need you to comfort me now ♫

480
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:22,570

You can't let him know it's your first time!

Ms. Kim, move your purse a little bit.

649
00:42:56,478 --> 00:42:58,688
A little to the right.

650
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:01,238
Geez, it's left.

651
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:04,198
I said I'd do it. Geez...

652

Move the purse to the left.

Geez, you keep assuming things. It must be a habit.

I'm not just assuming.

I've done some work in reading people, too.

The stake is a little higher here. Are you okay with that?

Gosh, no problem.

One cream, one sugar for me.

All right, then shall we begin?

I guess you can't really see your own bank account?

701

You can't seem to read what's right in front of you.

702

It's not that I can't see it.

703

It's just the greed blinding me.

That's right. That greed.

Why don't you just let go of your greed?

Let's raise the wager one more time.

Aigoo, we're going to stay up all night at this rate.

Shall we increase the wager one more time?

720

Okay! How about one bill per point, then?

What the?

751

You didn't notice anything all along, even though I was cheating to your face.

752

After stabbing him in the back like that?

766
00:50:27,718 --> 00:50:30,778
Stop spouting nonsense and apologize.

767
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,648
Apologize for taking advantage of people's desperation and say this.

but the liar who betrayed their trust.

So, they don't need to blame themselves at all.

771

Say that.

772

- Hello?
- Hey.

814
00:53:33,048 --> 00:53:34,988
- It's me.
- Dr. Park is buying.

815
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:36,708
I have tons of work because of this case.

816
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:39,438
- No, no, come with us!
- No, please...

817
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:40,968
Come after you finish then.

818
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,058
- I have too much work.
- Please...

819
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:45,508
You recognize my voice, right?

820
00:53:46,778 --> 00:53:47,878
So what the hell are you up to?

821
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:49,658
Well, it's nothing much.

822
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:51,868
I've been summoned to the Prosecutors' Office.

823
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:53,378
Why?

824
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:56,438
- Are you angry about that?
- Oh, no.

825
00:53:56,438 --> 00:54:00,928
I thought my nephew's effort to unveil the family's errors was so commendable.

826
00:54:00,928 --> 00:54:05,158
I wanted to tell you that I confessed to everything.

827
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,208
Gosh, I'm feeling all kinds of emotions right now.

828
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:10,188
Stabbing the father with a dagger that he put in my hands.

829
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:13,588
Is this how it feels?

830
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,938
What the hell are you spewing?

831
00:54:15,938 --> 00:54:17,078
What the hell?

832
00:54:17,078 --> 00:54:19,368
You really had no idea?

833
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:25,118
Hey, the evidence that you were seeking for so long appeared right in front of your eyes.

834
00:54:25,118 --> 00:54:27,238
How do you think that happened?

835
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:28,918
Gosh, seriously...

836

How much does he have to love his son

that he can just let go of the honor that is his life?

838
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:39,268
I would never get to find out how that feels.

839
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:42,088
Jeong Ho— That rude bastard! How dare he hangs up on me!

840
00:54:42,088 --> 00:54:44,588
He should hear me out to the end.

841
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:49,188
Gosh. Good.

842
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,368
It has to be at least like that to be good.

843
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:16,158
Here you go.

844
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:18,628
It's the evidence you mentioned.

845
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:21,208
Are you really going to be okay with this?

846
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:32,058
Yes, the Chief Prosecutor did give it to me in person.

847
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:38,198
He said he knew it would be revealed someday so he had kept it in his possession.

848
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:42,148
Please say a word!

849
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:43,898
Please make a statement!

Yes.

852
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:51,318
For the fire incident at the Dohan distribution warehouse in 2006,

853
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:56,018
Dohan Group put pressure on the prosecutor in charge at the time,

854
00:55:56,018 --> 00:56:00,238
Kim Seung Woon, in order to leave out the evidence.

855
00:56:00,238 --> 00:56:01,798
Only recently,

856
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:05,298
I learned of the connection between my father

857
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:08,768
Chairman Lee Byung Ok and my brother-in-law Chief Prosecutor Kim Seung Woon

858
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:11,528
back in 2006. And after—

859
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:19,328
And after finding this out,

860
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:22,438
I gave it a lot of thought, losing sleep

861
00:56:22,438 --> 00:56:26,038
and made a tough decision to reveal it to the world.

862
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:29,268
Are you saying you're the whistle-blower himself, CEO Lee?

863
00:56:29,268 --> 00:56:30,478
Yes! That's right!

864
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:32,058
On behalf of my father,

865

and the Dohan Group,

867
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,818
I, Lee Pyun Woong,

868
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:42,748
will apologize to you all.

869
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,478
What are you doing?

870
00:56:57,478 --> 00:56:59,368
What are you saying barging in here like that?

871
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:03,648
Are you playing with people or something? What are you doing?

872
00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:07,178
Looks like that Director Jeong has a big mouth.

873
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:09,658
Didn't you say it yourself?

874
00:57:09,658 --> 00:57:12,888
That the chief prosecutor position doesn't suit me.

875
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:17,388
I took the position, knowing full well that I'd step down someday.

876
00:57:17,388 --> 00:57:20,288
Then, you shouldn't have taken the position to begin with.

877
00:57:20,288 --> 00:57:22,338
How could you...

878
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,118
How could you do this to me?

879
00:57:25,118 --> 00:57:27,508
It was an age-old agreement with Chairman Lee.

880
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:32,568
When the time was right, I thought I'd be paying for the crime.

881
00:57:32,568 --> 00:57:34,258
But I guess I'm just a man, after all.

882
00:57:34,258 --> 00:57:36,708
I kept forgetting about it and delaying it.

883
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:39,088
It all worked out now.

884
00:57:41,088 --> 00:57:43,938
You just did what you had to do.

885
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:46,058
And you had the courage to do so.

886
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:50,038
That's not it. You just used me, so you could feel at ease.

887
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:56,158
I guess this is it.

888
00:57:58,938 --> 00:58:01,168
Now I know.

889
00:58:02,138 --> 00:58:05,858
How it feels to be betrayed by someone you trusted.

890
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,608
This totally makes you feel like a fool.
