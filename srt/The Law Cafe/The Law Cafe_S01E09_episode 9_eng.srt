1
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:33,334
   

2
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:38,064
I wanted to tell you after I took care of it first.

3
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:41,364
- But it's too late. 
 - Yes, it's too late.

4
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:47,964
That's why I decided to run to you without

5
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:51,364
wasting a moment from now on.

6
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:55,594
What am I to do, Kim Jeong Ho?

7
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:58,914
I'm starting to hate you, as you said.

8
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:03,784
♫  I'm lost in thought of the expression you couldn't hide  ♫

9
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:07,014
You can hate me.

10
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:08,804
You can run away.

11
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:11,224
You can step back or push me away.

12
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:14,454
♫  On an empty street  ♫

13
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:18,954
So please...  
 ♫  I think my troubled heart  ♫

14
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,254
don't leave me. 
 ♫  still c dry  ♫

15
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:26,424
♫  still isn't dry  ♫

16
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:33,014
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

17
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:37,564
How long have you known this? 
 ♫  Like the snow piled up at the end of dawn  ♫

18
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,084
Tell me.

19
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:42,314
Did you know it from the beginning? Did you?

20
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:46,104
♫  If I can see in your heart  ♫

21
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:48,254
Then what was I to you?

22
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:51,464
♫  If I could  ♫

23
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:54,660
♫  If I could  ♫

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,260
♫   that would be great  ♫

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,950


26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,100
 When Yoo Ri was 18 

27
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,744
 I mean, Ma'am, when the criminal court decision came out like this, there's no point in going to civil court. 

28
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:35,244
 You'd be lucky if they don't sue you for damages. 

29
00:02:35,244 --> 00:02:39,574
 It would be difficult for you to find a lawyer to take a case like yours, no matter where you go. 

30
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,404
 Have a nice day. 

31
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:45,524
 Mom, what's all that? 
   

32
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:49,224
 Those so-called lawyers are refusing to draft a complaint or whatever for me. 

33
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:52,064
 What can I do?  I will draft i myself? 

34
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,454
 But my goodness, 

35
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,424
 why is the terminology so difficult? 

36
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:58,094
 I swear, those lawyers are so foul and cheap 

37
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,904
 so I'm going to study this myself. 

38
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:05,034
 What, you think Mommy can't do it? 

39
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:09,598
 Let's see, they marked the section for it... 

40
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:22,868
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri. Get up and eat.

41
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:25,818
Come on, my baby.

42
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,950
Let's eat!

43
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,388
Oh, you want to go to Daddy?

44
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:33,688
You want to stand, right?

45
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:34,958
Okay, come to Daddy!

46
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,268
Let's go to Daddy.

47
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,658
Thanks for the food!

48
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:49,778
This is good.

49
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,268
Your mother made that.

50
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:55,478
Thank her for me. The leaf mustard kimchi really fermented well.

51
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:58,488
Why is my mom's side dish at your house?

52
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,958
Why are you saying that, as if it's anything new?

53
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,188
Especially to me, who ate your mom's kimchi all my life.

54
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:03,168
Right, baby?

55
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,178
She doesn't even send me stuff like this anymore...

56
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,788
Why does she only send them to you guys?

57
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:11,068
That's because... you don't eat them and end up throwing them away.

58
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,438
Are you crying right now?

59
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:15,798
Leave her. Just let her be.

60
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,798
She can't say that she's crying because of Kim Jeong Ho

61
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,468
so she's looking for an excuse to cry.

62
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,978
No, it's not that!

63
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:23,768
I got upset because of my mom!

64
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:25,308
Oh, was that so?

65
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,278
Oh! No, no, it's okay! Don't cry!

66
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:30,348
It's okay, it's okay! He just fell asleep, and you woke him up!

67
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,598
Oh, oh. Auntie woke you up, did she?

68
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,938
You woke him up, so you watch him. Okay, hold him here.

69
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:36,858
Please, stop crying.

70
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:38,658
It's nice to see you.

71
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:43,718
I'm sorry your Auntie is pathetic...

72
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:46,858
I think he's feeling uncomfortable.

73
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:50,838
 An arrest warrant for Seoul Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seung Woon was rejected early this morning. 

74
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:53,988
 District Prosecutor Kim is suspected of being lenient toward the Dohan Group, owned by his wife's family– 

75
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,608
Hey.

76
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:58,258
 ...he has avoided arrest for now. 

77
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,308
 The courts determined that while the criminal charges were justified, 

78
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:04,028
 it was difficult to prove the severity of the crime that he's accused of merits detention. 

79
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:06,728
 And since there was no way for him to destroy evidence or flee, 

80
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:09,298
 they decided to deny the arrest warrant. 

81
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,798
 Meanwhile, regarding the denial of an arrest warrant for District Prosecutor Kim, 

82
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,568
 some say that this was to be expected– 

83
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,188
Oh, he's out!

84
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:17,998
Chief Prosecutor!

85
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:21,068
The prosecution announced that they will serve a warrant for investigation without detention.

86
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:24,698
What are your thoughts on the controversy involving a prosecutor favoring his relatives?

87
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:27,608
Is it true that you also had a hand in the illegal merger of Dohan Bio?

88
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:28,978
Do you admit to being involved?

89
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,478
 - Did you— 
 - Please give us a reply. 

90
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,578
 How do you feel regarding this case? 

91
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,718
- What are you doing? 
 - Getting ready for work.

92
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,848
Man, it's really busy raising a baby while also working.

93
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,328
You have to take care of yourself when you get the time.

94
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:53,898
I'm going to borrow this.

95
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,708
Okay. Looks good on you.

96
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,568
Kim Yoo Ri's fashion is low-key for once.

97
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,168
She has to go to a disciplinary committee or something like that.

98
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,458
Imagine going there wearing the loud outfits she usually wears. That would stir up a commotion.

99
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,148
A disciplinary committee? Why?

100
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,378
She supposedly violated the Lawyers Act.

101
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:09,568
You violated the Lawyers Act?

102
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,918
They're just nitpicking.

103
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,668
Although I have an idea about who's behind this mischief...

104
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,608
I don't have concrete evidence to prove it.

105
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,570
   

106
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,570
 Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Association 

107
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:26,918
It's not like he gave consultations without legal knowledge,

108
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,708
nor did he receive any consultation fees—

109
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:32,728
It's the current law that anyone who is not an attorney cannot provide any legal counseling.

110
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:34,958
Although you said he didn't receive any consultation fees,

111
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,098
the clients who received consultations would've drank coffee whether it was a lawyer's office or cafe.

112
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,398
and your part-timer is getting paid.

113
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,758
What age are we living in right now...

114
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:45,318
Don't you think that perhaps the law is wrong?

115
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:46,798
Please tell me how someone with legal knowledge

116
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:50,438
listening to the legal problems of the customers of their cafe is a problem?

117
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:53,038
If this is a problem, then that law is what's wrong.

118
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,488
Attorney!

119
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:57,898
We're not here to debate the law,

120
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:01,908
but rather to give you a chance to explain yourself before imposing disciplinary action.

121
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:04,428
That's why I am explaining myself.

122
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:06,148
The world is changing,

123
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:09,038
so if there are laws that need to change, then they need to be debated and changed.

124
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:32,138
- Son of the Chief Prosecutor ... 
 - Kim Seung Woon...

125
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,228
The person who violated the Lawyers Act was me.

126
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:41,078
I'm sorry I'm late.

127
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:04,948
First, on June 2nd, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.,

128
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:08,098
I am deeply regretting my actions

129
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,338
regarding how I didn't officially register as an attorney

130
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,608
before providing a consultation to a client at the law firm, Law Cafe.

131
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:17,690
I immediately applied to the Lawyers' Association afterward and completed the registration.

132
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,218
The contents of what the client came asking about was

133
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:24,908
something that I, and our employee, a student at the Law School at Hankuk University,

134
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:29,568
were fully capable of providing consultation for with our legal knowledge.

135
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:33,628
This consultation did not even lead to legal representation on our part,

136
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:36,518
nor were there any incentives received,

137
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,918
nor were there any resulting changes to the employment structure.

138
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,018
Well, enough of that.

139
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,998
We conclude that Attorney Kim Yoo Ri's disciplinary action will be

140
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:48,558
limited to a reprimand.

141
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,268
Let's adjourn this meeting.

142
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:24,218
Why would you make something that should end with a reprimand go almost to a suspension?

143
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:27,908
Did you decide to pretend that nothing happened?

144
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,468
The only thing that I can do right now...

145
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,168
- is that. 
 - Don't.

146
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,928
It makes me even angrier.

147
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:38,118
Even just now, in case you mistakenly think you've helped me, I'm telling you now.

148
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:40,098
You were actually interfering.

149
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:42,758
The time for them to shut their ears and pretend like everything's all right has passed.

150
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:45,638
The time has come for them to hear things they don't want to hear.

151
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:54,138
I still can't understand.

152
00:09:55,358 --> 00:10:00,018
How could you hide something like that

153
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:01,878
when you've seen how much we've struggled

154
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:05,038
going around trying to find an attorney.

155
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,818
For me,

156
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:11,768
every time you pushed me away,

157
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:14,678
I only thought about

158
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:17,388
what I might have done wrong this time.

159
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:20,398
Not knowing anything, I thought it was all my fault.

160
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:23,598
So, Kim Jeong Ho,

161
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:26,548
it's like you've been committing fraud against me for 17 years.

162
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,418
I'm willing to receive

163
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:34,328
- any kind of punishment. 
 - You should wait then.

164
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:36,978
I don't even have the heart to punish you right now.

165
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:47,200
♫  I think my troubled heart still isn't dry  ♫

166
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:52,798
   

167
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:57,488
   

168
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:20,468
Oh! You scared me!

169
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:23,408
The landlord's usually always sticking around here.

170
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:25,188
- But I don't see him today. 
 - Shh!

171
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:27,338
It's now forbidden to say Hyungnim's name here.

172
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,458
The taboo words are:

173
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,888
"Seong Woon," "rich family," "prosecutor," "Chief Prosecuotor," "Kim Jeong Ho," "Jeong—

174
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:36,508
It's especially bad if you even mention Hyungnim's name,

175
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:39,128
so you have to be even more careful about that.

176
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,728
Unnis, what brings you here?

177
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:56,098
Attorney lady!

178
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:58,858
Please save us!

179
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,928
Save us!

180
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:14,778
So what you're saying is...

181
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:17,808
You invested in cryptocurrency with the informal savings club's money,

182
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:21,538
- but you're about to lose all of that money. 
 - Yeah.

183
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:26,188
And that informal savings club was formed together with Dr. Woo Jin on the second floor...

184
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:29,368
and with Kim Jeong Ho.

185
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:30,378
Yeah...

186
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:33,698
The landlord said that he would help us save a lump sum of money,

187
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:35,988
so that's why we decided to do it, but...

188
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,548
But how could you use that money for your personal investments?

189
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:44,178
This is all because of... that woman from Hello Hair Salon.

190
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:45,428
Hello Hair Salon?

191
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:48,308
So Hyungnim and I...

192
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:51,968
how could we have even known what cryptocurrency is and invested in it?

193
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:55,118
That woman kept telling us while doing our perm,

194
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:57,968
"Nowadays, you would be a fool to not do something like this"

195
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:00,788
"All the young people make a lot of money doing this."

196
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:03,798
She kept on enticing us like that.

197
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:07,428
At first, we were each putting in only 6 million won.

198
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:11,258
But the profits were like a million or so won for about two months.

199
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,518
So what then?

200
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,788
We invested just a bit more...

201
00:13:15,788 --> 00:13:18,538
So exactly how much of it did you put in?

202
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,598
5 million...?

203
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:35,118
- 50 million! 
 - 50 million?

204
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,018
But this...

205
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,368
The landlord must not know about this!

206
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:44,198
If he finds out, we're in big trouble!

207
00:13:56,998 --> 00:14:01,098
Hyungnim, why do you look so cool even when you look like you're in anguish?

208
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,718
Is it because I know that you're from a rich family?

209
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,868
Even your clothes look different.

210
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:10,668
- It's stunning— 
 - Stop speaking nonsense.

211
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:13,898
I grew up without any ties to that family.

212
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:17,338
S-S-So then, how did you buy this building then?

213
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,868
You said your parents didn't help you, either.

214
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:26,248
It was out on the auction,

215
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,498
- and it required a lot of loans. 
 - Nah...

216
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:30,838
But it still wouldn't have been cheap.

217
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,388
Hey, Honeybee!

218
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,398
If I can't make it work with a prosecutor's salary,

219
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:38,308
and it's not money I inherited from my parents, what could it be?

220
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:40,728
Answer!

221
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:41,868
Stocks?

222
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:44,938
Or... Cryptocurrency?

223
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:48,278
- Aren't you going to leave? 
 - I like you, Hyung.

224
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:52,538
At this rate, we might end up losing all the money we put in.

225
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:53,938
Speaking of which,

226
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:58,148
in the beginning, she explained to us how we could check the profits.

227
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:02,528
Those profits are received in this "coin wallet."

228
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,398
So with regards to how we could turn this into cash,

229
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:08,268
she's left that part out and didn't explain it to us.

230
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:12,138
I mean, how can someone leave out such an important part?

231
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:14,008
Yeah.

232
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,488
Such an important part...

233
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:20,818
Deception by omission.

234
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:24,638
Deceiving another person by not sharing an important piece of information,

235
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:27,578
by not sharing an important piece of information,

236
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,198
can also be considered fraud.

237
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:33,068
 How long have you known this? 

238
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:35,198
 Tell me. 

239
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,198
 Did you know from the start? Did you? 

240
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:48,908
But... this is not the end of the story.

241
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,698
What! There's more?

242
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,198
So...

243
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:59,668
It's so annoying!

244
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,758
   

245
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:05,488
Take a look at this!

246
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:07,008
Here, take a look at this!

247
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,878
Do you know how much profit I helped them to make all this time?

248
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:11,858
I gathered all the hair that's been pulled out

249
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:14,058
so I can submit it for evidence of assault!

250
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:17,068
Take a look at it! Look at it!

251
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:20,108
- You must have been really frightened... 
 - Of course!

252
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,298
Someone just comes barging in, calling me a con artist and yanking my hair.

253
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,228
As the hair salon owner, I would be frightened!

254
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:26,738
Of course. God, it would be natural to be frightened.

255
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:28,768
Why is your hair so damaged? You must not be taking care of it.

256
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,728
Take a seat. I'll give you a hair treatment pack.

257
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,088
- It's okay. 
 - Just do it, since you're already here.

258
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,518
I can't let it go after having seen it.

259
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:36,528
I told them that it's going to keep rising.

260
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,568
I told them to just trust it and wait.

261
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,418
But they just couldn't be patient

262
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:44,288
and making such a commotion about having pulled out!

263
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:45,518
Do you invest at all?

264
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:48,358
I invested in several places last year when everyone was doing it.

265
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:51,258
But they're all sitting under the profit margin.

266
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:53,208
That's because you're supposed to do some research before you invest,

267
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,328
but you just invested wherever.

268
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:01,008
Look at this.

269
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:05,828
My Pan-S has been growing steadily like this from its start.

270
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:08,308
How are you so sure that it will continue to grow steadily?

271
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,418
Shh.

272
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,548
There's someone who teaches me.

273
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:16,018
There's someone who teaches you about stocks?

274
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,678
His expertise is in stocks and cryptocurrency.

275
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:21,318
But even besides that,

276
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,108
he's really on-point. Every time I go, I get chills.

277
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:30,468
It's not...

278
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:40,958
Thank you, Sir.

279
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,128
Wow, he's really accurate.

280
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,878
Supposedly, he's ridiculous.

281
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,898
Wow, there are lots of people here.

282
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:57,478
 Anything which rises and falls... 

283
00:17:57,478 --> 00:18:00,400
 Waves, flows, stocks, crypto... 

284
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:02,628
 And life matters. 

285
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:06,048
 He knows everything about all of that. 

286
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:08,258
Sit down!

287
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:28,348
Your energy of doubt is interfering with all of the energy here.

288
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:32,918
You would be able to see clearly if you believed.

289
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:34,888
What a dim-witted person.

290
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:40,268
I don't have time for people who are unwilling to see, so leave.

291
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:49,128
No, Sir.

292
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,288
Who is doubting you?

293
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:04,528
Did you see blood recently?

294
00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:06,758
Yes, you're right.

295
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:08,398
When the cafe was terrorized,

296
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,898
there was a bloody mess with Nureongyi's death.

297
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,478
Yeah...

298
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,438
And it seems you've had to spend a lot of money.

299
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:15,698
Boss, your car!

300
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:18,048
Your car got wrecked last time, so you bought a new one!

301
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:19,408
That's true.

302
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,548
So you run a business.

303
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:23,268
- But your business is not doing so well these days, right? 
 - Yes.

304
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:25,418
Our customer reviews recently have been pretty bad,

305
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:27,878
saying that they leave after waiting without having received a consultation.

306
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:30,108
How many business owners nowadays are actually doing well these days...

307
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,758
And you have an issue with your health as well.

308
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,868
Your chest feels tight, and it feels like you can't breathe properly.

309
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:38,168
Wow, seriously. Daebak.

310
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,348
My goodness, you're really amazing.

311
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:43,498
- Boss, you have a panic disorder. 
 - Yeah, that's true.

312
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,918
All of that is because of him.

313
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,368
You know that, too, right?

314
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:51,268
That guy you think you know, but then you don't.

315
00:19:55,838 --> 00:20:00,938
So I...don't believe in anything like shamanism.

316
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:05,928
But this guy was definitely different.

317
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:12,508
Let's see...

318
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:16,958
I keep seeing two guys.

319
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,868
But there's only one guy in my case.

320
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:21,578
No, there are two guys.

321
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:27,238
Two guys... are fighting over you. It's a mess.

322
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:29,188
Daebak.

323
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:32,038
But it seems like you should avoid both of them.

324
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:33,378
Do I really need to do that?

325
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:35,538
One of those two guys could be okay, though.

326
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,798
Both of them are not good for you...

327
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:41,108
but one of them is especially not good.

328
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:44,688
Geez! Geez! Geez!

329
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:47,248
I see blood.

330
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:49,328
With that guy, you're going to see blood!

331
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,468
What about the other guy?

332
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:56,548
Tears.

333
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,818
The Chairman is asking for you.

334
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:47,258
Has it been 20 years since you've seen your grandfather's face?

335
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,518
Follow me.

336
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:13,238
I heard that... what happened recently involving your father was your doing.

337
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,288
Seeing how you don't have any grit, greed, or ambition,

338
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:20,058
I wondered whom you took after.

339
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,948
"Great Good, Destroy Relative."

340
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:25,488
Seeing how you're willing to part ways with your parents for the greater good,

341
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:28,168
you are definitely Kim Seung Woon's son.

342
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:30,268
It's not for such a grand reason.

343
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:33,478
Then? Is it because of that attorney girl?

344
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:41,402
You thought I didn't care this much about what my grandchildren were doing?

345
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,182
So stop with all this.

346
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:48,792
Now that you've had your fill of fun, join Dohan Group.

347
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,052
What do you mean by that?

348
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:53,372
If you have the wits to destroy someone, you must also have the wits to fix them.

349
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:58,822
- Come inside Dohan Group and cut out what's corrupt and fix what needs to be fixed. 
 - I will refuse.

350
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:00,842
If you want to gain something,

351
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:03,412
you must also let go of something.

352
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:07,852
Do you know how much you cost me this time?

353
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:12,722
Since you're the one who caused the harm, so you need to be the one to fix it.

354
00:23:17,122 --> 00:23:19,102
Why... why, why!

355
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:22,432
He has a perfectly fine son next to him!

356
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,272
Why! Why...

357
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:28,182
is he trying to make his son-in-law's son his own as well?

358
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:36,312
He should have come to his senses after one of his sons died.

359
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:51,882
That old man won't come to his senses until the day he dies.

360
00:23:57,692 --> 00:23:59,482
What's wrong?

361
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,632
I'll drive you there.

362
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,280
   

363
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,322
Hello.

364
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:32,062
What... brings you here?

365
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:36,902
Oh... I wanted to get a consultation from Attorney Kim.

366
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:38,502
I thought it would be fun.

367
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:41,942
Please stop coming here before you get a complaint for stalking.

368
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:47,072
If I ever get a complaint from you, Attorney Kim,

369
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:51,742
it wouldn't be for anything trivial like that.

370
00:24:54,212 --> 00:24:56,182
Attorney Kim.

371
00:24:56,182 --> 00:25:00,192
Do you want to hear the story of my mom?

372
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:02,962
Please leave while I tell you nicely.

373
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:09,112
You see, I...

374
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,892
Today, I...

375
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:15,782
I had something happen to me that made me really angry.

376
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,602
I really thought about causing some major trouble.

377
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:22,492
But I thought maybe I'll feel a bit better if I see your face,

378
00:25:22,492 --> 00:25:25,192
so that's why I came.

379
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:30,602
But if you blatantly treat me like a monster, I feel really upset.

380
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:34,922
What are you doing? I'm talking to you right now, and you're on the phone...

381
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:38,142
Like this? Like this?

382
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,222
You're going to be like this?

383
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:44,622
You see. You see! You see! If someone is talking to you honestly and sincerely about something,

384
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,572
You should be listening to them. But instead, you're calling the police!

385
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:51,102
Then... Hey! What did I do for you to call the police?

386
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:53,112
What did I do? Huh!

387
00:25:53,112 --> 00:25:54,382
What did I do!

388
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,672
Stop making a fuss here because you're in a bad mood, and leave.

389
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,992
This is not a trash receptacle for your emotions!

390
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,702
Oh, it's almost here.

391
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,972
Here. The look in your eyes that I like.

392
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:04,932
Yeah?

393
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:07,092
This. God, this here!

394
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,232
Refusing to yield, not knowing your place...

395
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:11,572
Yes, this look in your eyes!

396
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,882
I really like this look.

397
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:17,822
Like it makes me want to show you your place.

398
00:26:17,822 --> 00:26:21,512
How would this look in your eyes change once you know your place...

399
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:23,332
Just thinking about it makes me feel so good!

400
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,402
It makes me so happy!

401
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:27,392
You are free to imagine what you want,

402
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:30,332
but there's no chance I will be clinging to you, begging.

403
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:32,722
We'll just have to watch and see about that.

404
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,402
Shall we see about that?

405
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:36,212
Shall we see about that right now?

406
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,202
Shall we?

407
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:49,342
You! You!

408
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:51,792
Come over here! Come here!

409
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:52,952
Come here!

410
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:54,362
Let go!

411
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,402
Man, that hurts.

412
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:58,582
Oh, my teeth! My teeth...

413
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:02,442
I'm bleeding... I'm bleeding!

414
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:07,092
You. Do that to me one more time.

415
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,372
Do it again.

416
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:12,272
Make it a double nosebleed. Do it, do it!

417
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:15,432
You crazy bastard.

418
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,552
Hey, who is this!

419
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:23,672
- You son of a b****! 
 - Why did you come now? I was waiting.

420
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:26,452
She was like hitting me and punching me.

421
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:27,752
It hurts so much here.

422
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:30,902
- Jeong Ho. Hey, Jeong Ho! 
 - Come out. Come out!

423
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:32,242
Yes, the cafe here!

424
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:33,602
Please, Ahjussi! Come quickly!

425
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:37,132
The two are fighting right now! Quickly, quickly!

426
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:40,002
Wake up, you son of a b****! This bastard!

427
00:27:40,002 --> 00:27:41,912
You!

428
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:51,022
You crazy son of a b****

429
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,162
 No, there are two guys. 

430
00:27:53,162 --> 00:27:57,962
 Two guys... are fighting over you. 

431
00:27:57,962 --> 00:28:00,392
How dare you!

432
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:03,522
- Ow! That hurts! 
 - D*** you!

433
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:08,522
I'm telling you, I got hit. She headbutted me, and he slapped me across my cheeks.

434
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,712
You b****!

435
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,802
- Please stop! 
 - She headbutted me and...

436
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,782
I gave my report as a witness

437
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:18,832
so everything's finished, right?

438
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,852
But somehow, we keep having to come to this place.

439
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:23,032
You b****! Hey, you b****!

440
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:25,472
- You! 
 - God, this guy...

441
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,922
You guys can arrest them or whatever you want with those two.

442
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:30,402
Please stop this!

443
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:32,352
She headbutted me and...

444
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,962
he slapped me across my cheeks. It hurts so much.

445
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,402
Geez...

446
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,822
I'm sorry.

447
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:02,192
God, I was going to make sure that trash son of a b****

448
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:04,522
never steps foot in here ever again, but...

449
00:29:04,522 --> 00:29:06,972
Whether that bastard comes here again or not, that's my business.

450
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:08,802
It's none of your business.

451
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:16,452
Your business... is my business. You know that.

452
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:17,832
Kim Jeong Ho, I'm speechless.

453
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,022
You're acting like we're close now?

454
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,702
You should leave now. I have nothing more to say to you.

455
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,952
You don't want to?

456
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:30,712
Then I'll leave.

457
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:36,892
Please.

458
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,052
Please listen to what I've got to say.

459
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:51,912
I know.

460
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:55,132
You were probably too scared to tell me.

461
00:29:55,132 --> 00:29:58,942
And later, you probably couldn't tell me because you feared that I'd get hurt.

462
00:29:58,942 --> 00:30:01,852
And you avoided me because you felt sorry.

463
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:10,792
♫  The thought that you will disappear when I open my eyes  ♫

464
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,132
There's something that you don't know.

465
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:14,872
There's more that I don't know about?

466
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:17,092
What else is there that I don't know about?

467
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,562
That...

468
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:24,332
♫  If you are going to leave me  ♫

469
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:26,392
I love you.

470
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:30,082
♫  Please don't cry any more  ♫

471
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:32,342
Because I thought I wouldn't be able to see you...

472
00:30:34,882 --> 00:30:37,482
Because I was afraid I would never be able to see you forever...

473
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:41,382
I couldn't do anything.

474
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:44,672
Even though it was cowardly of me...

475
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:47,572
I wanted to be able to see you like that.

476
00:30:47,572 --> 00:30:52,482
♫  Don't slowly fade away  ♫

477
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,152
I'm sorry...

478
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:58,752
for loving you

479
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,612
even though I have no right to.

480
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:18,332
♫  I need you to comfort me now  ♫

481
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:22,570
♫  Shine on me for a while  ♫

482
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,180
   

483
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,312
♫  When the drizzling rain stops  ♫

484
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:32,262
♫  We can dream the same dream  ♫

485
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:36,360
♫  To the beginning to the first day  ♫

486
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,480
♫  We must return  ♫

487
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:44,522
♫  Don't fall asleep  ♫

488
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:48,230
♫  Don't slo  ♫

489
00:31:56,252 --> 00:32:01,642
Unless you avoid both men, I told you you'll only end up crying.

490
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:06,462
Aigoo, look at you...

491
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:10,102
Looks like we'll have to perform a shaman ritual.

492
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,772
Shaman ritual?

493
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,102
If you won't surrender to your fate,

494
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,842
you should drive out the bad luck blocking the two of you.

495
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:28,412
You! If you want to do what heaven forbids you,

496
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:31,412
you should at least not do it with such effort.

497
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:36,402
Attorney. Where is the attorney?

498
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:38,122
- She's not in yet... 
 - She's not?

499
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,442
Over there. She's here.

500
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:43,102
Oh, my gosh! Attorney! Attorney, what do I do?

501
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:44,322
Wh-What's wrong?

502
00:32:44,322 --> 00:32:45,702
The company listed on the stock exchange

503
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,122
The company lost its listing.

504
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:52,072
Where is she?

505
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:54,622
You!

506
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,572
You!

507
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:02,742
No! Let go!

508
00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:05,712
Unni, Unni, Unni, I'm sorry!

509
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,152
I had no idea it'd turn out like this.

510
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,732
Please forgive me just this once, Unni!

511
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:10,712
I'm sorry!

512
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,470
   

513
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:30,542
What's going on?

514
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,642
A scam? How about my money?

515
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:34,622
What's happening?

516
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,930
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

517
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,812
- You, too, Doctor? 
 - Yeah...

518
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:45,582
How much...

519
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:48,092
Three million won...

520
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,982
Five.

521
00:33:52,932 --> 00:33:55,352
Five million won.

522
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,692
When do you think it'll get resolved?

523
00:33:58,572 --> 00:34:00,972
What's your occupation?

524
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,642
A lawyer.

525
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:04,972
I didn't purchase coins like other people.

526
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:07,902
I prepaid 3 million won for the shaman ritual...

527
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:11,802
Nice going!

528
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:15,052
Hey, are you taking rotations within our police station?

529
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:17,652
Now, you're hitting up our financial crime division?

530
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:21,482
- J-Jeong Ho... 
 - Hyung!

531
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:32,472
Attorney Kim, are you all right?

532
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:34,672
Wh-What's wrong?

533
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:05,022
So...

534
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:07,582
are you saying that all of you here

535
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:09,992
got taken advantage of by that ridiculous shaman?

536
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:11,872
Even you, Hyung?

537
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:17,272
You even messed with our rotating group savings?

538
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,372
You said you wished you could save a lump sum!

539
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:25,392
So I helped you out punching numbers on the calculator and this is what I get in return?

540
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:27,012
You, too, Hyung!

541
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:28,672
You're a psychiatrist.

542
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:31,222
Why can't you even read people?

543
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:35,242
But you know, it's because you haven't met the master...

544
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:37,402
Cut the "master"...

545
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,052
And Kim Yoo Ri, you, too.

546
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:40,702
You're an attorney, you know.

547
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:42,402
You should be solving the problem.

548
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:44,492
How could you lose the money for the shaman ritual?

549
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:47,252
And you call yourself a lawyer? Huh?

550
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:51,022
Se Yeon, it happens, you know.

551
00:35:52,632 --> 00:35:55,472
- What the? 
 - Why are you scolding the victim?

552
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:57,062
Is it the fault of the deceived?

553
00:35:57,062 --> 00:35:59,112
The liar is the one at fault.

554
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:02,112
You were scolding the deceived just a minute ago, mister.

555
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:03,752
I thought about it, and I don't think it's right.

556
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:05,702
We should comfort them first.

557
00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:06,792
Hey, Barista!

558
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,552
They all must be in shock.

559
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:12,482
A round of hot chamomile tea for everyone. It's on me.

560
00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:13,992
An iced tea for me.

561
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:15,962
What a crazy nut.

562
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:20,602
But you know...

563
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:24,132
I'm saying this because I don't really...

564
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:28,382
understand the situation yet...

565
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:31,182
This is a pyramid scheme of bitcoin fraud.

566
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:33,062
They list the company with the least amount of money

567
00:36:33,062 --> 00:36:35,582
and drag people in as a pyramid and collect investments.

568
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:37,472
Then they shut down the listed company in a month or two

569
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:39,392
and take off with the investments.

570
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:42,672
They said they'd pay a dividend and pay you more if you bring in others.

571
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:44,382
That's how people fall for it a lot.

572
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:48,342
The problem is that this dividend is all paid in virtual currency.

573
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:51,822
In a word, in money which doesn't exist.

574
00:37:00,712 --> 00:37:02,952
But if he's really a fraudster,

575
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:05,432
how could he have gotten all those things right?

576
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,112
Who knows. That scamming a**hole.

577
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:10,432
I'll find him for sure and find out everything!

578
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:11,822
But he took off already, though...

579
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:13,402
South Korea is a small country!

580
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:15,712
We can find him!

581
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,912
Master Maru or whatever...

582
00:37:22,912 --> 00:37:25,672
He's got ten fraud criminal convictions.

583
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:32,612
Could you get me the previous case files?

584
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:34,302
Yeah.

585
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:42,632
Instead of that, how about you go with me?

586
00:37:48,622 --> 00:37:50,812
   

587
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:03,732
   

588
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:05,102
Hi.

589
00:38:05,102 --> 00:38:06,982
Hello.

590
00:38:11,282 --> 00:38:13,632
Yes...

591
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:16,172
   

592
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:18,252
What are you doing?

593
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,562
Come in.

594
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:21,182
Okay.

595
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:32,402
   

596
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:37,382
   

597
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,432
 Busy? What do you mean you're busy? 

598
00:38:40,432 --> 00:38:42,482
 You're always just sitting around, saying you're writing novels- 

599
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:44,212
 Was it about a year or two ago? 

600
00:38:44,212 --> 00:38:45,882
 He said he was a novelist. 

601
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:51,592
 Some guy came to see me and asked all kinds of questions so I did tell him a few things. 

602
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:53,782
Whee-seul-Blower?

603
00:39:04,872 --> 00:39:09,482
Did you even plan on telling me anything from the get-go?

604
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:14,272
This is you, right?

605
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,552
How do you know about this—

606
00:39:16,552 --> 00:39:19,632
What were you doing by yourself, and how far did you get with it?

607
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:31,612
I kept thinking about this and I think this is my fault.

608
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:33,552
Hey, how could it be your fault?

609
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:35,932
While watching my dad's case from afar as a kid,

610
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:38,262
I'm sure you were hurt by it, too.

611
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:43,052
But I guess I thought you had forgotten everything and are fine by now.

612
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,042
As is with this fraud case,

613
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:46,732
I foolishly...

614
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,832
saw what I wanted to see and believed what I wanted to believe.

615
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:53,412
What could you possibly have said that made me understand when I'm like that?

616
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:03,472
Writer, Writer! I found out! I got it—

617
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,032
I should stay out for a minute, huh?

618
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,092
No, no. That's that and...

619
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:15,272
- this is a separate matter. 
 - Right?

620
00:40:17,272 --> 00:40:18,982
This guy...

621
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,252
Master Maru...

622
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,962
He got caught selling goods illegally.

623
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,632
He sold jade mats and insurance frauds...

624
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,522
He's done all kinds of terrible things.

625
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:31,592
And then, while he was in prison five years ago,

626
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:36,642
he got sick with a mysterious illness and became spirit-possessed.

627
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,082
So he is possessed, indeed?

628
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:42,272
Yes! He was a sharp fraudster, to begin with and with his supernatural instinct,

629
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:44,802
he was way above the Hong Gil Dong, Jeon Woo Chi* level. 
  (Korean folk tale hero figures) 

630
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:47,272
He was all over the place like he owned it.

631
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:52,732
There's a rumor that says he owns a mansion as big as a resort in the Philippines.

632
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:55,292
Unbelievable.

633
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:57,672
Yeah.

634
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,462
Okay, got it.

635
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:02,582
I found out where he is.

636
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:04,200
Where is he?

637
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:14,111
 Come on! 

638
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:16,571
 Geez, what's wrong... 

639
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,351
Let's go...

640
00:41:40,261 --> 00:41:42,191
Hello.

641
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:46,361
This must be your first time.

642
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:48,461
Doesn't mean I can't play.

643
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:50,971
I've played a lot in my neighborhood.

644
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,761
I look forward to it.

645
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:57,898
You can't let him know it's your first time!

646
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:01,218
Now, Unnis, let's go in.

647
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:09,078
Okay.

648
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,470
   

649
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,478
Ms. Kim, move your purse a little bit.

650
00:42:56,478 --> 00:42:58,688
A little to the right.

651
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:01,238
Geez, it's left.

652
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:04,198
I said I'd do it. Geez...

653
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:08,308
Move the purse to the left.

654
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,728
My turn, huh?

655
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,408
First, eat the royal fox-glove card.

656
00:43:16,408 --> 00:43:19,418
I don't think you're here to win money...

657
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:20,518
Why did you come here?

658
00:43:20,518 --> 00:43:24,438
Geez, you keep assuming things. It must be a habit.

659
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:27,758
I'm not just assuming.

660
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:30,028
I can see right through you.

661
00:43:30,028 --> 00:43:33,048
My job is to read people, you know.

662
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,628
I've done some work in reading people, too.

663
00:43:36,628 --> 00:43:40,128
But don't you know that what you see isn't everything?

664
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:43,948
All right! I cleared the table, I cleared the table! No Light cards and not enough Point cards!

665
00:43:43,948 --> 00:43:45,688
Stop!

666
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,638
All right...

667
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:52,768
Should we raise the stakes now?

668
00:43:52,768 --> 00:43:53,938
Yes...

669
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:55,418
Stay out if you're scared.

670
00:43:55,418 --> 00:43:57,448
Scared?

671
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,608
Hey, Jung Nam!

672
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:07,648
You want to keep going?

673
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:13,008
 Unnis, let's get right to it now. 

674
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:16,138
Good job, good job.

675
00:44:16,138 --> 00:44:20,108
Oppas, we'll go over to the big table and play there, okay?

676
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:22,678
We had fun. Thank you.

677
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:24,278
Okay.

678
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:31,918
Welcome.

679
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:34,508
Hello.

680
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:36,138
Hello.

681
00:44:36,138 --> 00:44:38,558
The stake is a little higher here. Are you okay with that?

682
00:44:38,558 --> 00:44:39,998
Gosh, no problem.

683
00:44:39,998 --> 00:44:42,618
Let's learn a thing or two.

684
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:44,988
Do you want a cup of coffee?

685
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:52,198
Thank you. And you, Noonims?

686
00:44:52,198 --> 00:44:53,988
For me, two creams, two sugar, please.

687
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:56,988
One cream, one sugar for me.

688
00:44:58,778 --> 00:45:02,818
All right, then shall we begin?

689
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:04,038
Great!

690
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:08,608
Keep raising the wager and make him bring out all the money he brought with him.

691
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:11,338
Including the money he hid. Everything!

692
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:14,988
Man, he's good...

693
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:18,718
I guess things are not working out for you.

694
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:23,368
I'm almost at a full-blue ribbon set!

695
00:45:23,368 --> 00:45:26,818
Aigoo! Two each...

696
00:45:28,128 --> 00:45:30,928
Thank you!

697
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,598
He's literally donating to charity!

698
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:34,518
Jung Nam.

699
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:39,778
We're short on money...

700
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:47,318
Gosh, what do we do...

701
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:50,368
I guess you can't really see your own bank account?

702
00:45:50,368 --> 00:45:51,938
You can't seem to read what's right in front of you.

703
00:45:51,938 --> 00:45:54,538
It's not that I can't see it.

704
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:56,268
It's just the greed blinding me.

705
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:57,988
That's right. That greed.

706
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,398
Why don't you just let go of your greed?

707
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:02,488
Instead of causing damage to others.

708
00:46:02,488 --> 00:46:04,258
Damage?

709
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:07,748
Do you know me?

710
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,058
I just assumed.

711
00:46:12,778 --> 00:46:15,688
If you were going to lose all this, you should've just donated it all.

712
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:18,368
He's sensitive.

713
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:19,808
Very sensitive.

714
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:22,808
It's all fun and games, you know...

715
00:46:24,398 --> 00:46:26,988
All right, let's go again.

716
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,718
He's going in! He's going in!

717
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:34,148
The bag is going in right now.

718
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:36,778
Let's raise the wager one more time.

719
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:47,548
Aigoo, we're going to stay up all night at this rate.

720
00:46:47,548 --> 00:46:51,288
Shall we increase the wager one more time?

721
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:53,618
Okay! How about one bill per point, then?

722
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:56,318
Gosh, sure, then.

723
00:46:57,758 --> 00:46:59,408
Fine...

724
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:03,108
That freaking son of a b****.

725
00:47:03,108 --> 00:47:05,108
Eun Kang.

726
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,858
Four more.

727
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,578
Okay.

728
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:14,308
Four more.

729
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,310
Excuse me. ( In English )

730
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:22,868
Let's go, let's go...

731
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:29,998
All right...

732
00:47:36,158 --> 00:47:38,608
Wow. A brainiac vs. possessed.

733
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:40,868
This is the real thing.

734
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:45,728
Joon, we're not here to play.

735
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:54,188
One go.

736
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,478
Two go.

737
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:08,768
Let's go.

738
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:17,588
Yeah, let's go, let's go! I'll go as well.

739
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:24,918
Three go!

740
00:48:25,748 --> 00:48:28,198
Great! Let's go!

741
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:31,768
Let's go!

742
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:39,478
Here I go.

743
00:48:40,688 --> 00:48:44,508
Wow. A free point card! Service, service!

744
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:47,308
Four go!

745
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:50,338
Hold on.

746
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:59,478
Wow, you watched too many movies.

747
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,038
Jung Nam!

748
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,068
Bring the tools!

749
00:49:04,068 --> 00:49:07,408
How dare you try an old trick like sneaking a card from the bottom?

750
00:49:16,278 --> 00:49:18,438
How does it feel to be had?

751
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:20,088
What the?

752
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:23,728
You didn't notice anything all along, even though I was cheating to your face.

753
00:49:24,568 --> 00:49:27,928
I guess it's true that people can't see anything when they get desperate.

754
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:29,578
You...

755
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:35,988
Who the hell are you guys?

756
00:49:37,378 --> 00:49:41,068
Who else do you think? We're all victims you took advantage of!

757
00:49:42,248 --> 00:49:44,938
We'll make sure you pay for it this time.

758
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:47,498
So you can't scam people anymore.

759
00:49:52,148 --> 00:49:56,118
I saw a dagger in you before.

760
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:01,618
A dagger, my foot.

761
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:05,568
You say you look into people's hearts while you're stomping on them all along.

762
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:07,438
That makes no sense.

763
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:10,548
Don't you feel bad toward the real shamans?

764
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,548
How about you?

765
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:16,968
You don't feel bad toward your father?

766
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:20,698
After stabbing him in the back like that?

767
00:50:27,718 --> 00:50:30,778
Stop spouting nonsense and apologize.

768
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,648
Apologize for taking advantage of people's desperation and say this.

769
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:38,018
That the people who were fooled weren't at fault

770
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:43,598
but the liar who betrayed their trust.

771
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:47,888
So, they don't need to blame themselves at all.

772
00:50:47,888 --> 00:50:49,848
Say that.

773
00:50:58,178 --> 00:51:02,108
The gods would be angry because I wouldn't mean it if I said that!

774
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:05,308
That f***ing son of a b****!

775
00:51:05,308 --> 00:51:07,558
Hey!

776
00:51:07,558 --> 00:51:10,588
- Guys! 
 - Yes, Sir!

777
00:51:21,038 --> 00:51:24,908
You'll be locked up for at least five years for fraud.

778
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:27,438
Must you increase your sentence?

779
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:28,868
Sure.

780
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,408
Want me to show you?

781
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:32,908
How far I could go?

782
00:51:39,288 --> 00:51:40,928
Move.

783
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,668
I said move!

784
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,518
Jeong Ho!

785
00:51:52,608 --> 00:51:53,578
H-Hey...

786
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,108
I said move!

787
00:51:55,108 --> 00:51:56,978
No!

788
00:51:56,978 --> 00:52:00,608
♫  You are my everything  ♫

789
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,320
♫  Cascading like the stars /i&gt; ♫ 

790
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,538
Doctor!

791
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,380
Hyung!

792
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:22,738
Why did you jump in?

793
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:25,818
We could've avoided him.

794
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:27,748
Wait here a sec.

795
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:31,368
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

796
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,888
Hey!

797
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,638
Clean them up.

798
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:47,898
Stay put!

799
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,328
Now, now. No need to run away.

800
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:56,088
The police are all over the place outside!

801
00:52:56,088 --> 00:52:59,088
This is not even under my jurisdiction. I don't know why I'm here.

802
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:00,958
This is driving me nuts, too.

803
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:07,158
Thanks to you, we found his fake deposit book. 
    

804
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:10,158
I think we can retrieve the lost amount somewhat.

805
00:53:15,248 --> 00:53:17,938
Hey, hey, hey! Proud?

806
00:53:17,938 --> 00:53:20,028
Do Jin Ki says we shouldn't raise a child around Kim Yoo Ri.

807
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:21,508
Too many incidents and accidents surrounding you.

808
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:23,408
Hey! That's not my fault, though.

809
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,818
I'm a victim in this case, too!

810
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:27,228
Gosh, I have a headache. Forget it. You go!

811
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:28,538
Go where? You go with us.

812
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,628
Go where? Hurry up and leave.

813
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:30,878
Let's go together.

814
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:33,048
- Hello? 
  - Hey. 

815
00:53:33,048 --> 00:53:34,988
 - It's me.  
 - Dr. Park is buying.

816
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:36,708
I have tons of work because of this case.

817
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:39,438
- No, no, come with us! 
 - No, please...

818
00:53:39,438 --> 00:53:40,968
Come after you finish then.

819
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,058
- I have too much work. 
 - Please...

820
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:45,508
You recognize my voice, right?

821
00:53:46,778 --> 00:53:47,878
So what the hell are you up to?

822
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:49,658
Well, it's nothing much.

823
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:51,868
I've been summoned to the Prosecutors' Office.

824
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:53,378
Why?

825
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:56,438
- Are you angry about that? 
  - Oh, no. 

826
00:53:56,438 --> 00:54:00,928
I thought my nephew's effort to unveil the family's errors was so commendable.

827
00:54:00,928 --> 00:54:05,158
I wanted to tell you that I confessed to everything.

828
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,208
 Gosh, I'm feeling all kinds of emotions right now. 

829
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:10,188
Stabbing the father with a dagger that he put in my hands.

830
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:13,588
Is this how it feels?

831
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,938
What the hell are you spewing?

832
00:54:15,938 --> 00:54:17,078
 What the hell? 

833
00:54:17,078 --> 00:54:19,368
You really had no idea?

834
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:25,118
Hey, the evidence that you were seeking for so long appeared right in front of your eyes.

835
00:54:25,118 --> 00:54:27,238
How do you think that happened?

836
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:28,918
 Gosh, seriously... 

837
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:31,878
 How much does he have to love his son 

838
00:54:31,878 --> 00:54:36,138
 that he can just let go of the honor that is his life? 

839
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:39,268
I would never get to find out how that feels.

840
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:42,088
Jeong Ho— That rude bastard! How dare he hangs up on me!

841
00:54:42,088 --> 00:54:44,588
He should hear me out to the end.

842
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:49,188
Gosh. Good.

843
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,368
It has to be at least like that to be good.

844
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:16,158
Here you go.

845
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:18,628
It's the evidence you mentioned.

846
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:21,208
Are you really going to be okay with this?

847
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:32,058
 Yes, the Chief Prosecutor  did give it to me in person. 

848
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:38,198
 He said he knew it would be revealed someday so he had kept it in his possession. 

849
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:42,148
 Please say a word! 

850
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:43,898
 Please make a statement! 

851
00:55:43,898 --> 00:55:46,018
 Please! 

852
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,108
Yes.

853
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:51,318
For the fire incident at the Dohan distribution warehouse in 2006,

854
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:56,018
Dohan Group put pressure on the prosecutor in charge at the time,

855
00:55:56,018 --> 00:56:00,238
Kim Seung Woon, in order to leave out the evidence.

856
00:56:00,238 --> 00:56:01,798
Only recently,

857
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:05,298
I learned of the connection between my father

858
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:08,768
Chairman Lee Byung Ok and my brother-in-law Chief Prosecutor Kim Seung Woon

859
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:11,528
back in 2006. And after—

860
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:19,328
And after finding this out,

861
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:22,438
I gave it a lot of thought, losing sleep

862
00:56:22,438 --> 00:56:26,038
and made a tough decision to reveal it to the world.

863
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:29,268
Are you saying you're the whistle-blower himself, CEO Lee?

864
00:56:29,268 --> 00:56:30,478
Yes! That's right!

865
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:32,058
On behalf of my father,

866
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:34,478
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seung Woon,

867
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:37,598
and the Dohan Group,

868
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,818
I, Lee Pyun Woong,

869
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:42,748
will apologize to you all.

870
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,478
What are you doing?

871
00:56:57,478 --> 00:56:59,368
What are you saying barging in here like that?

872
00:56:59,368 --> 00:57:03,648
Are you playing with people or something? What are you doing?

873
00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:07,178
Looks like that Director Jeong has a big mouth.

874
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:09,658
Didn't you say it yourself?

875
00:57:09,658 --> 00:57:12,888
That the chief prosecutor position doesn't suit me.

876
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:17,388
I took the position, knowing full well that I'd step down someday.

877
00:57:17,388 --> 00:57:20,288
Then, you shouldn't have taken the position to begin with.

878
00:57:20,288 --> 00:57:22,338
How could you...

879
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,118
How could you do this to me?

880
00:57:25,118 --> 00:57:27,508
It was an age-old agreement with Chairman Lee.

881
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:32,568
When the time was right, I thought I'd be paying for the crime.

882
00:57:32,568 --> 00:57:34,258
But I guess I'm just a man, after all.

883
00:57:34,258 --> 00:57:36,708
I kept forgetting about it and delaying it.

884
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:39,088
It all worked out now.

885
00:57:41,088 --> 00:57:43,938
You just did what you had to do.

886
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:46,058
And you had the courage to do so.

887
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:50,038
That's not it. You just used me, so you could feel at ease.

888
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:56,158
I guess this is it.

889
00:57:58,938 --> 00:58:01,168
Now I know.

890
00:58:02,138 --> 00:58:05,858
How it feels to be betrayed by someone you trusted.

891
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,608
This totally makes you feel like a fool.

892
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:12,598
Jeong Ho.

893
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:57,798
   

894
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,938
 Hey, Kim Jeong Ho, where are you? 

895
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:49,100
♫  After the long rain   ♫

896
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:52,828
I'm sorry.

897
00:59:52,828 --> 00:59:55,598
♫  which seemed  like it wouldn't cease passed  ♫

898
00:59:55,598 --> 00:59:57,198
I'm sorry, Yoo Ri.

899
00:59:57,198 --> 01:00:03,118
♫  I'm lost in the thought in the expression you could not hide   ♫

900
01:00:03,118 --> 01:00:05,248
Why are you crying?

901
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:08,960
I even paid for your shaman ritual so you wouldn't cry.

902
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:15,590
I thought... I knew everything. 
 ♫  On an empty street my troubled heart ♫

903
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,740
♫  still isn't dry  ♫

904
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:23,000
But I didn't know anything at all. 
 ♫  still isn't dry  ♫

905
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,218
I'm really sorry.

906
01:00:24,218 --> 01:00:27,598
♫  Like the rain which falls throughout the long night  ♫

907
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:32,018
I'm sorry that I deceived you for so long.

908
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:36,898
♫  Like the snow piled up at the end of dawn  ♫

909
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:44,420
♫  If I can see in your heart  ♫

910
01:00:46,038 --> 01:00:49,478
♫  If I could  ♫

911
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:56,000
♫  If that could be, that would be great  ♫

912
01:01:01,378 --> 01:01:07,170
♫  Where you are looking  ♫

913
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:11,970
♫  behind my back  ♫

914
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:36,248
♫  I will become your umbrella  ♫

915
01:01:36,248 --> 01:01:42,768
♫  I can cover any pain too  ♫

916
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:50,210
♫  If I could convey my feeling like this  ♫

917
01:01:51,878 --> 01:01:55,238
♫  If I could  ♫

918
01:01:55,238 --> 01:01:57,760
♫  If I coud  ♫

919
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:04,050
♫  it would be great  ♫

920
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:11,120


921
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:17,968
   

922
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:20,708
 He did it on purpose! I saw it! 

923
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,008
 You read me wrong. 

924
01:02:22,008 --> 01:02:23,978
 I'm not that weak of a person. 

925
01:02:23,978 --> 01:02:26,368
 My Yoo Ri isn't that fragile, either. 

926
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,218
 I said I'd take care of myself! 

927
01:02:28,218 --> 01:02:30,678
 Oh, hey, hey! Give, give it, give it to me! 

928
01:02:30,678 --> 01:02:31,458
 Say ah. 

929
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:32,488
 Hey, get on my back. 

930
01:02:32,488 --> 01:02:34,568
 They're totally flipping out. 

931
01:02:34,568 --> 01:02:36,608
 I wanted to ask you about the inheritance. 

932
01:02:36,608 --> 01:02:37,838
 I'll help you. 

933
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,258
 Please watch your health. 

934
01:02:39,258 --> 01:02:41,898
 If you don't, your son will just! 

935
01:02:41,898 --> 01:02:43,688
 Say that to me again. 

936
01:02:43,688 --> 01:02:47,990
 That I love you?
