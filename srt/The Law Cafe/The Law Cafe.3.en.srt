A person stood on the ledge of a building to throw away their life,

31
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,567
but do you think that happened solely because of something you said?

32
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:24,017
Technically speaking, when you told him that nobody lived above him,

33
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:27,097
you didn't anticipate the shock that he'd go through.

34

It is true that you were wrong about that.

35

But thinking that he stood there because of you...

36
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:35,157
That's absolutely not it.

37
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,107
For him to have stood up there, there must have been many other

words, reasons, and emotions involved.

Man, what a mess...

48

I guess it wasn't that I was hungry...

But do you have to live with your place looking like this?

The fact that your mother didn't do anything seeing this...

Is this your first time coming here?

53

My mom doesn't come here anymore.

Every time she comes, she feels like she's going to develop anger issues.

Thank you for today.

If it weren't for you earlier, I don't even want to think...

To meet Mr. Jo Seok Joon from yesterday.

00:12:50,557 --> 00:12:53,457
I have it good, thanks to the doctor.

I'm more at ease than at home.

I...

182
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:02,977
always had... sensitive ears.

183
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:04,757
I used to do music.

Oh, really?

185
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:09,627
- By music, which—
- I played guitar.

186
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:13,267
I used to travel around as a session instrumentalist

187
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,627
and have people buy me drinks.

188
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:18,977
But because of alcohol, my wife and I got divorced

189
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:21,137
and ended up moving to this apartment.

190

But because I tried to quit drinking,

191

my already sensitive ears became even more sensitive.

but it turned out that I was wrong.

198

I am indebted to both of you.

199

I don't know if I want to accept his apology.

205

Of course, you would feel that way.

206

I'm sure a lot of frustrations piled up over all that time.

207

I kept telling him that it wasn't our home, but he wouldn't believe us.

00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:57,157
it could get away with using whatever material during the actual construction.

323
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,937
So it means this rotten company knew this...

324
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:02,407
so they did quality checks before construction,

325
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,887
but turn a blind eye to what happens after construction.

326
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:08,017
Those sons of b****es.

327
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,147
Furthermore, Dohan Construction built the apartment different

328
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,717
from the blueprint that they were approved for at the time.

329
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:18,427
Those conniving sons of b****es!

330
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,177
If we can just prove this,

331
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:22,737
the situation can become advantageous for us.

332
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:26,747
So how much can we receive in compensation if we sue them?

333
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,237
In 2009,

334
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,537
around 170 residents of an apartment building in the city of Namyang

335
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,947
filed a lawsuit against Daeon Construction.

336
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:37,567
It is true that this precedent ended with the court ruling that the company pays out

337
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,407
between 6 to 14 million won for sound insulation construction costs.

338
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:44,247
However, when thinking about the costs and duration of the legal proceedings,

339
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,637
it is an insignificant amount.

340
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:49,847
And that's if we win.

341
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:51,147
Hey, Kim Jeong Ho!

342
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:54,987
Why is he being such a nuisance?

343
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,567
Also, technically speaking,

344
00:21:56,567 --> 00:22:00,427
because it's been 16 years since this building was built,

345
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:02,337
the security liability period for defect repairs

346
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:05,917
based on the Apartment Housing Management Act has long passed.

347
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,067
Do people not live in apartments that were completed 16 years ago?

348
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,597
Do they not have the right to be compensated for damages?

349
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:15,797
What if the housing value of the apartments drops as the news of the lawsuit spreads?

350
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:19,237
Yeah, why should we get involved in a lawsuit just for 10 million won?

351
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,377
Just forget it!

352
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:22,557
Yeah, don't do it. Don't do it.

353
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:25,027
For the devaluation of apartments due to infringement of the living condition

354
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,597
such as inter-floor noise issues,

355
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,117
you can demand compensation for that as well.

356
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:29,947
It only sounds good.

357
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,557
You have to prove that the decline in housing value

358
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:35,707
is due to the inter-floor noise issue and the lawsuit.

359
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,887
But this is not easy at all.

360
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:40,447
Yeah, just give it up.

361
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,007
Don't do it.

362
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,258
Let's not do it.

363
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,390
Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think you're coming to?

364
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,473
This is a violation of the contract!

365
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:51,443
It was difficult enough without your help! Why did you interfere?

366
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:54,184
Because you were starting something you cannot be responsible for.

367
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:57,354
Not that you didn't want to start something you would have to be responsible for?

368
00:22:58,489 --> 00:22:59,689
Remember what you said?

369
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:04,809
A good attorney... is one who solves the issue before it reaches court.

370
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,029
Take a seat.

371
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,709
Okay.

372
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:20,069
Let's say that for the common good, we decide to devote our time and effort to this cause,

373
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,909
and those people notice our commitment

374
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:24,709
and choose to spend their time and money on this difficult lawsuit.

375
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:28,589
But after many years like that, all you get is a few million won?

376
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,739
You think that comes close to sufficient compensation

377
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:35,099
for many years of walking around on eggshells while living in their own homes?

378
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,319
Then what's your plan?

379
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,739
Are you saying we shouldn't do anything?

380
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:41,029
The deeper I dig into this, the more I feel like even filing a national reparations lawsuit.

381
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,809
Do you think this is a reasonable system?

382
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,189
What they're interested in is not about the system or the law!

383
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:49,359
They want their lives to get better immediately!

384
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,179
Then... are you saying what I'm doing right now is not making their lives better?

385
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,469
Yeah! Not at all!

386
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,639
And your life, neither.

387
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:02,879
And is that why you're stuck in this rooftop room in your tracksuit and not doing anything?

388
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,699
Because that's what's good for your life?

389
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,279
Yeah.

390
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,749
Because me not doing anything is what's good for us all.

- Attorney!
- Oh, Ms. Song Hwa!

393
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,239
Hello!

394
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:45,619
Hi, Yi Seul!

395
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,079
Hello.

396
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,309
You held a briefing session today, right?

397
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:00,749
Yes.

398
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,569
I tried my best,

399
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,829
but I don't think people were persuaded, though.

400
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:06,749
I wanted to be there, too,

401
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:09,019
- but I got delayed because of work...
- You're not too late!

402
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:11,439
Should I explain it to you?

403
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:16,249
Why are you going to this extent for this, Attorney?

404
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:19,059
It's not even your business.

405
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,649
Because it is something I can do.

406
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:24,459
It's something that can potentially be resolved

407
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,889
if I just have a cup of coffee and get involved

408
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:28,769
while others say I'm taking it overboard.

409
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,599
I can't just do nothing about it.

410
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:35,689
I haven't seen someone like you before, Attorney.

411
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,529
I do hear that quite often.

412
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:42,479
But sometimes, I want to do my best for others, but

413
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:46,399
I wonder if my method is really the right way.

414
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:48,309
Even this time, I don't know if proceeding with a lawsuit

415
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,519
is really what will make things better for the residents.

416
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:58,539
For me... I want to pursue...

417
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,789
that lawsuit.

418
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:05,999
Honestly, that apartment...

419
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:12,445
is a place I've lived with my husband since we were newly married.

420
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:17,145
I want to be able to live in my home without any worries.

00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,609
We want to participate in the lawsuit as well!

423
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:33,129
Although everybody's worried about the housing value dropping,

424
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,869
we need to keep living here.

425
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:36,029
So we want to try anything!

[Plastic | Vinyl]

435
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,809
Yeah, I'm cowardly.

And if you're going to keep violating the contract, vacate your space.

437
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:29,899
Okay. I admit that my method may not be the best one.

438
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,219
However, I cannot agree

439
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:36,209
that doing nothing is a better method.

440
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,569
Y-Yeah, okay.

441
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,109
So instead of just criticizing,

442
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:47,089
provide some alternative solutions to solve this problem.

Honestly, who doesn't know how to criticize?

If someone told me to do nothing but bash something all day, I can!

You've got to be kidding me.

450
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,319
The reason an impulsive moth like me was able to survive like this

451
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,289
was because I still take into account the words of prats like you.

They are in the midst of connecting this with the Palacio Hotel

in order to market it as luxurious apartments.

- You're right.
- But...

We've tried performing in an apartment building constructed by D Construction in 2007,

and lastly in a studio apartment constructed by Company G.

Although both were made using sheer wall structures,

531
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:36,169
there was a significant difference between the apartments constructed by Company D and Company Y.

532

What is the reason why we could hear better in the apartments built by Company D?

Is there a problem with Company D?

If we have the video taken down,

545

does that mean the video gets erased from the memories of those who watched it?

The fact that there is a video out there like this

556

they will sue us for defamation and obstruction of business.

642
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,939
What's up?

643
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,259
Attorney?

644
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:44,769
You were quite famous.

645
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:47,179
Oh, this one. Yeah.

646
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,059
My picture came out well, right?

647
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,219
That's awesome.

648
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,219
Okay. Aside from the video,

649
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:58,319
what's your reason for coming here?

650
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,919
Is this a declaration of war?

651
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:03,899
Well, I file lawsuits like this for the public interest all the time. It's my job.

652
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,709
But I thought that would make your life so much more difficult, Team Leader.

653
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:08,569
Before the complaint reaches court,

654
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:14,179
I was hoping we could come up with a solution that would be better for both of us.

655
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:22,229
My team members can handle the work.
[Complaint]

656
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,659
But still, the person in charge holds a lot of the responsibility.

657
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,279
If you lose this case, all other apartments will also line up to sue.

658
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,859
Then what will be the extent of the loss?

659
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:31,809
Gosh, that would be astronomical...

660
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:33,459
Oh gosh, I just got the shivers.

661
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,109
No chance that we would lose!

662
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:41,369
Is that something a mere legal team leader, can gamble all on your own?

663
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:47,759
Sir.

664
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,299
The world is changing around us.

665
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:54,529
It's so much easier for people to find out

666
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:59,069
what's lowering their quality of life and how they can claim their rights.

667
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:02,079
Even if it's not us, at some point in the future,

668
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,339
a crazy attorney somewhere will start a lawsuit against some construction company.

669
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:12,089
But does that troublesome headache of a case

670
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:16,059
have to happen to Dohan Construction right now?

671
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,359
Does it?

672
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,189
So did your meeting with your higher-ups go over well?

673
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:39,489
My goodness. Under the condition that you pull the video down,

674
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:42,499
for the cost of noise construction at 7 million won

675
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:44,499
and compensation of 520,000 won per household.

676
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:46,239
Let's settle it here.

677
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,869
520,000 won?

678
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:48,829
What 520,000 won?

679
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:50,789
Why not add another 500,000 and make it over 1 million?

680
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:52,949
Are you beggars?

681
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:55,139
Beggars?

682
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:05,629
Who's the one acting like a freaking beggar?

683
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:07,759
How dare you act all high and mighty when you're not even coughing up 1 million won?

684
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:11,379
So who told you to build a s***ty apartment in the first place?

685
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:13,899
Billions of won wouldn't be enough for the real compensation here!

686
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:16,099
I was going to spread the rumor all over the place and was going to get the money from the lawsuit,

687
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,029
yet I'm giving you a chance to be accountable on your own.

688
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:21,379
How dare you call us beggars when we're being so generous with you!

689
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:25,989
But why are you talking informally with me?

690
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:28,909
I mean, you were using such vulgar language earlier, Team Leader.

691
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:31,669
I thought you wanted to be on equal footing as friends.

692
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:34,419
Team Leader, they are in expensive apartments worth millions of won,

693
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:37,609
living as if being tortured in their own homes. How can you even bring up that amount?

694
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:40,699
But even in a precedent case in the Supreme Court,

695
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:42,119
they didn't award this much amount.

696
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,209
That precedent case was back in 2009!

697
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:46,129
There's the inflation—

698
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:47,249
Gosh, forget it.

699
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,999
It'd be faster for me to make money off the YouTube views and fix their homes for them.

700
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:55,669
Then as you mentioned,

701
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:58,439
how about 8 million won per household?

702
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:01,119
- Is that good?
- Gosh, let's just say it is.

703
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,929
Gosh, I'm so tired.

704
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:05,719
Then please wrap up the paperwork with my staff.

705
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:09,889
I have another meeting to attend.

706
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:13,079
Is it that time already?

707
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,039
Team Leader.

708
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:16,869
You don't need to go too far.

709
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:19,099
What is it now?

710
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:22,949
CEOs, over here! Over here.

711
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:24,909
Aigoo...

712
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:26,439
What's going on here?

713
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:27,809
Let me introduce myself again.

714
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:31,839
I'm Attorney Kim Yoo Ri, an attorney for Palacio Hills' Resident Representatives Committee.

715
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,779
For them, the apartment where residents haven't even moved in has water leaks and cracks...

716
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:39,869
Gosh, there are quite a lot of changes that are different from the blueprint.

717
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:41,779
Let's go up. Let's go up.

718
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,649
Oh, I think you'll have a bit more headache with this case than in the other case.

719
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,539
You should've built the apartments right from the get-go.

720
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:49,209
They're expensive apartments too.

721
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,179
W-Wait...

722
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,029
Thank you!

723
00:45:02,029 --> 00:45:03,689
- Get home safely!
- Thank you!

724
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:05,319
Thank you!

725
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:07,949

00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,179
When we were in college,

741
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,549
I had a panic attack out of the blue on the bus, so

742
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:23,749
we got off the bus and walked home drenched in the rain.

743

I'm feeling great today.

744
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,159
Should we walk home since we haven't done that in a while?

745
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,059
You don't remember getting sick with a cold for a week after that, do you?

746
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:32,709
And you messed up on your midterms because of that,

747
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,879
and you were bawling your eyes out.

I'm sorry. I'm so late.

I feel so sorry for such a young lady.

00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,349
Gosh, why?

784
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,139
Don't have pity for someone perfectly fine.

785
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:01,159
Aigoo! She's that woman!

786
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,409
She lost her husband two years ago and is raising a child alone.

787
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,309
She has to work, yet

788
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:09,809
it's tough to find a place for her child to be taken care of.

789
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:13,489
I feel so bad for her when I see her running around all by herself.

790
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:15,509
Whoa. Really?

791
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:17,139

792
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,279
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

793
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,479
As I told you last time,

794
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:31,709
the lawsuit will take too long for it to provide real help.

795
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:35,469
So I went to Dohan Construction and attempted to settle it.

796
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:38,089
Fortunately, for construction cost and compensation,

797
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:40,929
I have settled it for 8 million won per household.

798
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:42,579
Oh, my goodness!

799
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,889
Oh, my gosh!

800
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:44,869
What in the world!

801
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:46,539
It's not a huge amount, but

802
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:49,429
I've checked out vendors and got estimates.

803
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:54,119
It looks like fixing your living rooms, and the master bedrooms are doable with that amount.

804
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,239
Oh, my goodness! That's great!

805
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,319
Attorney Kim, thank you so much!

806
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:00,749
Thank you so much!

807
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:02,409
You went through a lot.

808
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:04,339
Thank you so much.

809
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:06,859
Gosh, I'm so happy!

810
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:08,739
And Ms. Song Hwa,

811
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:12,839
I'll make a special request for your place to be fixed sturdily

812
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:16,059
so Yi Seul can run around and play freely.

813
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:17,529
Yes...

814
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:21,979
Why are you crying?

815
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:32,799
And my apologies to you...

816
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:36,609
I spoke as if I could change everything in your house at first

817
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:39,999
- yet this is all I could—
- No, Attorney Kim.

818
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,889
It was enough for me that someone stepped forward and took care of it as if it was your business.

819
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:48,639
Thanks to you, Attorney Kim...

820
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,749
even if I hear some noise coming from the next door,

821
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:54,169
I don't think I'd get angry.

822
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:55,979
He's right.

823
00:50:57,409 --> 00:51:03,070
There was no worse hell than living in hatred for others.

824
00:51:03,749 --> 00:51:05,919
Thank you so much.

825
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,789
- Thank you, Attorney Kim.
- My gosh...

826
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:14,389
I'm the grateful one.

827
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:19,879
It's nice to see you smile.

828
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:24,339
To summarize,

829
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:28,189
they crapped all over us
[Settlement]

830
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:31,199
and even got what they wanted, right?
[CEO Lee Pyeon Woong]

831
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,489
And this...

832
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,819
This Kim Yoo Ri or something...

833
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:42,979
of all places she used to be at Hwang and Goo?

834
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:49,899
Oh, y-yes...

835
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,489
Geez.

836
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:53,979
What does she do?

837
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:56,339
Oh, well...

838
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:01,019
She was an attorney working for the Public Service Foundation of our law firm.

839
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:03,849
I'm not sure if this will be a comfort to you, but

840
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,799
she's recently left.

841
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:08,589
Why did she leave?

842
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,469
To run a cafe...

843
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:15,189
A cafe?

844
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:17,099
Where they sell coffee?

845
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,619
Yes. A cafe.

846
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:22,789
Then she should just sell coffee. Why is she picking a fight with us?

847
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:26,159
I'm sure she didn't have any other intentions.

848
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:28,479
For public service and whatnot,

849
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:32,399
she just loved to make matters bigger...

850
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,609
Oh, I see. That's her style, huh?

851
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:45,409
Someone with a personality like that should fix that.

852
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:49,739
That's all because she has no fear.

853
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:03,579
Why isn't she picking up?

854
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:06,649
How could this be?
[CEO Hwang]

855
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:09,199
How could you take care of only those residents?

856
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:10,359
We're all the same residents in the apartment!

857
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:12,399
- That's what I'm saying!
- Gosh, Sir.

858
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,879
You didn't do anything out of fear of apartment value dropping.

859
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,659
But asking for the money now is like highway robbery.

860
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:20,129
This came about because they wanted to claim their rights,

861
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,969
so they signed the complaints and came forward wanting to file a lawsuit.

862
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,839
So Dohan Construction had no choice but to settle.

863
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,219
Then we could settle with them, too!

864
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:28,989
That's right!

865
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,299
- Hello?
- Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

866
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:35,329
Why don't you pick up! Why don't you?

867
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,799
Hey, what the hell are you going around doing?

868
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,589
I'm kind of busy these days.

869
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:42,799
But did the rumor spread to you already?

870
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:45,299
You'd better stop being cheeky.

871
00:53:45,299 --> 00:53:50,379
D-Do you even know what kind of people CEO Lee and these people are?

872
00:53:50,379 --> 00:53:52,169
Gosh, if you're going to nag,

873
00:53:52,169 --> 00:53:53,819
come by the cafe next time and do it to my face.

874
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,679
That seems more affectionate, you know.

875
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:57,939
I'll hang up now. I have clients with me.

876
00:53:57,939 --> 00:54:00,359
N-No, wait! Yoo Ri—

877
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:02,809
Where were we?

878
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:04,219
Oh, to settle!

879
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:07,759
I settled this with the agreement not to file another lawsuit regarding this matter.

880
00:54:07,759 --> 00:54:09,979
I think you can look for another attorney, but

881
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:12,399
I don't think anyone would take your case.

882
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:14,569
Then what do we do?

883
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:16,349
- My gosh...
- So...

884
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,579
if you need any other legal consultation next time,

885
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:20,099
be sure to come to me.

886
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,099
Even if the winning chances are against me,

887
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:24,609
if you want, I'll definitely...

888
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:25,909
definitely...

889
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:27,519
definitely...

890
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:31,999
fight along with you.

891
00:54:43,939 --> 00:54:45,039
More meat.

892
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:46,579
- There.
- Everyone...

893
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:49,449
do you even know what a great thing we accomplished?

894
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,939
In this untact* era,
(T/N: No contact, no touch era post-Covid)

895
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:53,659
we crumbled the wall of misunderstandings, apathy,

896
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:55,199
and hatred among neighbors.

897
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:57,939
Kim Yoo Ri, you always give a speech when you start drinking.

898
00:54:57,939 --> 00:55:01,369
Se Yeon and Jin Ki, you let us use your newlywed home.

899
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:04,179
Doctor, Eun Kang, and Joon,

900
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,279
you showed off your hidden talents.

901
00:55:06,279 --> 00:55:08,049
And our landlord...

902
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,109
as usual, you may be annoying, but

903
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:12,769
you always say what's right.

904
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:15,569
So I was able to set the right direction.

905
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:20,439
In any case, celebrating our Law Cafe's successful first case,

906
00:55:20,439 --> 00:55:21,589
let's give a toast.

907
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:22,979
Cheers!

908
00:55:22,979 --> 00:55:24,749
Cheers!

909
00:55:24,749 --> 00:55:27,669
Cheers!

910
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:31,300
[Law Cafe]

911
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:38,949
Did you play that bass guitar right?

912
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:41,929
Of course...

913
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,589
- Let's drink.
- Good job.

914
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:08,869
Let's play the Truth Game! Truth Game!

915
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,949
She's not able to enunciate her words.

916
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:12,239
I think it's time to call it a night.

917
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,609
Truth Game!

918
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:15,539
I want to play.

919
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,609
I have a question for Eun Kang hyung.

920
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:22,089
As far as I know,

921
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,979
to get five years for arson,

922
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:26,339
it means you set the fire when a person is inside.

923
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:31,039
If so, why did you start the fire, Hyung?

924
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:37,559
He's not telling the truth.

925
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:42,109
All right, then it's my turn!

926
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:47,489
Kim Jeong Ho, be honest.

927
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:49,279
You had fun this time, didn't you?

928
00:56:49,279 --> 00:56:51,939
Working with me, huh?

929
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:55,979
Since when did the Truth Game change into just asking whatever you want to ask?

930
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,719
Hurry up and answer me!

931
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,769
You enjoyed it, right? You had fun, right?

932
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:02,339
You were proud, right?

933
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:05,279
Gosh, this question is too easy.

934
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,239
He answers too quickly. No, no...

935
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:08,949
Change, change. Let's change the question.

936
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:11,299
- Hey, can't do that.
- Wait.

937
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:13,899
I'll ask him something more interesting.

938
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:15,499
Hey, Kim Jeong Ho,

939
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:19,499
Why did you dump me back then?

940
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:20,779
- What?
- Hey...

941
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:23,519
You two were together?

942
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:27,969
Hurry up and answer me! If you're scared to answer, then drink.

943
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:35,429
Were we even together for real?

944
00:57:35,429 --> 00:57:38,509
Hey, even if we were faking it, you did dump me out of the blue.

945
00:57:38,509 --> 00:57:41,939
- Why did you dump me?
- How long did I have to fake it?

946
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:49,209
So why did you have to promise to fake it in the first place?

947
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:52,849
So this drunk attorney was seeing this oppa

948
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,629
and he was two-timing and had eight tentacles like an octopus.

949
00:57:54,629 --> 00:57:56,579
And she got dumped even with him.

950
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:58,379
I'm the one who dumped him!

951
00:57:58,379 --> 00:57:59,879
So she was embarrassed to face her friends

952
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:02,679
and pretended to date Kim Jeong Ho she always hung out with.

953
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,089
In a word, she used me.

954
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,219
Used you?

955
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:09,689
You said you didn't want to be bothered by other people and pretended to date me!

956
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:11,959
We came to an agreement for mutual benefit and enhancement.

957
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:14,789
- You can't knock it like that!
- Hey, hey!

958
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:17,939
Stop fighting, you guys. Aren't you even sick of it?

959
00:58:17,939 --> 00:58:19,229
Fine.

960
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:22,639
- Let's stop it, Kim Jeong Ho.
- Stop what?

961
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:25,559
Playing hard to get, pretending to dislike me when you like me.

962
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,859
I said let's stop that now.

963
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,729
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm okay...

964
00:58:34,729 --> 00:58:38,789
Hey, sit down. Seriously, you're going to regret this big time.

965
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:39,939
No, no, no.

966
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:43,949
I'll make a formal suggestion while I'm at it.

967
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:46,099
Kim Jeong Ho, you!

968
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:47,289
Come to me!

969
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:49,559
I'll be good to you!

970
00:58:50,229 --> 00:58:52,329
I'll treat you right! The best there is!

971
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,029
Become my partner... no, no, no...

972
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:57,449
Become our Law Cafe's—

973
00:58:57,449 --> 00:58:58,949
Are you okay?

974
00:58:58,949 --> 00:58:59,869
Honey!

975
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,919
- Se Yeon!
- Jin Ki!

976
00:59:00,919 --> 00:59:01,679
- Se Yeon!
- Honey!

977
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,949
Hey, are you okay?

978
00:59:05,216 --> 00:59:06,749
My baby is coming out!

979
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:09,019
Oh, taxi! The taxi is here!

980
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:10,179
One, two, three!

981
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,979
Her contractions are already less than four minutes apart!

982
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:13,889
We have to rush!

983
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:15,829
Hang on a little longer, Honey!

984
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:19,389
Ow, ow, it hurts!

985
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:28,969
So pretty...

986
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:35,399
No matter how your world shakes after falling for someone,

987
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:42,169
if one doesn't not start something, nothing happens.

988
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,399
I learned it for sure this time.

989
00:59:45,399 --> 00:59:47,699
The one who vitalizes your life,
[You!]

990
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:49,329
you feel secure no matter what he does.
. [You!]

991
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:51,469
Someone who understands me the most,
[You!]

992
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:55,599
and lead each other toward a better direction.
[You!]

993
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:07,009
But why did you come here instead of going home?

994
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:09,909
I wanted to finish what I was talking about earlier.

995
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:28,099
- Don't.
- Why not?

996
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:29,439
I'm not going to do it anyway.

997
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,799
I didn't even ask you. Why do you say no?

998
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,129
I want to work with you.

999
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,229
I feel secure when you're with me. It's fun working together.

1000
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:38,769
I wish you could join the Law Cafe as a partner lawyer.

1001
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:41,459
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

1002
01:00:41,459 --> 01:00:42,509
I told you last time.

1003
01:00:42,509 --> 01:00:46,799
For the good of everyone, it's best that I don't do anything.

1004
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,189
What do you mean by that?

1005
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,159
It means I just don't want to, and everything is a hassle to me.

1006
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:56,509
Why is everything such a hassle to you and don't want to do anything?

1007
01:00:56,509 --> 01:00:57,659
You!

1008
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:59,439
You're a hassle to me!

1009
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:03,199
I avoided you and wrote out that contract because you're a hassle. Don't you get it?

1010
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,589
Are you that dense, or do you just not want to get it?

1011
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:10,019
Please, I beg you.

1012
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:12,359
Don't bug me anymore.

1013
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,150
Seriously.

1014
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:11,559
♫ Cold wind breezes by my shoulder ♫

1015
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:13,199
Kim Yoo Ri...

1016
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:15,069
Close your eyes.

1017
01:03:15,069 --> 01:03:20,420
♫ The night I could only think of painful memories ♫

1018
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:27,880
♫ Do you remember that time when you came to me quietly to hold my hand ♫

1019
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,509
Don't think about anything.

1020
01:03:29,509 --> 01:03:34,390
♫ My frozen tears were falling ♫

1021
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:41,939
♫ Do you know how I feel? ♫

1022
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:45,539
♫ Do you feel it? ♫

1023
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:50,469
♫ Can you see with kindly eyes? ♫

1024
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:58,699
♫ It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long ♫

1025
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:02,219
♫ Just lean on me ♫

1026
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:07,299
♫ Embrace me just like this ♫

1027
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:12,209
♫ In the blue sky above ♫

1028
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:17,909
♫ An eagle flies high, and a KA-50 is about to swallow the world ♫

1029
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:20,799
♫ And sound of gunshots continue ♫

1030
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:23,759
♫ The soldier on TV victorious in battle ♫

1031
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,099
♫ My angel writing a journal ♫

1032
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:29,379
♫ The figure that will be drawn out on a canvas ♫

1033
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:32,909
♫ The world that she will draw out ♫

[The Law Cafe]

1035
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:38,249
Hey, let, let, let go of me!

1036
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,409
I'm confused these days.

1037
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,449
I don't want to leave you alone, Kim Yoo Ri.

1038
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:44,739
♫ Days like these ♫

1039
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:48,319
Whoa, what an interesting connection!

1040
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,359
You said you've reported to the police for child abuse before, right?

1041
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,499
I've seen him before.

1042
01:04:53,499 --> 01:04:54,749
Soo Ah!

1043
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:57,189
I wish you didn't blame yourself.

1044
01:04:57,189 --> 01:04:59,459
Stop!

1045
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:02,349
I don't want to be family with you.

1046
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:04,159
I want to be someone else to you.

1047

♫ If you were crying ♫

1048
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:09,100
♫ Think how great the world that you'll never get to see again was ♫
