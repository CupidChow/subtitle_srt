1
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,680
   

2
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,460
I did think about that often.

3
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,790
For parents who lose their children in an instant,

4
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,620
or victims who lose all their possessions due to fraud...

5
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,430
Or those who had their lives trampled on by indiscriminate abuse...

6
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,120
When I am sitting in front of them,

7
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,180
No matter what I do as a prosecutor...

8
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,800
I end up asking myself...

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,300
if I could resolve their sadness,

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,440
their sense of injustice,

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,510
and their pain.

12
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,260
 Could the law provide a solution to that? 

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,310
So, what brings you out to this remote spot at this hour, sir?

14
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,460
Sir?

15
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,090
Were you alone?

16
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,470


17
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,320
- Yes— 
 - No.

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,740
He was with us.

19
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,320
I'm Lieutenant Han Se Yeon, head of the Women and Youth Investigation Team at Hongsan Police Station.

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,200
What the...

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,390
Noonim, you were a cop?

22
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,040
Hey, Han Se Yeon, why are you here?

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,300
That's what I want to ask.

24
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,550
Did you guys commit a crime or something? What's with those looks on your faces?

25
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,100
Wow, seriously? How could you say such a thing?

26
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,270
You said you were going to be on maternity leave!

27
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,620
I came back last week.

28
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,900
For the sake of better organizational culture,
you shouldn't be doing this.

29
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Maternity leave is a worker's right guaranteed by the law.

30
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,070
Why would you give that up?

31
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,290
If I take off, I get s***. If I come back, I get s***.

32
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,650
Why so much chit-chat when I choose to have a child and return to work?

33
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,400
Se Yeon was not only a good student,

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,630
she also took on the responsibility of the class president.

35
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,440
She was more like a teacher rather than a student.

36
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,150
 Hey, Young Soo, isn't this basic stuff? 

37
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,680
 

38
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,550
 Hey, Kim Yoo Ri. 

39
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,090
 I told you not to wear slippers to school! 

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,800
 Two penalty points. 

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,700
 Hey, Se Yeon! 

42
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,650
 That bast— 

43
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,310
 - What did you do yesterday? 
 - You, come over here. Come here. 

44
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,990
 - Come here. 
 - Hey, thanks! 

45
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,260
 Come over here! 

46
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,560
 You... 

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,940
 - What is this? 
 - Okay, okay! I'll take it off! 

48
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,530
 - I'll take it off! 
 - And what's with your pants? 

49
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,010
 Ow, my groin! 

50
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,980
 We did this last time! 

51
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,790
 A squared minus B squared, yeah? 

52
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,280
 No! What I'm saying is this, and this is the same! 

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,770
 The second choice is different. The second one. 

54
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,300
 Okay. 

55
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,550
 The reason why you got this answer is because you solved this first. 

56
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,010
 - This problem— 
 - No, that's not it! 

57
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,100
 The front is the same. Only the back is different! 

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,990
 - Kim Yoo Ri, are you stupid? 
 - You solved this last time. 

59
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,630
 Yeah, I solved it last time! 

60
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,360
 You guys, be quiet! 

61
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
 Hey, Se Yeon? 

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,030
 - I was going to warn them— 
 - Teacher, you should hold on for a moment. 

63
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,540
 You guys! You think being smart is all that? 

64
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,170
 Don't you see the others trying to study? 

65
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,330
 If you're going to be noisy, then get out! 

66
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,010
If I ever make eye contact with her while doing something wrong,

67
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,320
I tremble for no reason, you know?

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,430
So, when Se Yeon got accepted to the police academy,

69
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,360
I thought it suited her very much.

70
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,470
Who would've thought we'd ever meet like this...

71
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,070
Okay, I think this is enough greeting.

72
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,130
So, these kids locked you up in here, set the place on fire, and ran away...

73
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,590
Is that what you testified?

74
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,620
Yes.

75
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,580
And you witnessed these kids coming out as you were passing by.

76
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,240
Yes.

77
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,500
What about you guys?

78
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,570
When we heard that this kid went missing,

79
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,490
us four were going around looking for him.

80
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,090
And Min Gyu's friend...

81
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,700
She told us, what... where was it again? The a-abandoned building?

82
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,020
She said he might be at the abandoned building.

83
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,320
This guy runs really fast.

84
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,050
So that's why he was there first.

85
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,840
When you look at the video,

86
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,980
you started filming before the kids started coming out.

87
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,650
Were you in the area before the fire started?

88
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,990
I saw them dragging Min Gyu inside, I got worried, so I waited nearby.

89
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,580
And when I saw the fire, I reported it.

90
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,160
You were searching for the kid because you were worried about him...

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,550
and yet when you saw him being dragged in by those kids,

92
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,450
all you did was just wait outside...

93
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,620
But more importantly, did you guys secure the identities of these kids?

94
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,810
They were caught hiding nearby and are under investigation right now.

95
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,860
You should first take their phones into custody.

96
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,140
It seems like they've been using the videos on their phones to blackmail Min Gyu.

97
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,020
If we're looking for school violence evidence, there should be plenty in them.

98
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,720
Oh, my child!

99
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,670
Min Gyu!

100
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,050
You aren't hurt anywhere?

101
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,550
My child...

102
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,570
It's okay, my child.

103
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,430
It's all right.

104
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,320
   

105
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,430
No, seriously!

106
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,490
That wasn't our doing!

107
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,870
Why don't you believe us?

108
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,040
Be quiet, you little punk.

109
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,630
Is that what that bastard Kim Min Gyu is saying?

110
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,740
That we started the fire?

111
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,420
Just answer the questions.

112
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,470
Did you plan this from the start when you called Min Gyu out?

113
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,030
I told you no!

114
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,700
Then why did you tell him to come out there?

115
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,140
- We were just going to get the money from him— 
 - Hey.

116
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,890
Shut your mouth.

117
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,250
I'll answer when my father gets here.

118
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,710
 Move over! My goodness, what happened! Are you okay? 

119
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,190
Are you not hurt anywhere?

120
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,150
You're okay?

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,250
What do you mean, under arrest?

122
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,340
The kids were just playing around a bit.

123
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,760
- What do you mean, under arrest? 
 - Playing around?

124
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,300
Gang up on him to repeatedly mug and beat a kid,

125
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,440
and torturing him by forcing him to drink water and then blackmailing him with videos.

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,570
And they locked him in a room and set it on fire tonight. Yet "Playing around"?

127
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,010
These kids here...

128
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,310
They're under arrest without a warrant for charges of special assault and arson.

129
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,490
Please come to your senses.

130
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,100
Currently, all you have is circumstantial evidence.

131
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,310
Isn't arrest without a warrant a bit excessive?

132
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,130
We will judge for ourselves.

133
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,550
So what we're saying is...

134
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,690
I don't know about the other stuff, but we didn't start the fire!

135
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,520
This is Kim Min Gyu's doing, Mom!

136
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,000
Y-You see! My child says he didn't do it!

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,310
How dare you accuse him as a perpetrator after listening to only one side!

138
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,090
Bring him here.

139
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,440
- Yeah, hurry up! Bring him here! 
 - Bring him here,

140
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,320
- Yeah, why don't you bring him here? 
 - and let's hear what he's got to say!

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,660
Why isn't he here? Why did you only gather up our kids here?

142
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,330
- How is this fair? 
 - Are you all right?

143
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,260
No, no, you don't do that...

144
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,490
You should say you don't know. Goodness.

145
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,770
I told you to listen to Mommy.

146
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,530
Yes, Honey.

147
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,020
What's his name, Hong Ji Hoon?

148
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,740
Supposedly, the gang leader's father is the mayor of Dowon-gu.

149
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,790
I ignored the station chief nagging me to let them go and just brought them into custody,

150
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,560
but I don't know if I did the right thing.

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
It's a good thing their birthdays had passed,

152
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,900
otherwise, we'd have had to dismiss them with a warning, even if they went on a serial killing spree.

153
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,440
You.

154
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,260
You're hiding something, aren't you?

155
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,930
What do you mean, hiding something?

156
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,280
What!

157
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,870
You think I don't know you?

158
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,810
You're going to respond with only a yes or no from now on.

159
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,240
- No. 
 - I didn't start asking.

160
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,190
There is something wrong with what was testified today.

161
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,880
No.

162
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,450
Regarding this matter,

163
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,240
you are in disagreement with Kim Jeong Ho.

164
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,320
- No. 
 - You liar!

165
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,100
I've never seen you be in agreement with Kim Jeong Ho!

166
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,150
I know that you're hiding something.

167
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,320
You better tell me while I'm still asking nicely!

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,560
You got it?

169
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,320
What's this, a cop threatening a civilian?

170
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
What do you mean? Nobody's threatening anyone here.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,490
I'm just asking because there's obviously something fishy going on here.

172
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,130
Sniff something fishy from the victim's testimony?

173
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,220
Wow, I guess there's a reason why we call cops 'dogs' nowadays.

174
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,260
Oh? You know that a 'dog' is originally a derogatory term for prosecutors, right?

175
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,410
'Dog' or prosecutor... It's been so long since I quit that it doesn't affect me one bit.

176
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,960
Who's responsible for delaying my honey from going home?

177
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,420
Hey, look who we have here.

178
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,370
Isn't this Kim Jeong Ho and Kim Yoo Ri?

179
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,830
Honey, why are you here at my workplace?

180
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,830
I came so we can go home together!

181
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,850
I'm going to be late!

182
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,520
Why are we going to be late? Because of them?

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,240
You guys tell me.

184
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,600
Why are you bothering my honey and delaying her from going home?

185
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,150
Your honey is bothering this innocent civilian.

186
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,970
My honey is the embodiment of cool and chic,

187
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,060
so she doesn't bother anyone like that.

188
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,380
Kim Yoo Ri probably got into some trouble again.

189
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,940
Hey, Do Jin Ki.

190
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,400
You're talking pretty funny.

191
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,360
Although Kim Yoo Ri may be the embodiment of working excessively

192
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,020
and making things worse by getting involved,

193
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,400
she would be helping your cool and chic honey even if she got into some trouble,

194
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,760
- not bothering her. 
 - Are you taking my side or putting me down?

195
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,030
I'm just stating the facts.

196
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,120
All of you, just go home!

197
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,750
Go!

198
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,900
You too!

199
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,290
   

200
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,570
   

201
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,370
   

202
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,970
   

203
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,740
Okay. I understand that those kids had been mistreating Min Gyu.

204
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,260
Of course, they should be punished.

205
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,170
But this is different.

206
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,340
Don't you see that Se Yeon noticed that something was up?

207
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,400
It doesn't matter how much she notices.

208
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,450
The evidence is on our side.

209
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,440
Is that something that an ex-prosecutor should be saying?

210
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,720
The situation is already tangled.

211
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,890
So, it's best to continue in a way that is to our advantage.

212
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,690
I can't do this. I'm against this.

213
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,300
It's already too late to go back.

214
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,030
- It's spilled milk. 
 - No.

215
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,300
It's better to turn back now

216
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,170
than to make matters worse by continuing with this.

217
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,160
What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,960
Are you worried that they might feel it's unfair?

219
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,500
Even if they get sentenced to the juvenile detention center,

220
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,780
they'll only be there for two years as minors.

221
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,810
For adults to plot together

222
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,990
and falsely incriminate children for something they didn't do...

223
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,250
This is also a crime, Eun Kang.

224
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,010
Kids who should be perpetrators become victims instead.

225
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,740
And what about Min Gyu?

226
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,600
What he' s going through now can result in further wounds later on.

227
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,800
And what if we do it by the law?

228
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,710
Assault, injury, blackmail, intimidation,

229
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,400
forced molestation, defamation...

230
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,490
It's endless just to list out their offenses.

231
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,170
Yet, they'd be released after some community service hours, all because they are young.

232
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,270
Then we can help him.

233
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,580
Joon and Doctor, please give your input.

234
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,590
Are we seriously going with this?

235
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,020
Well... although they are really bad bastards,

236
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,430
I also don't think this is right, Hyungnim.

237
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,320
I also think that this unjust way of getting vengeance

238
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,440
will follow Min Gyu around in the future.

239
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,290
Wouldn't there be a wiser way to go about this?

240
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,320
Talking about this without a care in the world...

241
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,200
Eun Kang...

242
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,930
- So...  what I mean is... 
 - Go inside.

243
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,340
I know what you're trying to say.

244
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,540
No, Eun Kang.

245
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,550
I am not trying to blame you, Eun Kang.

246
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,380
- I'm not trying to say that— 
 - I know.

247
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,550
I told you, I get it.

248
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,660
Then and now I am still very much by the book, right?

249
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,480
So boring.

250
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,430
I'm glad you know it, at least.

251
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Oh, my puppy. You're awake.

252
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,200
Hey, Min Gyu! Let's eat breakfast!

253
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,750
- Wow! 
 - Come.

254
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,110
The stew is... You have to eat it right now!

255
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,020
It's so good.

256
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,470
You know it, too, right?

257
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,890
Yesterday, we turned those bastards into perpetrators for attempted murder.

258
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,990
And that's why they're currently held in a cell.

259
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,770
Why?

260
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,180
- Do you feel uncomfortable about that? 
 - No.

261
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,980
How are they any different from perpetrators of attempted murder?

262
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,570
If it wasn't for my grandmother, I wanted to die.

263
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,120
I wanted to kill them all.

264
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,980
Aigoo... The attempted murderer was here all along.

265
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,940
If it's to get away from those kids...

266
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,440
I can do anything.

267
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,430
♫  Your figure passes me by  ♫

268
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,830
Geez... I...

269
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,330
I really don't like saying things like this.

270
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,910
But I've never lost out

271
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,200
on being the top student during all my school days.

272
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,190
I entered law school as the top student as well,

273
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,920
and even the Judicial Research and Training Institute...

274
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,700
I graduated as a top student.

275
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,970
During my eight years working as a prosecutor,

276
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,650
I produced pretty good results.

277
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,940
I'm saying I'm pretty good at what I do.

278
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,440
So, if you want,

279
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,060
I can help you

280
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,660
punish them in an honorable way.

281
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,260
If you think that you'll regret

282
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,520
having done something like this

283
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,100
sometime in your planned future,

284
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,950
or perhaps in your yet unplanned but open future,

285
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,870
just let me know.

286
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,260
I'll come up with a new game plan.

287
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,130
♫  Like the warm sunlight  ♫

288
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,900
♫  Embrace me once again  ♫

289
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,200
   

290
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,480
   

291
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,980
   

292
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,700
I knew it.

293
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,450
I knew something was off when I saw Kim Yoo Ri's face.

294
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,010
Who is responsible for this crazy idea?

295
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,780
- It was all just my— 
 - It was my idea.

296
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,540
He just did what I told him to do.

297
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,660
He's lying. This was all my idea from the start.

298
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,970
No, that's not true.

299
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,960
These hyungs were just trying to help me.

300
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,270
- It was my idea! 
 - What are you doing?

301
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,920
Han Se Yeon, this was all my doing.

302
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,100
No, no. This all started with me.

303
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,170
What are you talking about? I told you what to do!

304
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,640
- I'm the one who set the fire, so it's my fault. 
 - I told you

305
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,400
- You stay out of this. 
 - to testify falsely— you stay out of this.

306
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,310
Are you in your right mind?

307
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,860
- If I just hadn't done what I did from the start... 
 - I told you what to do!

308
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,710
- I told you— 
 - I told you I'm taking responsibility—

309
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,440
Hey!

310
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,330
What are you guys doing in front of this kid?

311
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,250
If you came here with a change of heart, then sit down and give me a proper testimony.

312
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,960
Setting the fire and trying to incriminate them for it, that was my idea.

313
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,950
Min Gyu never agreed to it.

314
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,420
He didn't really have much of a choice because an adult like me told him to do so.

315
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,160
That man wasn't even at the scene of the crime.

316
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,220
He came much later.

317
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,230
But regarding how Min Gyu was tortured by those kids...

318
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,240
That's all true.

319
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,130
Do you understand what you've done?

320
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,970
Not only that, you have a past record.

321
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,340
For arson, it would be a repeated offense and obstruction of justice on top of that.

322
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,900
This could also be charged as fraud or a false accusation.

323
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,090
This is not a light matter.

324
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,990
No, no. It would be too stretched to charge him for fraud or a false accusation.

325
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,420
Fraud means that one deceives a person to receive property or to profit.

326
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,240
In this case, it would be difficult to say that we profited anything from this.

327
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,930
And false accusation...

328
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,170
Well, it is true that we did make a false report last night.

329
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,840
But we came back today to correct our report and tell the truth,

330
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,190
so it would be difficult to claim that there was a real intent to punish them by law.

331
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,170
Yeah, yeah. You're so smart, aren't you?

332
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,720
Han Se Yeon.

333
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,376
Just hand them over to the prosecution team.

334
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,020
I'll handle this situation myself.

335
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,050
But apart from this particular incident,

336
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,610
I'd hope that you'd investigate the school violence case properly.

337
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,630
But who are you to be getting involved in this?

338
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,630
You're not the victim of school violence,

339
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,170
nor are you the one responsible for the arson.

340
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,840
Who are you?

341
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,340
- Tell me! 
 - Me?

342
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,720
I am an attorney.

343
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,500
- What? 
 - You see Seo Eun Kang and Kim Min Gyu here...

344
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,040
I am here as their attorney.

345
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,250
You guys will be getting out of here very soon.

346
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,170
Enjoy your freedom for the short time you will have it.

347
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,880
Since I'll do whatever it takes to put you back in.

348
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
- Who are you, Ahjussi? 
 - Me?

349
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,140
Well... I mean, I'm just...

350
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,140
an ahjussi...

351
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,330
who knows loads of interesting things that are on your phones.

352
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,710
There were lots of interesting things on your phones.

353
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,050
Did you decide to hold onto each other's weaknesses?

354
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,260
What are you talking about?

355
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,760
You should know better than I do.

356
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,190
So, don't think about trying to get back at him  or anything like that.

357
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,460
If this video spreads, you know that going to jail won't be your problem.

358
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,550
You're crazy!

359
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,710
Who the f*** are you?

360
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,920
Be quiet! Quiet.

361
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,270
Some tell me to do this by the law.

362
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,470
But I question whether trash like you guys

363
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,150
can be rehabilitated by letting the law take care of you.

364
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,700
So, you guys...

365
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,940
should be the ones giving me the answer.

366
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,360
Hey!

367
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,110
You little...

368
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,840
F***!

369
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,980
   

370
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,670
There's nothing that says we can't hand drip a coffee mix.

371
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,380
Yeah, we can just pour it like this.

372
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,690
Yeah, just rotate it like that.

373
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,930
Wow, seriously.

374
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,130
That's new!

375
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,740
You said let's do it by the law.

376
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,970
So we did that. So, what now?

377
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,420
Thank you, Eun Kang.

378
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,630
What, I didn't do anything...

379
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,670
Yeah! What did he do, anyway!

380
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,900
Thanks, Min Gyu.

381
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,900
I'll make sure that you'll never regret what you did today.

382
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,450
So, what about those kids?

383
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,380
They've been released, right?

384
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,510
Yeah.

385
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,520
They've been released.

386
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,840
Yeah, they've been let go.

387
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,000
Those guys who made the false report for sure,

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,500
but can't we sue those police officers as well?

389
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,880
How can they just hold kids in a cell after listening to just one party!

390
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,290
Although it feels unfair, it appears the police are fairly prepared regarding school violence,

391
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,580
and are responding strongly to this incident.

392
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,670
Instead of taking any actions such as a lawsuit haphazardly,

393
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,380
it may be better to just keep watch for now.

394
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,390
I mean, this is just ridiculous.

395
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,370
 You guys recorded lots of interesting things on your phones. 

396
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,400
 Did you decide to hold onto each other's weaknesses? 

397
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,810
A hot chamomile tea.

398
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,350
Now, the School Violence Committee meeting will be set soon,

399
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,900
so should we try planning a strategy?

400
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,570
First, an objective needs to be set.

401
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,800
By Min Gyu.

402
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,130
And Grandma needs to determine what she wants.

403
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,980
Proper punishment for the offense,

404
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,820
compensation for the damages,

405
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,080
or... a sincere apology and remorse for their actions.

406
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,100
My gosh, those bastards deserve punishment!

407
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,660
Do you want an apology?

408
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,650
I don't need anything like an apology.

409
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,100
I just don't want to see them again.

410
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,960
I wish they could just disappear.

411
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,170
Okay.

412
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
Understood.

413
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,420
We've understood.

414
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,320
 Hey, is anyone here? 

415
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,380
 Who's the owner here? 

416
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,740
Tell the owner to come out!

417
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,870
- Here... 
 - Our cafe is closed now.

418
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,430
Who are you?

419
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,580
Are you guys responsible for falsely accusing my son?

420
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,410
Oh, so it was you.

421
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,790
Kim Min Gyu, or something like that.

422
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,590
You don't have any parents and haven't been taught anything at home,

423
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,810
so you would do something like this.

424
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,110
This man! How dare you speak like that!

425
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,920
Who the f*** are you to say that someone's child has been taught or not!

426
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,230
All right. Are you speaking like this because you're so well-educated?

427
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,020
T-T-This...

428
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,510
This barely of-age b****...

429
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,990
Do you even know who I am?

430
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,870
You're right. Who are you, buddy?

431
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,590
Who are you to barge in like this and act all high and mighty?

432
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,560
Yeah! At least introduce yourself!

433
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,690
Time to introduce yourself!

434
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,220
He is Hong Seong Pil, the mayor of the Dowon-gu.

435
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,920
Also, the father of Hong Ji Hoon.

436
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,470
Oh, is that the case?

437
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,940
Did someone in public office just barge into a business like this

438
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,250
and say slanderous things like "barely of-age b****"?

439
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,590
I guess you don't even use the Internet?

440
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,840
You do realize all of this is being recorded, right?

441
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,530
You...

442
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,390
My son slept on that cold floor for a day, all because of you guys.

443
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,470
Do you know that?

444
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,070
My precious son could have been hurt by your actions.

445
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,900
You think guys like you could do anything to even touch my son in any way?

446
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,390
Hey, you!

447
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,240
You think only your kid is precious?

448
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,420
This all started because your kid bothered my precious kid first!

449
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,280
- Didn't you say that she was an attorney? 
 - Yes...

450
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,790
She is, but...

451
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,270
Then why are you saying that he's your kid?

452
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,490
Because I decided that all the kids in this neighborhood would be my kids!

453
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,120
Yeah, they're my kids! So what?

454
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,270
They're my kids!

455
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,720
 But whenever I watch Yoo Ri, I start thinking this way. 

456
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,940
Doing things by the law

457
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,340
won't provide sufficient relief to the victims,

458
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,300
but what the law can't provide

459
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,290
can perhaps be filled by people.

460
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,180
If you're done with your nuisance repertoire, then leave.

461
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,400
If you have any complaints, then complain to the police.

462
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,690
From now on, don't you even dare think about

463
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,760
coming anywhere near the victim!

464
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,990
- You got that? 
 - Go!

465
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,350
That little...

466
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,700
- Aigoo, you did well. 
 - You did well.

467
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,920
Oh, yeah!

468
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,910
Bravo!

469
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,270
Our boss managed to pull it off against the nuisance!

470
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,650
Aigoo, you did really well.

471
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,830
Rude bastards like him need to come to their senses.

472
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,960
Hey, hey, hey. Stop egging her on like that.

473
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,230
If you keep doing that, she'll become full of herself.

474
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,660
Min Gyu, why are you crying?

475
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,140
It's okay.

476
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,170
♫  An iron chain around my neck  ♫

477
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,340
Hey, go and comfort him!

478
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,200
- Me? 
 - Yeah, go and try to console him!

479
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,250
Hey, Min Gyu!

480
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,600
Don't cry.

481
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,580
- All of us here are on your side. 
 - Yeah, we're on your side.

482
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,380
 That just having someone take your side 

483
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,500
 can free someone up to finally breathe 

484
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,660
 and act as a major source of solace. 

485
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,340
♫  This too shall pass  ♫

486
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,960
♫  Walk with me  ♫

487
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,690
♫  Let's breathe deeply and cry it out  ♫

488
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,290
Hyung!

489
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,320
What's up?

490
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,820
I heard about your younger sister.

491
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,650
Bae Joon, that bastard...

492
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,560
Did you do this for me

493
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,970
because you thought of your younger sister?

494
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,490
No, it's not that.

495
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,330
- You're different from my younger sister. 
 - Then...

496
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,040
why did you help me?

497
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,690
I thought it was admirable of you

498
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,410
to choose to perhaps kill rather than to give up and die. 
 ♫  Look at me and smile  ♫

499
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,620
If I were by myself that day,

500
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,620
I couldn't have mustered up the courage

501
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,100
and ultimately, I wouldn't be able to do anything.

502
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,850
Thank you...

503
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,780
for stepping into my swamp.

504
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,650
Because of you, I have people taking my side for the first time in my life.

505
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,010
I am really grateful.

506
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,190
And I... 
 ♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

507
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,830
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

508
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,050
I promise I won't ever die...

509
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,870
Hyung.

510
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:15,670
♫  Be brave and just like you did before  ♫

511
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,630
♫  Look at me and smile  ♫

512
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:25,310
♫  The glance that is like the light  ♫

513
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:31,010
♫  You're looking at me as if you feel much better  ♫

514
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,790
 And that solace is contagious 

515
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,620
 and can act as medicine for another person's 

516
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,640
 old, worn-out wounds. 

517
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,680
I just have those thoughts

518
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,000
when I look at Kim Yoo Ri.

519
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,440
What are you thinking about?

520
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,890
Why did you exclude me earlier?

521
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,940
What?

522
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,240
Are you pretending not to know what I'm saying?

523
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,980
Around noon at the cafe earlier,

524
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,820
I'm talking about you hugging Seo Eun Kang so naturally.

525
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,600
I also hugged Min Gyu, not only Eun Kang.

526
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,430
But you skipped over me.

527
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,500
Of course, I know that hug was expressing your overwhelming emotions and gratefulness.

528
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,800
But if that's the case, it's reasonable to

529
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,360
hug me first since I brought about this situation, no?

530
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,610
I wanted to give you more than a hug

531
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,830
so I had to hold myself back with all my supernatural strength.

532
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,170
♫  I guess I recognize your laughter  ♫

533
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,220
Tell me if you've got any complaints. I can change that anytime.

534
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:51,440
♫  She's waking me up with that pretty smile  ♫

535
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,270
♫  You make me smile  ♫

536
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,740
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

537
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,360
Criminal Code... Article 298.

538
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,420
I guess you forgot that time when you were begging me not to sue you in tears in front of my house, huh?

539
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,660
Forget?

540
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,620
It's one of the top ten worst moments of my life. I'm reminded of it every night.

541
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,400
♫  I send my heart  ♫

542
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,290
Just kidding.

543
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,810
Thanks.

544
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,040
I opposed your method, but you still...

545
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,290
sided with Eun Kang and Min Gyu.

546
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,200
You have no idea how secure I feel and thankful I am.

547
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,390
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

548
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,210
Why are you thankful for that?

549
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,980
Kim Min Gyu was my client, to begin with.

550
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,000
Is this the same Kim Jeong Ho who said how nosy I am?

551
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,800
♫  It must have been love, my heart for you  ♫

552
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,780
- Now... y-you... go home... You can go home alone, right? 
 - Oh, okay.

553
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,340
I'm going, I'm going.

554
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,050
Bye!

555
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,970
♫  I keep seeing you in front of me  ♫

556
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,730
♫  I think of you wherever I go  ♫

557
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:13,600
♫  I wonder if she knows how I feel  ♫

558
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,000
Geez! What the heck!

559
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,280
Because you have too many worries...

560
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,530
No wonder you can't hit far. Geez, seriously.

561
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,870
- What are you saying? 
 - You know...

562
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,090
To get into politics, you forced your older son

563
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,000
to go into military service when he's such a weakling.

564
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,010
I hear your youngest son is causing you some grief these days.

565
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,860
How do you know that, CEO Lee...

566
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,830
Is the word out already?

567
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,550
Not that.

568
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,380
There's someone I'm interested in these days.

569
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,160
I just happened to find out.

570
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,570
- Nice shot. 
 - Nice shot!

571
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,200
If this goes to a juvenile court,

572
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,590
in the worst case scenario, he'll end up in a juvenile detention center.

573
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,470
But if the prosecutor doesn't cooperate and if it goes over to the criminal division,

574
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,600
it will leave a criminal record.

575
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,790
I mean, he's only 14 years old.

576
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,940
There's no need to have red writing in his record over such a small matter.

577
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,140
That can't be!

578
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,050
I mean, he's your son, Mayor.

579
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,740
The prosecutor should take care of it for you.

580
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,100
All right...

581
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,990
I'll... put in a call to the Prosecutors' Office

582
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,070
so they'll assign the case to the right person.

583
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,860
But the problem is...

584
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,330
the lawyer on the other side is such a nutcase.

585
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,900
Right? She's such a psycho.

586
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,130
But she's pretty, though.

587
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,010
So, you know... who she is, CEO Lee?

588
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,970
I know her well.

589
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,370
I'm... such a... fan of hers to the core.

590
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,680
So, you want me to look into Dowon-gu mayor

591
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,890
and the attackers' parents

592
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,750
to see if they have anything fishy?

593
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,300
Yeah.

594
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,610
Tax evasion, bribery, embezzlement...

595
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,300
and power tripping. Anything will do.

596
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,250
Whoa, Writer Kim, you don't write what I ask you to.

597
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,210
When did you become a parent without me knowing?

598
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,210
Oh, I'm going to give up writing.

599
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,050
I didn't tell you that, huh?

600
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,280
Give up writing? What are you talking about?

601
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,310
You told me to set up a publishing office, and you're quitting writing?

602
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,900
Who's the one who enticed me to write web novels saying the market is hot?

603
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,660
This place is the only one that failed out, of all the companies I invested!

604
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,840
It hurts my ego.

605
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,220
I'm bringing it back up slowly!

606
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,930
And we planned to retire together!

607
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,020
You can't stab me in the back like this!

608
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,650
So why did you get me mixed up in your retirement plan?

609
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,160
Geez! I'm leaving.

610
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,650
- Where are you going in the middle of eating? 
 - To work.

611
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,100
So, you did find someone else!

612
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,350
What kind of business is it?

613
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,910
I can do a good job too!

614
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,040
What are you talking about? A lawsuit?

615
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,720
    
 Violation of the Attorney Act?

616
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,940
They're flat-out telling me to come out on the day of the School Violence Committee meeting.

617
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,180
Who the hell are these childish bastards!

618
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,970
I'm sorry.

619
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,470
I think it's my fault, Boss...

620
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,440
I did give consultation to a few clients who were waiting around...

621
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,640
Hey, Joon!

622
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,710
If someone who isn't a lawyer gives wrong legal advice,

623
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,520
you could be punished. Didn't you know that?

624
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,300
   

625
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,800
   

626
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,640
 Min Gyu! 

627
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,500
Oh, no... What happened...

628
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,260
There was a report at the district office.

629
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,980
They just barged in and said

630
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,700
we violated food sanitation law, and we sold alcohol to minors...

631
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,040
They left the place in complete ruin.

632
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,700
What?

633
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,630
Violation of the Attorney Act?

634
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,330
Geez... Oh, come on!

635
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,150
That makes me look so petty!

636
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,080
Is that the only thing you could make an issue out of?

637
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,780
My apologies.

638
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,190
Geez...

639
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,720
This makes us look bad.

640
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,310
What did the Prosecutor's Office say?

641
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,850
Yes, they said it was assigned to a very sharp and sensible prosecutor.

642
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,850
What an obvious thing for them to say.

643
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,510
Geez, I wanted to have some fun with this.

644
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,530
Why am I bothering with raising someone else's child?

645
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,780
Geez...

646
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,720
It's regretful that I can't see her expression in real time.

647
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,350
That a**hole Mayor Hong! I knew he'd be nasty, but...

648
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,860
this is pretty creative.

649
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,280
Creative?

650
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,180
As for the  business suspension, you can request administrative judgment.

651
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,650
The School Violation Countermeasure Committee?

652
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,930
I'll go in your place.

653
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,070
You think you could... do a good job at the committee meeting?

654
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,170
Hey, don't you know who I am?

655
00:38:09,806 --> 00:38:11,386
   
 The reason School Violence Countermeasure Committee is crucial is because 

656
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:14,246
 the attackers should go through the judicial process 

657
00:38:14,246 --> 00:38:19,166
 but more importantly, they could enforce forced transfer, preventing them from facing each other. 

658
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,306
    
 They force-fed him water and beverages

659
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:23,086
and stopped him from going to the restroom.

660
00:38:23,086 --> 00:38:27,136
    
 And they demanded money and goods in return.

661
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:30,106
With these methods, they took about 100,000 won per week.

662
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:32,976
The amount they extorted from Min Gyu over six months

663
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:35,916
is over 3 million won in total.

664
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:39,286
Out of these, the most vicious incident was

665
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:42,476
    
 when they stripped him in the restroom last May

666
00:38:42,476 --> 00:38:45,116
    
 and blackmailed him with a video.

667
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:47,806
Since that day, they stalked him in and out of school

668
00:38:47,806 --> 00:38:50,806
    
 and demanded money. If he denied them,

669
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:54,206
    
 they did not hesitate to physically assault him.

670
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:58,596
From this point on, I'll prove what I've laid out—

671
00:38:58,596 --> 00:38:59,956
Chairman?

672
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:03,656
This is not a criminal court.

673
00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:06,566
There is no need to use difficult legalese

674
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:10,066
to bring down the mood of this meeting.

675
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:11,566
I see...

676
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:15,696
Bodily harm, physical assault, imprisonment, intimidation,

677
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:18,046
abduction and inducement, defamation,

678
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:20,196
humiliation, threats, coercion,

679
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:22,176
sexual assault.

680
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:24,696
Are these words too heavy for you?

681
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:30,376
I used the most appropriate expression to describe the attacks that had occurred.

682
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:32,246
If my expression was too heavy and difficult,

683
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,866
my apologies to you.

684
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:35,496
I'm sorry.

685
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:39,376
 I know this because I've attended one before. 

686
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:43,316
 The School Violence Committee is different from a courtroom where a prosecutor and attorney argue. 

687
00:39:43,316 --> 00:39:45,226
 The committee members comprise parents 

688
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:47,966
 and they just drive the argument to say it was a kids' fight. 

689
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:51,476
 So, it's not easy to prove that the attacks were one-sided. 

690
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:56,086
 It's not easy to accept student Kim Min Gyu's statement as completely true, 

691
00:39:56,086 --> 00:40:00,546
because you set fire to an abandoned building recently

692
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:02,616
and falsely reported to the police

693
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:06,066
saying that the three students tried to harm you, didn't you?

694
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:08,886
 That actually happened? 

695
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:11,676
Attorney Nam...

696
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,836
This isn't a criminal court, but...

697
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:16,006
you should state the facts properly.

698
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,706
The student victim did not start the fire and made a false report.

699
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:22,346
An adult who knew of his situation and

700
00:40:22,346 --> 00:40:24,476
tried to help did that.

701
00:40:31,036 --> 00:40:33,156
Because it was so terrible...

702
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:36,216
How terrible could it have been that he tried to do such a thing to help him out?

703
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:37,976
- That's because... 
 - "Because it was so terrible..."

704
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:40,206
It means "the degree of pain or situation was terrible."

705
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,316
That's what it means in our language.

706
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:45,476
Please watch an evidence video to grasp

707
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,886
how terrible things were.

708
00:40:48,886 --> 00:40:51,156
 Take it off if you want to pee. 

709
00:40:51,156 --> 00:40:52,646
   

710
00:40:52,646 --> 00:40:54,576
 - Come on. 
 - Take it off. 

711
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:56,286
I said pee.

712
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:58,106
You said you really had to go earlier.

713
00:40:58,106 --> 00:40:59,466
Hurry up and pee.

714
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:01,566
Hurry up and pee, Min Gyu. Go.

715
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:03,526
Hurry up and pee! Pee!

716
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:04,926
 Pee! 

717
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:06,816
 Hurry up and pee! 

718
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,576
 Pee... 

719
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:10,266
 Pee... 

720
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,506
 Can't believe you actually peed just because we said so. 

721
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:14,746
 Whoa... 

722
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:17,096
 Don't you feel good now? 

723
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:19,346
 Don't you feel good now? 

724
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:25,096
Well, there's no need to watch more of it.

725
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:28,556
Chairman! The source of this video and how it was obtained are uncertain.

726
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:30,026
It cannot be evidence.

727
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:33,406
Attorney Nam... This isn't a criminal court.

728
00:41:33,406 --> 00:41:36,206
So whether the evidence was obtained legally or not

729
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:38,526
isn't all that important.

730
00:41:38,526 --> 00:41:41,406
 Lastly, the easiest way to get the truth out when the accomplices 

731
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:46,076
 are gathered together is, of course... 

732
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:47,476
 Play one side against the other. 

733
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:51,036
The restroom toll issue led by student Park Si Woo...

734
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:52,606
What are you talking about?

735
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:55,116
What did my son lead?

736
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:58,226
That's what other students' statements said.

737
00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:00,316
Give me a moment.

738
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:01,796
Wait...

739
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:06,946
"I helped out because Si Woo said we could make money that way, but

740
00:42:06,946 --> 00:42:08,916
I felt bad for other kids."

741
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:12,366
That's what students Jong Seok and Ji Hoon's statements

742
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:14,666
say without leaving out a word.

743
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:18,456
Attorney!

744
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:23,186
I mean, what is your intention behind misleading the students' statements?

745
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:28,446
Attorney Nam, you're here to represent Hong Ji Hoon, to be precise, right?

746
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:29,996
Unbelievable.

747
00:42:29,996 --> 00:42:34,026
My child hung out with the wrong kids, and that's why he's dragged into this.

748
00:42:34,026 --> 00:42:36,456
He's a victim, too, to be honest.

749
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:38,846
He had no choice but to be dragged around because he was scared of Hong Ji Hoon.

750
00:42:38,846 --> 00:42:41,246
How dare you accuse him!

751
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:43,296
Si Woo's mom, please calm down.

752
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:45,656
Don't you know he's just trying to pit us against each other?

753
00:42:45,656 --> 00:42:47,896
Calm down, my a**!

754
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:49,916
When my child tried to stop it,

755
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:53,936
that punk Hong Ji Hoon threatened him with a video!

756
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:56,266
Look at this woman! Are you crazy?

757
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:58,856
Do you think it'd become my son's fault just because you two are in on it?

758
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:00,526
Don't even try!

759
00:43:00,526 --> 00:43:02,676
I saved a record of everything your son did!

760
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:04,246
Look at this woman! Seriously!

761
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,156
How dare you!

762
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:07,906
You must be crazy!

763
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:11,946
Come on, stop!

764
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:14,246
- How dare you! 
 - Stop!

765
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:17,926
Chairman, sh-shouldn't you stop them?

766
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,636
I was wondering who you were, Ahjussi.

767
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:36,306
You're just Kim Min Gyu's lawyer?

768
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,506
Hey, man. You should say a proper greeting first.

769
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:41,986
Have you been well?

770
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,286
Even if you did all that, I'd just be forced to transfer.

771
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:46,836
Why are you working so hard?

772
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:50,816
Well...

773
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:54,190
I'm just doing my best.

774
00:43:55,056 --> 00:43:57,346
What video is it?

775
00:43:57,346 --> 00:44:00,606
Is it okay for a lawyer to blackmail people like this?

776
00:44:02,496 --> 00:44:04,506
Why?

777
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:07,766
Are you that scared?

778
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:10,136
Geez, what will you do?

779
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:11,706
What would it take for you to delete it?

780
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:15,406
Hey, you should think hard about that and make an appeal to me.

781
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:19,856
Do I have to spell out how to apologize and write a letter of remorse?

782
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:22,136
Geez! So frustrating...

783
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:26,446
Don't do anything tonight.

784
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:29,216
Be sure to watch the news.

785
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:36,856
Did you wait long?

786
00:44:44,236 --> 00:44:48,276
 To cover up his son's school violence, the fact that Mayor Hong Seong Pil 

787
00:44:48,276 --> 00:44:53,036
 tried to blackmail the victim and parents was revealed causing quite a stir. 

788
00:44:53,036 --> 00:44:54,806
 Here is Reporter Kim Sung Eun reporting. 

789
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:56,786
 Due to a report from a victim 
   

790
00:44:56,786 --> 00:44:59,766
 in a middle school in Dowon-gu, Mayor Head Hong's son's 
   

791
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:02,586
 continual school violence was revealed. 

792
00:45:02,586 --> 00:45:04,846
 While the police were investigating this case, 

793
00:45:04,846 --> 00:45:08,356
 it was revealed that Mayor Hong had been blackmailing the school and his homeroom teacher 

794
00:45:08,356 --> 00:45:13,336
 and tried to cover up the school violence. 

795
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,756
Please tell me, Teacher.

796
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:17,196
Back then...

797
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:20,406
Ji Hoon and the other kids were only 14 years old

798
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:23,026
so they weren't eligible for punishment.

799
00:45:23,026 --> 00:45:25,816
And the principal wanted to keep things quiet.

800
00:45:25,816 --> 00:45:28,776
Rather than do something foolish, I decided to cover it up.

801
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:31,986
That's what I concluded.

802
00:45:31,986 --> 00:45:34,406
At the time, the things that

803
00:45:34,406 --> 00:45:36,916
Mayor Hong said to blackmail you...

804
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:39,966
By chance, did you record that?

805
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:41,526
Yes.

806
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:45,796
 I heard it's tough to become a full-time teacher these days. 

807
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:48,746
 It was challenging for you to get that position. You can't lose it so easily, can you? 

808
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:53,536
 Teacher, you can't pay attention to all the small things in life... 

809
00:46:01,406 --> 00:46:02,476
 Right? 

810
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:05,316
 Mayor Hong Seong Pil... 

811
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:07,006
 insisted that the recording is not valid 

812
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:09,076
 and was fabricated. 
   

813
00:46:09,076 --> 00:46:11,776
 However, while seriously tarnishing his reputation due to this incident, 

814
00:46:11,776 --> 00:46:13,436
 if the people in the video 

815
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:17,126
 does not step forward to restore his reputation, 

816
00:46:17,126 --> 00:46:20,266
 he added that he'll go after them for accountability. 

817
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:22,736
Why isn't he picking up!

818
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:26,806
 It was revealed that an executive Im of SG Chemical has been embezzling 

819
00:46:26,806 --> 00:46:30,046
 about 20 billion won for ten years since 2010. 

820
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:32,376
 The Prosecutors' Office has begun the investigation. 

821
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:35,986
 The seize and search warrants were issued for the executive's residence and office 

822
00:46:35,986 --> 00:46:37,796
 and the investigation is underway. 

823
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:41,536
 The prosecution suspects that Im has used an overseas paper company and account with a borrowed name 

824
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:44,676
 to hide the company funds. 

825
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,926
Wow! That makes me feel so good!

826
00:46:47,926 --> 00:46:49,746
Wow! That totally hits the spot!

827
00:46:49,746 --> 00:46:51,416
- Whoa! 
 - Nice!

828
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,296
Hyung, smile. It's all good!

829
00:46:53,296 --> 00:46:55,066
Min Gyu, smile, okay?

830
00:46:55,066 --> 00:46:56,956
Oh, and Jeong Ho hyung...

831
00:46:56,956 --> 00:46:59,956
Where is Jeong Ho hyungnim...

832
00:46:59,956 --> 00:47:01,506
He must be somewhere.

833
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:02,626
Right on! He's got to be somewhere.

834
00:47:02,626 --> 00:47:05,536
Boss, good work!

835
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:06,686
Applause!

836
00:47:06,686 --> 00:47:08,986
So are we all going to eat some meat tonight?

837
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:11,056
- Oh, meat and a drink? 
 - Meat and a drink?

838
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:12,996
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

839
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,426
Let's go eat meat!

840
00:47:18,146 --> 00:47:20,076
The second drawer in the library...

841
00:47:20,076 --> 00:47:22,456
- Yes. 
 - Be sure to get the files in there.

842
00:47:22,456 --> 00:47:23,536
Don't you worry.

843
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:25,076
Goodnight, Prosecutor. I'll call you.

844
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,316
- Thank you! 
 - Sure thing!

845
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:31,066
Yes, Sunbaenim.

846
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:32,546
Yes, yes, yes.

847
00:47:32,546 --> 00:47:35,666
I just left the scene.

848
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:36,856
Ah, yes...

849
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:40,676
It looks like it'll work itself out, thanks to you.

850
00:47:40,676 --> 00:47:42,166
Yes.

851
00:47:52,056 --> 00:47:55,766
I'll come and pay a visit sometime. Thank you.

852
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:06,816
Cheers!

853
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:08,806
This is all cooked.

854
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:09,866
Eat.

855
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:13,306
Eat a lot of this food. You have to become someone cool like me later, okay?

856
00:48:13,306 --> 00:48:15,036
Don't become like him.

857
00:48:15,036 --> 00:48:16,226
Okay, got it.

858
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,666
Why not? I helped you get your fishing pole back.

859
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:22,516
   

860
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:24,906
It's so good! My gosh!

861
00:48:24,906 --> 00:48:26,756
- Wow! 
 - It's so hot!

862
00:48:26,756 --> 00:48:28,896
Why isn't he picking up?

863
00:48:28,896 --> 00:48:32,076
- It's good. 
 - This and that are different meats.

864
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,496
Thank you!

865
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:35,246
Excuse me, but...

866
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,196
I'll stop by the cafe, but I'll be back.

867
00:48:37,196 --> 00:48:39,116
- Why? 
 - Where are you going, Unni?

868
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,236
I'll be back.

869
00:48:40,236 --> 00:48:41,336
It's late. Let me go with you.

870
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:42,416
Oh, no! No need...

871
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:44,066
It's late. I'll go with you.

872
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:45,306
We'll be right back.

873
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:47,936
- You too? 
 - We'll be back!

874
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:13,816
Why are you doing all this? What are you looking for?

875
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:16,576
This a**hole has all of our videos!

876
00:49:16,576 --> 00:49:17,936
Really?

877
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:20,726
Why do you think I did all this?

878
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:23,356
- Geez! 
 - Hey...

879
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:26,306
But, is someone coming here?

880
00:49:26,306 --> 00:49:29,396
Things are a mess at our house. No one is coming here. Come on!

881
00:49:29,396 --> 00:49:30,726
Let's say we find videos and delete them.

882
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:32,956
What will you do with him after?

883
00:49:32,956 --> 00:49:34,036
We have to kill him.

884
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,076
What the f***!

885
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:39,366
Whether we let him go now or kill him, it's all the same.

886
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:41,366
Hey, let's go.

887
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:45,236
How much longer do we have to get blamed for all the crazy things this a**hole pulled?

888
00:49:47,596 --> 00:49:49,376
What did you just say?

889
00:49:49,376 --> 00:49:51,176
Hey, Cafeteria Boys! 
  (T/N: Making fun of the fact that they're young and eat school food) 

890
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:52,286
Hey...

891
00:49:52,286 --> 00:49:55,636
whoever wants to leave, go.

892
00:49:55,636 --> 00:49:58,156
Why don't we come to an agreement here?

893
00:49:58,156 --> 00:50:01,056
My arms hurt now!

894
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:05,246
Hey, you guys. Special injury, abduction, and imprisonment on top of it.

895
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:08,886
If you made things much worse like this, isn't this enough?

896
00:50:10,566 --> 00:50:12,106
- Hey! Hey, wait for me! 
 - Hey!

897
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:14,806
Hey, release me before you go!

898
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:29,826
Hey, Se Yeon.

899
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,386
Kim Yoo Ri, where are you right now?

900
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:33,566
I can't reach Kim Jeong Ho, so I'm looking—

901
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:36,576
 Come to the address I'll text you. 

902
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,736
Hong Ji Hoon took Kim Jeong Ho.

903
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:42,126
 His friends reported it, so we're being dispatched right now. 

904
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:08,456
Hey.

905
00:51:08,456 --> 00:51:11,886
Your friends left and after a long discussion,

906
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:14,706
it's highly likely that they'll report you to the police.

907
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:17,916
Why don't you release me and talk?

908
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,776
Why should I?

909
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,846
Tell me the password for this.

910
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,926
Tell me.

911
00:51:25,546 --> 00:51:27,646
Hey, Hong Ji Hoon.

912
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:32,566
Tell me! I said tell me!

913
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:34,656
Tell me! Tell me!

914
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,226
Tell me! Tell me!

915
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,546
5-5234! 5234! 5234!

916
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,290
   

917
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,406
   

918
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:57,356
It looks like you've pulled such an extreme stunt like this because of my threat.

919
00:51:57,356 --> 00:52:01,416
I'm sorry, but there aren't such videos.

920
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,046
What?

921
00:52:03,046 --> 00:52:04,846
I said there aren't any.

922
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:07,866
I just threw it out there, hoping you'd experience the torment.

923
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:10,786
You took the bait.

924
00:52:10,786 --> 00:52:13,636
 - Good day. 
 - Okay. 

925
00:52:15,486 --> 00:52:17,576
 It's possible to make criminal charges. 

926
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:21,156
 He had tons of things on his cell phone. These guys are vicious. 

927
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:22,676
 They even threatened each other. 

928
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:24,766
 It's pretty crazy. 

929
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:33,656
There aren't any videos.

930
00:52:33,656 --> 00:52:35,806
You should just stop now.

931
00:52:41,836 --> 00:52:44,646
Hello! Is anyone home?

932
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,476
It's the police!

933
00:52:47,476 --> 00:52:49,596
Is anyone home?

934
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:56,326
The police!

935
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:58,506
Se Yeon, are you sure he's here?

936
00:52:58,506 --> 00:52:59,816
Yeah, probably.

937
00:52:59,816 --> 00:53:02,486
Wait. We'll break down the door.

938
00:53:02,486 --> 00:53:03,846
Can't open it?

939
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:05,266
We can't open it.

940
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,206
Call.

941
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:24,636
Tell me.

942
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:27,566
You're lying to me, right?

943
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:29,786
I'm not. I really don't have any.

944
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:32,386
So stop. You'll get into huge trouble at this rate.

945
00:53:32,386 --> 00:53:34,966
I'm screwed already.

946
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:38,206
Would anything change if I beat you to a pulp?

947
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:41,780
Since I'm a minor, no matter how tough a verdict,

948
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,320
I'd get out before I turn twenty.

949
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:49,196
See?

950
00:53:49,196 --> 00:53:51,616
You can't deny what I say!

951
00:53:56,676 --> 00:53:58,980
What should I do to make this fun?

952
00:54:03,236 --> 00:54:05,526
Try screaming.

953
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:07,786
Ask for help.

954
00:54:13,376 --> 00:54:15,136
Just hit me.

955
00:54:15,936 --> 00:54:18,716
Rather than people finding out, I got kidnapped by a cafeteria kid,

956
00:54:18,716 --> 00:54:20,526
I'll just die here.

957
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:22,626
Just hit me!

958
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:30,756
Because of you, do you know what torture I went through?

959
00:54:32,316 --> 00:54:33,446
When are they coming?

960
00:54:33,446 --> 00:54:36,346
I called them. They're on their way.

961
00:54:36,346 --> 00:54:39,236
- Ask the neighbors for cooperation. 
 - We did.

962
00:55:05,956 --> 00:55:07,966
Kim Yoo Ri?

963
00:55:09,216 --> 00:55:11,126
 Move! 

964
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:27,386
I'm sorry, but...

965
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:32,566
whether that video exists or not you're destined to be tormented.

966
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:36,946
No matter what you do, in every shining and happy moment,

967
00:55:36,946 --> 00:55:42,186
this incident will become your shame and will be revealed to the world.

968
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:45,436
You'll live in fear and anxiety all your life.

969
00:55:45,436 --> 00:55:47,176
Shut up!

970
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:49,816
Shut up! Please!

971
00:55:49,816 --> 00:55:53,996
So don't shine nor be happy.

972
00:55:53,996 --> 00:55:57,326
Just live quietly and breathe.

973
00:55:58,626 --> 00:56:00,076
Shut up!

974
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:02,656
I said shut up! Please!

975
00:56:13,446 --> 00:56:16,186
- Kim Yoo Ri! 
 - What's wrong with her?

976
00:56:18,586 --> 00:56:19,876
What are you doing? Get ready!

977
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:20,876
Pardon?

978
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:22,206
- Let's go in! 
 - Yes, Sir!

979
00:56:22,206 --> 00:56:23,926
Let's go!

980
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:26,896
Let go!

981
00:56:26,896 --> 00:56:28,806
Kim Jeong Ho!

982
00:56:28,806 --> 00:56:30,936
Hey! Move, you a**hole!

983
00:56:30,936 --> 00:56:32,756
Are you okay? Let me see.

984
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:33,816
Let go!

985
00:56:33,816 --> 00:56:35,216
Did he bite you?

986
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:37,016
You're bleeding!

987
00:56:37,016 --> 00:56:38,566
No. I'm okay.

988
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:40,906
Are you okay? Anywhere else?

989
00:56:40,906 --> 00:56:44,206
Let go! Let go, man!

990
00:56:46,226 --> 00:56:48,296
You punk!

991
00:56:50,246 --> 00:56:51,706
- Hey! 
 - Let go!

992
00:56:51,706 --> 00:56:53,656
- Hey, hey! 
 - You a**hole!

993
00:56:53,656 --> 00:56:55,906
He has to feel it to know how much it hurts!

994
00:56:55,906 --> 00:56:58,076
- Get over here, man! 
 - Who the hell are you!

995
00:56:58,076 --> 00:57:00,336
Who the hell? Get over here!

996
00:57:00,336 --> 00:57:02,486
Yoo Ri, calm down. Just ignore him.

997
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,736
- Come at me! 
 - That's right! That's what I'm doing!

998
00:57:04,736 --> 00:57:07,136
Hey! Calm her down!

999
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:09,576
She crashed her car to get in here!

1000
00:57:09,576 --> 00:57:10,676
Hey! Take him!

1001
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,816
- Take him! 
 - Yes! Let's go!

1002
00:57:12,816 --> 00:57:14,036
You a**hole!

1003
00:57:14,036 --> 00:57:15,516
I'll kill you!

1004
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:18,206
Calm down. Calm down for now.

1005
00:57:18,946 --> 00:57:21,186
That motherf***er...

1006
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:24,426
- Let go! 
 - Let's go.

1007
00:57:24,426 --> 00:57:25,816
You won't get away with this!

1008
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:27,386
Let's go!

1009
00:57:27,386 --> 00:57:29,196
The more you move, the more it will hurt you!

1010
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,326
That a**hole...

1011
00:57:34,226 --> 00:57:36,836
He learned all the bad things...

1012
00:57:37,896 --> 00:57:39,836
Kim Yoo Ri...

1013
00:57:42,846 --> 00:57:44,546
Yoo Ri...

1014
00:57:47,076 --> 00:57:49,476
Why are you crying?

1015
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:56,166
What happened here?

1016
00:57:57,566 --> 00:57:59,016
I just got hurt. So what!

1017
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:00,776
Hey, you didn't just get hurt here.

1018
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:03,206
- It's bleeding! 
 - Why are you yelling?

1019
00:58:03,206 --> 00:58:05,716
You're bleeding too!

1020
00:58:06,846 --> 00:58:08,806
Gosh, seriously...

1021
00:58:08,806 --> 00:58:13,216
How stupid are you to get kidnapped by a middle schooler?

1022
00:58:13,216 --> 00:58:18,456
Gosh, seriously, Kim Jeong Ho. Do you know how worried I was?

1023
00:58:20,546 --> 00:58:23,116
Gosh, seriously!

1024
00:58:29,526 --> 00:58:32,276
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

1025
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:34,636
Don't hit me. It hurts.

1026
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,616
It hurts me too!

1027
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:38,506
I was dying worried about you.

1028
00:58:38,506 --> 00:58:41,696
My heart almost burst open! I'm dying here!

1029
00:58:41,696 --> 00:58:45,066
♫  When I think about you  ♫

1030
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:51,346
♫  The spring that resembles you comes to my heart  ♫

1031
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:54,216
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

1032
00:58:54,216 --> 00:58:57,316
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

1033
00:58:57,316 --> 00:59:00,296
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

1034
00:59:00,296 --> 00:59:03,900
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

1035
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:12,006
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

1036
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:17,306
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

1037
00:59:17,306 --> 00:59:25,160
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

1038
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:31,406
♫  Will you tell me you love me?  ♫

1039
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:40,790


1040
00:59:42,366 --> 00:59:52,156
♫  I will kiss your lips with all my love for you  ♫

1041
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:54,926
♫  Because it's my love for you  ♫

1042
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:58,026
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

1043
00:59:58,026 --> 01:00:01,026
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

1044
01:00:01,026 --> 01:00:04,390
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

1045
01:00:05,966 --> 01:00:12,766
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

1046
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:16,666
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

1047
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:19,686
   

1048
01:00:19,686 --> 01:00:23,156
 Eat pasta, go to Namsan... 

1049
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:25,176
 and after going to Nami Island... 

1050
01:00:25,176 --> 01:00:27,246
 Why is everything so difficult for you? 

1051
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:30,386
 Must I spell everything out to you? 

1052
01:00:30,386 --> 01:00:31,506
 I give better consultations. 

1053
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:33,106
 Pay the penalty of 10 million won or less. 

1054
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:34,216
 Three Go! 

1055
01:00:34,216 --> 01:00:36,786
 You know that mountain in the back? There's something there. 

1056
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:38,606
 Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! 

1057
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,516
 I just exposed it. It was a hassle. 

1058
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:42,146
 It was revealed that there was a backroom deal. 

1059
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:44,836
 - More I dream, I cowardly realized 
 - Attorney! 

1060
01:00:44,836 --> 01:00:46,936
 that you get hurt more. 

1061
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:52,300
♫  Holding you tightly tonight  ♫
