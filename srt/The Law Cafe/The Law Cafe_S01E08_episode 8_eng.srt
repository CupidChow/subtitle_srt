1
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:32,974
   

2
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:36,484
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

3
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:42,864
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

4
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:47,864
♫  When I think about you  ♫

5
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:51,634
Wait a sec...

6
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,824
Why? What's wrong?

7
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:57,874
I don't think this is right.

8
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,974
W-W-Why? What's the matter?

9
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:01,944
S-Sorry!

10
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:16,014
That b**** a** motherf***ing bastard!

11
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:18,354
And after he left like that...

12
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:19,664
Hey, Kim Jeong Ho!

13
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,324
I know you're in there!

14
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:23,154
Come out!

15
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,750


16
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:40,624
   
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

17
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:44,734
I... had a plan for everything.

18
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:47,744
After I resolved all the problems,

19
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:50,134
I would approach her confidently, and together

20
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:54,294
eat pasta...

21
00:01:54,294 --> 00:01:56,354
go to Namsan...

22
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,524
and after going to Nami Island,

23
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:04,754
do all that afterward.

24
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,550
Hey!

25
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,130
   

26
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,400
   

27
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,154
Hey!

28
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:24,234
   

29
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:28,984
   

30
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:31,214
Ma'am, please serve us some more cubed radish kimchi here.

31
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:32,824
Okay!

32
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:35,354
I'm coming.

33
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,864
   

34
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:54,154
I... think I told you I have something to tell you in private.

35
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:55,674
After I became a prosecutor,

36
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:58,584
when people talk about doing something in private, I don't listen.

37
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:01,424
Oftentimes, no good comes from listening.

38
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,554
Thank you.

39
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:07,294
I heard you live like a bum.

40
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:08,624
Is it fun playing all day?

41
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,014
Geez...

42
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:12,414
So I heard that you returned to the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

43
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:14,204
Yeah.

44
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:19,614
The Inspector General... is still the same as before.

45
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:28,754
What you were looking for, Sunbae...

46
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,814
I think I found it first.

47
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:37,324
Evidence that reveals the connections between prosecutors and Dohan Group.

48
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:46,914
Inspector General Kim Seung Woon... during the 2006 Dohan Warehouse fire case,

49
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:51,534
he deliberately omitted these pieces of evidence upon request of the Dohan Group.

50
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:01,324
Why are you making a film noir in a samgyetang restaurant ( Chicken ginseng soup )?

51
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,444
That's why I said we should meet in a quiet location!

52
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:08,514
Are you sure you'll be fine?

53
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:15,204
But before you expose this, give me a few days' time.

54
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,764
Junpyeongdo?

55
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:26,934
What kind of island is it?

56
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,684
Oh, it's a small island on the Western Sea.

57
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:31,324
It's such a remote place,

58
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:35,324
so I go there every two months for medical charity work.

59
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:39,904
I was thinking it would good to go together with our Law Cafe family.

60
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,684
I would like that! I want to go!

61
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:44,164
If we're going for the weekend, that's great for me!

62
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:46,524
I'll ask Joon and Eun Kang.

63
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:48,524
Oh, that's great.

64
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:51,754
Should we also ask Jeong Ho as well?

65
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:55,004
If I say I'm going, it's obvious he'll say he's not going...

66
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,474
Mom.

67
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:12,944
Are you well?

68
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,644
Mom, you should eat too.

69
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:41,644
You know I don't eat what I cook because it's not good.

70
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:44,384
Today's food is quite edible, actually.

71
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:47,434
This time, I listened to my son and tried following the recipe,

72
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,904
suppressing my creative desire.

73
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,744
- Mom. 
 - Mom is fine, son.

74
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:03,214
As long as I can see your face like this from time to time, I'm good.

75
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:05,804
I won't even expect grandchildren.

76
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:10,394
Please listen to me seriously.

77
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:14,954
In the near future, while you're watching the news,

78
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:18,414
you may come across something that may shock you.

79
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,764
And perhaps as part of a witness investigation,

80
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:24,694
you may be called into the prosecutors' office.

81
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,804
What do you...

82
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,834
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:34,674
First, Father will... probably step down from his position,

84
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:38,814
and everything else will be decided after the investigation.

85
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:47,914
I'm sorry to you, Mom, but it's right for this to happen.

86
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:08,134
I'm sorry, Mom.

87
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:09,794
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:13,544
I don't know what this is about,

89
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:18,854
but I... believe in your dad.

90
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:23,064
I know.

91
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:27,824
And that's why I'm all the more sorry.

92
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,580
 Law Cafe 

93
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,204
Hyungnim!

94
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:58,684
Hello.

95
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:03,914
You have an uncharacteristically worried look on your face.

96
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:06,414
What kind of image do you have of me?

97
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:08,634
How shall I describe it... Leisurely?

98
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:13,414
A playboy cruising on a yacht moving with the wind.

99
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:17,964
Although, every time you laugh like that, my heart feels a bit agitated.

100
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,354
I guess you're not completely oblivious.

101
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:24,094
Yes. I, Bae Joon,

102
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:28,364
am not completely oblivious although I lack awareness sometimes.

103
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,744
- Got it. 
 - Oh, Hyungnim.

104
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,984
What's tasty on Jungpyeong Island?

105
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,444
- Jungpyeong Island? 
 - Yes.

106
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:36,504
Aren't you going?

107
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:41,044
Was I lacking awareness again...

108
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,300
 

109
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,750
   

110
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,474
Hyung! Don't tell them that I told you about it!

111
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,404
It's a secret, okay?

112
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:58,204
Hey, Jeong Ho. Obviously, I was going to invite you, too.

113
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,314
But you weren't around all day, so I just never got the opportunity to ask.

114
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:02,444
Hyung.

115
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:04,474
Hyung, by any chance,

116
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:07,334
you don't have a crush on Kim Yoo Ri, or anything like that, right?

117
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,984
I do like her.

118
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,614
As a colleague and as a neighbor.

119
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:15,464
At least for now based on the level of our relationship.

120
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:18,314
I would like for you go no further with that.

121
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:21,344
Do you think you have the right to say that to me

122
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:23,084
when you can't even tell Yoo Ri the truth?

123
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,794
I'm going to reclaim that right very soon.

124
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:33,884
Before it gets any later, I think I need to tell her.

125
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:50,764
♫  It was from the start for me, this inexplicable heart  ♫

126
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:58,004
♫  I was afraid you'd find out how I felt next to you  ♫

127
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:05,264
♫  So many awkward days between you and me  ♫

128
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:13,194
♫  I want to protect you now  ♫

129
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:27,170
♫  I guess I must like you, more than anyone else  ♫

130
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,654
♫  I guess I've come to like you  ♫

131
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:41,554
♫  Maybe I love you, more today than yesterday  ♫

132
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:47,764
♫  I guess I've come to love you more now than back then  ♫

133
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:55,974
♫  More than myself  ♫

134
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:04,034
Village Chief!

135
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:06,734
Aigoo! Welcome!

136
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,114
Hello!

137
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:11,694
Nice to meet you all.

138
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:16,414
If you're friends of Dr. Park, we're pretty much all family then.

139
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:17,824
Just think of this place as your own home

140
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,074
- and be comfortable while you stay here! 
 - Thank you.

141
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:22,404
- All right, let's all go inside! 
 - Thank you!

142
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:23,224
- Thank you. 
 - It's inside here, right?

143
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,674
It's inside here, right?

144
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:26,714
Yeah, go inside here.

145
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,154
Auntie.

146
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,314
It seems like someone is already using this room...

147
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:39,144
Oh, one of the people from your party came down here first yesterday.

148
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:59,364
Oh, you're here?

149
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:08,854
Why did you come here?

150
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,404
After avoiding me all that time.

151
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:16,574
I used to come here with Hyung all the time for charity work.

152
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:20,684
I guess your outstanding charitable mentality overcame your desire to avoid me.

153
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,244
What happened a few days ago...

154
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:30,094
was my mistake.

155
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,614
I'll admit that.

156
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:34,104
"It was my mistake. I'll admit that"?

157
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:36,564
That's your conclusion after avoiding me the past few days?

158
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,664
But too bad. It wasn't a mistake for me!

159
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:45,154
- What I mean is— 
 - If you were going to put me aside, you could've finished what you were doing first!

160
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:49,394
For me, you are... not someone I can just leave in the middle of a kiss!

161
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:54,144
For me, you are... not someone I can wait for several days without explanation after doing that.

162
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,994
If it were me,

163
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:59,084
I'd never do that for fear of hurting you because you're so precious to me.

164
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:07,074
♫  Cold wind breezes by my shoulder  ♫

165
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:09,634
Are you not going to listen to me any further?

166
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:12,784
If you're starting with "It was my mistake," I have no desire to listen.

167
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:15,794
I laid down my pride to tell you upfront that I like you...

168
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:19,244
Even if you look down on me, this crosses the line! This is so foul!

169
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:20,374
What did you say, so foul?

170
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:23,384
Yeah! You're acting so foul! I can't do this any more!

171
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:27,234
Why is everything always so easy for you?

172
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:31,204
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

173
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:33,764
After being friends for 17 years, it's easy for you to say you like me.

174
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,154
And turning away from me is also so easy!

175
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:40,274
What's always so difficult for you, then?

176
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:43,094
Tell me! What's so difficult?

177
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,344
Tell me then!

178
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:49,924
♫  It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long  ♫

179
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:53,544
♫  Just lean on me  ♫

180
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:55,624
You see. You can't say anything again.

181
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:59,034
You dummy, stupid idiot, jacka**!

182
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:16,564
Whose son came by here?

183
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:19,104
What is this?

184
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,614
Is this the line?

185
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,344
What the...

186
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,124
Why are there so many people?

187
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,564
   
   

188
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:30,414
Everything's hectic for you and you get dizzy.

189
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:31,504
How so?

190
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:35,274
Starting at some point, I've been a bit forgetful.

191
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,114
Breathe in deeply.

192
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:40,044
- Now breathe out. 
 - Write where it hurts.

193
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:41,704
All right, you just have to write down your name. 
    

194
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:44,324
Here, take this. 
    

195
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:48,434
Yes.

196
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,074
This cast...

197
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:52,674
Would two weeks be enough?

198
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,894
   

199
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:06,364
- Coffee.  Aigoo! 
 - Enjoy yourself!

200
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,194
Looks good.

201
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:11,454
- Aigoo, it's so bitter! 
 - Aigoo...

202
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,024
For this,

203
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:17,334
you need to add this to make it taste good.

204
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,644
- Now it tastes good. 
 - Aigoo, my goodness.

205
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:23,234
- D-Drip coffee... 
 - Coffee?

206
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:26,234
Try some coffee! It's really good.

207
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:27,364
Oh, thank you.

208
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:29,054
Enjoy the coffee!

209
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,754
Enjoy it!

210
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:33,104
Whoa, this is bitter!

211
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:35,214
Are we supposed to drink it just like this?

212
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:37,274
Being bitter must be good for you.

213
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:38,994
Since it's free, just shove it.

214
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:41,494
D***, you'd gulp down poison if it were free.

215
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:42,894
Of course.

216
00:15:42,894 --> 00:15:46,614
Besides that, what is this legal consultation thing?

217
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,894
Oh, this lady here is an attorney.

218
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:50,124
Hello!

219
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:52,594
If you have any questions about any legal matters,

220
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:54,294
you can ask her everything.

221
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:58,464
The young man inside the town hall also said he was an attorney.

222
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:02,174
Goodness, how many questions would the grannies have in a rural village like this

223
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:03,784
that two attorneys needed to come?

224
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:05,004
What do you mean?

225
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:07,904
I have a lot of questions!

226
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:12,344
I'm going to go ask those questions later

227
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,524
to that pretty-looking young man inside.

228
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,864
Wait! Why? Why!

229
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:19,234
Just ask me!

230
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,034
I'm better at legal consultations!

231
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:27,544
It seems like he's much better at playing Go Stop* than you. 
  (Korean card game) 

232
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:30,394
Thanks for the bitter coffee!

233
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:32,014
All right, let's go to play a round!

234
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:34,664
Oh, goodness, I guess I'll just have to take this to go.

235
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:39,094
The birds picture combo!

236
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:41,934
Illegally harvesting forest produce in national parks

237
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,884
is a pretty big crime under the Natural Parks Act,

238
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:46,814
punishable up to three years in prison,

239
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:49,994
or up to 30 million won of fines.

240
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:53,004
So, everyone, you have to be careful.

241
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:55,484
No Light card, and no Light card. Three go!

242
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,524
Plucking produce that's not yours is theft.

243
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:58,574
It's stealing.

244
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:02,084
If tourists keep coming over the fence and plucking your produce,

245
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:04,484
you should set up a CCTV and report it to the police.

246
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:06,054
"Oh man, that looks tasty!"

247
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:09,204
The moment you think this and enter someone else's private property,

248
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:11,154
this becomes trespassing.

249
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,114
What! Trespassing?

250
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:17,384
So even when you go digging for medicinal herbs and mushrooms in the mountain behind your house, you need to be careful.

251
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:19,374
Gosh, that's so strict.

252
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:22,244
- My goodness, he got a yut*! 
 - Get it, get it. 
  (4 steps ahead in the Korean game Yutnori) 

253
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:24,654
In our country, it's illegal to capture any species of snake.

254
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:27,334
So does that mean that we can't have any more snake-infused alcohol?

255
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:28,754
No snake-infused alcohol,

256
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:30,374
no wasp-infused alcohol, no fire ant-infused alcohol.

257
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,274
You can't make and consume any of these infused alcohols.

258
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:34,454
All these are punishable by a fine.

259
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,844
Sir, which coffee would you like?

260
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:38,674
Oh, this one.

261
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,694
Hyung, five non-bitter coffees.

262
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,744
Eun Kang, five cups of non-bitter coffee. Hurry, hurry.

263
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:46,214
- And anything else you're curious about? 
 - The non-bitter coffee is popular.

264
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:49,244
I guess they find it tasty because it's sweet. 
  

265
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:54,914
Oh, my. Hey, hey, hey. Young man...

266
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,444
W-we need a consultation.

267
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:58,224
All right. Okay.

268
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:00,304
Let's all play again in just a bit.

269
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:02,784
Big Sis, just ask away.

270
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,484
How long are you going to put up with it?

271
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,104
It's fine.

272
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:09,764
I'm going to speak on her behalf.

273
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:14,044
So... there was another old lady living next to Big Sis

274
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:17,254
and they were really close.

275
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:22,564
 But one day, maybe she got upset for some reason 

276
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:25,084
 and started telling Big Sis 

277
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:28,694
 not to use the entrance to Big Sis' house because it was on her property. 

278
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:31,294
So, Big Sis, at age 80,

279
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:33,144
had to run across her pepper field

280
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:36,444
and go over the fence in order to go inside her home!

281
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:39,394
- Does that make any sense? 
 - I mean, what is that...

282
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:43,504
Who would have thought that Mak Rye would be so up-tight and mean-spirited?

283
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:44,874
I had no idea!

284
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,294
I know, right?

285
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:49,484
Gosh, it's not anything like that.

286
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:51,604
So everyone, just let it be!

287
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:53,544
This is really not it!

288
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:56,154
For the entrance area that is the matter of dispute,

289
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:58,524
did you check the land ownership for it?

290
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:00,284
I went to the provincial government office

291
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:02,864
and I asked them for a cadastral map...

292
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:05,764
and it does seem like it is her property.

293
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:10,834
What is wrong with this old lady!

294
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,564
I checked with the provincial government office,

295
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:14,234
and they told me that this area is part of my property.

296
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,374
Then can't I do whatever I want with it?

297
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,684
Aigoo...

298
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:20,684
But still, preventing her from entering like that is illegal.

299
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:24,074
W-What part of that would be illegal?

300
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:25,684
Looking at the picture that you drew for me,

301
00:19:25,684 --> 00:19:28,214
the property of the other lady doesn't have direct access to the road.

302
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:31,774
According to the Private Roads Act, that is, Article 9 of the Private Roads Act,

303
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,334
the person who makes a private road

304
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:37,484
cannot limit or prevent a civilian from passing through.

305
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:41,264
Especially, a commonly used, customary road like this with no available detours,

306
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,024
you can't prevent access. No, you can't.

307
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,184
Right? I knew it!

308
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,034
- So why is she acting like that? 
 - However,

309
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:48,824
according to Article 10 of the Private Roads Act,

310
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:53,864
the person who makes the private road can charge other people a toll for using the road.

311
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:55,434
Which means...

312
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,564
you might have to pay a toll.

313
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,174
What do you mean?

314
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:02,454
- But it's for entering her own home! 
 - But...

315
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:05,694
if you charge an exorbitant amount, you might not get it approved.

316
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:08,364
And the next-door neighbor might file a lawsuit.

317
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:14,284
It may be in your best interest to give this up and try to find a way to reconcile.

318
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:19,164
I mean, what's there to discuss here...

319
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:30,594
All right! Go ahead and sue me then!

320
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,424
This all started because you wouldn't let me

321
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:34,824
pass through your property to go into the mountain behind it!

322
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:37,004
Why should I be the one to let this go?

323
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,904
Mak Rye! What about you?

324
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,984
We're all living together in one neighborhood!

325
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:43,974
Why are you being so mean about this?

326
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,504
What?

327
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:49,604
How come... everyone's always taking Wol Sun unni's side?

328
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:53,644
Am I not even a member of this village?

329
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:03,534
T-T-That girl... the one who's at fault is the one getting angry!

330
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:05,324
She's acting like a b****!

331
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:08,454
It wasn't even that long ago when she was always sticking with Wol Sun unni.

332
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:10,544
What's with her these days...

333
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,594
Aigoo... Seriously...

334
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:14,744
Goodness, she's so toxic.

335
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:36,441
Well, for that problem before,

336
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:39,831
we decided to meet again tomorrow to mediate the issue at the town hall.

337
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,241
But I don't know!

338
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:44,501
It might just end with another fight.

339
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:47,571
But why were you asking about Ms. Na's house? What are you planning?

340
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:51,121
I didn't feel good about her leaving in tears.

341
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:53,291
I thought maybe I'd go and hear her out a bit more.

342
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,091
I see. It's nearby here. I'll draw you a map to her house,

343
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:57,451
so try paying her a visit.

344
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,421
It's already late at night, so I'll go with you.

345
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,681
No, I'll go with her.

346
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,901
I don't have any bags or anything like that.

347
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,641
I mean, you guys can all go together.

348
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:11,341
Why would you argue about that?

349
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,661
Doctor, I'll just go by myself.

350
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:17,391
I feel like Ms. Na will open up more if I go by myself.

351
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:19,491
Okay, I understand.

352
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:34,691
I told you to stop following me!

353
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:37,751
Who says I was following you!

354
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,891
I have my own business to attend to!

355
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,681
I have my own business too.

356
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:04,381
I didn't want to be petty like this, either.

357
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:10,311
But Big Sis started acting really strange from a certain point.

358
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:12,001
 Big Sis! 

359
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:14,771
 Are you inside? 

360
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,821
 Where is she? 

361
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:19,991
 - Her shoes are here... 
 - Last spring, 

362
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:24,421
 I went to Big Sis' house so I can harvest some spring mugwort in the back mountain. 

363
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:26,881
Hey! Mak Rye!

364
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:28,851
 - Big Sis. 
 - You can't go that way! 

365
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,301
 - What? 
 - I'm telling you, you can't go that way. 

366
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:34,901
 My goodness, she was running toward me with her bad knees and all 

367
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:37,341
 and suddenly started getting mad at me. 

368
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:40,761
 It's all dug up now, so there's nothing to harvest there. 

369
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,231
 What is with you? 

370
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:43,681
 You can't go through this way. 

371
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:47,441
She told me never to go to the back mountain that way,

372
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:51,471
and if I want to go, that I should go all the way around her property.

373
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,131
We've lived more than 30 years together without making any distinctions about the property.

374
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:58,011
But because she suddenly started acting that way,

375
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:02,211
I thought that there must be a reason. So I went to see her several times.

376
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:04,741
But now she tells me...

377
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,211
to never come to her house again.

378
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:11,441
Oh, my...

379
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,311
For me, the land is not the problem.

380
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:15,981
I'm just really hurt.

381
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,811
If she would just tell me why she's doing this,

382
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:21,071
I would be able to understand her.

383
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:22,321
Of course!

384
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:25,461
If they'd just tell us what's going on, we'd understand.

385
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:29,711
But she keeps holding it all in without telling me.

386
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:32,181
Obviously, I would get angry and upset about this.

387
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,911
You'd feel like exploding.

388
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:37,651
Avoiding you in plain sight but not telling you what's really the issue.

389
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,621
 You! You're a hassle to me! 

390
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:42,951
 I avoided you and wrote out that contract because you're a hassle. Don't you get it? 

391
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:44,871
 You're not the one for me. 

392
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:50,791
 So, please wait for me a little bit. 

393
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,571
 It means I like you, too. 

394
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,001
 Hey! 

395
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,221
Leaving you confused all the time,

396
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:02,311
and just when you think you understand, they hide...

397
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:04,231
Lady attorney, are you crying?

398
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,991
- Hey, don't cry! 
 - I mean, come on!

399
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:09,861
I got angry as I was listening to what you were saying.

400
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:12,901
Which guy is it?

401
00:25:23,011 --> 00:25:24,721
This is all just crappy.

402
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:26,901
Don't cry for a guy like that.

403
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,641
Your tears are not worth it.

404
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:34,481
In any case, it does seem true that Ms. Wol Sun changed suddenly.

405
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:36,121
Yeah.

406
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:44,821
Hey.

407
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:49,261
My intuition tells me that the back mountain over there...

408
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:51,101
There's something there.

409
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:00,451
What is this?

410
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,851
What's that?

411
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,571
I don't know about that, either.

412
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:15,661
However, no matter how much you try to cover something up,

413
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:18,631
things that will come to light will become visible.

414
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,811
There is definitely something there.

415
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:28,241
Please, go inside.

416
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,071
Have a good night!

417
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:49,061
 The back mountain over there... 

418
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:51,021
 There's something there. 

419
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,951
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

420
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:00,491
Hey!

421
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:02,251
Geez, that girl!

422
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,671
Hey!

423
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,441
Where are you going?

424
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:08,951
Kim Yoo Ri!

425
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:13,591
Whoa! Hey!

426
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,421
 Sorry! 

427
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:56,321
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri. That's not a human sound!

428
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:59,521
But, still! This is the sound of something in pain!

429
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:04,061
It's the sound of a water deer.

430
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,661
It seems a water deer got caught in a boar trap.

431
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:10,381
It's been crying like that all night.

432
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,791
But besides that... what are you guys doing

433
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,751
on someone else's private property at this time of night?

434
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,371
We were wondering if something had happened because of that shrieking noise.

435
00:28:22,071 --> 00:28:26,331
There's no reason for anyone to be shrieking like that on this island.

436
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:33,521
He's Ms. Wol Sun son?

437
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:36,201
He moved here from Seoul

438
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:39,291
and he said he'd grow blueberries and then he said he'd grow the Apple Watermelons.

439
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:43,111
This year, he said he'd grow Shine Muscat or something like that.

440
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:45,481
Aigoo, he drives me crazy.

441
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:47,991
Aigoo, so frustrating.

442
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:10,051
Village Chief, I thought we were the only ones who were talking to the ladies.

443
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:14,211
Yeah, but they all wanted to see it, so they came.

444
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,231
What can you do with that?

445
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:26,251
Let's get started!

446
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,841
Please pay attention!

447
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:34,141
Okay, to summarize...

448
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:39,731
Ms. Park has always been using the road that's on Ms. Na's property.

449
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:43,571
But it became a problem because she wasn't allowed to use it.

450
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:44,431
- Yes. 
 - That's right.

451
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:45,831
It all started with

452
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:49,761
Ms. Park preventing Ms. Na from using the path to the mountain.

453
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:51,141
Why don't we talk about that first?

454
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:52,311
Hold on.

455
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:54,201
They're different problems.

456
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:57,511
The path to the mountain has alternative routes.

457
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:59,981
But Ms. Na blocked a public road.

458
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,601
How could you treat those cases in the same way?

459
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:04,281
You said I can't use your property.

460
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:08,301
But you want to use my property. What nonsense is that?

461
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:11,091
There's no reason to bring the law into this.

462
00:30:11,091 --> 00:30:13,811
As long as Ms. Park allows access to the mountain

463
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,831
like she used to, Ms. Na would allow access

464
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:19,961
to the road in front of Ms. Park's house without charging any fees. That's her position.

465
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:21,741
That would be fair.

466
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:25,271
What do you think, Ms. Park?

467
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:34,111
Aigoo, I knew it'd be like this.

468
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:38,331
Nobody knows how you feel if you keep your mouth shut!

469
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:43,711
Big Sis, do you know what I'm most disappointed with?

470
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,181
That mugwort rice cakes.

471
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:46,841
It's that mugwort rice cakes!

472
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:49,421
- What's she talking about? 
 - What about the rice cakes?

473
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:52,871
 The mysterious island, Jeju even makes a crybaby smile! 

474
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:57,101
 It's about 450 meters long and there are about 500 of them. 

475
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,601
Geez, Big Sis.

476
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:05,641
You want to eat all of that yourself?

477
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,351
Let me try one.

478
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:08,801
No way!

479
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,031
What?

480
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:12,471
It's nothing much.

481
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:17,981
All on her own?

482
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,371
My gosh. What was that about?

483
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:22,051
I wouldn't know!

484
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:26,351
I mean, how tasty were they anyway?

485
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:30,151
We've been splitting even a bean for 30 years!

486
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,631
She said she couldn't even let me have a bite!

487
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:34,661
What mugwort rice cake? How could that be?

488
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,271
Big Sis...

489
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,751
What is she talking about?

490
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,611
Be quiet!

491
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:42,881
Seriously, you can't be greedy with food.

492
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,741
I know! It's just some rice cakes...

493
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,931
But still, you can't just break the law and block

494
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:51,541
the road the neighbors use all the time. How could you do that?

495
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:54,431
You should've talked it out if you had a beef.

496
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:56,531
You can't talk to someone who's impossible to talk to!

497
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:57,811
"Why didn't you give me the rice cake?"

498
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:59,751
"We've been living like family for 30 years.

499
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,121
Why won't you let me in your front yard all of a sudden?"

500
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,891
Ms. Na asked her countless times.

501
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:05,711
But she won't give her any answers!

502
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:08,281
She could have her reasons.

503
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,011
Does she have to say everything on her mind?

504
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,331
Hiding your feelings is a bad habit!

505
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:17,101
If she thought about what it might be like to get rejected over and over again even once,

506
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,401
she can't be like that.

507
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:21,981
Because of all the time they shared,

508
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:25,921
she would've been understanding if only she told her.

509
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:36,431
You don't even understand this. How could you be so sure?

510
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:39,821
By the way,

511
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:44,501
it's the youngest and and Wol Sun unni they are talking right now, right?

512
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,731
Yes...

513
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,181
I didn't realize the old ladies' drama goes so deep like this.

514
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,131
How interesting.

515
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:53,311
She must've had a reason she couldn't talk.

516
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,271
Something you can't even share with a friend for 30 years!

517
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:57,321
She must've had a reason that drove her crazy,

518
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:00,521
broke her heart and make her feel frustrated.

519
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,351
Couldn't she have been understanding and waited a bit?

520
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,751
She tried to wait.

521
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,331
But she kept running away.

522
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:07,591
She kept walking backward.

523
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:09,551
And pushed her away!

524
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,861
It's because she's scared.

525
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:22,341
She worried she might be hated if she gets found out.

526
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:25,861
She was afraid of being left behind.

527
00:33:27,181 --> 00:33:30,511
That's why she hesitated and walked backward.

528
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:35,681
So please be understanding.

529
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,691
Just wait a bit even if you're frustrated.

530
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,421
Big Sis!

531
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:56,861
I'm so sorry!

532
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:59,281
It's because I'm impatient!

533
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:01,111
Big Sis!

534
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:03,381
I'll wait for you.

535
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:05,911
I'll wait for you no matter what you want to tell me.

536
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:09,741
So come to me whenever you want to talk to me.

537
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:12,081
Aigoo! My goodness!

538
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:17,541
So this means the road Ms. Park blocked

539
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,901
- will be accessible again? 
 - Yes.

540
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:23,211
My goodness! That's great!

541
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,541
Great! If so...

542
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:30,191
with a touching and tearful exchange, the conflict between the two ladies

543
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:33,531
had concluded without any issues.

544
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:39,451
So...

545
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:45,661
by the way, it looks like you two are not done talking.

546
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:48,141
It was pretty interesting.

547
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:50,321
Do you want to continue?

548
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:02,731
There is an island between people.

549
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,281
An island called "secret."

550
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:09,831
The place only Jeong Ho knows and hides.

551
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:13,321
I wanted to go to that island only Jeong Ho lives.

552
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:17,621
I must've forgotten that...

553
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:23,541
the island is a place where he hid the things that are scary and heartbreaking.

554
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,141
Well...

555
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:38,681
I think we'd better brace ourselves for this.

556
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:44,071
By the way, what could the Prosecutor's Office have?

557
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:45,771
Why are they being so brazen?

558
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:49,081
I think it's regarding the 2016 warehouse case.

559
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:52,511
I think they secured evidence for it.

560
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:56,221
It was Jeong Ho who brought it to them, wasn't it?

561
00:35:57,191 --> 00:36:00,841
Seriously. It's quite the family we have.

562
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:05,421
But that happened a long time ago.

563
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:07,601
Can that become a problem now?

564
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,521
The real problem is that...

565
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:14,481
all the cases that Inspector General Kim Seung Woon took on regarding Dohan Group

566
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:17,161
will be under investigation.

567
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:19,891
 Pyeong Woong, where are you, bastard? 

568
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,201
Huh!

569
00:36:21,201 --> 00:36:22,861
Hey!

570
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:25,261
Fath—

571
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,631
What kind of useless bastard are you

572
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:33,831
that you did not notice while all this was happening?

573
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:36,381
Well...

574
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:39,761
I'm a CEO of a company too.

575
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:45,101
I can't just sniff around all the time and see if Kim Seung Woon is screwing up or not.

576
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:46,161
W-What?

577
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:48,651
You're freaking out about something happening

578
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:52,021
to the troublemaker son-in-law,

579
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:56,941
but you don't seem concerned about your son whose kidney you took.

580
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:58,211
You...

581
00:36:58,211 --> 00:37:00,761
told me that you'd live like a dog if I took care of you.

582
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:03,191
Why do you keep wanting to become a human?

583
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:08,361
I told you that when I was 15.

584
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:11,171
Father, I've been taking care of you...

585
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:15,251
I've been assisting you all this time. How could I... you know?

586
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:17,691
How could I still want the same...

587
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:19,841
Stop calling me "Father"!

588
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:22,261
And what do you mean, "assist?"

589
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:23,431
I gave you that little company.

590
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:26,291
And you ruined everything single thing you touched! How dare...

591
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,051
All the money that was left after I ruined things...

592
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:32,251
all went into...

593
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,531
your pocket, Father...

594
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:36,151
Doesn't that count as assisting?

595
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:37,361
What happened?

596
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:39,551
Do you have dementia or something and forget everything?

597
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:42,261
How dare you...

598
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:50,591
Even if Hyung Joo died, there's no way you'd replace him.

599
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:51,911
Give up!

600
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:54,331
Once a dog is always a dog.

601
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:55,821
Just lick whatever food I give you!

602
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:57,721
Stop acting up!

603
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:58,941
Also...

604
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:02,121
the Inspector General could come in handy later if we keep him in that position.

605
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:04,761
Sort things out before things blow up!

606
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:09,521
- Here. 
 - Aigoo.

607
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,321
Thank you.

608
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:18,681
I was so thankful to you two today.

609
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:22,011
Aigoo, you're at a beautiful age.

610
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,781
Those were the days.

611
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:26,001
Aigoo, all days can be good days.

612
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,681
You're at a good age too.

613
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,761
And you're beautiful too.

614
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:32,521
Aigoo, you're so precious, saedek*. 
  (Addressing newlywed wife) 

615
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,931
Do you guys have a baby then?

616
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,751
I heard you're not supposed to say that these days.

617
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,331
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

618
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:45,241
It's okay. It's not like that.

619
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:46,311
Yes.

620
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:50,091
It's nice to have fun without kids too.

621
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:53,781
You can have one if you want to later.

622
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,181
Aigoo, hold on.

623
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:57,981
I forgot to bring out marinated crab.

624
00:38:57,981 --> 00:39:00,261
I'll go get it.

625
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:21,721
 That mugwort rice cake! It's that mugwort rice cake! 

626
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:26,061
 I mean, how tasty were they anyway? 

627
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,671
 We've been splitting even a bean for 30 years! 

628
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:33,071
 She said she couldn't even let me have a bite! 

629
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,461
What are you doing?

630
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,611
- Are they good? 
 - Yeah.

631
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:52,831
Totally.

632
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:55,671
They're those rice cakes.

633
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:57,021
Say "ah."

634
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:58,491
Let's become joint offenders.

635
00:39:58,491 --> 00:40:00,671
Joint offender, my foot.

636
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:04,051
You became an instigator the moment you said that.

637
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:08,081
How dare you drag me in.

638
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:17,641
Let's have a talk after the meal.

639
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:19,901
Talk about what?

640
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:25,281
I realized that the more I delay and

641
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,921
be cowardly, the more you get hurt.

642
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:38,971
So I decided to try being brave.

643
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:45,741
If so let's talk tomorrow.

644
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:48,251
Why does it have to be tomorrow?

645
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:51,161
While I was waiting,

646
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:56,601
your heart must've been heavy as if you owed me something the whole time.

647
00:40:56,601 --> 00:41:01,961
Tonight, I'll neither wait nor nag.

648
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:06,911
For just one day, just forget about everything and have fun with me.

649
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:21,681
Here's the marinated crab.

650
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:23,101
It's so tasty.

651
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:24,071
Thank you.

652
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:27,171
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

653
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:28,331
Eat the leg.

654
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:29,801
Thank you.

655
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,321
Aigoo, here.

656
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:33,351
Thank you.

657
00:41:40,861 --> 00:41:42,771
It's tasty.

658
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:56,361
Let's go.

659
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,371
Let's talk.

660
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,301
There's no use avoiding it.

661
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:06,281
I won't let you wait any longer.

662
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:08,411
Jeong Ho.

663
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:14,091
The ants are moving.

664
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,001
Stop changing the subject. I'm serious!

665
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:24,931
Because I didn't want you to get hurt...

666
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:28,521
I've been running around like a coward

667
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,661
pretending like it was for you.

668
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:37,671
Thinking how much you must've been hurt...

669
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:46,451
Are you listening, Kim Yoo Ri?

670
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:53,311
The stars are moving too.

671
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,641
You see stars?

672
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:06,661
The stars aren't moving. We're moving.

673
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:08,511
Because the earth and the planets around it revolve...

674
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:11,091
it just seems like they're moving...

675
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:14,221
Kim Yoo Ri, stop changing the subject!

676
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:16,481
It's true.

677
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:23,071
If I move the stars move too.

678
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:30,351
The starlight is falling like rain!

679
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:33,371
♫  The starlight is falling like rain  ♫

680
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:36,920
♫  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la  ♫

681
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:43,310
♫  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la  ♫

682
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:49,240
♫  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la  ♫

683
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,901
♫  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la  ♫

684
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,067
♫  I remember the moments we shared  ♫

685
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,881
♫  The small image of me is fading  ♫

686
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:23,201
♫  The sky of the city is as dark as my heart  ♫

687
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:28,451
♫  I was hurt so much, and I cried so much  ♫

688
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:30,490
Kim Yoo Ri!

689
00:44:34,611 --> 00:44:36,271
Kim Yoo Ri.

690
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,651
Hey.

691
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:40,661
Y-Yoo Ri, what's wrong with you?

692
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,521
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri. Are you okay?

693
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:48,101
What's wrong with her?

694
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,080
Yoo Ri.

695
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,010
Are you okay?

696
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,190
Village Chief, please get ready to take her to the hospital!

697
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,620
The thing is, even the nearest hospital can only be reach by a boat.

698
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,250
We'll travel by boat or whatever!

699
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,160
She's...

700
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,200
She's about to die right now!

701
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,100
I don't think it's that bad.

702
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,090
Looks like she had a drink...

703
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,800
Seriously!

704
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,320
Hey, Yoo Ri.

705
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,980
What's wrong with you?

706
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,130
Pull yourself together!

707
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,150
- Kim Jeong Ho. 
 - Yeah.

708
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,610
- Jeong Ho. 
 - Yes, Yoo Ri.

709
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,840
Am I bad at kissing?

710
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,630
Is that why you ran away?

711
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,550
What are you talking about right now?

712
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:38,780
Jeong Ho!

713
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,560
Hyung! Hyung, come here!

714
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,420
- What's wrong with Yoo Ri? 
 - She's acting weird.

715
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,010
She didn't even drink, but she keeps saying nonsense and smiling.

716
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,730
Attorney Kim. Attorney Kim.

717
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,160
Attorney Kim!

718
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,120
Doctor.

719
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:06,820
Do you think I'm bad at kissing or not?

720
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,290
- You said she hasn't drunk at all? 
 - Not at all! Not at all.

721
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,940
Her eyes are red, but her pulse is normal.

722
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,590
Did she eat anything weird?

723
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,640
No, she just had dinner and...

724
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,570
 - Is it good? 
 - Yes. 

725
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,880
 Totally. 

726
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,010
Hold on. The rice cakes.

727
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,860
That rice cakes!

728
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,600
Grandma, what is in that rice cakes?

729
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,610
What? The rice cakes...

730
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,550
I don't know what you're talking about.

731
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,290
I'm talking about that mugwort rice cakes!

732
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,040
What did you put in them?

733
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,050
The rice cakes?

734
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:45,400
Is he talking about the rice cakes you keep eating sneakily?

735
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,510
Please say something, Grandma!

736
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,230
She's dying right now!

737
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,830
Like I said earlier, I don't think it's that bad.

738
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,330
- Geez! 
 - Say something, Big Sis!

739
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,440
Were they not mugwort rice cakes?

740
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,100
Huh?

741
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,820
They are...

742
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:20,670
 I went up on the mountain last spring. 

743
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,470
 And there were a whole bunch of them growing together. 

744
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,510
What are those?

745
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,510
Marijuana!

746
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,350
It was marijuana!

747
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,800
Marijuana...

748
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,260
- What? 
 - Oh, my.

749
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,450
Marijuana.

750
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,620
What?

751
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,920
Marijuana?

752
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,230
I picked those flowers, dried them, and made rice cakes.

753
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,700
It cured all my aches and pains completely.

754
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,680
It helped me sleep at night too.

755
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,600
Grandma, that stuff is illegal!

756
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,760
I know that too.

757
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,470
It's bad if you get addicted.

758
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,150
It's bad for your brain too!

759
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,940
- I know that too. 
 - But why?

760
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,680
I was dying from my aches!

761
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,020
I meant to make it and eat it every so often,

762
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,720
but I got caught by my son.

763
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,980
At first, I just wanted to pull out the weed give it a little fertilizer.

764
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,680
And it kept growing more and became a big bunch.

765
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,550
Aigoo, what do I do?

766
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,690
Attorney Kim!

767
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,750
Attorney Kim!

768
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,410
- Yoo Ri! 
 - Attorney!

769
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,270
Hold on, hold on!

770
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,140
Get her, get her!

771
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,870
Hey, Young Joon. You came.

772
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,410
What are you doing here at this hour...

773
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:56,550
Move the truck. We need to drive down.

774
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,970
Hey, what are you doing?

775
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,030
Where are you going?

776
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,640
We need to take her to the hospital. Move!

777
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,450
She can't go to the hospital like that!

778
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,450
Young Joon!

779
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,830
- Stop! 
 - Be quiet, Mother!

780
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:17,520
You grew, carried, possessed, transported, and used marijuana!

781
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,510
Not only that, you were even dealing them too.

782
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,360
You already committed felonies.

783
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,830
Be quiet and move.

784
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,060
Are you thinking of reporting me?

785
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,690
- I said move! 
 - What do you mean, report?

786
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:30,850
No need to make it a big deal.

787
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,260
That stuff grows in fields in the countryside!

788
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,010
What do you mean they grow in the fields?

789
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,100
That's what I'm telling you!

790
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,090
What?

791
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,520
- My goodness. 
 - What's this?

792
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,110
Are you crazy? What did you do just now?

793
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,080
Young Joon, you bastard! You crazy bastard!

794
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,900
That marijuana or whatever! Whatever is tormenting Big Sis,

795
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,700
I'm going to flip everything over, you bastard!

796
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,940
Do you even know how much that costs?

797
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,730
What's more important?

798
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,950
Is that more important than your mother?

799
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,450
- You d*** bastard! 
 - Why are you doing this?

800
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,880
If you're going to make money, do it honestly!

801
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,340
- Stop! 
 - Attorney!

802
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,170
Stop!

803
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,610
Stop!

804
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,660
Stop!

805
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,940
Stop!

806
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,190
Stop!

807
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,950
Please stop!

808
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,220
We're all going to die at this rate!

809
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,240
What did I do wrong?

810
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,640
Who do you think you are?

811
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,510
The floor is cold. It's cold.

812
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,070
It's freezing in here. What should we do?

813
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,500
Excuse me.

814
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,750
- The floor is so cold in there... 
 - It's cold.

815
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,310
Why didn't you say you were in that much pain?

816
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,090
It already spread everywhere apparently.

817
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,570
There's no use getting treated.

818
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,360
I don't want to die in hospital.

819
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,340
I lived all my life in this neighborhood and property.

820
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,720
I want to die with my friends on my side.

821
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,690
Gosh darn it.

822
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,390
But I ended up behind bars.

823
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,450
You have no criminal record, and there are extenuating circumstances too.

824
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,930
I don't think you'll have to go to prison for it. Don't worry.

825
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,510
But...

826
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:12,190
my son would get pushed a little more, right?

827
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,980
- What did I do? Seriously! 
 - Calm down.

828
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,270
Tell the Agriculture Department people to come here!

829
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,170
What are you holding her in there for?

830
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,380
Yes.

831
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,660
But still...

832
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,280
I feel like the weight that I borne for 10 years has been lifted off.

833
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,570
I can sleep well now.

834
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,910
By the way,

835
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:50,410
please tell the attorney lady that I'm really sorry.

836
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,620
Aigoo, she ate so much of that.

837
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:56,570
Okay.

838
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:59,640
Get her an electric blanket at least!

839
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,130
An old lady is sitting on that cold floor...

840
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,670
Young man.

841
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,270
Yes.

842
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,370
Do you want to hear a secret?

843
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,020
I probably seem really old to you,

844
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:21,090
but you don't know how fast my life went by.

845
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:23,340
Whenever I look in the mirror,

846
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,090
I'm shocked every day

847
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:31,070
that I became and old wrinkly grandma.

848
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:39,780
My husband died when he was 40.

849
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:46,470
We don't have as much time as we think.

850
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:53,960
The world doesn't wait for us to say everything we want to say.

851
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,020
♫  Don't draw me in anymore  ♫

852
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,360
♫  Don't smile at me  ♫

853
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:12,320
 So don't waste time hurting and agonizing the person who's dear to you. 

854
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,110
 It's such a waste. 

855
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,140
   

856
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,250
♫  Don't be in pain  ♫

857
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:24,190
♫  Don't fade away  ♫

858
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,150
   

859
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:29,020
♫  Just like sunshine  ♫

860
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,800
Yes.

861
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,130
What's wrong? Do you have a headache?

862
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,650
No, just because...

863
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,580
Just because?

864
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:49,510
I just remember the starlights...

865
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,630
What was that?

866
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,720
Did I get drunk?

867
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,230
When did I drink?

868
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,800
Boss, you know the rice cake you ate?

869
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,440
That wasn't a mugwort rice cake.

870
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,350
What then?

871
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,380
That was mariju-

872
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,890
Yes...

873
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:16,300
Well, just think of it as a quick trip.

874
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,520
   

875
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,090
How did it go?

876
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:35,570
I tried to stop no matter what, but...

877
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,950
But what?

878
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,740
I just let it happen. I didn't want to bother.

879
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,940
W-What?

880
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,900
What time is it?

881
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,340
The news...

882
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,580
 Breaking news. 

883
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:51,910
 Kim Seung Woon, the Inspector General of SPO, who's been pushing for reform of the Prosecutors' Office 

884
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:55,970
 has been covering up the corruption of Dohan Group, owned by his in-laws. 

885
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,060
 The scandal has caused great controversy. 

886
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,600
 Regarding this, the Dohan Group and Inspector General Kim, the Prosecutors' Office... 

887
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,610
 Kim Jeong Ho, why didn't you pick up your phone? 

888
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:05,990
 Forget it. 

889
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:11,660
 I don't know how they figured it out, but Jodong Newspaper exposed everything. 

890
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,830
 Inspector General Kim Seoung Woon's wife, 

891
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,520
 Lee Hyun Joo, is the youngest daughter of Lee Byung Wook, the CEO of Dohan Group. 

892
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,990
 It was known that she cut ties with Dohan Group 

893
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:22,640
 after marrying Kim Seung Woon, who was a public prosecutor at the time. 

894
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,580
 But according to the recent discovery, 

895
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,510
 Inspector General Kim Seoung Woon and Dohan Group 

896
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:31,890
 engaged in a certain deal starting with the 2016 Hwacheon Warehouse case. 

897
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:37,480
 Although it's yet to be known what kind of deal Inspector General Kim and Dohan Group made, 

898
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,280
 but there are rumors involving cover-up investigations, illegal solicitation or bribery 

899
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,900
 in the effort to invalidate evidence. 

900
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,980
   

901
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,190
   

902
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,780
   

903
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,920
Attorney Kim!

904
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,950
Attorney Kim, hold on!

905
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:21,740
Jeong Ho tried to tell you.

906
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,980
It's true. Please believe me.

907
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,580
 What you think is right for you isn't right for everyone. 

908
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,490
 I'm sorry about your father. 

909
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,390
 I think your father did everything he could. 

910
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,010
 But for me to go to you, 

911
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:42,030
 there are quite a few things I need to take care of. 

912
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,580
 She must've had a reason she couldn't talk. 

913
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:49,420
 She must've had a reason that drove her crazy, broke her heart and make her feel frustrated. 

914
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:52,490
 So please wait for me a little bit. 

915
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,880
Did your father cover up my dad's case too?

916
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,180
♫  After the long rain  ♫

917
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,410
Is this what you needed to take care of?

918
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:05,370
I wanted to tell you after I take care of it first.

919
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,540
- But it's too late. 
 - Yes, it's too late.

920
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,590
♫  I remember your face  ♫

921
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,070
That's why I decided to run to you without

922
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,720
wasting a moment from now on.

923
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,400
What am I to do, Kim Jeong Ho?

924
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,770
I'm starting to hate you as you said.

925
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:30,770
♫  I think I couldn't tell you yet  ♫

926
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,770
You can hate me.

927
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,150
You can run away.

928
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,640
You can walk backward and push me away.

929
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,380
So please...

930
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,720

 I'm willing to receive any kind of punishment.

 You should wait then. 

942

 I don't even have the heart to punish you right now.

 It's all because of him.

 You mean everyone here is a victim of that ridiculous shaman? 

947
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,810
 Is it because of that lawyer woman? 

948
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:09,470
 That arrogant woman, not knowing her place. 

949

 Those eyes... 

950

 Is there anything else I don't know about? 

951
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,940
 The fact that I love you.
