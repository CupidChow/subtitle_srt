1
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,560
   

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,000
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

4
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,220
♫  When I think about you  ♫

5
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,430
♫  The spring that resembles you comes to my heart  ♫

6
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,200
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,380
♫  Even if it rains, even when the cold wind blows  ♫

8
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,010
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

9
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,480
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,440
- Take it off? 
 - Yeah, take it off.

11
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,430
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

12
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,470
Wait, wait.

13
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,950
   

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,940
Not today.

15
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,410
- Who is it? 
 - It's just Do Jin Ki.

16
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,220
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,450
♫  Will you tell me you love me?  ♫

18
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:56,300
♫  I will kiss your lips with all my love for you  ♫

19
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,880
♫  Because it's my love for you  ♫

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,530
 Hey, Kim Jeong Ho! Open the door. 

21
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:05,834
 Hey, Kim Jeong Ho! Are you sleeping? 

22
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:12,417
They left, they left!

23
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,627
 Is he sleeping? 

24
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,097
Honey, let me try calling him.

25
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:20,457
Oh, God, what the...

26
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,857
Why are they here at this time of night?

27
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:24,277
- I've put on my clothes. 
 - Put it on, put it on.

28
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,727
Why are they here all of a sudden?

29
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,037
Wait, wait, wait.

30
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:28,887
Lace it up again.

31
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,087
Wait. You were inside?

32
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:32,487
Yeah, I was.

33
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:33,607
Yeah.

34
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,657
- Oh, what are you guys here for? 
 - Yeah, what's up?

35
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,867
You didn't even give me a call beforehand.

36
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:40,927
What's going on between you two?

37
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,447
- What do you mean? 
 - What?

38
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,047
- What? Huh? 
 - Honey.

39
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:48,057
They seem to emanate an aura restricted for viewers under 18. Is it just me?

40
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:49,257
Why do you keep asking?

41
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:51,537
Next time, let's just call beforehand before coming.

42
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:55,217
We did call them. It's just that they didn't pick up.

43
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,087
Okay.

44
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:01,067
Since it seems like you guys caught on...

45
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,487
What's with all this you brought?

46
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:05,137
You bought meat!

47
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,137
So since we seemed to have caught on already...

48
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,037
What's after that?

49
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:12,527
- So we... 
 - As you guys probably caught on,

50
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,517
we had a lot of stuff happening today.

51
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:15,597
I told you last time.

52
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,707
We decided to run the Law Cafe business together.

53
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:21,717
Gosh, it's tough working into the night.

54
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:24,427
Yoo Na! Should we eat some meat?

55
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:25,557
- No. 
 - Are you sure we can go in?

56
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:26,887
- We can go inside? 
 - Sure!

57
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,077
- Are you sure it's okay? 
 - Are you sure it's fine?

58
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,247
Of course, come on in!

59
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:33,007
- Your fashion is good now. 
 - Yeah, I like your pajamas.

60
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,287
Let's go inside, Yoo Na!

61
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:37,227
So when are you going to tell us then?

62
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:39,387
Stop interrogating them. Let's go!

63
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,677
- Continue where you left off! 
 - Thanks for the food.

64
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:42,757
All right, let's go.

65
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,610
- Get home safely! 
 - Bye!

66
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:52,050


67
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,207
- What's the problem? 
 - What?

68
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:57,807
Why do we need to hide our relationship from them?

69
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:59,417
I mean, our relationship is like one day—

70
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,997
No, more like one hour old.

71
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:03,737
What does that matter, whether it's been one day or one hour?

72
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:07,347
It's not like our relationship is something that will last just one hour and end.

73
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,577
You don't know that.

74
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:12,407
"You don't know that"?

75
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,647
No, what I mean is...

76
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:17,777
I feel a little shy about letting other people know about it,

77
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,807
and I think it's something that requires careful thought.

78
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:23,357
So...

79
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,267
for the time being,

80
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,707
let's have a secret dating relationship.

81
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,507
Wh-What relationship?

82
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:34,157
Let's have a secret dating relationship.

83
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,527
Hey! Is this a company or a school?

84
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,857
Why should we do that?

85
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,067
Oh, that?

86
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:51,547
It's probably because she's had so many relationships that have gone wrong.

87
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:54,757
If there is even such a thing as being good or bad at dating,

88
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:59,417
Kim Yoo Ri is terribly bad at it.

89
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:02,327
 It's that sunbae. 

90
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:04,737
 Where? Where, where? 

91
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:24,617
 First, she has a terrible eye for guys. 

92
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,167
 - I'm sorry. 
 - You're sorry? 

93
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,137
 What are you sorry about? 

94
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:34,287
 I couldn't pay you much attention because I was busy with work. 

95
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:35,837
 Your phone call! The fact that I didn't notice your phone call! 

96
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:38,987
 Yeah! That's it. 

97
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:42,027
 Then, by chance, is it because I didn't get to see you 

98
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:45,327
 on your birthday because I was hanging out with Se Yeon and the others? 

99
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:46,877
 Today! 

100
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:49,297
 Today is my birthday! 

101
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,307
 Honey! 

102
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:55,397
 She's oblivious, but there are a lot of things that are important to her aside from dating. 

103
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:00,957
 Honey, you're always like this! 

104
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:01,947
 Honey... 

105
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:05,367
 And the way she rushes in and comes onto them. 

106
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:06,817
It's the perfect recipe for disaster!

107
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,477
I mean, nobody's taught her that.

108
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:11,047
How could she have failed so miserably?

109
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,477
There probably was someone who taught her.

110
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:16,067
What? Whom?

111
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,127
You.

112
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,547
Me? What are you talking about?

113
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,677
So you two shouldn't give each other advice.

114
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,717
I think that's the primary reason for failure.

115
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,567
Why?

116
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,607
Oh, there's no cup.

117
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,487
See you.

118
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:36,067
You think Jeong Ho wouldn't have had anyone during this time?

119
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:40,067
For that long period of time, there were attempts to forget Kim Yoo Ri.

120
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,987
 I'm telling you that I like you, Sunbae. 

121
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,977
 Are you listening to me? 

122
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:47,487
 Yeah, I am. 

123
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,747
 Go out with me, Sunbae! 

124
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,337
 How could you do this to me! 

125
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:58,987
 Who changes their mind in a day like this? 

126
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:03,157
 Even for an object, you can cancel a contract in seven days out of a change of heart. 

127
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,787
 Am I an object? 

128
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,127
   

129
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,507
 Hey! 

130
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:22,577
 Then you shouldn't have said yes! 

131
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:29,237
 Just do what I tell you, and you wouldn't get slapped. 

132
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:30,897
 Seriously! 

133
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:36,017
Wow, he's such a bad bastard.

134
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:37,927
- He did that? 
 - Yeah.

135
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:40,007
You said you forget people with people,

136
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:41,937
so you kept introducing people to him.

137
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,657
Cheers!

138
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:45,697
Thinking about it, you're really the biggest problem.

139
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,667
What do we do?

140
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,997
You're trying to pick a fight with me, right?

141
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:52,947
No!

142
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,687
We promised not to fight while talking about other people!

143
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,007
The baby woke up!

144
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,117
Go put her to sleep!

145
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:11,747
   

146
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:20,707
Good morning!

147
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,670
   

148
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:32,467
I'm tired.

149
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:35,257
What do you want to do together? I told you I'll go after watching a movie.

150
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:38,017
Just go home. Just go home and—

151
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,967
Did you get upset?

152
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,067
Why would you get upset over something like that?

153
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:45,027
Who says I'm upset?

154
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:47,297
Okay, we'll do what you say.

155
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:50,077
Secret, secret. Secret.

156
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,077
Hey, Jeong Ho!

157
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:55,867
- Oh, Hyung! 
 - Oh, Doctor!

158
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,437
Are you going home now?

159
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,760
Hyung, you don't have an umbrella?

160
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,670
 I'm coming. 

161
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:13,787
It's a relief that it stopped raining.

162
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,527
It was pouring so hard,

163
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:18,717
it would have been the perfect weather to watch a horror movie.

164
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:24,897
Oh, right. Doctor, you don't really like creepy stuff, right?

165
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,167
I guess you like it, Attorney?

166
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,837
Hyung, you can't figure it out even after seeing her all this time?

167
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,697
Kim Yoo Ri has no fear in the world.

168
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,797
Oh, wait. No. Actually, there is something she's afraid of.

169
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:38,067
The attention of others.

170
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:41,117
How others would see us and how others would—

171
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:44,067
Oh, there was a mosquito on you.

172
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,007
Hyung.

173
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:56,227
Is there a problem?

174
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,237
Yeah...

175
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:59,837
You didn't look too good since earlier...

176
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,947
Is something wrong?

177
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:04,517
No, what could possibly be wrong?

178
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,497
Let's go.

179
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:02,127
   

180
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:07,467
   

181
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:10,547
The food turned out well today as well.

182
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:11,577
- Yeah, Hyungnim! 
 - Isn't it good?

183
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,597
Oh, is the soup good?

184
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,017
Eat up!

185
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,907
Eat up.

186
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,207
What else do you want to eat?

187
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,907
Oh, oh, okay. Here, here.

188
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,287
Here, you should eat a lot of meat.

189
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,297
Then what will Ms. Chae eat?

190
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:26,307
She hurt her arm before.

191
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,967
She's still in recovery. In recovery.

192
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,947
Eat up.

193
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:36,377
But where did the doctor go?

194
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,677
I don't see him today.

195
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:40,007
Well, when I saw him in the morning,

196
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,997
maybe he's dealing with some issue, but his face was pale

197
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:46,167
- and didn't look good.
 - He must have gotten indigestion again.

198
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,477
He gets indigestion really easily.

199
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,107
Give it to me. I'll do it.

200
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,437
The laver...

201
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:59,447
Here. Okay, eat!

202
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,427
- Good. 
 - Right?

203
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,687
So savory.

204
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,907
Oh, yeah. It's savory.

205
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,137
It's savory.

206
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:18,057
It's savory. Try it.

207
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,297
Try tasting it.

208
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,817
- Thank you for the food! 
 - Thank you for the food!

209
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:26,547
Yeah, you guys probably enjoyed your food.

210
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,707
Did they decide to start dating?

211
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:34,757
I've never seen such a public secret dating relationship.

212
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:38,327
They're really making it difficult for themselves.

213
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:44,217
Where did it go?

214
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:46,297
What?

215
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,687
The flower pot over there.

216
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:50,667
Did Eun Kang take it to water it?

217
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,107
I guess he did.

218
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:53,527
Here, drink some coffee.

219
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,267
- Have you tried it? 
 - Oh, wait.

220
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,157
It's perfect. It's just right.

221
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,077
It's okay, right?

222
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,177
Yeah.

223
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,847
- Tissue. 
 - Tissue, tissue!

224
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:09,337
Tissue, tissue... here.

225
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:13,807
Geez, they're really starting to annoy me.

226
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,127
Will that be enough?

227
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,557
Oh, no! Hyung! You can't do that!

228
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:18,367
No?

229
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,837
We're going to have to clean it up.

230
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,747
Still... 
 - No, no! Hold it in!

231
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,367
Give me a sec.

232
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:28,437
   
 Prosecutor, they found Kang Do Hyun's body. 

233
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:36,307
Geez! Why are you here now? I called you forever ago!

234
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,927
Are you sure that Kang Do Hyun died?

235
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:41,537
Prosecutor, you told me last time

236
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:45,497
to check all the bodies unclaimed by family relatives. 
    

237
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:50,237
So I was looking through them when I saw this name here.

238
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,677
The date of birth matches too.

239
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:57,577
Geez, it turns out that Lee Pyeon Woong is one scary bastard.

240
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,207
Because he feels like someone might catch up to him,

241
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:02,507
he killed him off to prevent any connections leading to him.

242
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:05,877
I'm going to head to the police, so organize the files for me.

243
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,197
Okay.

244
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:11,097
Who killed whom?

245
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,457
What's this all about?

246
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:20,767
The guy who hit you and drove off.

247
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,177
We thought we had nearly found him.

248
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:24,317
That man died?

249
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,587
Are you telling me that Lee Pyeon Woong just killed that man?

250
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:29,767
We're only saying that there's reasonable cause for suspicion.

251
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,507
This is ridiculous.

252
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,417
Why is he going to such an extent?

253
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:36,467
Because he's a bastard who knows no boundaries.

254
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,987
Hey, Yoo Ri.

255
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,687
Kim Yoo Ri!

256
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,387
We're already commuting to and from work together.

257
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,117
What more do you want?

258
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:50,917
I'm just saying that we should be more careful!

259
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,297
Okay. Let's say that we're always sticking together.

260
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:55,637
How long do you think we can keep this up?

261
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:58,077
Until Lee Pyeon Woong dies?

262
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:02,637
I want to be lovers with you.

263
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,467
I don't want you to be my guardian.

264
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:38,527
- Whoa! 
 - I'm sorry—

265
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,847
 When I looked up your interview, 

266
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:46,827
 you said your dream is for the Law Cafe to be everywhere, like Starbucks. 

267
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:48,997
 What do you think of me? 

268
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:51,317
 I'm an attorney as well. 

269
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,487
It's you, right?

270
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:53,867
The person I met at the office.

271
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,337
Oh, Attorney!

272
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,707
What a coincidence to meet you here!

273
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,117
Oh, right! Attorney, your cafe was in this neighborhood, right?

274
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,157
Yes, that's right.

275
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:04,007
I've been meaning to contact you...

276
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,347
Oh, were you taking a stroll?

277
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:07,407
Yes.

278
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:11,397
Since we've met anyway, shall we walk together for a moment?

279
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,787
Oh, okay! Sounds good.

280
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,917
So you were part of a public interest foundation at a law firm,

281
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,987
and you left and opened your own legal office?

282
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:22,267
How are you so similar to me?

283
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:25,367
I know. I find it so interesting as well.

284
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,487
So I was thinking,

285
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,987
I do this with my colleagues called "Wish Law,"

286
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:34,537
that is, a public interest lawyers' meeting called "Law that fulfills wishes."

287
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:37,877
Would you be able to come to our meeting once later?

288
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:39,917
We're your fans.

289
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,227
Gosh, you don't mean that.

290
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,627
- Okay! 
 - Seriously?

291
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,477
I'm so excited!

292
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:49,967
But when I saw you before, you didn't look too well.

293
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,877
Were you dealing with some issues?

294
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:56,177
Oh, I had a little fight with my boyfriend.

295
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:07,397
Here.

296
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,917
So...

297
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:12,737
even before 24 hours passed since you guys started dating, you guys fought?

298
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:16,087
I mean, it's possible with you guys.

299
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:21,347
Do you think it's normal to be so d*** scared like this?

300
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:26,627
I'm scared to just let her walk in the streets.

301
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:29,537
I'm scared that something might happen while walking in the streets.

302
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:32,917
I'm scared that she might suddenly disappear from me.

303
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,337
Or that I do something wrong, and something happens to her because of me...

304
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,107
Seriously, if it were up to me,

305
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:45,417
I want to prevent her from going anywhere or doing anything.

306
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:49,287
I mean, I understand that my situation is like that.

307
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,387
But he's just so anxious about my every single move.

308
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:55,557
But I feel like it's just getting more severe...

309
00:17:57,697 --> 00:17:58,847
Oh, I'm sorry.

310
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:01,797
I'm saying all kinds of things to you, Da Young.

311
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,267
You're so lucky.

312
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:09,357
Excuse me?

313
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:13,017
He must love you very much to be acting like that.

314
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:16,247
Is that so?

315
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:24,487
 If there's no madness, anxiety, and fear, how could that be love? 

316
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:26,847
They're all part of the whirlpool of emotions you'll experience.

317
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,407
This feeling of anxiety, fear, and going mad...

318
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:32,037
This is normal?

319
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,237
How did you endure this?

320
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:38,667
Now you have Yoo Na as well. Don't you get anxious?

321
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,347
I'm literally spending all my time watching the baby, neglecting my restaurant.

322
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,177
You think I'm not anxious?

323
00:18:43,177 --> 00:18:45,647
And honestly, you're not even at my level to come to me like this.

324
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,787
Do you know the burden of raising a child?

325
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,267
Hyung.

326
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,857
Hyung!

327
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:57,277
Hyung Woo Jin!

328
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,347
Hey, Jeong Ho.

329
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,377
I was calling you. Why couldn't you hear me?

330
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:03,407
Are you already headed home?

331
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:06,577
Oh... well...

332
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,877
Hyung, is something the matter?

333
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,387
There is something wrong, right?

334
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:13,317
What is it?

335
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,637
I think that woman came back.

336
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:51,022
Do you want to come inside before you leave?

337
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,762
Are you not angry?

338
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:58,200
I am angry, but I want to be with you.

339
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:12,502
It's a shame, but I'll just go for today.

340
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,712
I told Hyung I'll be with him.

341
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,102
Suddenly?

342
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:17,662
Yeah.

343
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:21,182
Hyung Woo Jin is feeling a bit anxious.

344
00:20:21,182 --> 00:20:25,352
It's not an impromptu arrangement you came up with in case I came onto you?

345
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,172
I'm telling you now, but I plan to start shyly holding hands,

346
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:32,462
and do everything in order, one step at a time.

347
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,402
What do you mean, do everything in order? In this day and age?

348
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,662
Just mix it up!

349
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:39,332
I'm agreeing to keep our relationship secret from that line of thought.

350
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:42,492
That we do things in order, one step at a time.

351
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,182
We're old enough. What do you mean, do things one step at a time?

352
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,822
I'm not interested in doing anything like that—

353
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:59,532
You don't even know if you can handle it,

354
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:03,172
so don't tempt me.

355
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,682
Kim Yoo Ri, what's wrong?

356
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,372
Why...

357
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,552
Who says I can't handle it?

358
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,762
What's this?

359
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,832
Why?

360
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,632
Do you feel like someone broke into your place?

361
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:46,902
Yeah. I'm sure of it.

362
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:50,102
So you're saying that person made this mess, right?

363
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:53,862
No, I made most of the mess, but...

364
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,602
Although it looks like a random mess, there's a certain method to my madness.

365
00:21:57,602 --> 00:21:59,002
Look at that remote control!

366
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,182
It's in its rightful place.

367
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:01,952
If it were me, I'd never do that.

368
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:04,352
That cupboard door too. I'm sure I left it open this opening before leaving,

369
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,372
and they're closed right now!

370
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,352
What about missing items?

371
00:22:10,352 --> 00:22:12,632
I don't know about that yet.

372
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,062
Is this the work of Lee Pyeon Woong, or whatever the name of that bastard was?

373
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,412
Hey, that's not something you should be asking us. That's for you guys to figure out!

374
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:20,182
But why are you already furious?

375
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:23,442
How can I not get furious about this? Something like this happened again!

376
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,142
So what are you going to do about this?

377
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:27,322
What do you mean, what am I going to do about this?

378
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:28,672
Obviously, we'll reinforce the patrol around this place—

379
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:29,882
You think that's going to be enough?

380
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,962
Then what? Should I live with her for the rest of her life?

381
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:33,432
If you would do that, then I would be grateful!

382
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,592
My house got broken into. Why are you guys fighting?

383
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,202
You should go. Dr. Woo Jin is probably waiting for you.

384
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:42,442
Where would I go with all this happening?

385
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,762
So what's going on right now?

386
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:51,292
So there are some strange people

387
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:54,172
surrounding Attorney Kim Yoo Ri. So I'm looking into it.

388
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,192
There are other people following her aside from us?

389
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:00,632
What?

390
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,432
What's this?

391
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:08,342
Wow, if you think about it, Attorney Kim is really unlucky.

392
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:11,392
How is it that all the guys after her are like this?

393
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:15,082
God d*** it.

394
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:18,342
I really hate it when others mess with what's mine.

395
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:20,332
What should I do about this...

396
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:26,952
How did you come to this conclusion?

397
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:28,572
I can't leave you by yourself,

398
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:31,142
but I also can't leave this hyung by himself.

399
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,232
And you refused to come to my place, so...

400
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:34,912
what other option do I have?

401
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,922
We'll be staying with you for a while.

402
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:42,852
I think she's angry.

403
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:45,902
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri is a public welfare attorney.

404
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,872
What are you doing?

405
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,192
I'm in the middle of taking care of myself. Why?

406
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:08,712
So that I could look prettier in someone's eyes.

407
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:11,772
Where could you possibly get prettier?

408
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:13,042
Oh, my God, you must be crazy!

409
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,892
Why are you getting so fluttery over that?

410
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,972
Now get used to it.

411
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,002
Come outside.

412
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:20,402
Let's have a drink since things turned out like this.

413
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:25,592
"Where could you possibly get prettier?"

414
00:24:25,592 --> 00:24:27,582
Am I liking this or hating this?

415
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:30,302
Drinking like this after so long feels–

416
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:32,812
Here.

417
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,632
All right.

418
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,132
Well...

419
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:46,112
I'm not sure if it's good for me to follow him all the way here like this,

420
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:49,042
but recently, I've been a bit afraid.

421
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,842
Hyung, if it's difficult for you, you don't have to tell her.

422
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,002
Three years ago, I went through a difficult situation.

423
00:24:59,002 --> 00:25:01,902
And I moved my hospital as well as a result.

424
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,812
There was a really tenacious stalker after him.

425
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:08,482
He really went through a hard time back then.

426
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,562
A stalker?

427
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,862
Thank you...

428
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,182
 At first, 

429
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,262
 we met as a patient and doctor at the hospital. 

430
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:20,972
 Don't worry. 

431
00:25:20,972 --> 00:25:22,772
 Oh, I'm sorry— 

432
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,682
 - Oh, my goodness! Doctor. 
 - Oh, hello. 

433
00:25:25,682 --> 00:25:27,532
 Oh, sorry! 

434
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:28,552
 Let's eat. 

435
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:32,992
 At first, she slowly began obsessing over me .

436
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,012
 Okay, I'm heading home now. 

437
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,312
 Did you see my umbrella? 

438
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:43,252
 No, we haven't. 

439
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,122
 Later, at every location I went... 

440
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,272
 Then you should have applied immediately for a restraining order! 

441
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:13,232
 Of course, he did. 

442
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:14,212
But whenever she gets caught,

443
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:16,182
she just pays the fine and keeps doing it.

444
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:17,902
It just so happens that her family is rich.

445
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:18,842
What?

446
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:21,352
I mean, a law to punish stalking exists now,

447
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:22,812
but back then,

448
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:25,942
there were no legal ways to prohibit behavior like that.

449
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:27,342
So after a while,

450
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:29,902
it got to the point where she was breaking into his house,

451
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,372
so she almost got prison time.

452
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:32,952
But this man here

453
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:35,212
decided to write her a letter of non-punishment!

454
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:40,132
I mean, her parents promised me that they would send her abroad.

455
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,522
But then...

456
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:47,642
are you still dealing with the same problem?

457
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:50,442
Well, things were fine for several years,

458
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,282
but recently, it kept feeling like someone was tailing me.

459
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:57,002
- It could just be me being paranoid, but... 
 - No, no, no.

460
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:59,452
The pattern is way too similar to the last time.

461
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,642
Hyung.

462
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:03,502
If you're thinking of going soft on her because she's a patient or whatever,

463
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:06,012
you'd better come to your senses about this.

464
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:10,402
She spread weird rumors and caused your hospital to go out of business.

465
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:14,052
Why did you forgive her then? I still can't understand it.

466
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,182
But I mean, I can understand the doctor.

467
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:20,942
If my patient did that,

468
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:24,352
I don't think I could have hated her for it.

469
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,672
It's true that this bastard is following you!

470
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:38,462
What do you mean you were being paranoid?

471
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,712
But didn't you say that the person stalking you is a woman, Doctor?

472
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:43,002
This bastard is a man.

473
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:45,932
No! This woman hired other people to follow him around like this.

474
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:47,112
I'm 100% positive about this.

475
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:49,892
Who's accepting dirty requests like this?

476
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:53,612
They should have some pride being in this business! They should be demolished.

477
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:56,562
Hyung, are you okay?

478
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:59,072
Yeah. I'm okay.

479
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,982
But if this is from yesterday,

480
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:05,662
isn't she somewhere nearby right now?

481
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,512
 Is it a gathering I can't accompany you to? 

482
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,252
It's a public interest attorneys' meeting.

483
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:12,782
It's a place filled with attorneys. What could possibly happen there?

484
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:14,212
I'm not saying that particular space is dangerous.

485
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:15,882
There's the travel to and from that place...

486
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:20,022
And so, I decided to meet with that attorney and go there together.

487
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,442
Not only that, I'll be meeting them for the first time.

488
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:26,552
It's not like I can show up with my lover.

489
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,102
Lover?

490
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,012
Yeah, lover.

491
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:32,622
Aren't you?

492
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:36,292
If you say so, then I am.

493
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,042
Then, lover,

494
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,532
although I appreciate your concern,

495
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:42,132
I'll take care and go.

496
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,592
Okay.

497
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,552
Hello.

498
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,202
You arrived on time.

499
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:52,642
I bought you this. I thought you might be thirsty.

500
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:53,642
Please, drink.

501
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:55,722
Thank you.

502
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,782
But, Attorney, you're so pretty today as well.

503
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:08,062
Gosh! No, you're prettier, Da Young!

504
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:10,362
- Shall we go? 
 - Sure.

505
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,682
Hello.

506
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,712
Hello.

507
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:44,742
Why are you here?

508
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,352
- Yeah... What was I doing again— 
 - Hey, you!

509
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:50,092
4885!

510
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:51,582
That's you, right?

511
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:52,692
Excuse me?

512
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:54,212
Get out, get out.

513
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:57,052
Oh, the car? Yeah, I'll move out of the way.

514
00:29:58,252 --> 00:29:59,862
Where do you think you're going?

515
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:02,272
Get out! Right now.

516
00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:04,372
Hurry up and get out of the car!

517
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:06,972
Open the door for him so he can get off.

518
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,032
Oh, no!

519
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:12,052
- What, what? What's wrong? 
 - What should I do?

520
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:15,472
We refer to our files when we have our discussions during our meetings.

521
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:17,232
And it was my turn to get the documents ready.

522
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,052
Yes, and?

523
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:20,592
But I was so excited about meeting with you that

524
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:22,222
I think I left it at home.

525
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:22,982
What should I do?

526
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:25,502
Then how about we go over to our cafe and print them again...

527
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:27,732
No. I live right around here.

528
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:30,252
Can we stop by for a second?

529
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:32,492
Sure. Why not?

530
00:30:34,362 --> 00:30:36,192
Please come in.

531
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:40,052
- Give me a moment.
- Okay.

532
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,402
   

533
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,372
 Where did it go? 

534
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,922
   

535
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,782
How do I look?

536
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:29,202
It looks good on me, too, right?

537
00:31:29,202 --> 00:31:32,302
Let me try on the shoes, too.

538
00:31:45,012 --> 00:31:49,542
Is the medicine already working?

539
00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:05,372
I ought to!

540
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,162
Here.

541
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,712
I mean...

542
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:18,242
We were just asked to keep an eye out.

543
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:21,412
Don't you even have any ethics in your work?

544
00:32:21,412 --> 00:32:24,062
She basically outsourced stalking!

545
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:27,332
If that woman told you to watch someone 24/7,

546
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:29,632
didn't you just feel it in your gut? I just ought to!

547
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:32,592
Sir, you know best.

548
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:36,022
It's really tough for us to make a living these days.

549
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:39,632
And how could we turn down work like this?

550
00:32:39,632 --> 00:32:42,232
Why are you listening to him? Just report to the police.

551
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:43,632
Hand him over.

552
00:32:43,632 --> 00:32:45,522
Sir, Sir...

553
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:48,852
Please... I have two kids to feed.

554
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:50,212
But still.

555
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:52,242
You shouldn't have done that.

556
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:54,602
To you and that attorney...

557
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:57,252
- I'm so apolo— 
 - Wait.

558
00:32:57,252 --> 00:32:58,912
- Attorney? 
 - Yes!

559
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:01,902
You know, the one who runs a cafe downstairs...

560
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:03,742
What about her?

561
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:07,812
Hurry up and spill it!

562
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:09,642
I'm not sure. She just...

563
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:12,122
told me to keep an eye on her too.

564
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:14,282
They were meeting today too.

565
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:16,382
Who is meeting whom?

566
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:20,952
My client and that lady attorney.

567
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:19,052
Awake already?

568
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,462
Let me see...

569
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,012
9:05 a.m. Coming to the cafe in your car.

570
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:31,572
You give consultations all morning

571
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:35,922
and visit Happy Market at 1:08 p.m. to have lunch with your employees.

572
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:38,312
Resume your consultations at 2 p.m.

573
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:42,702
Have dinner at the cafe at 6:30 p.m. and close the cafe.

574
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:48,162
And then review documents and take care of work until 9 p.m.

575
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:50,782
You live so diligently,

576
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:52,582
don't you?

577
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,992
But I'm so curious about this.

578
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:59,362
No matter how many photos we take,

579
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:02,462
it's not like you can photograph one's heart.

580
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,312
Attorney, which one do you like between two?

581
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,672
It was you, right?

582
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:15,562
The stalker who is after Dr. Woo Jin.

583
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,492
You've heard about me, too?

584
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,242
You really must be close to him.

585
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:28,052
But you know...

586
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:33,552
Attorney, how come you're so pretty?

587
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,512
Is it your eyes?

588
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:41,592
What can I do...

589
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:46,492
to receive love from someone like Dr. Woo Jin?

590
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:50,132
Attorney, please let me know.

591
00:35:56,962 --> 00:36:00,162
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

592
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:14,212
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

593
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,212
Where are they?

594
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:26,972
I wouldn't know—

595
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:28,122
Tell me! Where are they!

596
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,212
I'm telling the truth! I really don't know!

597
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:31,702
Calm down, Jeong Ho. I'm sure they're fine.

598
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:33,942
How would you know that, Hyung?

599
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,512
- Tell me her address. 
 - She must be at her office.

600
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,572
I'll call and ask.

601
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,782
Don't do this...

602
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:52,402
and let me just go now.

603
00:36:52,402 --> 00:36:54,072
Why would Dr. Woo Jin like me?

604
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:57,252
That's your misunderstanding, Da Young.

605
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:01,962
I can tell by just looking at Dr. Woo Jin's eyes.

606
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:08,212
I've imagined ten million times how he would look at the woman he's in love with.

607
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:12,292
How does it feel when Dr. Woo Jin looks at you like that?

608
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,382
It's your misunderstanding!

609
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,702
Don't waste your energy on something so silly, and let me go!

610
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:18,602
I see...

611
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:22,412
I guess you don't know since your eyes are only on that man.

612
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:25,632
That's why my Dr. Woo Jin's eyes looked so sad.

613
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,592
I have no idea what kind of imagination you've got going there...

614
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,722
It's okay.

615
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:35,562
If he likes a woman like you, I'll become like you and love him.

616
00:37:35,562 --> 00:37:38,322
Do you think doing this is loving him?

617
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,242
I feel like burning up and tormented.

618
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:43,742
If this isn't love, then what? What is it?

619
00:37:43,742 --> 00:37:46,792
It's an obsession. It's violence.

620
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,702
Love isn't selfish like this.

621
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,532
So stop now.

622
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:55,882
For the sake of Dr. Woo Jin, you shouldn't go any further with this.

623
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:02,912
Now that I'm looking at you,

624
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:05,882
your eyes, Attorney...

625
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:08,532
really suck...

626
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:10,732
I think you see me as a joke.

627
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,712
Come on.

628
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:27,612
Are you sure it's here?

629
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:35,632
What the?

630
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,340
She's some kind of lunatic b****.

631
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,550
Hi, Attorney Kim.

632
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,117
Yoo Ri! Kim Yoo Ri!

633
00:38:57,117 --> 00:39:00,087
Are you okay? Open the door!

634
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,637
Kim Yoo Ri!

635
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:03,317
Who is it...

636
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,457
Yoo Ri!

637
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:09,607
What the?

638
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:11,767
Wh-Who are you...

639
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,237
Okay...

640
00:39:16,237 --> 00:39:17,177
This is...

641
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:19,437
What are you doing here?

642
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:23,197
I mean, I heard some crazy lunatic was hanging around you

643
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:27,027
so I came here to rescue you.

644
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:29,167
Like a prince.

645
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,087
That's right.

646
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:34,787
 I'll have to rescue Attorney Kim. 

647
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:36,657
 Pardon? 

648
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:38,217
 Think about it, Director. 

649
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:43,052
 If the guy who killed her father shows up in the nick of time and rescues her. 

650
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:45,687
 How would you feel if that happened? 

651
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:48,127
 When Attorney Kim tried to run over me with her car... 

652
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:51,717
 I'm sure she'd feel similar to how I felt then. 

653
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,237
 It was a s***ty feeling. 

654
00:40:00,627 --> 00:40:05,417
So you shouldn't be nice to just any stranger!

655
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,017
Hey. What the heck?

656
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:13,317
S***. She's fast.

657
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:16,257
She's running away!

658
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,957
But I have no reason to catch her.

659
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:23,337
I'm fine as long as I rescue you, Attorney Kim.

660
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,547
Like a prince.

661
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,127
   

662
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,527
- Hello? 
  - Come to the station right away. 

663
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,577
 Kim Yoo Ri is here. 

664
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,397
Taxi!

665
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,407
Hyung, aren't you getting in?

666
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:00,737
You go ahead.

667
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,077
I'll be right behind you.

668
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:03,857
Okay.

669
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:43,947
Doctor...

670
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,707
It's been a while.

671
00:41:47,707 --> 00:41:51,137
I couldn't...

672
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:55,477
stand to be apart from you...

673
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:57,967
That's why I'm here.

674
00:41:57,967 --> 00:42:00,327
Doctor, please...

675
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:04,066
Could you just love me?

676
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:13,604
Yoo Ri!

677
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,324
Jeong Ho.

678
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,014
You son of a b****!

679
00:42:25,014 --> 00:42:26,704
Move! Move it!

680
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,194
That son of a b****!

681
00:42:28,194 --> 00:42:30,364
What's with you? I'm a witness.

682
00:42:30,364 --> 00:42:31,374
Witness?

683
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,574
Witness, my a**!

684
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:35,794
- Cut the crap, you a**hole! 
 - It's true.

685
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:40,964
He brought Yoo Ri from that woman's house.

686
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:46,641
You motherf***er, what the hell are you up to!

687
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:48,621
What the hell am I up to?

688
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,641
My nephew speaks so poorly toward me, doesn't he?

689
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:53,781
Please step aside.

690
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:59,301
I really reflected on my actions last time.

691
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:03,741
It made me wonder if it was because I couldn't gain popularity before a big meeting.

692
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:07,491
I really have been renewed.

693
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:08,631
But you know...

694
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,631
I bumped into someone I know today

695
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:13,781
and he said he accidentally saw Attorney Kim getting dragged somewhere.

696
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:15,851
So, you know, I went after her because I was so worried.

697
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,821
And it was such a big mess when I got there.

698
00:43:17,821 --> 00:43:19,641
Are you okay?

699
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:23,691
When I look around after being renewed,

700
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:27,541
it makes me wonder why I've made both of you my enemies.

701
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:31,091
So as your uncle, befitting of an adult,

702
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:33,961
I decided to offer a truce.

703
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:37,811
From now on, I'll stop fighting with you guys.

704
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:39,111
Cut the bulls***.

705
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,001
Think of all the things you've done.

706
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,441
You've already crossed the line, you murderer!

707
00:43:51,221 --> 00:43:56,731
How could my a**hole of a nephew conspire against his uncle like this?

708
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,581
I'm telling you this clearly.

709
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:06,281
If you guys leave me alone, I'll also leave you guys alone.

710
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:08,381
Got that?

711
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:09,961
Okay?

712
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:13,401
Unni.

713
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,991
Unni!

714
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:17,471
Can I leave now?

715
00:44:20,971 --> 00:44:24,471
I can't believe I still get s*** even after doing a good deed.

716
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:27,051
 Even if I help them out... 

717
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:30,521
 Don't they give out courageous citizens awards these days... 

718
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:34,201
 How could people help each other out at this rate... 

719
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:36,201
Are you okay?

720
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:40,401
How is Dr. Woo Jin?

721
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:42,191
What?

722
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:44,981
We haven't caught that woman yet!

723
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:51,841
Da Young, please stop now.

724
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,681
I came here to end all this.

725
00:44:56,751 --> 00:45:00,671
You're the one who made me do all this, Doctor.

726
00:45:00,671 --> 00:45:03,231
Only you could understand me

727
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:05,911
and everything becomes fine as long as you're with me.

728
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,211
You made me this way, Doctor.

729
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,971
I'll dress, talk, and behave like Attorney Kim Yoo Ri.

730
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:12,961
That'll do it, right?

731
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:16,071
Look at me. I already look similar to her.

732
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:24,541
You must take responsibility for me to the end, Doctor.

733
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,661
I'm your patient.

734
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:31,501
 If my patient did that, 

735
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,911
 I don't think I could have hated her for it. 

736
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:39,921
 Gosh, you're all angels. 

737
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,651
 But Doctor, 

738
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:48,481
 if that person reappeared, do not forgive her again this time. 

739
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:49,861
 As for me, 

740
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:52,961
 even if that person is sick, and if that person hurts me, 

741
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:55,521
 I would never forgive her. 

742
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:57,151
 When I get confused, 

743
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,651
 I think of my mom and dad, 

744
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:03,311
 and people who cherish me. 

745
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:07,371
 People who would hurt more if I got hurt. 

746
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,631
 When I do that, things become clearer. 

747
00:46:13,431 --> 00:46:16,061
Why do I have to take responsibility for you, Da Young?

748
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:19,471
Everyone takes responsibility for themselves.

749
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:24,971
You've changed.

750
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:28,931
You look at me differently than before.

751
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:33,731
Before, you used to look at me with sadness and pity.

752
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:35,651
You used to see me like that, at least.

753
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:38,321
But there's nothing there now.

754
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,811
There's nothing there.

755
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,341
It's all because of that woman, isn't it?

756
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,391
No.

757
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:45,461
It's because of you, Da Young.

758
00:46:45,461 --> 00:46:48,271
You've made me this way, Da Young.

759
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,351
Please go home.

760
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:52,741
I really don't...

761
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:58,121
want to ever get mixed up with you again.

762
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:17,551
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

763
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:22,971
This world without you is meaningless to me.

764
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:26,391
Da Young!

765
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:53,131
Let's die together, Doctor!

766
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:56,411
That'd be better if I can't have you!

767
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:00,521
Right now we're not dying together...

768
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:03,931
You're killing me, Da Young!

769
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:08,831
Doctor! Doctor!

770
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,241
Hyung! Hyung!

771
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:23,181
Da Young, is this the love that you speak of?

772
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:29,031
The love that I know is liking something she likes alongside her

773
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,511
and watching her choices by her side.

774
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,161
And even if it's too tough for me to love her by myself,

775
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:39,391
it's not letting her know the pain I feel.

776
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:44,661
Because I don't want her to feel any amount of guilt or have her struggle.

777
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:47,971
But you make me ill, Da Young.

778
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:49,591
No. No, Doctor...

779
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:52,081
You cause me to struggle!

780
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:55,641
You make me sick! You drive me crazy!

781
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,521
So please...

782
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:04,651
Please don't ever appear in front of me or people I cherish.

783
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,571
No... No, Doctor!

784
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:10,231
It's not like that!

785
00:49:10,231 --> 00:49:12,141
You have the right to an attorney.

786
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:13,971
You have the right to remain silent.

787
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:15,371
- No. No! 
 - Take her outside.

788
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:16,981
No! Doctor!

789
00:49:16,981 --> 00:49:18,251
It's not like that!

790
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,011
 It's not like that! 

791
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:24,481
 Doctor! No! 

792
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:27,991
♫  Stop your footsteps in this dark road  ♫

793
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:29,651
I'm sorry. I...

794
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:32,561
Today...

795
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:35,631
♫  Don't get hurt  ♫

796
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:38,431
It's okay, Dr. Woo Jin.

797
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:41,221
Everything is okay now.

798
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:42,471
It's all over.

799
00:49:42,471 --> 00:49:46,271
♫  Like the warm sunlight  ♫

800
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:50,401
♫  Embrace me once again  ♫

801
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,781
What kind of situation is this now?

802
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:07,171
What else?

803
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,481
It's a hug showing humane love.

804
00:50:09,481 --> 00:50:11,471
You'd never get this type of emotion.

805
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:14,071
I don't think you quite get it, either.

806
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:16,341
Yeah, that's actually true.

807
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:18,251
They're hugging for way too long.

808
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:22,321
♫  We can dream together  ♫

809
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,841
Is he asleep?

810
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:29,081
He must be exhausted.

811
00:50:29,081 --> 00:50:31,281
Are you all right?

812
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:33,741
Excuse me, you know...

813
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,111
don't you think it'd be tough for me to rest if you're here like this?

814
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:37,241
No.

815
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:38,661
We'll sit by your side.

816
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,491
Please rest assured and relax.

817
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:42,841
We'll be quiet. Just sleep.

818
00:50:42,841 --> 00:50:44,931
Oh, okay.

819
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,291
Kim Jeong Ho...

820
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:32,571
Kim Jeong Ho.

821
00:51:53,171 --> 00:51:54,931
Jeong Ho.

822
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:57,901
Why did you wake up so soon?

823
00:51:57,901 --> 00:51:59,831
You should've slept more.

824
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:03,511
Were you very angry earlier because of me?

825
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:05,911
I'm sorry.

826
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:09,831
The thought that Da Young could be that woman never even crossed my mind.

827
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:13,021
I must be stupid.

828
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:23,071
What do I do?

829
00:52:24,011 --> 00:52:29,561
I don't want to obsess like that woman and give you a hard time.

830
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:35,841
But I'm too afraid.

831
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:37,721
Why?

832
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:42,710
Why are you afraid?

833
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:47,381
I'm afraid you'd fall walking down the street

834
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:51,841
and I wonder if you'd get into an accident while driving...

835
00:52:51,841 --> 00:52:54,341
What if the world...

836
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,981
suddenly takes you away from me?

837
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:00,381
Or...

838
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:03,291
what if you get sick of me

839
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:06,891
and leave me all of a sudden?

840
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:09,381
All of that.

841
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:10,931
Why do you say stuff like that?

842
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:16,331
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

843
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:20,061
What should I do?

844
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:23,691
Do I make you that anxious?

845
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:27,541
♫  I wish I could look inside your heart  ♫

846
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:32,541
I wish you'd trust me.

847
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:35,891
Even if I face an accident or a crisis,

848
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:39,321
that I'd overcome the crisis by myself,

849
00:53:39,321 --> 00:53:42,611
that I'd be able to handle it wisely.

850
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:45,221
So...

851
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,961
 I'm scared, too. 

852
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:48,411
 But what can I do? 

853
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:50,551
 I just have to trust her. 

854
00:53:51,371 --> 00:53:53,451
 We're talking about Kim Yoo Ri and Han Se Yeon. 

855
00:53:53,451 --> 00:53:55,931
 Will they let something happen to them and leave us behind? 

856
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:59,071
 They can never go wrong. 

857
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:00,711
 I live my life believing in that. 

858
00:54:00,711 --> 00:54:05,981
♫  The short shower that didn't seem like that was coming  ♫

859
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:09,001
I'll instill trust in you.

860
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:11,891
If you believe in me,

861
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:15,901
I think I can do anything.

862
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:19,651
♫  I fall into deep thoughts  ♫

863
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:26,061
♫  Empty place, my heart disturbed  ♫

864
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:33,080
♫  I don't think it's dry from the rain yet  ♫

865
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:39,351
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

866
00:54:39,351 --> 00:54:42,021
 You could become more afraid because you have it 

867
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:46,301
and you could also thirst for it because you don't have it.

868
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:48,561
That could be love.

869
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:49,661
Here.

870
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,491
You don't have to give me the cake.

871
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:53,581
It's okay. It's leftovers.

872
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,231
No, it's okay. Really.

873
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,051
It's really okay.

874
00:54:57,051 --> 00:55:01,281
Ahjussi, do you pity us?

875
00:55:02,051 --> 00:55:03,871
What are you saying, Yi Seul?

876
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:08,391
Other kids say that when someone is nice to you for no reason,

877
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:11,921
it means he pities us.

878
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:14,211
What in the world?

879
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:23,381
Let me pay for it.

880
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:36,521
Wait.

881
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:42,091
Just a moment.

882
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:53,041
Yi Seul,

883
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,881
the reason I'm nice to you is because you're so pretty.

884
00:55:57,881 --> 00:56:00,091
When adults see pretty little kids,

885
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:04,131
they just want to give them yummy food and be nice to them.

886
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:05,701
It's like that.

887
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:07,981
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

888
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:10,921
And I also have a very tough time

889
00:56:10,921 --> 00:56:15,331
so I don't have time to feel pity for someone else.

890
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:23,911
If you leave with a misunderstanding,

891
00:56:23,911 --> 00:56:26,051
it wouldn't matter to me, but

892
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,361
you'd probably feel down for the rest of the day.

893
00:56:32,751 --> 00:56:34,491
That's why.

894
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,461
 Whether it's feeling regretful or empathy, 

895
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:42,981
 there are many ways for one soul to recognize another. 

896
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:46,351
But more difficult thing than starting to love someone

897
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:49,191
is sustaining that love. Don't you think so?

898
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:52,191
There is nothing worse than wrongly expressed love

899
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:55,541
that causes struggles for someone.

900
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:05,081
I'm here as a legal representative for Park Woo Jin and Kim Yoo Ri victims.

901
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:06,921
I'll make this short.

902
00:57:06,921 --> 00:57:09,791
"There will not be favorable arrangements or agreements like last time."

903
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:12,811
"Going forward until the day you die,"

904
00:57:12,811 --> 00:57:18,081
"in any way or form, please do not approach those two people."

905
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:23,481
Even if I said that courteously, I'm sure you won't understand.

906
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,921
Now, with the violation of enforcement of the stalking punishment act,

907
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:28,021
trespassing, kidnapping, and imprisonment,

908
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:31,761
and even attempted murder,

909
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:36,851
I'll make sure you never get to meet those two people this time around.

910
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,511
 In life, you experience things you can't avoid, just like the pouring rain. 

911
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:04,651
Hey, Honey!

912
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:09,291
Why did you leave the umbrella behind?

913
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:11,121
Hi, Mommy! Let's go.

914
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:16,501
- Let's go home. 
 - Come on. You missed mommy, huh?

915
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:19,261
How could the boss not have purchased an umbrella container?

916
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:21,831
How about you? How can you not even have an umbrella at home?

917
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,421
Oh, Doctor!

918
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,591
I knew we could count on you!

919
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:28,361
Wait, over there. Over there.

920
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:30,611
Please walk me to the bus stop.

921
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:31,481
Over there.

922
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:33,271
Wait, wait!

923
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:34,901
I'll ask your favor, too.

924
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:36,361
- I hate being cold. 
 - Wait for us!

925
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:38,381
Wait for us...

926
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,561
Me, too!

927
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:40,581
Me, too, Doctor!

928
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:41,971
Just to my car.

929
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:43,981
- Let's go. 
 - How can we walk like this?

930
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:46,031
Just keep our heads under and go. Let's go!

931
00:58:46,031 --> 00:58:47,901
 Even if standing in the rain, 

932
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:51,171
 if there are people who'd become an umbrella for you, 

933
00:58:51,171 --> 00:58:53,311
 although you may get a little wet, 

934
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:57,721
 I think you may be able to shake it off and stand up again. 

935
00:58:57,721 --> 00:59:04,361
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

936
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:07,981
Then go inside.

937
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:18,661
You still don't trust me?

938
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,331
I trust you wholeheartedly.

939
00:59:22,331 --> 00:59:26,321
Then do you want to watch a movie before you go?

940
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:28,241
You said let's do things in order.

941
00:59:28,241 --> 00:59:32,521
Since we held hands, we should watch a movie.

942
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:40,491
Then after we see a movie what are we going to do?

943
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:44,071
What do you think?

944
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:50,221
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

945
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:56,960
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

946
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:02,421
♫  When I think about you  ♫

947
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:08,751
♫  The spring that resembles you comes to my heart  ♫

948
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:11,581
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

949
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:14,731
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

950
01:00:14,731 --> 01:00:18,731
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

951
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:22,471
Do you want to take it off or should I take it off for you?

952
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:25,011
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

953
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:26,451
Whatever you prefer.

954
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:29,391
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

955
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:34,731
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

956
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:42,420
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

957
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:48,501
♫  Will you tell me you love me?  ♫

958
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:57,010


959
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:09,511
♫  I will kiss your lips with all my love for you  ♫

960
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:12,211
♫  Because it's my love for you  ♫

961
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:15,311
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

962
01:01:15,311 --> 01:01:17,971
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

963
01:01:17,971 --> 01:01:21,021
   

964
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:23,341
 Everyone who's here knows that there'll be blood. 

965
01:01:23,341 --> 01:01:26,521
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

966
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:30,681
 The legendary safe cracker who broke into the Blue House and even a Las Vegas casino. 

967
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:35,271
 If it's for you, Attorney, I'll open it. I'll open all of it. 

968
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:36,811
 Pretty girl. 

969
01:01:36,811 --> 01:01:39,161
 Why is he calling her a baby? Why does she like it? 

970
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:41,481
 The right order is for a person to go out and come back in. 

971
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:44,911
 As for the lovers' quarrel, just you two do it. Okay? 

972
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:46,801
 I know that you're not ready. 

973
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:52,140
 But even if I ask myself a hundred, a thousand times, my answer is still the same.
