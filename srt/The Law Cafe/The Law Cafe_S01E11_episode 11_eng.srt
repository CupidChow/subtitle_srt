1
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:32,189
   

2
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:37,349
I don't think someone like Lee Pyeon Woong should be the CEO

3
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:41,689
of the company, so people don't end up like my dad anymore.

4
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,033
Come here for a second.

5
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,850
   

6
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,709
What's all this?

7
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:24,189
They're Dohan Construction's case files I've been collecting.

8
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,149
Including your dad's case,

9
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:30,749
this construction company destroyed this many lives.

10
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,549
But now he's trying to take over the Dohan Group too.

11
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,399
Can we stop him?

12
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:41,979
I'm thinking of persuading Mother first.

13
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,149
Why don't you come inside, Mom?

14
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,109
I can see everything.

15
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:53,599
Don't be like that and come in.

16
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,399
I was... trying to let you know I was here since earlier...

17
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:05,329
There's something I'd like to tell both of you.

18
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,119
It's regarding the stock you received as an inheritance from Grandma.

19
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,329
   

20
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,389
Oh, yes.

21
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:23,909
Hello, Sir.

22
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,499
Hello.

23
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:33,830


24
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,569
My noble sister decided to participate in a worldly event like this.

25
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,649
The world has changed, I guess.

26
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:22,689
Yes.

27
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:26,799
The world has changed, but why are you the same?

28
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,909
Thank you!

29
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,709
I aged a lot, though.

30
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,299
But seriously, what are you doing here, Noonim?

31
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,109
I think you forgot.

32
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:41,119
When Grandma passed away, she left Mom a share of the company as an inheritance.

33
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:44,179
Aigoo, how much could that be?

34
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:46,959
That won't change anything.

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,419
Well, we'll see about that.

36
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,179
 Don't do it! 

37
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,129
 Daebak! 

38
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:01,932
 What's the lobster for all of a sudden? 

39
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,852
 - Have some. 
 - Yes, yes. 

40
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:04,992
 Wow. 

41
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,052
 You don't get to eat this so often in a lifetime. 

42
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:14,772
 Working for a company that destroys people's life whenever it builds something. 

43
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:16,942
 I wonder what that's like. 

44
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:21,402
 "Aigoo, is this what I studied the law for?" 

45
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:24,432
 Do you feel ashamed like that? 

46
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,002
 What's with you two? 

47
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,552
 What do you want from me? 

48
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,922
 How much longer will you be Lee Pyeon Woong's minion? 

49
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:31,802
 You must know because you're close to him. 

50
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:33,742
 What kind of person that bastard is. 

51
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,532
 We don't ask for a lot. 

52
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:40,342
 Think of our old friendship and give us a little hint for the shareholder's meeting. 

53
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:57,102
 Was this a poisoned lobster? 

54
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:04,902
 - Past... 
 - Past. 

55
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:06,512
 What do you think? Doesn't it sound full? 

56
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:09,592
 - Gabak... 
 - Gabak. 

57
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,532
 Gadong Pharmaceutical's CEO Kwak... 

58
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:13,102
 No, no, no! 

59
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:14,832
 That's all I can say. 

60
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:17,942
 Are you kidding? You're such a tease! 

61
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,572
 Not all allies are the same. 

62
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:29,152
 Gadong Pharmaceutical's CEO Kwak and Chairman Lee go way back 

63
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:32,852
 so he's very much torn about it. 

64
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:36,462
Dohan Construction, Dohan Bio, Dohan Cement, Alpha Airline and etc. 
    

65
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,732
If you combine all the shares that belong to the pro-Lee Pyeon Woong people,

66
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:40,633
it's about 38.5%.

67
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,305
On the other hand, Chairman Lee's supporters' shares,

68
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:44,105
National Pension, GL Chemical,

69
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:46,605
and the shares Mom and Aunt got as an inheritance.

70
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,125
- I persuaded my mom. 
 - With that...

71
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,845
even if we combine all the shares belonging to Lee's closest friends

72
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:56,145
and persuade all the shareholders, we're still 5.3% short.

73
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:59,215
But Gadong Pharmaceutical, who owns 2.93%,

74
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:02,145
ends up joining our side...

75
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:07,565
With a difference of 0.56%, we'll be able to win.

76
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:09,580
   

77
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,100
   

78
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:21,506
Wow, you have a great swing.

79
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,036
Who are you?

80
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,926
If you allow me, I'd like to step in...

81
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,356
Yes.

82
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,986
Everything was great, but you push your belly too much.

83
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,566
Belly push.

84
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:38,446
Try aiming your belt toward the target.

85
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:40,746
If you fix just that...

86
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:44,746
Wow, how cool!

87
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,126
Belly push.

88
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,496
Looks like you enjoy golfing.

89
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:50,546
Yes. I kind of do.

90
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:52,236
Is that why you made a bet with the head of the tax office

91
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,936
while you were undergoing a tax investigation?

92
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,306
Did you purposely lose and give him a lot of money?

93
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,376
Who are you people?

94
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,406
CEO Kwak Sang Han of Gadong Pharmaceutical.

95
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:06,886
You're under arrest for bribery and violating the anti-graft law.

96
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:07,966
What the hell...

97
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:10,816
All I did was play golf!

98
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:14,876
I'm saying you might end up with this if you hang out with Lee Pyeon Woong.

99
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,676
Lee Pyeon Woong introduced you to the head of the tax office, too, right?

100
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,706
Right?

101
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,866
You two. What are you supposed to be—

102
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:25,536
I'm Attorney Kim Jeong Ho.

103
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:26,886
I'm Kim Yoo Ri.

104
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:28,836
We're here because we need to have a serious discussion

105
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:32,126
regarding Dohan Group's shareholders' meeting.

106
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:34,516
Shareholders' meeting?

107
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:39,416
Right.

108
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:43,126
The extra 3.2% of the shares of Dohan Construction which were purchased recently.

109
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:47,456
You have a hard time exercising the voting right because of the court's decision, right?

110
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:53,806
The rest of the shareholders will have to behave as they promised.

111
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,426
Would that work out?

112
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:57,456
What's wrong with you?

113
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:01,356
Why are you doing this to me?

114
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,226
Just because.

115
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:06,656
You might be getting sloppy.

116
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,846
My target isn't Dohan Group.

117
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:12,446
It's you.

118
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,916
   

119
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,386
Therefore, the motion for the removal of Lee Byung Wook as chairman

120
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:27,476
of Dohan Construction has been rejected.

121
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,069
So are you trying to make a deal with me?

122
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,709
It's not really a deal.

123
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,939
We're trying to give you a chance.

124
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,549
If you don't plan to give everything you have to

125
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:06,399
Pyeon Woong, and spend your last days in prison, then do what we say.

126
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,189
First of all,

127
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:14,549
I'd like to thank you for being considerate enough for this old man

128
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,689
to not have a disgraceful ending.

129
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,559
But I, Lee Byung Wook,

130
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,169
will take responsibility for my failure in management,

131
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,809
implement an independent professional management system,

132
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,659
and step down from my position.

133
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:44,009
I'm also letting you know that Dohan Group will

134
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,969
no longer abide by family succession from now on.

135
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:23,989
- Wh-What are you doing? 
 - What's wrong, Yoo Ri?

136
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,319
Hey, hey! Kim Yoo Ri!

137
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,029
- Whoa, whoa! Hey! 
 - Oh, my!

138
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,449
Hey! What's that? Whoa!

139
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,869
What's that! What's wrong with you!

140
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,419
Oops! Sorry.

141
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,789
You looked so similar to the person who hit me with his car.

142
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,049
You crazy...

143
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,239
Good job!

144
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,569
Hey!

145
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,369
H-Hey! What should I do?

146
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,309
How do I get them back for this?

147
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,749
How should I repay them, so I feel better?

148
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:30,119
Think about it. Think about it!

149
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,589
Think! Think, you bastard! Don't you have any thoughts?

150
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:34,379
No thoughts?

151
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:39,039
Everyone, you all worked so hard.

152
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,639
You all did great.

153
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,619
This is on the house.

154
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,559
- Wow, thanks. 
 - Please, enjoy yourselves.

155
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,339
Today, you were so cool.

156
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,379
- Really? 
 - Yes.

157
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,859
After I gave birth to Jeong Ho, all I did was housekeeping.

158
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:58,849
So I've never really had the chance to stand in such a place.

159
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:02,739
It's been so long since I was called Lee Yeon Joo

160
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,699
instead of as someone's wife or mother.

161
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:08,629
Today, you were really... cool.

162
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,569
Using a popular catchphrase now, are you?

163
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,799
- All right, we'll head out first! 
 - Come on, Mom!

164
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,939
Why did you get so drunk so quickly?

165
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,429
It's because you kept saying cheers to her, Hyung!

166
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,319
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! Come here and sit down for a sec.

167
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,059
Why, why?

168
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,479
So you two...

169
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,199
What... What happened between you two?

170
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,379
What do you mean, what happened?

171
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,609
I'm asking if you and Kim Jeong Ho reconciled or not.

172
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:34,599
For now, you can think of it as a temporary ally relationship.

173
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,829
Allies, my foot!

174
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:38,129
If it is, it is. If it's not, it's not.

175
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,869
Yeah, don't make him wait too long if you have feelings for him.

176
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,109
He's waited a long time for this.

177
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,069
Where can you find someone like him? Liking you for more than 10 years—

178
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,779
Why?

179
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,829
For more than 10 years...

180
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,029
You've been friends for more than 10 years! What more time do you need?

181
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,699
- Yeah, right. 
 - You go for it if he's the one.

182
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:58,579
That's what I'm saying. Look at us.

183
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,219
While you guys were lost, we've created a tiny human being like this.

184
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:03,329
Yeah, Yoo Na. Pretty, right?

185
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:04,619
We made her.

186
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,219
It was pretty simple, actually...

187
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,329
 Yeah, don't make him wait too long if you have feelings for him. 

188
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,329
 He's waited a long time for this. 

189
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:31,359
So... when did you start liking me?

190
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:37,089
Wh-Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?

191
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,509
Answer me.

192
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,669
When was it for you?

193
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:49,539
Well, for me...

194
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,369
It was after you told me that you liked me.

195
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,129
Why?

196
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,279
No, I'm just asking.

197
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,469
Come in for a bit before you go.

198
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:20,279
I can go now since I saw you enter your place.

199
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,359
Thank you for today.

200
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:27,349
I know it wouldn't have been easy to do that to your family.

201
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,229
It's just the first step now.

202
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:57,989
- Do you want some tea? 
 - Yeah.

203
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,409
Are you okay with warm tea?

204
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:01,639
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

205
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:17,289
Oh, sorry.

206
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:20,899
You surprised me...

207
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,869
It's okay.

208
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:27,199
- I wasn't trying to push you away... 
 - It's okay, Yoo Ri.

209
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:32,679
I'm... okay with continuing to be like this with you.

210
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,159
I just want you... not to be hurt...

211
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:44,399
or in torment when you come to me later.

212
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,969
I'll wait for you, whether it be for one or two years

213
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:55,089
so take your time in coming when you can come.

214
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,349
You know that I'm impatient.

215
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,419
I'll go to you quickly.

216
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:13,799
   

217
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,669
   

218
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:20,239
Please don't get any scratches or damages.

219
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:23,169
Okay, okay! Move it!

220
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,889
Hey! That's ceramic, so... please be careful.

221
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:30,239
He makes a unique impression.

222
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,539
He's polite and greets people well.

223
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:35,439
Here.

224
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,809
Hello, Sir!

225
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,399
Are you moving in?

226
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,529
The vacancy on the second floor.

227
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,899
I decided to use that space from today on.

228
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,839
If there was a vacant space like this,

229
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,999
he should have brought me in quickly.

230
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,839
Don't you think so, Attorney Kim?

231
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,339
It's because he keeps asking to lower the monthly rent!

232
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,769
Geez, I really don't click with that guy.

233
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,389
Are you really going to go with me?

234
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,899
How many times are you going to make me repeat myself?

235
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,399
For the time being, go with me wherever you go.

236
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,389
After provoking Lee Pyeon Woong like that last time,

237
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:09,649
you should at least know you'll need to pay the price like this.

238
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,279
But this is...

239
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,409
Where in the world are you trying to go to?

240
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:15,779
If it's a private matter, I'll give you some space.

241
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,089
There's an unni that I decided to call Unni after we drank together.

242
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,729
Another unni again...

243
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:24,389
It's that person who came in about the inheritance issue last time, right?

244
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:26,059
- I told you to be mindful. 
 - What?

245
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,559
Did you decide to take on that case?

246
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,639
I told you inheritance issues can lead to knife attacks!

247
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,689
Hey, you b****. Were you the only one to take care of Father?

248
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,859
You've gone mad because of money, you b****!

249
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:48,949
Because of you...

250
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,609
Which room number did you say it was?

251
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,459
Room 15.

252
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:54,810
What's with her?

253
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,809
Unni!

254
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,859
She's making unnis in all sorts of places.

255
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,299
Are you okay, Unni?

256
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:15,129
It's exhausting.

257
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:18,479
Doing this as we're sending off Father for the last time,

258
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:21,089
it hurts me so much.

259
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:24,719
Although it's bitter to swallow,

260
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:28,669
Inheritance issues always tend to be like this.

261
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:34,329
But wow, there are a lot of flower wreaths here.

262
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:42,099
Honestly, I bought the wreathes that are

263
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:44,969
from here to over there.

264
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:47,939
   

265
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:53,149
My father used to buy me flowers on my birthdays.

266
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,809
When it was time to let my father pass,

267
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:03,099
I realized that I've never in my entire life bought flowers for my father.

268
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,729
So that's why...

269
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:19,879
What is this?

270
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:23,649
My father gave me this at the very end.

271
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:26,289
But I couldn't understand what it meant.

272
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,199
Do you have any inkling as to what it could be?

273
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,089
From what I've heard,

274
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:39,989
it turns out that a safe was found in my father's home.

275
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,979
But no one knows how to open it

276
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:45,839
and everyone seem to be at a loss as to what to do.

277
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,839
   

278
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:02,289
"Hui Yeon, everyone faces death."

279
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,299
"I shall await you at the place where the sum of all the ends points."

280
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,649
"Even if this turns out to be my last goodbye in this world,"

281
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,849
"there's a flower in the middle of the field."

282
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:17,159
"Burning with the passing time as if reaching the blue sky."

283
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,879
"In the field, the light from the shining golden sand."

284
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,279
"How shall I forget this place even in my dreams?"

285
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,379
"My heart aches."

286
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:28,869
This looks like a cipher text.

287
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,469
If we decipher it, you get the pass code to the safe,

288
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:34,629
and there's like 20 billion won in there?

289
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:38,509
But... "How shall I forget this place even in my dreams?"

290
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,619
Isn't this a quote from a poem by Poet Jeong Ji Yong?

291
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,769
Oh, you're right. I remember, Jeong Ji Yong.

292
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:47,849
As expected, Doctor, you're just...

293
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:48,979
Why are you amazed by that?

294
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,509
All these lines were in the school textbooks in the past.

295
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,659
Then, isn't this talking about his hometown?

296
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:56,329
Oh. I think you're right!

297
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,519
So I thought of his hometown as well and asked about it.

298
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,729
But they say there's no scenery like that.

299
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:04,859
It's abandoned land, so there's nothing.

300
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:11,019
"Flower," "School Tree," "Mom and Noona," "Perfume," "Surah"!

301
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,289
What are you saying all of a sudden?

302
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,779
All of these are titles of poems. And every line is a line from a poem.

303
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,359
So?

304
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:19,579
"Hui Yeon, everyone faces death."

305
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:23,019
"I shall await you at the place where the sum of all the ends point."

306
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,709
When it says the sum of all the ends...

307
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:28,739
What about we try adding all the years that these poets died?

308
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:35,279
The year of death for Poet Yi Sang, who wrote "Flower," was... 1937.

309
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,099
The poet, Yi Yuk Sa who wrote "School Tree," died in 1944.

310
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,099
For Kim So Wol, it was 1934.

311
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:44,009
Poet Jeong Ji Yong's year of death was 1950.

312
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,999
And for Poet Baek Suk, it was 1996!

313
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,939
- If we add all of this... 
 - 8,641.

314
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:52,249
That's incorrect! It's 9,761!

315
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:54,319
I was so close!

316
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:04,209
In any case, if you add the year of death for all of the poets,

317
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:06,129
you end up with a 4-digit number.

318
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,979
- Oh, really? 
 - Yes.

319
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:11,569
Although I don't know if it's directly related to the safe.

320
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,129
I would have to try it on the safe.

321
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:16,869
But I don't know if my oppas would just let me.

322
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,439
All your oppas are...

323
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,599
They're all right here!

324
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,577
Are we breaking into someone's house?

325
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:39,027
Technically, this wouldn't be breaking in.

326
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:41,927
Since the inheritance is shared property of the heirs for the time being,

327
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,417
it's not illegal since we were invited by Kang Hui Yeon.

328
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:47,107
But I don't think Hui Yeon's oppas would just stand by idly if they find out.

329
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:48,547
Today happens to be the day of burial,

330
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:51,037
so they won't be able to come here today.

331
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,497
- Let's go. 
 - Okay!

332
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,897
Wait a minute.

333
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:56,537
The two of us will stand here and keep watch.

334
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:58,017
Sounds good.

335
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:10,867
What are you doing?

336
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,887
Don't they dispatch the police if you don't turn the alarm off within 5 minutes?

337
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:15,447
- That's true. 
 - Where is the safe, again?

338
00:23:15,447 --> 00:23:17,337
In the second-floor study.

339
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:19,837
Let's go!

340
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,577
- Doctor! 
 - Hurry, go!

341
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:29,847
I heard you need to open some wall?

342
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,227
Wall?

343
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,407
It opened.

344
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,847
9761, 9761!

345
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,967
Why is that wrong?

346
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,157
What the heck?

347
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,437
Yeah, it's better if we don't go in like you said, Hyungnim.

348
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:17,387
Yeah, we'd suffer like crazy if we went in.

349
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:19,737
Hyungnim.

350
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,307
It's my dream to live in a house like this later.

351
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:25,627
- I wanted to own a building like Hyungnim Jeong Ho, but– 
 - Hey.

352
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:29,167
- There's a yard– 
 - I think we're in trouble.

353
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,577
Oh! My phone...

354
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:33,737
Where's my phone?

355
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:34,637
Hyung, where's my phone?

356
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:36,317
How would I know that? Hurry up and find it!

357
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,437
- I think someone took it! 
 - S***!

358
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,847
Maybe you pressed the wrong numbers?

359
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,497
No, I didn't.

360
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,847
Doesn't a safe usually get hard-locked if you input the pass code wrong too many times?

361
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:55,457
Oh, sorry.

362
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,597
What did I miss...

363
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:02,107
- Yeah, Joon? 
 - B-B-Boss, why don't you pick up the phone?

364
00:25:02,107 --> 00:25:04,927
- W-We're in big trouble! 
 - Wh-Why?

365
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:06,677
The security company car is coming this way.

366
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,907
 - What should we do?  
 - Already?

367
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,747
Wait.

368
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,437
Is this a five-digit code?

369
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:19,707
What?

370
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,677
Have we missed something?

371
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,157
"Hui Yeon, everyone faces death."

372
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:42,027
"I shall await you at the place where the sum of all the ends point."

373
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:44,227
"Even if this turns out to be my last goodbye in this world..."

374
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:45,937
Isn't this also a line from a poem?

375
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,797
Look it up.

376
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:54,487
Yes, it is a line from a poem!

377
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,017
Poet Yu Chi Hwan's "Happiness."

378
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:59,227
Poet Yu Chi Hwan passed away in 1967, so...

379
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,777
11,728!

380
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:03,017
It's five digits!

381
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:04,637
I'm going to press it!

382
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:11,997
It opened!

383
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,817
What is this?

384
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,257
Look more carefully! Is there anything more?

385
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:42,897
Hey, Joon. We opened it.

386
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:45,017
B-Boss! You need to come out now! Hurry!

387
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,647
The security company employees went in!

388
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,917
We need to leave immediately!

389
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:52,327
I told you, we're fine!

390
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:02,397
Hyung, you don't need to do that!

391
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:03,667
Why is he doing that?

392
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,847
The retreating route is already blocked off.

393
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:09,967
That's the only way to escape.

394
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,477
- I told you we're not in here illegally. 
 - Be quiet!

395
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,237
Let's go.

396
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:15,847
Why are you guys doing this?

397
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:17,607
Come on.

398
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:21,997
Are you guys crazy?

399
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,267
This is the second floor!

400
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,937
Hyung, stop treating this like a film noir!

401
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,917
But she told us we shouldn't get caught!

402
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,597
Geez, this is nuts.

403
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:31,697
Okay, jump off onto this, Hyungnim!

404
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,357
You think this is going to work?

405
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,817
- Forget it. Whatever. Hurry up! 
 - It's okay.

406
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:36,897
Just trust me!

407
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:40,567
What are they doing there now? Geez!

408
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,107
Why do I have to do this?

409
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:44,867
We could just tell them and leave.

410
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,697
Geez, we could just tell them and leave.

411
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:51,907
Why are we going to such an extent?

412
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:53,717
D*** it.

413
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:06,807
You... Honeybee!

414
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,727
I-I guess my hands were a bit sweaty...

415
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:10,967
Hey, hurry up and get off.

416
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,367
- Geez, seriously... 
 - It slipped.

417
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,647
- I need to hold on more tightly! 
 - Nice.

418
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,447
Dear God, please protect me.

419
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,277
Doctor, why are you doing this?

420
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:31,747
I'm trying to slow down my fall by using air resistance.

421
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:33,417
I see...

422
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,347
Hurry and get up!

423
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:44,577
Yoo Ri! Jump slowly and carefully, okay?

424
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:47,197
You could get hurt! So be careful!

425
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,877
Let's go!

426
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,287
"There's a grass flower scent coming off you that only I can recognize."

427
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:28,037
"Even though I, once small like a dandelion, grow like a dahlia,"

428
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:31,917
"and the red sunset spreads across the evening sky,"

429
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:37,087
"please do not be heartbroken or be too sad."

430
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,607
Another poem...

431
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:44,757
I thought there would at least be 20 billion won in here, but a poem–

432
00:29:44,757 --> 00:29:46,667
It's okay.

433
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,317
After sending off my father...

434
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:52,927
I wonder why I was being so spiteful.

435
00:29:52,927 --> 00:29:54,687
I guess...

436
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,807
I just wanted...

437
00:29:56,807 --> 00:30:00,677
confirmation that my father loved me

438
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:04,097
as much as he loved my brothers.

439
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:11,917
And that's why the fact that my father tried to leave me something

440
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,387
is enough for me.

441
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,897
Why?

442
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,477
- Geez. 
 - Why? What's up?

443
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:38,607
Just as you said, Prosecutor,

444
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:44,027
I called up every single junkyard company that handle and deliver unregistered vehicles.

445
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:47,577
By the time I arrived, it was already in this mess.

446
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:53,517
 Right after the driver did that to the attorney, he crushed the car. 

447
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,397
Where is this?

448
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:04,797
So as for that, I know it was a man.

449
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,737
But I don't remember much more than that.

450
00:31:06,737 --> 00:31:09,537
It was late at night, too.

451
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,767
Let's see the CCTV footage from that night.

452
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:15,147
Gosh, that's just an empty can.

453
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:18,927
I just picked up what I floated around here and they're just for looks.

454
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:23,897
You don't remember and CCTVs are empty, huh?

455
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:25,137
That's right.

456
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,157
But this man skips honorifics altogether, huh?

457
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,557
Yeah, isn't it quite charming?

458
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:32,047
He's American style.

459
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:33,227
Did you study overseas?

460
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,407
Then I'd understand.

461
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:39,457
I also was sleepless in Seattle, you know.

462
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:43,367
On my way, I noticed so many cars parked along the stream.

463
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,837
They all belong to the junkyard, right?

464
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,937
Right.

465
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:50,687
Right. With so many cars, it'd be tough to remember

466
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:54,517
what car came in last week or what the owner looked like.

467
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:56,377
Yeah, that's right.

468
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:58,787
How could I remember every single one of them?

469
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,587
But you know, there is no way that the

470
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:03,147
city has given permission for the stream area to be a junkyard.

471
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:05,017
- Have you ever heard of that? 
 - No, I haven't.

472
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:07,597
If I report this for violating Article 33

473
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:09,537
of the River Act, Collection of Permit Fees,

474
00:32:09,537 --> 00:32:11,527
you'll have to pay a generous amount of penalties.

475
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:12,547
How much was it?

476
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:14,047
Was it 30 million won per vehicle?

477
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:14,997
Thirty million won per vehicle...

478
00:32:14,997 --> 00:32:18,267
Whoa, that's quite a lot of money to pay.

479
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,907
Is that CCTV still empty?

480
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:26,937
The CCTV. I think it recorded what happened that night.

481
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:28,297
I thought it might've.

482
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,167
Bring it.

483
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:37,717
 He came in in the middle of the night and demanded that I crush the car right away. 

484
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:42,367
 And then I guess he got hot and took off his jacket. 

485
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:47,757
 He had tattoos all over his arm... 

486
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,637
 Gosh! 

487
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:56,137
With this many tattoos, I can find out with a little bit of legwork.

488
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:02,787
CEO.

489
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:04,567
CEO.

490
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:11,067
I think they've found the tail.

491
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,857
Hey!

492
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:22,687
By chance, is it Jeong Ho who has caught onto us?

493
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:25,217
My apologies.

494
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:27,997
Hey, then... then what do we need to do?

495
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:32,057
We should hurry up and do something about that bastard...

496
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:35,627
If he spills, it'll get back to me.

497
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:40,407
Hey, if Jeong Ho finds him first...

498
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:45,327
we'd have to do something about Jeong Ho, too...

499
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,817
You're all done.

500
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,857
- Thank you. 
 - Take care.

501
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:59,287
   

502
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,707
   

503
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:14,117
   

504
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:25,907
   

505
00:34:25,907 --> 00:34:27,877
   

506
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:29,287
A gift...

507
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:32,787
   

508
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:45,447
What's this?

509
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,637
I found it on the way.

510
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:53,237
Why be all speechless over just this?

511
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:55,737
I mean, you've never done this before. That's why.

512
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:57,147
I said I'd wait for you.

513
00:34:57,147 --> 00:34:59,397
I didn't say I wouldn't do anything.

514
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,177
I thought about it...

515
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:05,317
and realized I've never even bought you flowers that are so commonplace.

516
00:35:07,327 --> 00:35:08,987
Thanks.

517
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,397
It's pretty.

518
00:35:11,397 --> 00:35:13,367
♫  You make me smile  ♫

519
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:14,957
Get used to it.

520
00:35:14,957 --> 00:35:16,157
You need to get used to it.

521
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,747
This is going to happen a lot going forward.

522
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:21,687
♫  I wonder if you know that I feel this way  ♫

523
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,417
What were you reviewing so seriously?

524
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:30,317
I was so curious about what this memo was talking about.

525
00:35:30,317 --> 00:35:33,317
♫  I send my heart  ♫

526
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:38,637
Flower.

527
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,567
Flowerbed.

528
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:45,007
It's the flower, Jeong Ho! Flowers!

529
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:48,307
What do you mean, flowers?

530
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:52,787
A flowerbed! The gift!

531
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:03,187
I mean, why do we need to go right this minute?

532
00:36:03,187 --> 00:36:05,347
Because the season for flowers doesn't last long.

533
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:07,737
- What did you say? 
 - Just know there's something like it!

534
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:09,257
I could've gone alone.

535
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:10,947
I feel bad...

536
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:13,857
But that's an abandoned land.

537
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:15,967
There's really nothing to see there.

538
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:19,797
But I think there's something there.

539
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:21,137
There are lots of good foodie places, too.

540
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:21,947
That's right.

541
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,767
I heard potato ongshimi* soup is really good there. 
  (Kind of like gnocchi) 

542
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,217
I found a good place with great reviews!

543
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,597
4.9 stars.

544
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:30,357
- Okay! Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

545
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:35,237
Why am I missing the barista?

546
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:38,897
No consultations today.

547
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:42,627
I guess Attorney isn't in today.

548
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:44,817
Hello.

549
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:46,997
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

550
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:51,027
Attorney Kim told me that she has newly roasted coffee beans.

551
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:52,117
Yes, we have them.

552
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:54,697
We have coffee beans.

553
00:36:54,697 --> 00:36:58,087
Come in. I mean, have a seat.

554
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:13,547
I-I think that's enough.

555
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:16,587
Yes.

556
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:17,947
How much is it?

557
00:37:17,947 --> 00:37:20,027
You don't have to pay.

558
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:21,567
I can't do that.

559
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:23,587
If you don't treat me as a customer,

560
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:26,507
I'd feel bad and can't come back here.

561
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:28,867
Then 10,000 won?

562
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,067
Please take 20,000 won.

563
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,867
I can't take 20,000 won.

564
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:33,087
No, no...

565
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,977
Please take it.

566
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,907
I'll be back.

567
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:46,697
Be careful going home...

568
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:16,647
It's here.

569
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,537
"There's a grass flower scent coming off you that only I can recognize.

570
00:38:39,537 --> 00:38:43,307
Even though I, once small like a dandelion, grow like a dahlia,

571
00:38:43,307 --> 00:38:46,977
and the red sunset spreads across the evening sky,

572
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:51,857
please do not be heartbroken or be too sad."

573
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,507
My daughter...

574
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,187
The flowerbed.

575
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,947
My gift.

576
00:39:01,997 --> 00:39:05,027
They were all lines from poems.

577
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:11,637
I think your father really wanted to show this to you, Hui Yeon.

578
00:39:12,547 --> 00:39:14,527
It wasn't an abandoned land.

579
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:18,147
I guess he wanted to give you the land he cherished most.

580
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:33,037
♫  Gently putting my hand on your small hunched shoulders from behind you  ♫

581
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:40,617
♫  Yes, you endured and struggled through the day  ♫

582
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:46,697
♫  Will you let me in just a little bit into your heavy heart  ♫

583
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:53,340
♫  It's okay even if you look ruffled  ♫

584
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:58,427
♫  This too shall pass  ♫

585
00:39:58,427 --> 00:40:02,327
♫  Walk with me  ♫

586
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:09,600
♫  Let's breathe deeply and cry it out  ♫

587
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:16,637
♫  I will stay by your side now  ♫

588
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:20,947
♫  I will hold your hand  ♫

589
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:26,907
One, two, three. Take a picture of me.

590
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:30,327
♫  Once some time passes  ♫

591
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,467
Starting at some point,

592
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:37,077
whenever I see something like this, you'd be the first one to come to my mind.

593
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:40,187
Are you like that, too?

594
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:44,727
Gosh, stop confessing your feelings so suddenly.

595
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:49,307
I know that you like me, but something doesn't add up.

596
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:50,427
What?

597
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:52,847
No matter how much I think about it,

598
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:58,287
I just don't know when you started liking me.

599
00:41:01,397 --> 00:41:03,797
One, two, three!

600
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,517
Who's there?

601
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:17,727
You have to pay 1,000 won if you want to take pictures.

602
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,157
Ahjumma!

603
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:29,367
Where did I put this...

604
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,407
I tried to keep it safe...

605
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,677
Here it is. Aigoo...

606
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,707
Oh, Ahjumma used to...

607
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:41,667
live at our house and helped us out with our housework.

608
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:45,077
I had never imagined she'd be living here.

609
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:49,007
That looks very heavy.

610
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:55,877
Boss said...

611
00:41:55,877 --> 00:42:00,697
I should give it to you when you come or else he told me I could have it.

612
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:02,437
But you came just in time.

613
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,237
What is this?

614
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:05,617
I wouldn't know.

615
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:07,827
I don't even know the lock combo.

616
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:11,007
Here. Do what you need to do with it.

617
00:42:16,277 --> 00:42:19,817
Do you think 20 billion won is sitting in here for real?

618
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,807
Why is my heart racing, Hyung?

619
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:24,407
Hey! Who'd put 20 billion won in here?

620
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:26,627
You never know, though.

621
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:30,327
There's a secret combo here, too.

622
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:32,877
Then, could it be that same number?

623
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,057
Daebak!

624
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:36,147
Your father's real gift. Let's open—

625
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:37,527
Hey, hey.

626
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,377
We'll wait for you outside.

627
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:40,757
No.

628
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:43,377
You came all the way here with me.

629
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:45,707
- Let's look at it together. 
 - 9761!

630
00:42:45,707 --> 00:42:47,947
N-No... 11728.

631
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:49,897
011, 728.

632
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:53,267
011...

633
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,037
- 7... 
 - 728...

634
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,099
Oh, my God!

635
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:32,442
Look, Hyung!

636
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,802
There is someone who puts 20 billion won in a briefcase!

637
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,899
That briefcase earlier...

638
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:57,499
Suppose it's 35cm horizontal, 20cm vertical, and 10cm height in dimension.

639
00:43:57,499 --> 00:43:59,199
The volume it holds is 7 liters.

640
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,159
The volume of one kilogram of the gold bar is 0.05 liter.

641
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:06,289
Then the current value is 75 million won per kilogram.

642
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:10,499
It's approximately... 10.5 billion won.

643
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:15,609
So when you consider the inheritance tax, even if you deduct this and that,

644
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:19,069
you have to pay approximately 4.4 billion won in taxes.

645
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:24,289
But that kind of money is usually...

646
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:27,409
likely to be an unreported asset.

647
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:31,869
If so, you'll owe money for delinquent tax or unreported profit.

648
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,369
So usually, people don't report it.

649
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:42,939
So we might be at a crime scene right now, not a heartwarming scene!

650
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:45,279
We should decide what to do now then.

651
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:46,909
We should either take a gold bar and keep quiet,

652
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:51,579
or maintain our status as model citizens.

653
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:54,089
If so, I'll definitely—

654
00:44:57,699 --> 00:45:00,679
It'd be a shame to give up my conscience for 70 million won, right?

655
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,879
Should we settle for two gold bars, then...

656
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:04,659
No, that's not it, either.

657
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:07,179
I didn't expect to have this kind of talk in the flower field.

658
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:09,249
Sorry for being so secular in a flower field.

659
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,779
Why are you getting upset?

660
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:13,449
You might not get persuaded by 10 billion won because you guys are rich,

661
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,339
- but we aren't. 
 - That's right.

662
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:19,029
I keep picturing a different life!

663
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:22,279
Attorney.

664
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:35,259
 Born in 1949, on November 9th in the lunar year. 

665
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:39,619
 I, Kang Gye Young, am recording my will. 

666
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:45,829
 First of all, the will I wrote with my sons earlier was coerced. 

667
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:51,409
 I'd like to express that this recording reflects how I really feel. 

668
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:53,729
 Hui Yeon. 

669
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:59,799
 As my death approaches, there's only one thing I regret. 

670
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:04,479
 I've always thought you were as delicate as a flower. 

671
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:09,759
 So rather than encouraging you, I've always told you not to do anything. 

672
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:13,829
 But seeing you staying by my side until the end 

673
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,089
 makes me realize you're stronger and more courageous than anyone. 

674
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:19,099
 My daughter, Hui Yeon. 

675
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:24,499
 I realize that you're not a flower but fertile and solid soil. 

676
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:29,439
 If you let the roots grow slowly, you can grow any flowers. 

677
00:46:29,439 --> 00:46:32,699
 So don't ever be hasty. 

678
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:56,369
 First of all, the will I wrote with my sons earlier was coerced. 

679
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:01,259
 I'd like to express that this recording reflects how I really feel... 

680
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:06,509
The ones who forced a will out of a testator like this are ineligible for an inheritance.

681
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:08,749
Therefore they don't get a single penny.

682
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:12,289
But since your sister is such a nice person,

683
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:15,549
she suggested splitting the inheritance equally.

684
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:18,339
H-How is this equal?

685
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:19,779
She doesn't even have kids!

686
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:21,369
That's my point!

687
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:24,989
You have children. Do you have to behave this way?

688
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:30,529
What if they learn from you and fight each other to death after you pass away?

689
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:37,039
Debts and assets aren't the only things that are left when you die.

690
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,299
The image of you behaving like this last too.

691
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,669
Thank you.

692
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,129
Thank you so much.

693
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:57,049
- I really appreciate it. 
 - Not at all.

694
00:47:57,049 --> 00:48:01,599
Well, what will you do with the gold...

695
00:48:03,669 --> 00:48:08,499
I'll report it according to the law and pay tax for it.

696
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:12,419
I can't burden you all for helping me.

697
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:18,909
It'd be 4.4 billion won.

698
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:21,499
Will you be okay?

699
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:25,689
Well...

700
00:48:27,629 --> 00:48:30,389
Yes, Attorney.

701
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:35,369
My father left it for me behind my brothers' backs because he cared for me.

702
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:38,149
I'll make sure it's used for good.

703
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:41,389
Since we're on the topic...

704
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:47,219
could I pay you with this for the fee?

705
00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:00,029
Look at that gold toad.

706
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:03,349
You know you have to pay tax for it, right?

707
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:19,439
A poetry book.

708
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:20,859
Boss.

709
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:23,129
Aren't you going home?

710
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:25,389
Whose book is this?

711
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:27,279
- Is it Dr. Woo Jin's? 
 - Right.

712
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:30,589
Jeong Ho hyung was reading it earlier.

713
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:33,279
He's reading poems now?

714
00:49:33,279 --> 00:49:35,219
I'll go home now, then!

715
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:38,709
- Goodnight, Boss! 
 - See you!

716
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:48,019
   

717
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:51,910
   

718
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,439
   
 Ta-da! 

719
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:04,999
 This year's cherry blossom. 

720
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:07,869
 I made a wish and immortalized it here. 

721
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:10,549
 It's supposed to blossom and die. Why trap it in there? 

722
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,039
 Because it's pretty! 

723
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:14,379
 I wanted to keep it. 

724
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:17,759
 You probably won't understand sentiments like this. 

725
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:20,549
 Give it to me. 

726
00:50:40,669 --> 00:50:42,309
 What? 

727
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:48,839
 It's my dream to open a shop like this someday. 

728
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:52,199
 You're studying for the bar exam. What's the shop for anyway? 

729
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:53,869
 When I become a lawyer, 

730
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:58,329
 I'll open a warm and cozy office like this in the neighborhood. 

731
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:03,389
 A kind of place where you can stop by and ask a question on the way from the store. 

732
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:05,289
 You're planning to make money, right? 

733
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:08,239
 I'll make money first and do it. 

734
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,319
 So you'll spend all the money you made? 

735
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:13,789
 I planned it all out. 

736
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:14,729
 What plan? 

737
00:51:14,729 --> 00:51:16,799
 I'll do it with you. 

738
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:19,849
 You'll figure out how to make money then, right? 

739
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:35,989
 As you wish. 

740
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:38,099
 Did you agree to do it? 

741
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,449
 It depends on how you behave. 

742
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:41,489
 You agreed, okay? 

743
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:09,980
♫  After the long rain passed...  ♫

744
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,369
This was the place.

745
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:14,479
 Don't let him wait any longer if you have feelings for him. 

746
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:15,739
 He waited a long time. 

747
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:19,279
 So please don't leave me. 

748
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:25,369
♫  Your face you could not hide  ♫

749
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:27,469
♫  I fall deep in...  ♫

750
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:29,699
 Can I hold you? 

751
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:34,949
 Can I hold you just for a while? 

752
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:43,610
 What will I do if I miss you? 

753
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,029
 - You're not saying that we should date? We should date. 

754
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:51,049
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

755
00:52:51,049 --> 00:52:57,589
♫  Like the snowfall from early dawn  ♫

756
00:52:57,589 --> 00:53:00,839
♫  I wish I could look inside your heart  ♫

757
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:02,839
Kim Jeong Ho!

758
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:05,150
Kim Jeong Ho!

759
00:53:07,499 --> 00:53:11,179
 He said he was dropping Aunt home earlier. 

760
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:16,830
Taxi! Taxi.

761
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:24,549
Will you really be okay?

762
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:26,499
I had enough fun.

763
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:29,109
I can't just keep avoiding it.

764
00:53:31,189 --> 00:53:32,949
Hold on.

765
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:35,339
   

766
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:37,619
Yoo Ri is a fun person.

767
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:42,039
I couldn't express my affection because of the wrongs I've done, but she's so cute.

768
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:46,189
She reminded me of my old self.

769
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:50,549
Are you complimenting Yoo Ri or bragging right now?

770
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:52,409
Both.

771
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:53,789
   

772
00:53:53,789 --> 00:53:55,519
So hurry up and get going.

773
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:58,199
Don't let her wait any longer.

774
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:02,589
Go inside, then.

775
00:54:10,649 --> 00:54:14,179
   

776
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:15,599
Yes, did you find him?

777
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,529
I did find him, but this bastard is a convicted killer.

778
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:22,629
What?

779
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:26,439
There's something that kind of bothers me.

780
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:29,149
The victim happens to be

781
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:33,899
someone who used to work in the accounting department of Dohan Construction.

782
00:54:33,899 --> 00:54:35,499
 It's so shady. 

783
00:54:35,499 --> 00:54:37,989
Doesn't it complete the picture?

784
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:40,469
 Anyway, as long as we catch this bastard, 

785
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:44,499
 we can convict Lee Pyeon Woong for conspiracy to commit murder. 

786
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:47,209
But I can't find him.

787
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:50,139
He's really hiding somewhere tightly.

788
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:53,199
 Prosecutor, are you listening? 

789
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:55,379
 Prosecutor? 

790
00:54:57,859 --> 00:55:01,599
 The line is currently busy. 

791
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:42,929
I-I-I told you not to get caught, didn't I?

792
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:45,539
I said you'll be responsible if you get caught!

793
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:46,939
CEO...

794
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:49,399
Sir, we will...

795
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:56,489
You know, when someone else does it,

796
00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:00,689
you have to hide stuff and kill again.

797
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:03,239
What's this? Geez...

798
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,799
This time around... s***...

799
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,849
Do it right...

800
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:08,329
Yes, sir.

801
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:10,359
I'm sorry.

802
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:20,619
It wasn't that big of a deal.

803
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:31,549
Will Jeong Ho like the gift I'm sending him?

804
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:46,089
   

805
00:56:57,639 --> 00:56:59,419
Kim Jeong Ho, where are you?

806
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:00,789
 Where are you? 

807
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,589
I'm near your parents' house.

808
00:57:17,009 --> 00:57:18,529
What are you doing here?

809
00:57:18,529 --> 00:57:19,959
I was looking for you.

810
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:23,099
I told you not to be alone for a while!

811
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:29,009
I'm sorry.

812
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:31,409
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell—

813
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:34,679
It's not true, is it?

814
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:38,069
You said you came to like me since I liked you.

815
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:40,339
It was a lie, wasn't it?

816
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:45,659
- Why are you suddenly— 
 - It's like you're a fool.

817
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:49,059
How could you like someone for so long?

818
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:57,523
I don't know who told you what,

819
00:58:00,703 --> 00:58:02,942
but don't feel pressured.

820
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:06,592
It's just like a crush that everyone has at that age—

821
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:08,192
You're lying again!

822
00:58:08,192 --> 00:58:11,312
Stop lying to me, Kim Jeong Ho.

823
00:58:18,732 --> 00:58:21,032
What should I do then?

824
00:58:21,652 --> 00:58:24,982
Should I burden you by saying I'm dying to hold you right now?

825
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:27,622
Should I say that I can't wait for the Lee Pyeon Woong issue or whatever,

826
00:58:27,622 --> 00:58:30,902
so we should kiss and spend the night?

827
00:58:30,902 --> 00:58:35,302
If that's how you feel, you should say that.

828
00:58:43,842 --> 00:58:45,702
I like you.

829
00:58:47,772 --> 00:58:54,372
It's always been you and you were the only one.

830
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:58,942
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

831
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:05,710
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

832
00:59:07,772 --> 00:59:11,062
♫  When I think about you  ♫

833
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:17,392
♫  The spring that resembles you comes to my heart  ♫

834
00:59:17,392 --> 00:59:20,202
♫  Even if it's in the middle of winter  ♫

835
00:59:20,202 --> 00:59:23,322
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

836
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:26,202
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

837
00:59:26,202 --> 00:59:30,000
♫  It's always you for me  ♫

838
00:59:31,232 --> 00:59:37,992
♫  Holding you tightly tonight with stars sparkling  ♫

839
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:43,280
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

840
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,950
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

841
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:57,570
♫  Will you tell me you love me?  ♫

842
01:00:08,462 --> 01:00:10,232
Will you really be okay?

843
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,452
Yeah.

844
01:00:11,452 --> 01:00:13,772
Everything is settled now.

845
01:00:13,772 --> 01:00:14,662
I'll stay the night here.

846
01:00:14,662 --> 01:00:19,912
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

847
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:27,430
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

848
01:00:28,812 --> 01:00:31,912
♫  Will you tell me you love me?  ♫

849
01:00:31,912 --> 01:00:38,832
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

850
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:44,110
♫  I'll be by your side forever  ♫

851
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:51,870
♫  Holding you tightly tonight as you sparkle  ♫

852
01:00:53,112 --> 01:00:58,170
♫  I will tell you I love you  ♫

853
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:17,940


854
01:01:19,832 --> 01:01:30,442
♫  I must like you, more than anyone else  ♫

855
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:34,132
♫  I guess I've come to like you  ♫

856
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:45,932
♫  Maybe I love you, more today than yesterday  ♫

857
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:48,932
   

858
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:52,472
 Let's keep our relationship a secret for a while. 

859
01:01:52,472 --> 01:01:55,882
 I've never seen anyone who's so obviously in a secret relationship. 

860
01:01:55,882 --> 01:01:57,552
 - I'll— 
 - No! You can't, you can't! 

861
01:01:57,552 --> 01:01:59,792
 You think someone broke in? 

862
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:02,222
 Because I did something wrong, because of me... 

863
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:06,662
 If I had the power, I won't let you go anywhere or do anything. 

864
01:02:06,662 --> 01:02:09,422
 I want to be your girlfriend. 

865
01:02:09,422 --> 01:02:11,482
 I don't want you to be my guardian. 

866
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:13,432
 Who's meeting with who? 

867
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:17,372
 If you leave me alone, I'll leave you guys alone too. 

868
01:02:17,372 --> 01:02:20,150
 Where is she? Where is she? 

869
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,570
♫  More than anyone else  ♫

870
01:02:21,602 --> 01:02:24,300
♫  I must like you  ♫
