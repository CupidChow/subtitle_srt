1
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:33,050
   

2
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,407
♫  A cold breeze brushes past my shoulders  ♫

3
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,227
Kim Jeong Ho.

4
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:46,557
I'm feeling weird.

5
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:51,157
M-My heart is... beating quickly.

6
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:54,927
♫  And you held my hand  ♫

7
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:56,367
Are you...

8
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:59,780
♫  The tears are finally flowing  ♫

9
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,677
It's okay. That can happen.

10
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:07,350
It's because you're frightened.

11
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,957
Are you able to breathe okay?

12
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:10,937
Yeah.

13
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:15,667
♫  Can you see with kindly eyes?  ♫

14
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:23,797
♫  It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long  ♫

15
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:27,477
♫  Just lean on me  ♫

16
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:32,797
♫  Embrace me just like this  ♫

17
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:43,040


18
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:50,177
Attorney! I...

19
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,787
I'll try talking to him first.

20
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:57,097
Hey, Jeong Ho, I'm entrusting you with this.

21
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,217
Are you okay?

22
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:43,547
As you had said, I guess I'm hopeless.

23
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:46,527
I just say things as they come up in my head,

24
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:50,207
without even understanding what they might mean to others...

25
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:54,977
Just getting involved in other people's business, acting as if I care about them.

26
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,487
Kim Yoo Ri.

27
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,657
Trying to look at yourself objectively is good, but let's assess the situation correctly.

28
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:03,617
I did assess the situation correctly. I'm trash.

29
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,467
Because of what I said today, that man...

30
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:10,857
Hey...

31
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,727
A person stood on the ledge of a building to throw away their life,

32
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,567
but do you think that happened solely because of something you said?

33
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:24,017
Technically speaking, when you told him that nobody lived above him,

34
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:27,097
you didn't anticipate the shock that he'd go through.

35
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:29,977
It is true that you were wrong about that.

36
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,027
But thinking that he stood there because of you...

37
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:35,157
That's absolutely not it.

38
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,107
For him to have stood up there, there must have been many other

39
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:41,507
words, reasons, and emotions involved.

40
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:50,107
But come on! How old are you that you're still crying like this?

41
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:53,497
What does age have to do with how I cry?

42
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,467
Kim Jeong Ho!

43
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,107
What?

44
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,387
I'm hungry.

45
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,337
In the midst of all this?

46
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:11,417
Y-You're hungry?

47
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,757
H-How can you be hungry?

48
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:32,717
Man, what a mess...

49
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:48,227
I guess it wasn't that I was hungry...

50
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:51,097
but rather that my stomach was hurting.

51
00:04:56,957 --> 00:05:00,567
But do you have to live with your place looking like this?

52
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,097
The fact that your mother didn't do anything seeing this...

53
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,627
Is this your first time coming here?

54
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:09,167
My mom doesn't come here anymore.

55
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:13,047
Every time she comes, she feels like she's going to develop anger issues.

56
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,967
I thought you said your stomach hurt.

57
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,227
I went to the bathroom earlier.

58
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:30,197
Thank you for today.

59
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,477
If it weren't for you earlier, I don't even want to think...

60
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,407
about what would have happened.

61
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,907
Even if I wasn't there, nothing would have happened.

62
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:49,937
Even if Mr. Jo tried to jump off,

63
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:57,977
how could he when he thinks about this face?

64
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,217
What's wrong? Is it doing it again?

65
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:18,137
This...

66
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:20,377
It's like I have a hard time breathing,

67
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,547
and my heart...

68
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,607
It's like it throbs all the way up to my neck.

69
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,347
It's doing it again even though you were sitting still?

70
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,217
The panic attacks you used to have...

71
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:31,427
Are you sure they haven't come back?

72
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:33,337
I don't think it's anything like that.

73
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:36,137
All right, that's it. You should meet Woo Jin Hyung first thing tomorrow.

74
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,667
I'll tell him to drop by the cafe in the morning.

75
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:41,117
- No, no need for that. 
 - No. Meet him for sure.

76
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,417
I don't need to...

77
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:53,437
After my father passed away from an accident,

78
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:55,967
I had my first episode in high school.

79
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:59,537
I was sitting still, but my heart just started beating like crazy,

80
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:02,837
and I felt like I was going to die.

81
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,757
 - Hey. Hey! 
 - Yoo Ri! 

82
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,167
 - Hey! 
 - Hey! Are you okay, Yoo Ri? 

83
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,837
 What's wrong? What's wrong? 

84
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:10,417
 Kim Yoo Ri! What's the matter? 

85
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,707
 Breathe! Breathe! 

86
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,757
 - Hey, Yoo Ri! 
 - Are you okay? 

87
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:16,037
 Are you okay? Breathe! 

88
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:20,217
 - Hey! 
 - Since that day, it has happened once every month or two. 

89
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:24,337
 At first, we didn't know what it was so Jeong Ho ran with me on his back every time. 

90
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,297
 Teacher! She's not able to breathe properly! 

91
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:27,807
 - Come this way! 
 - Okay! 

92
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,117
 Her blood type is Type O positive. 

93
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:32,177
 Supplements she takes are Vitamin D, Omega-3, liver health pills, and lutein... 

94
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:34,377
 You'll be fine. This is the hospital. 

95
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,207
 They'll treat you. 

96
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,737
 Just breathe slowly, okay? 

97
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:46,117
 But whenever we got to the nurse's office or the emergency room... 

98
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,927
 I'd be perfectly fine. 

99
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,490
 Are you okay? 

100
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,150
 Yeah. 

101
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,577
 Sorry. 

102
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:55,537
 Going through this several times, we learned what it was. 

103
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,167
 It's okay. 

104
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,347
 That it was psychological. 

105
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:07,837
   

106
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:13,427
Here you go, Attorney.

107
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,507
It's green tea.

108
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:19,797
Goodness, Kim Jeong Ho shouldn't have said anything.

109
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:23,197
I mean, I did go through some difficult times in the past.

110
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:28,207
But I didn't have any symptoms after I started working.

111
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,187
Even if the symptoms seem to have disappeared,

112
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,387
there are cases when they do return.

113
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,087
I'm a doctor, but for the past several years,

114
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:38,207
I've also been taking pills to treat anxiety and depression.

115
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:43,947
But what I experienced yesterday was different from my symptoms during a panic attack.

116
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:46,257
How were they different?

117
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:49,487
Well, the fact that I had a hard time breathing

118
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,437
and that my heart was beating really quickly were similar.

119
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:53,377
Okay.

120
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:56,967
But it didn't feel like I was going to die...

121
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:01,547
But really, Doctor. It's not to the point where you need to worry.

122
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,637
I know I'm nothing compared to you, but

123
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:07,367
I am still somewhat of an expert in this field.

124
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,287
 Well, okay. 

125
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:14,837
 I'll leave it up to your discretion for now, Attorney. 

126
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:35,197
Who are they?

127
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:37,007
They're TWICE!

128
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:42,057
I was watching a variety show a couple of days ago, and I got into a fan-cident.

129
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:44,477
What's a fan-cident?

130
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,727
Oh. Let's see...

131
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:51,397
It means that you become a fan of someone as suddenly and intensely

132
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:54,617
as you would encounter a car accident.

133
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,557
I see...

134
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:59,887
There are all sorts of accidents nowadays, huh?

135
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:02,797
Yes, but it's not that type of accident...

136
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:19,547
 Oh, and if those symptoms reoccur... 

137
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,597
 don't focus on the symptoms 

138
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:25,187
 but focus on the three things you see. 

139
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:27,417
 Kim Jeong Ho? 

140
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,147
 Wet hair. 

141
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:34,737
 And his tracksuit. 

142
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,737
 And after that... 

143
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:40,627
 Breathe deeply and focus on the three things you hear. 

144
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,997
 The sound of coffee. 

145
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:47,687
 The sound of Kim Jeong Ho's footsteps! 

146
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:50,877
- What are you doing? 
 -  The sound of Kim Jeong Ho's voice! 

147
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:55,567
- What's wrong with her? 
 - I don't know. She's acting weird.

148
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:17,647
   

149
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:22,167
   

150
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:25,987
Wh-Wh-Why are you coming in and out of here all the time?

151
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:29,737
You wrote it into the contract that we shouldn't run into each other often.

152
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:33,417
According to the contract, there's no problem with me dropping by here.

153
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:34,637
But still!

154
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:36,377
The landlord dropping by daily

155
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:39,397
while the tenant is conducting business is a nuisance.

156
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,017
Hey, get me a coffee.

157
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:45,167
- Which one? Americano, Cappuccino, vanilla latte— 
 - Just get me anything!

158
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,837
Anything coming right up!

159
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:50,437
So, did everything go well when you went to see Woo Jin hyung?

160
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:52,307
Yeah! Everything went well.

161
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:53,657
Why? What did Hyung say?

162
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:56,707
Wh-What do you mean? Obviously, he said I'm fine.

163
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,887
Eun Kang, the coffee I asked for earlier.

164
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,267
What is it today?

165
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,887
From Kona beans we roasted in-house.

166
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,067
Okay!

167
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,507
Where are you going?

168
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,397
To meet Mr. Jo Seok Joon from yesterday.

169
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,667
I heard he's in a hospital with a doctor I know.

170
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,087
Gosh, I'm running late.

171
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:18,227
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

172
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,367
When are you coming back?

173
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,407
What's wrong with her?

174
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,097
I don't know.

175
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:28,007
Geez...

176
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,367
What about my coffee?

177
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,207
   

178
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,447
Here's some coffee.

179
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,757
How's the hospital?

180
00:12:50,557 --> 00:12:53,457
I have it good, thanks to the doctor.

181
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:56,357
I'm more at ease than at home.

182
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:58,717
I...

183
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:02,977
always had... sensitive ears.

184
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:04,757
I used to do music.

185
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,367
Oh, really?

186
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:09,627
- By music, which— 
 - I played guitar.

187
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:13,267
I used to travel around as a session instrumentalist

188
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,627
and have people buy me drinks.

189
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:18,977
But because of alcohol, my wife and I got divorced

190
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:21,137
and ended up moving to this apartment.

191
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:23,767
But because I tried to quit drinking,

192
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:27,997
my already sensitive ears became even more sensitive.

193
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:31,507
I wanted to give up on everything, but...

194
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:35,127
Dr. Park held onto me...

195
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,877
and I ended up meeting you, Attorney.

196
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:42,967
Up until now,

197
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:46,427
I thought I met the wrong neighbors,

198
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:50,597
but it turned out that I was wrong.

199
00:13:55,087 --> 00:14:00,157
I am indebted to both of you.

200
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:04,680
I feel bad that I am only doing things that put me in your debt, but...

201
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,500
the litigation you mentioned last time, Attorney.

202
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,747
- I want to pursue it. 
 - Really?

203
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:18,337
But before that, I feel I should apologize first.

204
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,657
Even if he apologizes,

205
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,147
I don't know if I want to accept his apology.

206
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:28,817
Of course, you would feel that way.

207
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,337
I'm sure a lot of frustrations piled up over all that time.

208
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,827
I kept telling him that it wasn't our home, but he wouldn't believe us.

209
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:39,517
Every day, he kept smashing the walls with a hammer.

210
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:43,967
My Yi Seul... had nightmares every night.

211
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:49,117
I understand that it must've been a living hell for him below us,

212
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:53,357
but it was hell for us, too.

213
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,367
Mom!

214
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,897
I worked hard to prepare it.

215
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,857
   

216
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:21,687
I thought it'd be good to gather interested residents

217
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,617
and have a briefing session first.

218
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:25,267
What do you think?

219
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:29,377
So you're actually going to file litigation against Dohan Construction?

220
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:31,227
What did you say when you came in here?

221
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:33,457
Didn't you tell me that you were not going to stir up any trouble

222
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:35,627
and only provide legal consultations quietly or not?

223
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:39,817
I tried to quietly provide my services without causing you any trouble, but

224
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:42,737
I changed my mind completely after hearing what you told me yesterday.

225
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:44,137
What are you talking about?

226
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:46,857
"So, let's fight together."

227
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,397
"Not by yourself!"

228
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,637
"Get compensated for the pain you went through all this time and"

229
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,767
"we'll make sure those a**holes will never build another apartment like this again!"

230
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,447
Hey, I only said that just because of the situation last night.

231
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:56,507
"Just because"?

232
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,097
How do you say something so cool like that just because?

233
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:00,177
You might make hearts flutter.

234
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,987
What do you mean, make hearts flutter?

235
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:09,067
Someone says they'll fight with you. Of course, hearts would flutter.

236
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:16,067
Do you think it's easy to prove that it was the construction company's fault?

237
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,997
It's difficult, but it's not impossible.

238
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:20,417
If we look at related precedents in other countries, we can find a way.

239
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,977
Even if there is a way, this apartment is 16 years old.

240
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:29,077
- You'll lose 100 percent! 
 - And that's why... we should set a precedent for this together.

241
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:34,077
We should set a what together?

242
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,327
Let's go all the way to the Supreme Court together.

243
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,907
Please?

244
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:45,587
Unnis! I'm begging you.

245
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:48,767
I like the intent, but...

246
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:52,637
I don't know if people will be persuaded.

247
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,847
And that's why we need to help!

248
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,347
Hyungnim's charisma wins over the crowds.

249
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:02,410
I suppose it is overwhelming.

250
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:07,877
As you said, CEO,

251
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:10,467
we looked at the cases where the male protagonist goes around

252
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:13,177
destroying different corporations in the novel.

253
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,967
It's clear that it's impossible to write a story like this containing details about

254
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,417
Dohan Construction's bidding and licensing corruption

255
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:22,737
for the contract for Dohan New City without looking at the court records.

256
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:23,977
So what is this?

257
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:28,197
Are you telling me that the novelist is an insider from Dohan Construction?

258
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:30,917
S***. What did the publishing company say?

259
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,887
The publishing company also said that they don't know anything

260
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:36,437
about the author, aside from his pen name.

261
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:39,667
What crazy bastard is responsible for this...

262
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:45,527
First, pressure the publishing company to suspend releasing the series.

263
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:51,417
They kept pressuring me to tell them who it was.

264
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:53,977
Prosecutor, I mean, Novelist...

265
00:17:53,977 --> 00:17:56,977
You know that I'm not that strong mentally.

266
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,857
I had such a hard time pretending I didn't know anything.

267
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:06,497
So... why don't you forget about controversial content like this that criticizes our society

268
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:08,967
and write stories that are more light-hearted like last time?

269
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,227
 Enough of that! 

270
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:12,927
If Hwang and Goo comes by again, start recording the conversation first.

271
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,657
If they're going to threaten you like that,

272
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:16,247
tell them you will take legal action!

273
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:17,297
 Come on! 

274
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,037
How can I take legal action

275
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,917
 against the top law firm in South Korea? 

276
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,947
 - You think you're still a prosecutor—  
 - Forget it. Hang up!

277
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:26,147
   

278
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:30,887
Man...

279
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:33,797
   

280
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:50,437
So loud!

281
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:04,757
All right, look here.

282
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:05,967
"Article 112, Clause 2."

283
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:10,197
"If the tenant hosts an event exceeding 30 people that is contrary to the purpose of running a cafe,"

284
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:12,567
"they must first get the landlord's approval."

285
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,777
I put it in there, just in case.

286
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:17,257
But I didn't think she would break this one too!

287
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,417
What, one week?

288
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,397
Has it been even one week since she opened the cafe?

289
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:24,287
Wow, what's this?

290
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,237
All this resulted from here?

291
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,757
Oh, my. It's amazing.

292
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:30,617
Wow, that's not pretty.

293
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:33,497
- Oh, my! 
 - It's good because it's light and can hold a lot.

294
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:35,807
I see!

295
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,777
Hyung! This is so good! What coffee is this?

296
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,487
It's this.

297
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:42,357
Move.

298
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,387
What are you doing here?

299
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,917
I just felt like coming by.

300
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:53,497
Through a private company's assessment of Apartment 1012, the average noise level from floor impact 
    

301
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:56,047
was about 68 decibels.

302
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:59,127
 Based on the minimum performance standard set in 2003, 

303
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:02,237
 it far exceeds the minimum of 50 decibels for medium-weight floors 

304
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:03,927
 and 58 decibels for lightweight floors. 

305
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:08,107
Even when we look at precedents, this level of noise is beyond the level of toleration.

306
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,767
So what she's saying is the fact that you feel like

307
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:14,177
you're going crazy at home... is not just because of your moodiness.

308
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,677
Yeah! That's right.

309
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:18,467
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

310
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,887
If the problem is that the building was built improperly,

311
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,687
should we be fighting with our neighbors living above or next to us?

312
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,827
- She's right! 
 - I'm so sick and tired of it.

313
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,027
- Don't nod your head! 
 - Since the inter-floor noise problem

314
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:34,537
lies with the problematic construction of the apartment, sue the business responsible.

315
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:38,967
That is... the way to solve this issue is by suing the construction company.

316
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:40,087
Yeah, this can't continue.

317
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:43,007
So even though there are all these regulations,

318
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:45,487
why is it so noisy?

319
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,297
Starting in the year 2004,

320
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,187
they implemented the Pre-Certification System. 
    

321
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:50,617
This was the problem.

322
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:54,037
As long as a company can create a good test sample and get the certification,

323
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:57,157
it could get away with using whatever material during the actual construction.

324
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,937
So it means this rotten company knew this...

325
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:02,407
so they did quality checks before construction,

326
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,887
but turn a blind eye to what happens after construction.

327
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:08,017
Those sons of b****es.

328
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:12,147
Furthermore, Dohan Construction built the apartment different

329
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,717
from the blueprint that they were approved for at the time.

330
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:18,427
Those conniving sons of b****es!

331
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,177
If we can just prove this,

332
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:22,737
the situation can become advantageous for us.

333
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:26,747
So how much can we receive in compensation if we sue them?

334
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,237
In 2009,

335
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,537
around 170 residents of an apartment building in the city of Namyang

336
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,947
filed a lawsuit against Daeon Construction.

337
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:37,567
It is true that this precedent ended with the court ruling that the company pays out

338
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,407
between 6 to 14 million won for sound insulation construction costs.

339
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:44,247
However, when thinking about the costs and duration of the legal proceedings,

340
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,637
it is an insignificant amount.

341
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:49,847
And that's if we win.

342
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:51,147
Hey, Kim Jeong Ho!

343
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:54,987
Why is he being such a nuisance?

344
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,567
Also, technically speaking,

345
00:21:56,567 --> 00:22:00,427
because it's been 16 years since this building was built,

346
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:02,337
the security liability period for defect repairs

347
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:05,917
based on the Apartment Housing Management Act has long passed.

348
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,067
Do people not live in apartments that were completed 16 years ago?

349
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,597
Do they not have the right to be compensated for damages?

350
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:15,797
What if the housing value of the apartments drops as the news of the lawsuit spreads?

351
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:19,237
Yeah, why should we get involved in a lawsuit just for 10 million won?

352
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,377
Just forget it!

353
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:22,557
Yeah, don't do it. Don't do it.

354
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:25,027
For the devaluation of apartments due to infringement of the living condition

355
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,597
such as inter-floor noise issues,

356
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,117
you can demand compensation for that as well.

357
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:29,947
It only sounds good.

358
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,557
You have to prove that the decline in housing value

359
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:35,707
is due to the inter-floor noise issue and the lawsuit.

360
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,887
But this is not easy at all.

361
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:40,447
Yeah, just give it up.

362
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,007
Don't do it.

363
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,258
Let's not do it.

364
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,390
Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think you're coming to?

365
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,473
This is a violation of the contract!

366
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:51,443
It was difficult enough without your help! Why did you interfere?

367
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:54,184
Because you were starting something you cannot be responsible for.

368
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:57,354
Not that you didn't want to start something you would have to be responsible for?

369
00:22:58,489 --> 00:22:59,689
Remember what you said?

370
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:04,809
A good attorney... is one who solves the issue before it reaches court.

371
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,029
Take a seat.

372
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,709
Okay.

373
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:20,069
Let's say that for the common good, we decide to devote our time and effort to this cause,

374
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,909
and those people notice our commitment

375
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:24,709
and choose to spend their time and money on this difficult lawsuit.

376
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:28,589
But after many years like that, all you get is a few million won?

377
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,739
You think that comes close to sufficient compensation

378
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:35,099
for many years of walking around on eggshells while living in their own homes?

379
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,319
Then what's your plan?

380
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,739
Are you saying we shouldn't do anything?

381
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:41,029
The deeper I dig into this, the more I feel like even filing a national reparations lawsuit.

382
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,809
Do you think this is a reasonable system?

383
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,189
What they're interested in is not about the system or the law!

384
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:49,359
They want their lives to get better immediately!

385
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,179
Then... are you saying what I'm doing right now is not making their lives better?

386
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,469
Yeah! Not at all!

387
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,639
And your life, neither.

388
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:02,879
And is that why you're stuck in this rooftop room in your tracksuit and not doing anything?

389
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,699
Because that's what's good for your life?

390
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,279
Yeah.

391
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,749
Because me not doing anything is what's good for us all.

392
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,169
   

393
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:41,199
- Attorney! 
 - Oh, Ms. Song Hwa!

394
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,239
Hello!

395
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:45,619
Hi, Yi Seul!

396
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,079
Hello.

397
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,309
You held a briefing session today, right?

398
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:00,749
Yes.

399
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,569
I tried my best,

400
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,829
but I don't think people were persuaded, though.

401
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:06,749
I wanted to be there, too,

402
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:09,019
- but I got delayed because of work... 
 - You're not too late!

403
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:11,439
Should I explain it to you?

404
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:16,249
Why are you going to this extent for this, Attorney?

405
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:19,059
It's not even your business.

406
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,649
Because it is something I can do.

407
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:24,459
It's something that can potentially be resolved

408
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,889
if I just have a cup of coffee and get involved

409
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:28,769
while others say I'm taking it overboard.

410
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,599
I can't just do nothing about it.

411
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:35,689
I haven't seen someone like you before, Attorney.

412
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,529
I do hear that quite often.

413
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:42,479
But sometimes, I want to do my best for others, but

414
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:46,399
I wonder if my method is really the right way.

415
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:48,309
Even this time, I don't know if proceeding with a lawsuit

416
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,519
is really what will make things better for the residents.

417
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:58,539
For me... I want to pursue...

418
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,789
that lawsuit.

419
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:05,999
Honestly, that apartment...

420
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:12,445
is a place I've lived with my husband since we were newly married.

421
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:17,145
I want to be able to live in my home without any worries.

422
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:26,089
Welcome!

423
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,609
We want to participate in the lawsuit as well!

424
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:33,129
Although everybody's worried about the housing value dropping,

425
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,869
we need to keep living here.

426
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:36,029
So we want to try anything!

427
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:39,079
- Yes, me too. 
 - Me too!

428
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:40,809
Okay!

429
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,619
Please take a careful look at all the fine details,

430
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,799
and if you have any difficulties,

431
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,329
feel free to ask me.

432
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:50,419
And make sure to sign the back.

433
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,309
Please enjoy.

434
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:18,889
There's nothing more cowardly than criticism without providing solutions.

435
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,569
   

436
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,809
Yeah, I'm cowardly.

437
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,099
And if you're going to keep violating the contract, vacate your space.

438
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:29,899
Okay. I admit that my method may not be the best one.

439
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,219
However, I cannot agree

440
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:36,209
that doing nothing is a better method.

441
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,569
Y-Yeah, okay.

442
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,109
So instead of just criticizing,

443
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:47,089
provide some alternative solutions to solve this problem.

444
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:48,859
Honestly, who doesn't know how to criticize?

445
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:52,309
If someone told me to do nothing but bash something all day, I can!

446
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,999
You're not capable of comprehending my avant-garde ideas.

447
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,219
I'll just be wasting my breath.

448
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:09,249
What are you talking about? My very being is avant-garde.

449
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:11,319
You're just an impulsive moth!

450
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,689
You've got to be kidding me.

451
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:15,319
The reason an impulsive moth like me was able to survive like this

452
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,289
was because I still take into account the words of prats like you.

453
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:21,119
I'm an impulsive mutant moth, okay?

454
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:33,779
Currently, Dohan Construction has built Palacio Hills with over 1003 apartments in Gangcheon-gu

455
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,669
and are only awaiting inspection of completion.

456
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:39,049
They are in the midst of connecting this with the Palacio Hotel

457
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,109
in order to market it as luxurious apartments.

458
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:44,939
They wouldn't want any scandals regarding inter-floor noise issues

459
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:46,799
or improper construction at this time.

460
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,469
- You're right. 
 - But...

461
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:52,239
there wouldn't be anything noteworthy about a compensation lawsuit under the name Blue Apartments

462
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:54,589
even if it was publicized.

463
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,299
How could building this take so long?

464
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:00,999
You should just hurry up and build them.

465
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,329
Wow!

466
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,229
Hey, take a photo of me.

467
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:07,909
Looking good, sir.

468
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,459
Okay!

469
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:11,579
Oh, my gosh, look at that!

470
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:15,849
So if you want to get the attention of Dohan Construction,

471
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:19,919
- you have to... bring Palacio Hills into the picture. 
 - Hello!

472
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,119
Hi.

473
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,549
Looking forward to working with you.

474
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:26,799
But it is important that you take a unique approach

475
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,199
so that you can get more people interested in the issue.

476
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:41,439
So that approach... is this?

477
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,999
You see!

478
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:45,209
I told you you won't get this.

479
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:48,659
It turns out that our Jo hyungnim is tremendous.

480
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,689
Jo Seok Joon. The Jimi Hendrix of South Korea.

481
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:55,409
A living legend in the world of guitar!

482
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,269
I'm stupid for trusting you...

483
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,389
Where did you get all of this?

484
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,749
We borrowed everything from the church next door!

485
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:06,959
Hyungnim, I can play the drums, right?

486
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,199
- Of course! 
 - Hey!

487
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:11,619
Hey. It's been a while. I'm taking the bass.

488
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:13,929
Why are you doing this too, Doctor!

489
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:16,829
And I'm the keyboard ace of Cheonggang Penitentiary.

490
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:18,057
You guys must all be crazy!

491
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:20,527
Are you really going to do this?

492
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:52,639
Okay, let's go!

493
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,099
Okay, let's go!

494
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:58,019
Let's go.

495
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:03,849
Yeah, I'm ready.

496
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:07,949
Yes. I'm ready.

497
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,189
One, two, one, two.

498
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:12,539
Okay, I'm ready as well.

499
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:17,079
Okay, we'll just go without rehearsal.

500
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:25,619
♫  A mountain path where trees have disappeared  ♫

501
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,379
♫  The ocean no one owns, but isn't it still great?  ♫

502
00:31:30,379 --> 00:31:33,990
♫  A world where things go my way  ♫

503
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:37,749
♫  When the night comes, the memories I've collected  ♫

504
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:43,359
♫  Wasn't there a notepad and a pencil for me to write a journal?  ♫

505
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,790
♫  A world that I can draw my way  ♫

506
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:50,429
♫  In the blue sky above  ♫

507
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:56,179
♫  An eagle flies high, and a KA-50 is about to swallow the world  ♫

508
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,069
♫  And sound of gunshots continue  ♫

509
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:01,929
♫  The soldier on TV victorious in battle  ♫

510
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,419
♫  My angel writing a journal  ♫

511
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:07,489
♫  The figure that will be drawn out on a canvas  ♫

512
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:11,020
♫  The world that she will draw out  ♫

513
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,669
♫  We sing  ♫

514
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:17,619
♫  We will be better  ♫

515
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:22,319
♫  We will remember the days we spent in vain  ♫

516
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,370
♫  The days we spent foolishly  ♫

517
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:30,829
♫  But aren't we still doing great?  ♫

518
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:37,319
♫  Aren't we together in this overflowing river of tears?  ♫

519
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:42,289
♫  Aren't we funny like this?  ♫

520
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:44,719
♫  If we were crying  ♫

521
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:50,859
♫  Isn't the world we can't ever see again so awesome?  ♫

522
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:53,749
♫  But aren't we still doing great?  ♫

523
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:59,610
♫  Aren't we together in this overflowing river of tears?  ♫

524
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:05,229
♫  Aren't we funny like this?  ♫

525
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:07,869
♫  If we were crying  ♫

526
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:14,149
♫  Isn't the world we can't ever see again so awesome?  ♫

527
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:22,599
 Did you enjoy our Inter-Floor Noise Concert? 

528
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,669
 We've tried performing in an apartment building constructed by D Construction in 2007, 

529
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,339
 an apartment building constructed by Y Construction in 1998, 

530
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,059
 and lastly in a studio apartment constructed by Company G. 

531
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:33,029
 Although both were made using sheer wall structures, 

532
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:36,169
 there was a significant difference between the apartments constructed by Company D and Company Y. 

533
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:39,249
 What is the reason why we could hear better in the apartments built by Company D? 

534
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:40,979
 Is there a problem with Company D? 

535
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:45,109
 Then what about Company D's new apartment buildings? 

536
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,759
What is this?

537
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,879
But the timing of this is a bit too much.

538
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:09,399
How did they know that we were awaiting approval for Palacio Hills...

539
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,309
Why are so many people out there trying to mess with me nowadays?

540
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:14,389
Man...

541
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,169
I'll tell the legal team to take action

542
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:19,369
- and get the video taken down immediately. 
 - Sure.

543
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,379
Okay.

544
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,729
Well...

545
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:31,239
If we have the video taken down,

546
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:36,619
does that mean the video gets erased from the memories of those who watched it?

547
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:38,349
Hello?

548
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:40,249
Anyone home?

549
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:42,749
Well, the video hasn't gotten that many views,

550
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,259
and it didn't get that much publicity.

551
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:47,719
So I don't think you have to worry too much about it.

552
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,009
Cockroaches!

553
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:51,569
Haven't you heard that

554
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:52,829
if you see just one cockroach,

555
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,719
there are dozens more crawling around in that house?

556
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,159
The fact that there is a video out there like this

557
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,869
means that there are people talking

558
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:08,079
behind closed doors about how Dohan Construction makes buildings like garbage!

559
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,319
Ahjussi, Ahjussi, move over.

560
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:16,419
Managing Director Park...

561
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:20,159
you're old, lack sense and are incapable of reading the room.

562
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,599
When's your retirement again?

563
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:28,669
If the completion of Palacio gets delayed by even one day...

564
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,829
Everyone here...

565
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:39,029
All the Ahjussis here will be packing their bags except me.

566
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,679
Get out.

567
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,619
I told you to get out.

568
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:47,879
Get out!

569
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,459
Get out! I told you to get out!

570
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:51,719
Go out and work!

571
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,249
Just do your jobs well!

572
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:57,189
Understand? You got it? S***!

573
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,249
Did you see? Did you see?

574
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,019
Did you see the number of views?

575
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:16,949
Why are you making a fuss about it? It was an obvious result.

576
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:19,679
How do you get over 500,000 views in just 3 days?

577
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,339
- 500,000? 
 - Yeah!

578
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:24,159
This is because of my ability to read trends...

579
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,279
Mr. Jo is amazing!

580
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:30,149
He's not called a legend for nothing!

581
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:33,879
Wow! Celebrities are retweeting it and everything!

582
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,439
So did you get a call from them?

583
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:37,409
Yeah. They said if we don't take down the video immediately,

584
00:36:37,409 --> 00:36:40,229
they will sue us for defamation and obstruction of business.

585
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:43,799
Then we can move on to our next phase, right?

586
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,759
Okay!

587
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,769
Begin the next phase!

588
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:49,859
Let's start!

589
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,709
All right!

590
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:57,469
   

591
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:59,509
What's taking him so long?

592
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,669
Eat up!

593
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:03,189
- Eat up! Eat up! 
 - Thank you.

594
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:45,389
Kim Yoo Ri, let's go.

595
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,106
What the...

596
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:49,349
Disgusting!

597
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:50,899
What are you doing? It's disgusting!

598
00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:52,999
What's with you?

599
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:55,309
How did you suddenly become a human being?

600
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:57,949
Did you eat some garlic and mugwort? 
  (T/N: Referring to Korean folktale) 

601
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:00,629
Did you expect me to go there wearing a tracksuit?

602
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:02,729
What's your concept for today?

603
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:05,119
A python?

604
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,729
Anaconda?

605
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:10,589
How would someone like you, wearing a tracksuit in and out of season, know anything about fashion?

606
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:11,719
Let's go.

607
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:15,089
Gosh, he would think this was a regular snake...

608
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:16,719
Goodness.

609
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:24,499
   

610
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:31,659
   

611
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:43,169
What's that?

612
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:44,789
What's wrong?

613
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,199
Oh, it's nothing. It's just anti-diarrhea pills.

614
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,219
You know, my stomach starts to growl when I get nervous.

615
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:53,109
If it's too difficult for you,

616
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:55,409
- it's okay to stop now. 
 - What are you talking about?

617
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:58,639
And when we go inside, you stay off to the side!

618
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:00,789
Are you sure about that?

619
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,179
Look here, Prosecutor.

620
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,229
Although I often took up hopeless cases

621
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:06,219
and ended up being called Queen of Losses,

622
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,579
I'm a King when it comes to settling before reaching court!

623
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:21,359
   

624
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,799
So you're an attorney!

625
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:32,709
Why would someone experienced in legal matters like you put yourself

626
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:34,869
in this situation by posting that video?

627
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,209
Because it was posted as a matter of public interest, it would be difficult to penalize it.

628
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,469
But if you must waste your human resources, I suppose...

629
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:43,909
Whether the video was posted for the purpose of public interest or slander,

630
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:46,329
we would have to fight about it in court.

631
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:49,459
Then since you'll be working on this anyway...

632
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:52,589
could you look over this as well?

633
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:11,059
So your main point was something else then?

634
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:13,139
Oh, come on! Take a proper look at it!

635
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:16,079
I spent a lot of effort writing this complaint.

636
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,329
And take a look at the letter of action in the back here as well.

637
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,479
Even when I look at it again, it's a masterpiece, right?

638
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,529
It was well-written.

639
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:25,779
And who the hell is this guy?

640
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:27,289
Oh, this guy...

641
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:31,309
- He's a partner in our firm— 
 - I'm Paralegal Kim Jeong Ho.

642
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:33,329
Paralegal...

643
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,939
What's up?

644
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,259
Attorney?

645
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:44,769
You were quite famous.

646
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:47,179
Oh, this one. Yeah.

647
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,059
My picture came out well, right?

648
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:54,219
That's awesome.

649
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,219
Okay. Aside from the video,

650
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:58,319
what's your reason for coming here?

651
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,919
Is this a declaration of war?

652
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:03,899
Well, I file lawsuits like this for the public interest all the time. It's my job.

653
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,709
But I thought that would make your life so much more difficult, Team Leader.

654
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:08,569
Before the complaint reaches court,

655
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:14,179
I was hoping we could come up with a solution that would be better for both of us.

656
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:22,229
My team members can handle the work. 
     

657
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,659
But still, the person in charge holds a lot of the responsibility.

658
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,279
If you lose this case, all other apartments will also line up to sue.

659
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:29,859
Then what will be the extent of the loss?

660
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:31,809
Gosh, that would be astronomical...

661
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:33,459
Oh gosh, I just got the shivers.

662
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,109
No chance that we would lose!

663
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:41,369
Is that something a mere legal team leader, can gamble all on your own?

664
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:47,759
Sir.

665
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,299
The world is changing around us.

666
00:41:51,299 --> 00:41:54,529
It's so much easier for people to find out

667
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:59,069
what's lowering their quality of life and how they can claim their rights.

668
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:02,079
Even if it's not us, at some point in the future,

669
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,339
a crazy attorney somewhere will start a lawsuit against some construction company.

670
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:12,089
But does that troublesome headache of a case

671
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:16,059
have to happen to Dohan Construction right now?

672
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:21,359
Does it?

673
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,189
So did your meeting with your higher-ups go over well?

674
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:39,489
My goodness. Under the condition that you pull the video down,

675
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:42,499
for the cost of noise construction at 7 million won

676
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:44,499
and compensation of 520,000 won per household.

677
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:46,239
Let's settle it here.

678
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:47,869
520,000 won?

679
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:48,829
What 520,000 won?

680
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:50,789
Why not add another 500,000 and make it over 1 million?

681
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:52,949
Are you beggars?

682
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:55,139
Beggars?

683
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:05,629
Who's the one acting like a freaking beggar?

684
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:07,759
How dare you act all high and mighty when you're not even coughing up 1 million won?

685
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:11,379
So who told you to build a s***ty apartment in the first place?

686
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:13,899
Billions of won wouldn't be enough for the real compensation here!

687
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:16,099
I was going to spread the rumor all over the place and was going to get the money from the lawsuit,

688
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,029
yet I'm giving you a chance to be accountable on your own.

689
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:21,379
How dare you call us beggars when we're being so generous with you!

690
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:25,989
But why are you talking informally with me?

691
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:28,909
I mean, you were using such vulgar language earlier, Team Leader.

692
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:31,669
I thought you wanted to be on equal footing as friends.

693
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:34,419
Team Leader, they are in expensive apartments worth millions of won,

694
00:43:34,419 --> 00:43:37,609
living as if being tortured in their own homes. How can you even bring up that amount?

695
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:40,699
But even in a precedent case in the Supreme Court,

696
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:42,119
they didn't award this much amount.

697
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,209
That precedent case was back in 2009!

698
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:46,129
There's the inflation—

699
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:47,249
Gosh, forget it.

700
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,999
It'd be faster for me to make money off the YouTube views and fix their homes for them.

701
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:55,669
Then as you mentioned,

702
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:58,439
how about 8 million won per household?

703
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:01,119
- Is that good? 
 - Gosh, let's just say it is.

704
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,929
Gosh, I'm so tired.

705
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:05,719
Then please wrap up the paperwork with my staff.

706
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:09,889
I have another meeting to attend.

707
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:13,079
Is it that time already?

708
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,039
Team Leader.

709
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:16,869
You don't need to go too far.

710
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:19,099
What is it now?

711
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:22,949
CEOs, over here! Over here.

712
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:24,909
Aigoo...

713
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:26,439
What's going on here?

714
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:27,809
Let me introduce myself again.

715
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:31,839
I'm Attorney Kim Yoo Ri, an attorney for Palacio Hills' Resident Representatives Committee.

716
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,779
For them, the apartment where residents haven't even moved in has water leaks and cracks...

717
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:39,869
Gosh, there are quite a lot of changes that are different from the blueprint.

718
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:41,779
Let's go up. Let's go up.

719
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,649
Oh, I think you'll have a bit more headache with this case than in the other case.

720
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,539
You should've built the apartments right from the get-go.

721
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:49,209
They're expensive apartments too.

722
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,179
W-Wait...

723
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,029
Thank you!

724
00:45:02,029 --> 00:45:03,689
- Get home safely! 
 - Thank you!

725
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:05,319
Thank you!

726
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:07,949
Oh, it's raining.

727
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:10,159
Aigoo, the rain...

728
00:45:26,299 --> 00:45:28,839
I feel great!

729
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:34,339
♫  She's waking me up with that laughter  ♫

730
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:40,460
♫  She's waking me up with that pretty smile  ♫

731
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:44,399
♫  She makes me smile  ♫

732
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:47,349
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

733
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:50,849
♫  I wonder if you know that I feel this way  ♫

734
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:53,990
♫  I wonder if you know that I feel this way  ♫

735
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,779
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

736
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:02,819
♫  I send my heart  ♫

737
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:06,349
Hey, you always do this when it rains—

738
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:07,939
Doesn't it feel refreshing?

739
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:12,570
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

740
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:15,739
Remember?

741
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,179
When we were in college,

742
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,549
I had a panic attack out of the blue on the bus, so

743
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:23,749
we got off the bus and walked home drenched in the rain.

744
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:25,229
I'm feeling great today.

745
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,159
Should we walk home since we haven't done that in a while?

746
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:31,059
You don't remember getting sick with a cold for a week after that, do you?

747
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:32,709
And you messed up on your midterms because of that,

748
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,879
and you were bawling your eyes out.

749
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:38,129
I want to reminisce first time in a while, and here you go again! Again!

750
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,889
I'm the only one enjoying myself, huh?

751
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:42,800
♫  My heart for you  ♫

752
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,800
♫  It must have been love, the look of love  ♫

753
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:53,099
♫  I keep seeing you in front of me  ♫

754
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,919
♫  I think of you wherever I go  ♫

755
00:46:55,919 --> 00:46:59,339
♫  I wonder if she knows how I feel  ♫

756
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,430
♫  I wonder if she knows how I feel  ♫

757
00:47:03,689 --> 00:47:07,550
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

758
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:11,669
♫  I send my heart  ♫

759
00:47:11,669 --> 00:47:16,480
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

760
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,249
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

761
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:28,019
♫  Like the wind, it blows without ending  ♫

762
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:31,350
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

763
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:36,729
♫  Like that night sky  ♫

764
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:48,339
♫  Like the spring breeze  ♫

765
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,739
♫  I'm in love with you, with you  ♫

766
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:02,269
   

767
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:08,400
♫  I want to fall in love with you, with you  ♫

768
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:10,539
   

769
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:13,849
♫  Like the wind, it blows without ending  ♫

770
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,740
♫  And shakes me up  ♫

771
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:22,129
♫  The wind blows toward me  ♫

772
00:48:22,129 --> 00:48:23,679
Look at these chunks.

773
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:25,599
Here, Bomtol Young Man. 
  (T/N: Chestnut in Korean, they say he looks like a chestnut) 

774
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,319
Say "ah."

775
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:28,859
How is it? How is it?

776
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:29,989
It's so tasty.

777
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:31,279
- I'm sorry. 
 - Welcome.

778
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:33,419
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

779
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:35,699
- This way, please. 
 - Okay.

780
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:37,429
Come, come.

781
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:39,919
- We didn't start yet. 
 - Oh, okay.

782
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:45,619
Thank you.

783
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:53,969
I feel so sorry for such a young lady.

784
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,349
Gosh, why?

785
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,139
Don't have pity for someone perfectly fine.

786
00:48:57,139 --> 00:49:01,159
Aigoo! She's that woman!

787
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,409
She lost her husband two years ago and is raising a child alone.

788
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,309
She has to work, yet

789
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:09,809
it's tough to find a place for her child to be taken care of.

790
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:13,489
I feel so bad for her when I see her running around all by herself.

791
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:15,509
Whoa. Really?

792
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:17,139
Yeah!

793
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,279
- Is everyone here? 
 - Yes.

794
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,479
As I told you last time,

795
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:31,709
the lawsuit will take too long for it to provide real help.

796
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:35,469
So I went to Dohan Construction and attempted to settle it.

797
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:38,089
Fortunately, for construction cost and compensation,

798
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:40,929
I have settled it for 8 million won per household.

799
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:42,579
Oh, my goodness!

800
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,889
Oh, my gosh!

801
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:44,869
What in the world!

802
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:46,539
It's not a huge amount, but

803
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:49,429
I've checked out vendors and got estimates.

804
00:49:49,429 --> 00:49:54,119
It looks like fixing your living rooms, and the master bedrooms are doable with that amount.

805
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:57,239
Oh, my goodness! That's great!

806
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,319
Attorney Kim, thank you so much!

807
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:00,749
Thank you so much!

808
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:02,409
You went through a lot.

809
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:04,339
Thank you so much.

810
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:06,859
Gosh, I'm so happy!

811
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:08,739
And Ms. Song Hwa,

812
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:12,839
I'll make a special request for your place to be fixed sturdily

813
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:16,059
so Yi Seul can run around and play freely.

814
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:17,529
Yes...

815
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:21,979
Why are you crying?

816
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:32,799
And my apologies to you...

817
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:36,609
I spoke as if I could change everything in your house at first

818
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:39,999
- yet this is all I could— 
 - No, Attorney Kim.

819
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,889
It was enough for me that someone stepped forward and took care of it as if it was your business.

820
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:48,639
Thanks to you, Attorney Kim...

821
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:51,749
even if I hear some noise coming from the next door,

822
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:54,169
I don't think I'd get angry.

823
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:55,979
He's right.

824
00:50:57,409 --> 00:51:03,070
There was no worse hell than living in hatred for others.

825
00:51:03,749 --> 00:51:05,919
Thank you so much.

826
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,789
- Thank you, Attorney Kim. 
 - My gosh...

827
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:14,389
I'm the grateful one.

828
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:19,879
It's nice to see you smile.

829
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:24,339
To summarize,

830
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:28,189
they crapped all over us 
    

831
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:31,199
and even got what they wanted, right? 
    

832
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,489
And this...

833
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,819
This Kim Yoo Ri or something...

834
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:42,979
of all places she used to be at Hwang and Goo?

835
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:49,899
Oh, y-yes...

836
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,489
Geez.

837
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:53,979
What does she do?

838
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:56,339
Oh, well...

839
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:01,019
She was an attorney working for the Public Service Foundation of our law firm.

840
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:03,849
I'm not sure if this will be a comfort to you, but

841
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,799
she's recently left.

842
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:08,589
Why did she leave?

843
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,469
To run a cafe...

844
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:15,189
A cafe?

845
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:17,099
Where they sell coffee?

846
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,619
Yes. A cafe.

847
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:22,789
Then she should just sell coffee. Why is she picking a fight with us?

848
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:26,159
I'm sure she didn't have any other intentions.

849
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:28,479
For public service and whatnot,

850
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:32,399
she just loved to make matters bigger...

851
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,609
Oh, I see. That's her style, huh?

852
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:45,409
Someone with a personality like that should fix that.

853
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:49,739
That's all because she has no fear.

854
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:03,579
Why isn't she picking up?

855
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:06,649
How could this be? 
    

856
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:09,199
How could you take care of only those residents?

857
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:10,359
We're all the same residents in the apartment!

858
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:12,399
- That's what I'm saying! 
 - Gosh, Sir.

859
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,879
You didn't do anything out of fear of apartment value dropping.

860
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,659
But asking for the money now is like highway robbery.

861
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:20,129
This came about because they wanted to claim their rights,

862
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,969
so they signed the complaints and came forward wanting to file a lawsuit.

863
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,839
So Dohan Construction had no choice but to settle.

864
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,219
Then we could settle with them, too!

865
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:28,989
That's right!

866
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,299
- Hello? 
  - Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! 

867
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:35,329
Why don't you pick up! Why don't you?

868
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,799
Hey, what the hell are you going around doing?

869
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,589
I'm kind of busy these days.

870
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:42,799
But did the rumor spread to you already?

871
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:45,299
 You'd better stop being cheeky. 

872
00:53:45,299 --> 00:53:50,379
D-Do you even know what kind of people CEO Lee and these people are?

873
00:53:50,379 --> 00:53:52,169
Gosh, if you're going to nag,

874
00:53:52,169 --> 00:53:53,819
come by the cafe next time and do it to my face.

875
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,679
That seems more affectionate, you know.

876
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:57,939
I'll hang up now. I have clients with me.

877
00:53:57,939 --> 00:54:00,359
 N-No, wait! Yoo Ri— 

878
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:02,809
Where were we?

879
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:04,219
Oh, to settle!

880
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:07,759
I settled this with the agreement not to file another lawsuit regarding this matter.

881
00:54:07,759 --> 00:54:09,979
I think you can look for another attorney, but

882
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:12,399
I don't think anyone would take your case.

883
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:14,569
Then what do we do?

884
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:16,349
- My gosh... 
 - So...

885
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,579
if you need any other legal consultation next time,

886
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:20,099
be sure to come to me.

887
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:22,099
Even if the winning chances are against me,

888
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:24,609
if you want, I'll definitely...

889
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:25,909
definitely...

890
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:27,519
definitely...

891
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:31,999
fight along with you.

892
00:54:43,939 --> 00:54:45,039
More meat.

893
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:46,579
- There. 
 - Everyone...

894
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:49,449
do you even know what a great thing we accomplished?

895
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,939
In this untact* era, 
  (T/N: No contact, no touch era post-Covid) 

896
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:53,659
we crumbled the wall of misunderstandings, apathy,

897
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:55,199
and hatred among neighbors.

898
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:57,939
Kim Yoo Ri, you always give a speech when you start drinking.

899
00:54:57,939 --> 00:55:01,369
Se Yeon and Jin Ki, you let us use your newlywed home.

900
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:04,179
Doctor, Eun Kang, and Joon,

901
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,279
you showed off your hidden talents.

902
00:55:06,279 --> 00:55:08,049
And our landlord...

903
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,109
as usual, you may be annoying, but

904
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:12,769
you always say what's right.

905
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:15,569
So I was able to set the right direction.

906
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:20,439
In any case, celebrating our Law Cafe's successful first case,

907
00:55:20,439 --> 00:55:21,589
let's give a toast.

908
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:22,979
Cheers!

909
00:55:22,979 --> 00:55:24,749
Cheers!

910
00:55:24,749 --> 00:55:27,669
Cheers!

911
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:31,300
   

912
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:38,949
 Did you play that bass guitar right? 

913
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:41,929
 Of course... 

914
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:44,589
 - Let's drink. 
 - Good job. 

915
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:08,869
Let's play the Truth Game! Truth Game!

916
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,949
She's not able to enunciate her words.

917
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:12,239
I think it's time to call it a night.

918
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,609
Truth Game!

919
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:15,539
I want to play.

920
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,609
I have a question for Eun Kang hyung.

921
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:22,089
As far as I know,

922
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,979
to get five years for arson,

923
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:26,339
it means you set the fire when a person is inside.

924
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:31,039
If so, why did you start the fire, Hyung?

925
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:37,559
He's not telling the truth.

926
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:42,109
All right, then it's my turn!

927
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:47,489
Kim Jeong Ho, be honest.

928
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:49,279
You had fun this time, didn't you?

929
00:56:49,279 --> 00:56:51,939
Working with me, huh?

930
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:55,979
Since when did the Truth Game change into just asking whatever you want to ask?

931
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:58,719
Hurry up and answer me!

932
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,769
You enjoyed it, right? You had fun, right?

933
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:02,339
You were proud, right?

934
00:57:02,339 --> 00:57:05,279
Gosh, this question is too easy.

935
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,239
He answers too quickly. No, no...

936
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:08,949
Change, change. Let's change the question.

937
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:11,299
- Hey, can't do that. 
 - Wait.

938
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:13,899
I'll ask him something more interesting.

939
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:15,499
Hey, Kim Jeong Ho,

940
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:19,499
Why did you dump me back then?

941
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:20,779
- What? 
 - Hey...

942
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:23,519
You two were together?

943
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:27,969
Hurry up and answer me! If you're scared to answer, then drink.

944
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:35,429
Were we even together for real?

945
00:57:35,429 --> 00:57:38,509
Hey, even if we were faking it, you did dump me out of the blue.

946
00:57:38,509 --> 00:57:41,939
- Why did you dump me? 
 - How long did I have to fake it?

947
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:49,209
So why did you have to promise to fake it in the first place?

948
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:52,849
So this drunk attorney was seeing this oppa

949
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,629
and he was two-timing and had eight tentacles like an octopus.

950
00:57:54,629 --> 00:57:56,579
And she got dumped even with him.

951
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:58,379
I'm the one who dumped him!

952
00:57:58,379 --> 00:57:59,879
So she was embarrassed to face her friends

953
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:02,679
and pretended to date Kim Jeong Ho she always hung out with.

954
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,089
In a word, she used me.

955
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,219
Used you?

956
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:09,689
You said you didn't want to be bothered by other people and pretended to date me!

957
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:11,959
We came to an agreement for mutual benefit and enhancement.

958
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:14,789
- You can't knock it like that! 
 - Hey, hey!

959
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:17,939
Stop fighting, you guys. Aren't you even sick of it?

960
00:58:17,939 --> 00:58:19,229
Fine.

961
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:22,639
- Let's stop it, Kim Jeong Ho. 
 - Stop what?

962
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:25,559
Playing hard to get, pretending to dislike me when you like me.

963
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,859
I said let's stop that now.

964
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,729
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, I'm okay...

965
00:58:34,729 --> 00:58:38,789
Hey, sit down. Seriously, you're going to regret this big time.

966
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:39,939
No, no, no.

967
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:43,949
I'll make a formal suggestion while I'm at it.

968
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:46,099
Kim Jeong Ho, you!

969
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:47,289
Come to me!

970
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:49,559
I'll be good to you!

971
00:58:50,229 --> 00:58:52,329
I'll treat you right! The best there is!

972
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,029
Become my partner... no, no, no...

973
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:57,449
Become our Law Cafe's—

974
00:58:57,449 --> 00:58:58,949
Are you okay?

975
00:58:58,949 --> 00:58:59,869
Honey!

976
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,919
- Se Yeon! 
 - Jin Ki!

977
00:59:00,919 --> 00:59:01,679
- Se Yeon! 
 - Honey!

978
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:03,949
Hey, are you okay?

979
00:59:05,216 --> 00:59:06,749
My baby is coming out!

980
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:09,019
Oh, taxi! The taxi is here!

981
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:10,179
One, two, three!

982
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,979
Her contractions are already less than four minutes apart!

983
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:13,889
We have to rush!

984
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:15,829
Hang on a little longer, Honey!

985
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:19,389
Ow, ow, it hurts!

986
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:28,969
So pretty...

987
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:35,399
 No matter how your world shakes after falling for someone, 

988
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:42,169
 if one doesn't not start something, nothing happens. 

989
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,399
 I learned it for sure this time. 

990
00:59:45,399 --> 00:59:47,699
The one who vitalizes your life, 
    

991
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:49,329
you feel secure no matter what he does. 
.    

992
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:51,469
Someone who understands me the most, 
    

993
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:55,599
and lead each other toward a better direction. 
    

994
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:07,009
But why did you come here instead of going home?

995
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:09,909
I wanted to finish what I was talking about earlier.

996
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:28,099
- Don't. 
 - Why not?

997
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:29,439
I'm not going to do it anyway.

998
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,799
I didn't even ask you. Why do you say no?

999
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,129
I want to work with you.

1000
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,229
I feel secure when you're with me. It's fun working together.

1001
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:38,769
I wish you could join the Law Cafe as a partner lawyer.

1002
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:41,459
- I don't want to. 
 - Why not?

1003
01:00:41,459 --> 01:00:42,509
I told you last time.

1004
01:00:42,509 --> 01:00:46,799
For the good of everyone, it's best that I don't do anything.

1005
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,189
What do you mean by that?

1006
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,159
It means I just don't want to, and everything is a hassle to me.

1007
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:56,509
Why is everything such a hassle to you and don't want to do anything?

1008
01:00:56,509 --> 01:00:57,659
You!

1009
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:59,439
You're a hassle to me!

1010
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:03,199
I avoided you and wrote out that contract because you're a hassle. Don't you get it?

1011
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,589
Are you that dense, or do you just not want to get it?

1012
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:10,019
Please, I beg you.

1013
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:12,359
Don't bug me anymore.

1014
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,150
Seriously.

1015
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:04,880


1016
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:11,559
♫  Cold wind breezes by my shoulder  ♫

1017
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:13,199
Kim Yoo Ri...

1018
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:15,069
Close your eyes.

1019
01:03:15,069 --> 01:03:20,420
♫  The night I could only think of painful memories  ♫

1020
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:27,880
♫  Do you remember that time when you came to me quietly to hold my hand  ♫

1021
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,509
Don't think about anything.

1022
01:03:29,509 --> 01:03:34,390
♫  My frozen tears were falling  ♫

1023
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:41,939
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

1024
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:45,539
♫  Do you feel it?  ♫

1025
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:50,469
♫  Can you see with kindly eyes?  ♫

1026
01:03:50,469 --> 01:03:58,699
♫  It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long  ♫

1027
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:02,219
♫  Just lean on me  ♫

1028
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:07,299
♫  Embrace me just like this  ♫

1029
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:12,209
♫  In the blue sky above  ♫

1030
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:17,909
♫  An eagle flies high, and a KA-50 is about to swallow the world  ♫

1031
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:20,799
♫  And sound of gunshots continue  ♫

1032
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:23,759
♫  The soldier on TV victorious in battle  ♫

1033
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,099
♫  My angel writing a journal  ♫

1034
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:29,379
♫  The figure that will be drawn out on a canvas  ♫

1035
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:32,909
♫  The world that she will draw out  ♫

1036
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:36,869
   

1037
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:38,249
 Hey, let, let, let go of me! 

1038
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,409
 I'm confused these days. 

1039
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,449
 I don't want to leave you alone, Kim Yoo Ri. 

1040
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:44,739
♫  Days like these  ♫

1041
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:48,319
 Whoa, what an interesting connection! 

1042
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,359
 You said you've reported to the police for child abuse before, right? 

1043
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,499
 I've seen him before. 

1044
01:04:53,499 --> 01:04:54,749
 Soo Ah! 

1045
01:04:54,749 --> 01:04:57,189
 I wish you didn't blame yourself. 

1046
01:04:57,189 --> 01:04:59,459
 Stop! 

1047
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:02,349
 I don't want to be family with you. 

1048
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:04,159
 I want to be someone else to you. 

1049
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:06,479
♫  If you were crying  ♫

1050
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:09,100
♫  Think how great the world that you'll never get to see again was  ♫
