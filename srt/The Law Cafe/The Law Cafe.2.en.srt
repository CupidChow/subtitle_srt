Everything was easier for me compared to others.

00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:49,586
Because people were jealous of me, I didn't have many friends.

You're amazing!

17
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:41,776
Without attending an academy, you took the top rank in the entire school as soon as you transferred?

But did you see Kim Yoo Ri's face yesterday?

19

Seeing her face like that was priceless!

20
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,276
She was always the top student, and her face was like this when she missed her place.

Hey, ever since I saw Kim Yoo Ri flaunt, I knew this would happen.

Thinking of Yoo Ri like that

66

is a struggle and painful at times.

67

But at least there's no way for us to hurt each other,

68

so it's immensely peaceful...and safe.

71
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,636
use text messages as you specified in the agreement.

72

Even if we meet, I won't greet you or say hello.

73

I'll be careful not to use the rooftop or the stairs leading to it.

74
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:06,686
And I'll make sure to keep the other 125 terms of the agreement.

And I do prefer retaining the oils from the coffee.

The more oils it retains, the more unique the flavor and fragrance of the coffee would become.

You always jump at the sight of a pasta dish as if you starved for three days. Yet you're twirling your fork.

324
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:12,758
So I'm sure something is up.

325
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,888
I'm not really that interested, but I'll listen. What is it?

326
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:19,138
You know, when a person comes close to you,

327
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,438
you could close your eyes, right?

328
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:22,498
What are you talking about?

329
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:24,118
Kind of like a reflex, right?

330
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:26,888
The mystery of the human body. Something like that.

331
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:29,338
Something like that...

332
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:32,758
You didn't drink that much. Why are you talking nonsense?

333
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:36,258
I'm giving up the valuable time I'm supposed to practice water labor with Se Yeon.

334
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:39,808
Aigoo, give me a freaking break. My apologies, sir.

335
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,008
I'm leaving. I'll go.

336
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,628
Hurry up and go home to see your Se Yeon. Go now.

337
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,138
I was just about to do that anyway.

338
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:47,468
Gosh, I'm tired.

339
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,838
You're not going to eat this, right?

340
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:50,348
Hey.

341
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,298
How do you make porridge?

342
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,468
You just add water and rice and boil it.

343
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,638
Just water and rice?

344
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:04,698
Just water and rice.

345
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:27,798
Don't be ignorant and put ramen and coffee in your aching stomach

346
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:31,178
and eat the vegetable porridge that this new tenant made for you.

347
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,198
All right then...

348
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:43,388
The annual economic loss due to food waste is more than 20 trillion won.

349
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,038
Did you know that?

350
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,378
But in various places around the world,

351
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:52,018
even now, more than 1.2 billion people are starving.

352
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:02,578
But I still couldn't eat it.

353
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:06,278
Wow... the porridge... it's tough for the porridge to taste like that...

354
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,288
Yet she's done it somehow!

355
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:12,018
She, literally, "boiled porridge."*
(Korean saying that means to ruin something)

It's a law consultation cafe.

- Is the consultation mandatory?
- Welcome!

367

We can just say we came for coffee.

Thank you.

What is your relationship with that first-floor cafe lady?

375

We're just alumni.

376
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:26,318
But you know, I noticed last time that

377
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:31,978
the way the second-floor doctor looks at the lawyer lady is pretty serious.

378
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,798
- Thank you.
- If you're just friends with her,

379

why don't you help him out?

380
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:42,178
A doctor and a lawyer. They make a nice picture.

People can handle relationships on their own.

L-Look! Look over there!

386
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,838
The doctor is going into the cafe!

387
00:31:08,978 --> 00:31:11,298
Oh, Doctor, you're here.

388
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:12,928
Hello, Attorney Kim.

389
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:16,598
I heard you went through a lot because of my patient last night.

390
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:18,358
He says he scared you late at night.

391
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:19,948
He's very sorry.

392
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:21,438
Oh, no!

393
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:25,038
I opened my cafe to help people like him, just like you, Doctor.

394
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:27,808
Gosh, I'm so sorry about it.

395
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,778
If I'm not being rude, may I ask you what this is?

396
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:34,908
It's a noise monitor.

397
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,248
Try speaking into it.

398
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:40,788
Gosh, I feel so shy.

399
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:43,388
It's nice to meet you, Attorney Kim.

400
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,748
Yes, hello!

401
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:51,338
I'm delighted to meet you as your neighbor as well.

402
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,168
So, why do you need that?

403
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:56,708
I wanted to verify his complaints.

404
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,978
I told him that I'd visit his place.

405
00:31:59,978 --> 00:32:03,648
Of course, you move quickly.

406
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:06,518
Someone told me I' m too rash.

407
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:10,438
Then, later tonight...

408
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:12,708
would it be okay for me to accompany you?

409
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,078
Really?

410
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:16,808
I'd be grateful if you'd do that.

411
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,328
Where do you think you're going?

412
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:20,748
Don't tell me you're visiting that guy with the hammer?

413
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:23,498
Didn't we decide we wouldn't talk to each other?

414
00:32:23,498 --> 00:32:25,708
Why are you being so nosy?

415
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:26,948
Mind your own business.

416
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,408
Do you think I could mind my own business?

417
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,108
Hey, are you trying to save the planet?

418
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:32,588
Do you have a Superwoman complex or something?

419
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:36,808
I'm not saving the planet and I'm just trying to help out a neighbor who came to me for help.

420
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:38,948
- Must you bring up Superwoman or whatever?
- Hello.

421
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:40,368
Are you in your right mind right now?

422
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:43,158
How old are you, young man who resembles a chestnut?

423
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:45,558
I'm Bae Joon. I'm 27 years old.

424
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:48,938
- We're noonas who run small businesses here.
- Noona.

425
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,768
There's not much to eat in this cafe.

426
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,928
There isn't much to eat, but there's a lot to see here.

427
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:55,688
You're so cute.

428
00:32:55,688 --> 00:32:58,318
And would he accept that?

429
00:32:58,318 --> 00:33:00,448
Hey, don't you feel any fear?

430
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:02,608
Don't you worry or think?

431
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,518
You were traumatized last night. Where do you think you're going by yourself?

432
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:08,208
- I'm going with her.
- What?

433
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,888
I'm going with her.

434
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,528
What?

435
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,198
They're cousins.

436
00:33:14,198 --> 00:33:16,858
And they get along so well that they're always together.

437
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,058
They're best friends.

438
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,958
Best, my foot.

439
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:24,458
They're... just Dumb and Dumber of our neighborhood.

440
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,508
D***, I lost again.

441
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:34,418
Come out, come out. A stick, a stick!

442
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:36,108
- What is he saying?
- A stick!

443
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,668
Yes, okay!

444
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:41,428
Will we see those two...

445
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:44,738
go separate ways because of a woman?

446
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,458
I couldn't stand the sight of two grown men

447
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,368
going around together with nothing to do.

448
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:51,608
It turned out perfectly!

449
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:53,548
What turned out perfectly?

450
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:56,088
What turned out perfectly?

451
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:57,428
- The sweet potato...
- Oh, I see.

452
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:58,598
- turned out perfectly.
- Yeah.

453
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:00,438
It's sweet.

454
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,168
D*** it.

455
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:10,228
My wrist is going to give out first at this rate.

456
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,968
It's your turn.

457
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,838
Landlord.

458
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,888
Can't you just go to the cafe lady and ask her when she's coming out?

459
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:20,608
What are you saying? I'm...

460
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:24,168
- totally focused on our game right now!
- Hold it!

461
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,728
You're putting Hong* card next to Heuk* card.
(Hwatu cards)

462
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:29,708
How dare you try to lie to yourself and us?

463
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,068
I couldn't see because it was dark. I couldn't see.

464
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,068
Since it's nighttime.

465
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,908
Landlord! You left everything here!

466
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,278
What is it?

467
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:55,878
When I was a rookie prosecutor, the first dead body I saw

468
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,418
was someone murdered by a neighbor due to a noise conflict.

469
00:34:59,418 --> 00:35:01,188
So what?

470
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:02,488
Now that I think about it,

471
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:07,208
in a country with 42,250 noise complaints per year,

472
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:11,418
your intention to help your neighbor in suffering is quite commendable.

473
00:35:11,418 --> 00:35:12,898
In regards to this situation,

474
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:16,658
it doesn't make sense for me to sit out when I'm highly experienced.

475
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,738
"Don't you feel any fear? Don't you worry or think?"

476
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:22,598
That's how you were criticizing me just earlier today.

477
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:26,408
- Let's go.
- Yes, sure.

478
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:37,288
Were there any customers at the cafe today?

479
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,438
No.

480
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:42,218
There were a few customers who just came to drink coffee.

481
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:44,108
Don't worry too much.

482
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,798

Yes.

to the house above and make a formal complaint?

508
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,288
Complaint?

If you proceed by sending them a legal notice and...

obtain a written diagnosis from the hospital

and collect evidence regarding your damages,

515
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:01,518
we could also try to sue them for damage compensation.

516

That's right.

Honestly, is there anyone here who doesn't understand that lunatic?

565
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:19,778
Of course, there isn't.

Oh, my gosh!

Come in, come in.

569
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:40,198
There must be a baby upstairs.

570
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,588
A grandma lives alone upstairs.

571
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:44,928
That's why we're going crazy.

572
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:48,118
Since we can't even tell where the noise is coming from.

573
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:51,668
That tenth-floor lunatic is like that, even though no one lives above him.

574
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:53,218
- That's true.
- Pardon?

575

They moved somewhere else because that lunatic kept making a big fuss.

577
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:01,348
It's already been a few months.

578
00:42:06,468 --> 00:42:10,518
Then all those noises coming from the ceiling are...

579
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:12,618
No one knows the source!

580
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:17,568
If we knock from here, the ceiling two floors above us will resonate as well.

581
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:36,628
This is recorded on a cell phone, so it could be hard to hear,

582
00:42:36,628 --> 00:42:39,788
but the entire apartment had terrible soundproofing.

583
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:42,088
The noise issues between floors are quite...

584
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:46,408
To be honest, this can be resolved by just constructing the floors thicker.

585
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,718
But then the construction fees will increase,

586
00:42:48,718 --> 00:42:52,238
so that's why everyone just builts with the minimum thickness.

587
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,908
What year was the apartment constructed?

588
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:55,208
In 2007.

589
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,638
It's not even that old.

590
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:00,068
It's not that new apartments will be less like that,

591
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:01,628
and old apartments will be more like that.

592
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:03,548
It has nothing to do with that.

593
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:06,388
Was it since 2004?

594
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:08,818
There was a pre-certification system.

595
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,648
Before construction, they made floor test samples and drew blueprints.

596
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:14,508
If they could just get this approved,

597
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:18,168
they didn't even check on how the actual construction progressed.

598
00:43:18,168 --> 00:43:23,088
So from the contractor's side, there's no reason to construct them properly.

- Why can't you—

Why are you avoiding me?

That day, the reason why I looked at you like that

671
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:13,156
is because I needed someone to blame,

When you experience misfortune, you'll be furious at the world.

675

That day...

I was too angry and blamed the wrong person.

679
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:42,626
I believe your father

680
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:47,496
did his best within the bounds of what he believed to be just.

Should I have just left it alone?

there are some parts that used your story and Dohan Construction as an inspiration.

01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:03,066
Remember Jo Seok Joon from yesterday? From Green Apartments.

803
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,326
We have to go right now and stop him.

804
01:00:05,326 --> 01:00:07,716
But I'm kind of far away right now.

805
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:09,386
I wasn't sure, so I reported it to the police already.

806
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:11,346
What are you talking about?

807
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:16,466
He called me just now and said he talked to Attorney Kim this evening.

808
01:00:16,466 --> 01:00:17,706
Taxi! Taxi!

809
01:00:17,706 --> 01:00:20,426
He's standing on the rooftop.

810
01:00:21,706 --> 01:00:24,406
Come on, pick up the phone!

811
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:27,996
Gosh, seriously.

812
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,066
Yeah, what?

813
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:38,946
Oh, no!

814
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:44,006
Kim Yoo Ri, tell me exactly what you told him.

815
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:51,056
Because he complained so much, the people above him rented another place and live there for months now.

816
01:00:51,056 --> 01:00:52,546
But I guess he didn't know about it.

817
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:56,356
I told him that when I suggested that he files a lawsuit against the construction company.

818
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:58,336
Maybe that shocked him.

819
01:00:58,336 --> 01:01:00,476
I'm on my way. So hold him for 10 minutes...

820
01:01:00,476 --> 01:01:02,886
No, for five minutes.

821
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:06,546
Please. Please come down and let's talk.

822
01:01:06,546 --> 01:01:09,486
- Please calm down.
- Hello...

823
01:01:11,086 --> 01:01:12,366
Do you know him?

824
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:14,176
He's my hyungnim. Hyungnim.

825
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:18,036
Hyungnim! You remember me, right?

826
01:01:18,036 --> 01:01:20,336
Whoa, step back!

827
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:26,516
The attorney suggested another way to you. Why are you doing this?

828
01:01:28,586 --> 01:01:31,106
It's all useless.

829
01:01:31,106 --> 01:01:34,026
It's all pointless, anyway.

830
01:01:34,026 --> 01:01:35,226
Why?

831
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:39,076
Because you thought the people above you were the crazies but it turns out you're the crazy one.

832
01:01:39,076 --> 01:01:40,566
So, you just want to die now?

833
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:42,566
What are you doing? Are you really his family?

834
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:45,706
If not, are you going to jump off

835
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,796
and take revenge on all the residents

836
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:50,606
- who live here?
- Hey, you!

837
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,936
"March 17, 11:12 a.m. Piano practice.

838
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:07,906
12:39 p.m. Sound of meal prepping.

839
01:02:07,906 --> 01:02:10,166
March 18, 1:20 a.m.

840
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,076
Sound of TV. Don't know where it's coming from.

841
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:14,296
March 19, 4:12 a.m.

842
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:16,766
The sound of a ball rolling. Don't know where it's from."

843
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,586
You wrote it all down meticulously.

844
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:28,926
You have been piling up your anger

845
01:02:28,926 --> 01:02:30,686
and you don't know where you should blow up at.

846
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:32,486
You're so frustrated that it's driving you crazy, right?

847
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:34,166
But you're aiming at the wrong direction.

848
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:36,416
That's not the right direction! You've got it all wrong!

849
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:39,576
What do you know about me?

850
01:02:39,576 --> 01:02:42,726
Do you even know what kind of pain I went through?

851
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,656
No one knows!

852
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:47,456
No one knows, I said!

853
01:02:51,786 --> 01:02:55,466
Just because no one knows about it, do you think you can just let it out anywhere?

854
01:02:56,706 --> 01:03:00,826
When you're facing misfortune, you need to stay alert

855
01:03:00,826 --> 01:03:04,786
and find the right direction to let out your anger!

856
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:08,336
Don't let it out on the wrong places! That's cowardly!

857
01:03:09,546 --> 01:03:12,716
When you experience misfortune, you'll be furious at the world.

858
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:16,536
But you have to make it clear who you're furious at, especially at times like that.

859
01:03:21,026 --> 01:03:25,516
Attorney Kim found the culprit for you.

860
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:27,606
So, let's fight together.

861
01:03:27,606 --> 01:03:30,006
Not by yourself!

862
01:03:33,436 --> 01:03:35,306
Here.

863
01:03:35,306 --> 01:03:37,486
We'll win this one for you.

864
01:03:38,556 --> 01:03:41,986
Get compensated for the pain you went through all this time

865
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:46,036
and furthermore, we'll make sure those a**holes

866
01:03:46,036 --> 01:03:49,356
will never build another apartment like this again!

867
01:03:54,646 --> 01:04:01,196
So please...hold my hand. Please?

868
01:04:26,026 --> 01:04:28,026
He got him!

You're actually going to sue Dohan Construction, right?

894
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:05,686
You'll lose, 100%!

895
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:10,596
Then, give me another idea that could take care of this problem.

896
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:12,696
Why are there so many people trying to screw me over?

897
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,256
The fact that videos like this are online means...

898
01:07:15,256 --> 01:07:16,756
We can move on to the next stage, right?

899
01:07:16,756 --> 01:07:18,456
- Proceed!
- Great!

Wow! I feel so great!
