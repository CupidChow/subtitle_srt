1
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:31,337
   

2
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:36,980
How is Yoo Ri... as a girlfriend?

3
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,680


4
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,127
♫  I guess I recognize your laughter  ♫

5
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:54,717
♫  She's waking me up with that pretty smile  ♫

6
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:57,467
 Well, first of all, 

7
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,837
 she's pretty. 

8
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:01,937
 She's extremely pretty and... 

9
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:04,700
 really pretty. 

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,820
♫  Would you know about this?  ♫

11
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:12,897
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

12
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:18,077
What are you doing? It tickles!

13
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,817
What were you doing? 
♫  I'm in love with you  ♫

14
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,117
I was just...

15
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,597
A written agreement?

16
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:27,197
It's not anything important, but

17
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:31,797
you mentioned last night that there was nothing  that requires more accurate communication.
    

18
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:37,797
So I wrote this up for a mutually healthy and satisfactory sex life for both parties.

19
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:44,467
"Article 1, Contraception."

20
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,000
"Regardless of A's contraceptive status or menstrual cycle,"

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,357
"B must always use a condom."

22
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:52,717
"B is given the right to choose the type of condom used."

23
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,257
 But she's crazy. 

24
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,817
 Crazy, I tell you. 

25
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,177
Everything she does goes beyond common sense and expectations.

26
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:04,797
But... that's also...

27
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:07,483
what makes Yoo Ri so attractive.

28
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,954
"A and B must both make an effort to please each other"

29
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:14,994
"and must not hide or add anything regarding one's orgasm."

30
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:17,314
"Instead, they must be honest with each other–"

31
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:18,344
Are you listening to me?

32
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,914
I'm...

33
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:22,694
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:24,914
Suddenly? About what?

35
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,154
When you first came into my building for your cafe,

36
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:29,934
I wrote out 125 articles for the lease, and I think you're doing this because of that.

37
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:32,924
- Well, so... 
 - Am I the type to hold a grudge like that?

38
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,574
It's not that.

39
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:40,224
I really do want to have mutually healthy and satisfactory sex—

40
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,707
Please.

41
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:45,234
What is this...

42
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:47,504
Are you uncomfortable with my usage of accurate terminology?

43
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:49,464
Who was the one who kept emphasizing last night that the more sensitive the content

44
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:54,011
the more important it was to express it accurately and clearly?

45
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:56,167
Me. That was me.

46
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,874
I was wrong. I was wrong.

47
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,854
What's with this reaction...

48
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:03,384
We still have a lot to discuss.

49
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:11,304
But Yoo Ri... is it necessary for us to go so far in discussing every detail like this?

50
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:16,304
Seriously, I'm doing this so we can be happy together for a long time.

51
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:19,014
I want to speak openly with you about everything

52
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:22,084
and not have even the smallest of misunderstandings.

53
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:27,424
You're right.

54
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:34,454
Then I guess I'll have to... scan more carefully again.

55
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:38,044
There are a few more things to add as well.

56
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:43,854
What kind of boyfriend is Jeong Ho?

57
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:49,664
Compared to my expectations, he's... much more...

58
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:53,274
♫  Love must be coming my way  ♫

59
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:57,624
♫  I guess my heart keeps searching for you  ♫

60
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:00,044
passionate...

61
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:06,164
♫  When I think about you  ♫

62
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:11,084
 and to the point where I wonder why I wasn't able to catch on how he felt about me all this time, 

63
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:14,564
he's warm.

64
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:17,694
♫  Even if it rains  ♫

65
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:20,194
♫  Even when the cold wind blows  ♫

66
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:20,990
Wait, wait.

67
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,340
♫  You are the one for me always  ♫

68
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:30,994
It became warped!

69
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:32,634
They're totally putting on a show again.

70
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,714
What a mess.

71
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,024
Geez, should I really quit?

72
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:38,114
They need to know when enough is enough.

73
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:41,104
- They're totally... 
 - Yeah, right, right.

74
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,334
What are they doing?

75
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,474
There are customers here!

76
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:57,954
Boss! A package arrived!

77
00:04:57,954 --> 00:04:59,894
Oh! Hey!

78
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:00,914
No, no, no!

79
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,784
- You can't! 
 - Why, why, why?

80
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:04,474
- Sit down. 
 - The delivery...

81
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:06,614
Later! Not now.

82
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:09,494
How long will you just watch and not do anything?

83
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:12,484
What would I do about it?

84
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:17,714
Wait, wait. Wow...

85
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,484
Try the spicy stir-fried pork.

86
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:21,314
I made it, so the flavor is not too strong.

87
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:23,364
And the jangjorim* too. 
  (Beef boiled down in soy sauce) 

88
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,064
Try the egg in it first.

89
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,364
You shouldn't consume only fats,

90
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:30,834
you also need to eat protein. So eat quail eggs.

91
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,854
Eat up, eat up.

92
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,934
No, I'm okay!

93
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:04,424
"To the recently passionate couple,"

94
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:09,244
"Landlord and Attorney lady."

95
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,004
"We did not want to have to resort to this,"

96
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,844
"but because watching you guys makes others feel uncomfortable"

97
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,394
"and feel embarrassed on your behalf,"

98
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,454
"and become extremely"

99
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:22,674
"lonely,"

100
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:25,424
"when there are others around,"

101
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:29,974
"we request that you refrain from excess public displays of affection."

102
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,184
- I agree! 
 - "Sincerely, all the members of the Eun Ha Building family."

103
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:36,724
Wait, wait.

104
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:38,674
What's the standard for excessive PDA?

105
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,174
You need to be clear about that.

106
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:43,384
H-How... did you all know about this?

107
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:47,824
Only you and Hyungnim didn't know, but every one of us has known about it.

108
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,074
We were hiding it thoroughly, though...

109
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:51,514
You couldn't hide it at all.

110
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:53,274
Wow. Did you think you were hiding it?

111
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,484
That makes me even more angry.

112
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:55,964
Come on, people.

113
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,904
You can't wait for a short moment of sweetness between us?

114
00:06:57,904 --> 00:07:00,464
If you guys like each other, then just be happy together.

115
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,564
Why are you making us feel lonely, too?

116
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:05,714
In any case, I hope that you two would

117
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:11,094
please listen to our requests.

118
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:13,634
Let's eat! Eat up.

119
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,284
But seriously, how did everyone find out?

120
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:21,474
Why is that important?

121
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,980
Get away from me. They said not to stick together so much.

122
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,120
Ignore them.

123
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,760
I can't stay away from you anymore.

124
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,830
Isn't that Yi Seul down there?

125
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,160
Did you come here by yourself at this hour?

126
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,260
Without your mom?

127
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,393
I have something to tell you secretly without my mom knowing.

128
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:04,473
What's that?

129
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,980
I think my mom is... going to die.

130
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,610
What do you mean by that, Yi Seul?

131
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,800
Why would your mom die?

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,897
My mom is...

133
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,150
sick.

134
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,900
Every day, she throws up and every day, she says her stomach hurts.

135
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,230
We went to the hospital,

136
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,950
but even the doctor said he didn't know why she's like that.

137
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,030
 Every night, so that I won't find out, 

138
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,830
 she hides alone and cries. 

139
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,930
If my mom dies too,

140
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,600
then... Yi Seul needs to live by herself.

141
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,960
No, Yi Seul.

142
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,530
Why would your mom die?

143
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,590
It's not true.

144
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,840
Aigoo... You must have been so upset.

145
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,570
Unni will talk with your mom

146
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,960
and find out how she's sick

147
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,150
and how Unni can help her.

148
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,450
So Yi Seul, don't you worry about a thing.

149
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,270
Okay?

150
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,330
Yi Seul!

151
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,030
Kang Yi Seul!

152
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,420
   

153
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,510
Hello?

154
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,420
Yi Seul! Yi Seul!

155
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,780
Kang Yi Seul! Who told you to go out like that without telling mommy?

156
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,940
Huh?

157
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,140
Why are you doing this?

158
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,680
Why would you make mommy worried like this?

159
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,120
Song Hwa, it's not that.

160
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,030
- We... 
 - Why are you crying, as if you did something right!

161
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,770
Please stop.

162
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,820
You're going to regret this later.

163
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,480
Yi Seul, it's okay. Don't cry.

164
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,990
Mommy was just very frightened.

165
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,450
It's okay.

166
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,300
Song Hwa, you were probably really frightened.

167
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,920
We should have given you a call immediately...

168
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,690
We are sorry.

169
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,910
No...

170
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,590
I am sorry.

171
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,900
I didn't know Yi Seul would come here by herself like this...

172
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,500
 Yi Seul seems to be very worried about her mom. 

173
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,790
 She came here saying she thought her mom was sick and started crying. 

174
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,940
 If you're dealing with a difficult issue, please consult with me, Song Hwa. 

175
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,570
♫  Please don't cry any more  ♫

176
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,790
♫  Don't smile at me  ♫

177
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,800
♫  Stop your footsteps  ♫

178
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,820
♫  In this dark road  ♫

179
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,910
♫  Don't get hurt  ♫

180
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,480
♫  And stop fading more and more  ♫

181
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,280
♫  Like the warm sunlight  ♫

182
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,367
   

183
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:08,870
   

184
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,130
   

185
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Eun Kang?

186
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,400
I'm thinking of not taking any more customers for the day

187
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,030
and closing up the cafe early.

188
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,440
Okay.

189
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,930
I'm sorry...

190
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm sorry, Attorney.

191
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,020
There's no need for you to apologize.

192
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,930
Let's do this slowly.

193
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,890
Take your time.

194
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,050
I think it started...

195
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,761
about a year ago.

196
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:49,450
   

197
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,840
   

198
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,830
 At first, he started touching my shoulders 

199
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,340
 and my back. 

200
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,070
 Then my ears, 

201
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,440
 my neck, 

202
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,110
 my arms, 

203
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,670
my breasts and my butt.

204
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,270
He would sometimes reach inside my skirt.

205
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,060
But I got that job after a long, difficult process.

206
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,590
Next year, I have to send Yi Seul to school...

207
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,780
It's okay, Song Hwa.

208
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,300
I just endured it.

209
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,420
Attorney, I held it all in.

210
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,940
I'm so ashamed about that, but

211
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,420
I couldn't do anything else but bear it.

212
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,490
Then, last week,

213
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,210
he said that there was a file that he needed to review in a rush, so I went.

214
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,740
 Mi Young, Mi Young, Mi Young, Mi Young, Mi Young! 

215
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,490
 Hurry, hurry. 

216
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,950
 Just a little bit! 

217
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,440
 Secretary Choi is here! 

218
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,840
 Come here, come here, come here. 

219
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,910
 Come here. 

220
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,600
 See. 

221
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,820
 I was right! 

222
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,820
 I told you Secretary Choi is pretty! 

223
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,330
 Please. A face like that is common in Apgujeong! 

224
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,950
 That old man's taste is so... 

225
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,440
 What are you saying! 

226
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,640
 It's because you haven't seen her naked. 

227
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,350
 Assemblyman! I will be on my way. 

228
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,950
 Where do you think this is! Sit down! 

229
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,333
 Come on, stay still. 

230
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,710
 Why are you doing this, Assemblyman! 

231
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,700
 Assemblyman! 

232
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,960
 Ow, my nose. My nose. 

233
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,530
 My nose. It hurts. 

234
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,140
 But you... 

235
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,350
 How dare you! 

236
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,210
 Assemblyman, you're too... 

237
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,960
 Control yourself a bit more, Assemblyman. 

238
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,070
 The people there were... just laughing at me. 

239
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,240
I was so embarrassed...

240
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,570
that I wanted to keep it buried deep down until the day I die, but

241
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,360
no matter how much I try to bury it,

242
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,700
it doesn't seem to work, Attorney Kim.

243
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,490
Even when I'm at home,

244
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,490
I can smell his cologne, so I keep gagging.

245
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,480
And I'm afraid that Yi Seul would take after me

246
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,910
and live like a fool holding everything in...

247
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,366
Song Hwa.

248
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:05,486
By any chance, do you have any evidence apart from your testimony?

249
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,653
What about those people who were at the villa?

250
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,433
Was there anyone there you could identify?

251
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,903
You would find... those people if you looked up the news.

252
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:29,943
   

253
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:32,423
   

254
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,343
   

255
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:50,873
   

256
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:58,123
   

257
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:11,533
 You would find all those people if you looked up the news. 

258
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:15,273
 Chief Prosecutor Park Joo Tae of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office. 

259
00:18:15,273 --> 00:18:18,643
 Kwon Jae Shin, president of the Seodong Daily News. 

260
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:24,843
 - Dohan Construction's CEO Lee Pyeon Woong. 
 - Come on now... 

261
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,467
Why are you torturing your innocent hands?

262
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:39,253
No matter how you look at it, it's not an easy situation.

263
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:41,763
As much as I'd love to sue them and put them in prison,

264
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:44,913
your story would not only be made public if you sued them,

265
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:46,573
but you would have to testify until you get sick and tired

266
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,323
whether it be to the police or in the courts,

267
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:50,773
and they will surely threaten you as well.

268
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:54,413
They may try to use the media to frame you as a gold digger.

269
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:56,693
And most importantly,

270
00:18:56,693 --> 00:19:01,513
Yi Seul will be watching this whole process.

271
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:14,090
Despite that, if you decide to still proceed with this, Song Hwa,

272
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,953
I will do my absolute best to help you.

273
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:19,393
During that entire process,

274
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:22,283
I'll be by your side, Song Hwa.

275
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:27,703
So... please consider this carefully.

276
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:48,503
- No, I can't sleep right now. 
 - Just lie down for now.

277
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:52,883
- Sleep tonight and let's look at it tomorrow. 
 - No...

278
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:54,963
Let's look at it tomorrow.

279
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,407
   

280
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,280
I can't breathe.

281
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,857
Looks tasty.

282
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,972
Thanks for the food!

283
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,432
This case...

284
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:03,032
You know that you're not going up against just Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan, right?

285
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,122
I know.

286
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:07,902
It turns out Lee Pyeon Woong is involved as well.

287
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:10,012
I guess we really have an ill-fated relationship.

288
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:13,372
An incumbent assemblyman,

289
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:15,702
the president of a newspaper company, the chief prosecutor of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office,

290
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,192
and the CEO of a construction company...

291
00:22:17,192 --> 00:22:19,552
Do you know what kind of a group this is?

292
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,632
It's probably a group that Lee Pyeon Woong brought together for lobbying.

293
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,122
It's a group that makes killing someone and

294
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,732
covering it up a piece of cake.

295
00:22:27,732 --> 00:22:32,222
Are you trying to scare me now?

296
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,102
I don't want you to take on this case.

297
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,612
It doesn't have to be you, does it?

298
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,372
I'm trying to do this because I know no one would take this on.

299
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,372
You may not have known this,

300
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,942
but I'm an attorney who specializes in this area.

301
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,292
Yes, Song Hwa.

302
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,822
 The assemblyman is telling me to meet with him. 

303
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:17,512
 What should I do? 

304
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,302
Meet with him.

305
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:23,022
But make sure you record everything.

306
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,062
I'll be nearby.

307
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:31,402
Will you be able to do it?

308
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,182
Yes.

309
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:36,112
I will do it.

310
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:37,772
I can do it.

311
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,462
 It's a pen that's capable of location tracking and recording audio. 

312
00:23:46,462 --> 00:23:49,242
 All you have to do is keep it in your bag. 

313
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,140
What do you mean by a resignation letter?

314
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,552
Do you need a raise?

315
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:59,132
Is that what you're looking for?

316
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,602
It's not anything like that.

317
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:02,122
If it's not that, then what is it?

318
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,732
You're not a young twenty-something-year-old.

319
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:06,782
How much coddling and comforting do I have to do for you?

320
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,432
Try to be more honest with yourself.

321
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:12,772
Even now.

322
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:17,770
Even though you came here completely wrapped up in clothes, not showing any skin,

323
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,722
I can see through it all.

324
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:22,772
For you...

325
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,492
In your eyes there's sensuality there.

326
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:42,372
I mean, you're not even a virgin.

327
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:45,412
Why do you keep backing away?

328
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,682
Assemblyman, by any chance...

329
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:06,902
do you remember what happened at CEO Lee's villa?

330
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,312
I got a bit drunk, so...

331
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,302
Wait.

332
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:19,152
When was that again?

333
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,362
I don't remember any of that.

334
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:23,372
You tried to take off my clothes,

335
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:25,482
and you hit me...

336
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,982
You're saying you don't remember any of that?

337
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,572
What are you talking about now?

338
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:50,982
Oh, have I treated you all this time in such a way

339
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,942
that made you get upset at me

340
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:57,622
to the point of making stuff up, Secretary Choi?

341
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,612
 Song Hwa. 

342
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:36,362
 Are you okay? 

343
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,362
Attorney.

344
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:41,282
I want to do it.

345
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:43,352
The lawsuit...

346
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,042
I want to go through with it.

347
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,652
Have you considered it thoroughly?

348
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:49,702
Son of a b****.

349
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:53,672
That son of a b**** will probably keep living his life without a care.

350
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,742
When I think about how only I will be in anguish for the rest of my life,

351
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,842
it's too unfair.

352
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:06,512
I'm glad you decided to do that.

353
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:09,412
Then I'll submit the complaint immediately.

354
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:11,072
Yes.

355
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:12,952
Then I'll see you later.

356
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,132
Darn it. It was off.

357
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,872
How far did we get up to again?

358
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:23,212
What do you mean, how far did we get up to?

359
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:24,992
You just barged in here on your own,

360
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:26,952
started talking about my swing,

361
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:28,552
and then you just plopped over there to take a call.

362
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:30,182
Gosh! I'm sorry.

363
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,082
You know, I'm just so busy these days.

364
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:35,512
Running a business is definitely not an easy thing.

365
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:37,412
By the way, CEO,

366
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:38,842
last time we met,

367
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:42,872
I ended up finding out what I am to you.

368
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:44,502
What are you to me?

369
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:47,312
I am your last bit of conscience.

370
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,922
Wow, good shot!

371
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:53,392
- Is that what you are to me? 
 - Oh, my!

372
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:54,632
My swing is crazy!

373
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,252
Wow, that's good.

374
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:58,192
Riding that backswing...

375
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:01,172
With that said, CEO,

376
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:04,462
how well do you know Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan?

377
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:08,382
Hey, why would Assemblyman Choi's name come from your lips?

378
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,942
Wait, what's so shocking about a citizen of South Korea

379
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:12,832
mentioning the name of an assemblyman?

380
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,332
Lee Pyeon Woong.

381
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,182
Choi Yeo Hwan?

382
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:20,072
President Kwon Jae Shin of the Seodong Daily News?

383
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:20,812
Well...

384
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:23,952
Chief Prosecutor Park Joo Tae of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office.

385
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,012
Why would these individuals get together?

386
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,982
But why are you suddenly asking for files on Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan?

387
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:34,882
There was just something I wanted to look into recently.

388
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,002
These are just the files from the closed internal investigations on Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan.

389
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:42,492
And if you want to look into President Kwon of the Seodong Daily as well,

390
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:45,362
well, that's going to be a lot.

391
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:47,782
Suspension of prosecution,

392
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:51,982
no charges, non-indictment, did not charge, informal prosecution...

393
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,562
God, South Korea is such a good place to live.

394
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,692
Is it true that Lee Pyeon Woong got to know Choi Yeo Hwan

395
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:01,562
while obtaining authorization for the Palacio Hills Apartment?

396
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:04,182
Yes, Assemblyman Choi was nearing the end of his term then

397
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:05,712
and was preparing for his reelection campaign,

398
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:08,452
so it seems they were able to benefit each other.

399
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,282
 If the fact that these ahjussis got together and played around, 

400
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:16,852
there would be a huge commotion, right?

401
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:18,952
Hey, lower the mic, lower the mic!

402
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:20,632
If you go around talking like that,

403
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:23,132
something really terrible might happen to you!

404
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:24,382
But...

405
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:25,642
you're not, by any chance,

406
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:27,782
involved in this as well, right?

407
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:30,272
Aigoo, seriously! What do you take me for...

408
00:29:30,272 --> 00:29:31,812
If that's not the case, that's a relief.

409
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,502
CEO, instead of going back and forth between two sides,

410
00:29:34,502 --> 00:29:36,412
set your course quickly.

411
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:40,322
I can somewhat understand taking the side of those who have a lot,

412
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,212
but taking the side of crappy people...

413
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,702
makes you look like a loser.

414
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,432
That's true.

415
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:53,562
We have money, and we have a reputation.

416
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,802
D*** that ungrateful b****!

417
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:08,272
Who would have known that she'd be plotting something like that behind my back?

418
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,442
She would dare to sue me?

419
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,262
Hey, hey. Seriously.

420
00:30:12,262 --> 00:30:15,112
Don't worry about it too much.

421
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,462
She only has her testimony.

422
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:20,632
It seemed like she didn't even have any evidence.

423
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:25,632
None of this would have happened if you'd just played around with the girls I introduced you to.

424
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:27,962
Do you think I did that for free?

425
00:30:27,962 --> 00:30:30,622
You know that I have a conscience, CEO Lee.

426
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:33,652
That Secretary Choi. Do you know how considerate I was of her

427
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:36,222
so that she could work comfortably for me?

428
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:39,772
Wait, won't this become a headache if this case blows up?

429
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,942
Why would it ever become a headache?

430
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:43,842
What, "Me Too"?

431
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,702
That trend's already passed. What are you worried about?

432
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:50,612
She was really determined when she came today and recorded everything!

433
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,902
Don't worry!

434
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:54,672
It's me you're talking about.

435
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:58,472
I've already taken care of it.

436
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:01,332
Thank you.

437
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:03,842
Please enjoy.

438
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,232
Hello.

439
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,732
Boss!

440
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:43,382
I'll go with you.

441
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:44,862
Making sure I get home?

442
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:48,942
Yes. Hyungnim said he had to go somewhere tonight.

443
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:57,842
But did you two argue?

444
00:31:57,842 --> 00:32:00,452
What do you mean, argue?

445
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:03,052
Rather than an argument...

446
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:05,082
 I don't want you to take on this case. 

447
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:08,362
 It doesn't have to be you, does it? 

448
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,892
We just have different opinions.

449
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:21,912
Oh, hey! Hey!

450
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:23,262
Hey!

451
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:24,682
Hey...

452
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:26,352
Hey...

453
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:28,922
Boss!

454
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:32,772
Boss, are you okay?

455
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:34,782
Seoul Gangcheon Ra 1907.

456
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:35,582
What?

457
00:32:35,582 --> 00:32:37,682
Hurry up and report the license plate to the police.

458
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,932
Oh, okay, okay.

459
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,882
Are you all right?

460
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,182
I'm okay.

461
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:49,812
Okay, got it.

462
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:53,442
They did catch him, but he insists he didn't see a recording of any kind.

463
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:54,732
That doesn't make sense.

464
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:56,892
That's why he took it, no matter how you look at it.

465
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,362
Don't worry. I'll beat it out of him.

466
00:32:58,362 --> 00:32:59,722
What do you mean beat it out of him?

467
00:32:59,722 --> 00:33:01,552
You go home. It's your day off today.

468
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:04,882
How can I go home when you got your purse stolen?

469
00:33:05,502 --> 00:33:07,392
Kim Yoo Ri!

470
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:24,982
Do you still want to go ahead with it after going through something like this?

471
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:26,142
Something like what?

472
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:27,692
I should do what I need to do even if I go through it a hundred times.

473
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:31,142
Besides Choi Song Hwa's statements, do you have any other witnesses or evidence?

474
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,572
What is it you want to say?

475
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:34,312
The frame of the story could turn around on you in a moment.

476
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,102
They have the press and the prosecution all on their side.

477
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:38,102
- How could we— 
 - Among Song Hwa's colleagues,

478
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:40,402
I'll see if there are any witnesses or similar victims.

479
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:42,042
I'll also see if there is other corruption.

480
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:45,022
I'll find evidence to prove that he's not a moral person.

481
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:47,782
But it doesn't have to be you.

482
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:48,882
Are you saying that again?

483
00:33:48,882 --> 00:33:53,022
It's so clearly obvious that you and Song Hwa will get hurt.

484
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:55,902
Let me do it instead then.

485
00:33:55,902 --> 00:33:57,672
Why would you?

486
00:33:59,302 --> 00:34:01,662
Do you look down on me?

487
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:03,452
That's not what I'm saying right now.

488
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:04,652
If not, what is it then?

489
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:07,742
What's dangerous for me isn't dangerous for you?

490
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:11,912
I asked you to trust me.

491
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:18,422
It's not because I don't trust you.

492
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,862
It's because I know the reality of things.

493
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:21,952
The reality?

494
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:23,632
The bastard who talks about policies for women

495
00:34:23,632 --> 00:34:25,212
abuses his own power behind the scenes

496
00:34:25,212 --> 00:34:28,442
and has been sexually harassing a single mother for over a year.

497
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,242
Can't you see that?

498
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:34,412
"Article 10 of the Act on Special Cases concerning the Punishment of Sexual Violence Crimes."

499
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:36,442
"Molestation using professional power:"

500
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,452
"A person who molests a person whom he supervises or has authority over due to work or employment"

501
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:41,962
"shall be sentenced to up to three years in prison or fined up to 15 million won."

502
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:44,052
Is this so hard?

503
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,042
After having seared a horrific memory

504
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,042
into a person that they can't go to sleep at night

505
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,402
out of humiliation and shame,

506
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:54,452
is it that difficult to even punish him to this extent?

507
00:34:59,862 --> 00:35:02,442
I'm just afraid that you'll get hurt.

508
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:04,042
I'm the one who'll get hurt if anything were to happen.

509
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:07,022
So mind your own business if you're not going to help me.

510
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:23,892
How could that happen?

511
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:25,372
Eun Kang really said that?

512
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:26,442
Yes! That's what he said yesterday.

513
00:35:26,442 --> 00:35:28,262
What's so funny?

514
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:30,532
Hey, Jeong Ho...

515
00:35:35,822 --> 00:35:37,842
Did you guys fight?

516
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:40,602
Why would we fight...

517
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:42,182
I came here first!

518
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:45,552
Hey, a person should leave first, and then you come in. Didn't you even learn that?

519
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:47,282
Is this a subway? That you have to leave before I go in?

520
00:35:47,282 --> 00:35:48,972
- Whatever. I'm in a hurry. 
 - I'm in a hurry, too!

521
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,672
Whoa! Are you trying to use brute force?

522
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:52,202
- I'll get hurt. 
 - I'm in a rush, too.

523
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:53,722
This is intimidation.

524
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:55,302
- It's good. 
 - Is it good?

525
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:57,852
Hyung, how is mine? Is it good?

526
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:00,602
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri.

527
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:02,192
How much longer will you keep this up?

528
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:03,572
What did I do?

529
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:04,662
Were you always this childish?

530
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,062
Yeah! I've always been this childish.

531
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:07,902
Didn't you know?

532
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:13,702
Geez! So frustrating!

533
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,992
Who eats cutlassfish like that?

534
00:36:27,672 --> 00:36:29,612
You should take out the bones around the fins

535
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:32,662
and pull the meat centered around the spine and eat it like a steak.

536
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:33,642
That's how you can pull the most meat out of it.

537
00:36:33,642 --> 00:36:37,062
Hey, must I listen to your meddling while eating cutlassfish?

538
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,232
I can do it, too.

539
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:39,572
I can take the meat off of the bones.

540
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,512
Is this only about you?

541
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,812
Is this cutlassfish just for you?

542
00:36:41,812 --> 00:36:44,512
It's for everyone here.

543
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:01,509
"A second manifesto!"

544
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:06,500
We will withdraw our request from last time"

545
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,839
"for you two to refrain from excessive PDA."

546
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:12,789
"Please stop yelling and slandering each other"

547
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:15,939
"and we sincerely request that you do not create an atmosphere of tension"

548
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:19,319
"within and around this building."

549
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:22,509
"Keep your lovers' quarrels between the two of you."

550
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:24,149
"Okay?"

551
00:37:24,149 --> 00:37:25,159
"That'll be all!"

552
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,369
"Sincerely, all the members of the Eun Ha Building family,"

553
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,029
Yeah!

554
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:52,949
♫  Gently putting my hand on your small hunched shoulders from behind you  ♫

555
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:55,169
Talk to me for a minute.

556
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:57,519
"It's a fight you can't win."

557
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,689
"You guys will get hurt while fighting."

558
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:02,059
"That's the reality."

559
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:03,819
All of these things

560
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:09,019
are what my mom and I heard from the lawyers when we tried to clear my dad's name.

561
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:12,169
Kim Jeong Ho, everything you say is correct.

562
00:38:12,169 --> 00:38:13,609
I know you're right, but

563
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:16,719
♫  This too shall pass  ♫

564
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,669
I really hate saying this, Jeong Ho.

565
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:22,729
♫  Let's breathe deeply and cry it out  ♫

566
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:24,249
I hate it.

567
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:26,579
♫  Let's breathe deeply and cry it out  ♫

568
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,489
I don't know why you studied law,

569
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:36,219
but the reason I pushed and shoved words into my head until I felt like puking

570
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:38,839
was all for moments like this.

571
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:45,400
♫  I am sorry for not knowing about it for so long  ♫

572
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,210
♫  If some time passes by  ♫

573
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:52,239
So can't you just cheer me on?

574
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,329
♫  Be brave and just like you did before  ♫

575
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:02,500
♫  Look at me and smile  ♫

576
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:09,009
 Kim Jeong Ho, everything you say is correct. 

577
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,269
 I know you're right, but 

578
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:15,259
 I really hate saying this, Jeong Ho. 

579
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:26,599
Son.

580
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,579
Stop thinking and just come in.

581
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,849
It's been 30 minutes already.

582
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:02,699
You peel them, Honey.

583
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:07,899
So what brings you all the way here, Son?

584
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,359
I came here because I just can't find the answer.

585
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:18,739
You can't just say that without an explanation.

586
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:31,799
He has sexually harassed his secretary for over a year.

587
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:34,079
The perpetrator is an incumbent assemblyman

588
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,919
And the witnesses and the parties involved are not easy pushovers.

589
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,289
   

590
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:44,089
Since he has personal connections with the prosecution,

591
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:45,939
I couldn't figure out what to do,

592
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:49,519
or find a gap in his defense to squeeze through.

593
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,789
I really hated to, but you're the only person I could get any advice from.

594
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:58,909
You're trying to pursue a difficult task.

595
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:02,729
The reason these people are still protecting each other

596
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:05,789
means that they still have something to gain from each other.

597
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:10,109
They'll split faster than anyone if there is any type of loss.

598
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:13,249
However, with just this much evidence,

599
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:16,559
I don't think it will be easy to break them down.

600
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,179
You're not even a prosecutor anymore.

601
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,349
Why are you trying to pursue this?

602
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:29,379
It's obvious.

603
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,309
You're in love with a good person.

604
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:36,589
That's why you have a chance to fight for a good cause, Jeong Ho.

605
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,759
They're not the only ones with connections.

606
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:58,359
I have connections, too.

607
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:01,489
So what does he do that we came all the way here?

608
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,709
He was born as a son of a locksmith.

609
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:24,969
 I hear he was very good with his hands, even as a child. 

610
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,429
 There were no doors he couldn't unlock at age six. 

611
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:35,129
 He spent his teenage years stealing bikes and robbing empty houses. 

612
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:38,569
The legendary safecracker who broke

613
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:42,709
into the Blue House and even a Las Vegas casino.

614
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,929
You even defended a jerk like that?

615
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:49,959
He cracked into the safe and always donated 11% of what he stole.

616
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:52,279
He had his own rules he abided by.

617
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:14,689
What the?

618
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:17,239
What are you doing here, Attorney?

619
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:21,469
By chance, waiting for me?

620
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:25,519
As expected, did you decide to consider my love confession?

621
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,889
I told you.

622
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:30,959
I can't look after a man who goes in and out of prison.

623
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:37,779
I could open everything, but

624
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:40,669
I guess I couldn't open your heart, Attorney.

625
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:44,029
Get in.

626
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,290
   

627
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,859
Thank you, Baby.

628
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:55,999
So rude...

629
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:01,459
So...

630
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:02,859
that...

631
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:05,889
problematic recorder...

632
00:44:05,889 --> 00:44:08,339
That pen...

633
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:11,369
is inside CEO Lee Pyeon Woong's suite?

634
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:12,969
That's what the location tracker says.

635
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:14,839
Then, I guess...

636
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,029
he must've put it in a safe or something.

637
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,529
Yes. That's why we looked for you, Geum Moon.

638
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:23,439
For you, my Attorney Kim...

639
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:25,589
I'll open it. I'll open everything.

640
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:27,559
Everything. Perfectly.

641
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:28,979
I give my all.

642
00:44:28,979 --> 00:44:30,019
Whoa. Wait, wait.

643
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:35,289
Wait. Then do you mean to steal it back again?

644
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:36,849
Is that okay?

645
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,999
They broke the rule to our faces.

646
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:41,539
We can't just sit back and play it fair.

647
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:44,249
They have the press and prosecution on their side.

648
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:47,319
No matter what, we cannot win by following the rules.

649
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:49,639
That's my conclusion.

650
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,589
Here's why Song Hwa's case is particularly difficult. First of all, 
    

651
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:06,989
apart from Song Hwa's testimony, there is still no other evidence.

652
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:11,389
The files you have are the information on Assemblyman Choi's aides.

653
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:14,049
We're trying to locate other victims who had a similar experience.

654
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:15,189
Second,

655
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:18,639
these four people who were at the villa that night.

656
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,339
Why these influential individuals from the political, legal, and media world

657
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:24,329
gathered together to hang out, we don't know. However—

658
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:27,689
It's a cartel that came together under Lee Pyeon Woong's leadership two years ago

659
00:45:27,689 --> 00:45:30,679
to prevent the passing of the Serious Disasters Act in the National Assembly.

660
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,889
However, the Serious Disasters Act was eventually passed.

661
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:41,159
Although Lee Pyeon Woong gave away golf course memberships and multi-billion won worth of sales rights,

662
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:43,639
he hasn't gained anything from it.

663
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:51,729
Under the circumstances, how far

664
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:54,379
will they go and try to cover up for Assemblyman Choi?

665
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:55,619
That's the core issue.

666
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,529
If they do try to protect him,

667
00:45:57,529 --> 00:45:59,309
apart from winning or losing,

668
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:01,199
we'll see too much blood.

669
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,319
Everyone who's here knows that there'll be blood.

670
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,829
Even if we do,

671
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:11,019
we must try to minimize getting hurt.

672
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,069
Let's aim for that as our target.

673
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:16,919
So who's that gentleman?

674
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:19,399
Oh, the boss's lover.

675
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:21,469
Although they're fighting at the moment.

676
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:22,509
Why?

677
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:26,349
Assemblyman Choi will hold a fundraising event for women soon.

678
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:29,989
And he plans to give a speech there himself.

679
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,739
So?

680
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:35,789
If Song Hwa is okay with it,

681
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:38,109
I think we should aim for that day.

682
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:00,139
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

683
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:04,709
I was bad for not knowing what I needed to do for you.

684
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:11,189
♫  My heart must keep looking for you  ♫

685
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:16,329
So, don't give up. 
 ♫  When I think of you  ♫

686
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:20,709
Do everything you want to do. 
 ♫  the spring which resembles you  ♫

687
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:22,179
Whether it's a good thing,
♫  comes into my heart  ♫

688
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:25,609
the right thing, dangerous thing, or whatever it may be,

689
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,649
I'll always be by your side.
♫  even in the heavy rain  ♫

690
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:29,849
What in the world?

691
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:35,769
Is today a special day for only saying things the other person wants to hear?

692
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,829
No.
 ♫  even when the strong wind blows  ♫

693
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,469
It's the answer I've found. 
♫  for me it's always you  ♫

694
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:42,939
♫  with you filling my arms  ♫

695
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:45,829
All I need is you but for you,

696
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,359
even without me,

697
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,749
you need to correct the wrong. You're a big person like that.

698
00:47:50,749 --> 00:47:52,759
I realized that's why I love you.

699
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:56,569
♫  with you filling my arms  ♫

700
00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:00,309
So when I try to trap someone like that only inside me, of course, it won't work.

701
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,069
So I've made up my mind.

702
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:06,849
I'll just become like you.

703
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,549
A moth who is discerning...

704
00:48:11,549 --> 00:48:14,479
and could take advice...

705
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:16,909
Not anyone could do that.

706
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:20,479
Will you be okay with that?

707
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,889
♫  On your lips I'll place a kiss full of love  ♫

708
00:48:23,889 --> 00:48:26,549
♫  Because it's my love for you  ♫

709
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:27,989
♫  Despite the heavy rain  ♫

710
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,699
I'll try.

711
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:32,689
♫  Even when the wind blows  ♫

712
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:36,079
♫   for me it's always you  ♫

713
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:42,349
D*** it! That f***ing bastard!

714
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:44,449
Come on!

715
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:48,589
You should've said so sooner if something like that was going on.

716
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,679
You'll soon get to find out, anyway.

717
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:52,199
So I'm letting you know in advance.

718
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,899
Bastards like that need to be stripped naked

719
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:59,559
and be hung on an intersection in Gwanghwamun to dry and die.

720
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:02,869
Come on, Landlord!

721
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,179
You two should stop fighting and take care of this problem first, no?

722
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:08,129
That's right.

723
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:11,629
Speaking of which, we do have a plan.

724
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:14,239
- What's your plan? 
 - What?

725
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,439
What is it, please?

726
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:35,339
This is Honey Bee.

727
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,329
The serpent has climbed over the wall.

728
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:39,249
Please come in.

729
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,179
We're checking into the suite we have reserved.

730
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:11,119
Okay, I'll help you, Sir.

731
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,199
It's the room with the window facing the Han River, right?

732
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:15,929
I mean, my honey...

733
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,559
lacks water, according to a Wu Xing assessment,

734
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,739
so he always needs to sleep with his head facing the water.

735
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,199
We left our key in the room.

736
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,969
Could you please come up and open it with your master key?

737
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:32,659
Okay.

738
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:39,859
It's that room, isn't it?

739
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,889
But that Jahm Gin Moon* or Jahm Geum Moon guy... 
  (Locked door) 

740
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:45,879
- Who is he, anyway? 
 - I told you.

741
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,099
He was born a locksmith's son—

742
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,629
Not that! Why does he keep hitting on you?

743
00:50:50,629 --> 00:50:51,989
He studied in Las Vegas.

744
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:54,639
Where could you possibly study in Las Vegas?

745
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,949
Also, you think if every American acts like that to anyone they see—

746
00:50:57,949 --> 00:50:59,469
Hello, Sir.

747
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:03,889
I mean, my honey left his card key in the room.

748
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:05,779
Gosh, he's such a klutz!

749
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:08,159
My mistake.

750
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,199
Sorry for bothering you with this.

751
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:12,679
It's okay. No problem.

752
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:20,029
Oh, my, honey! It opened.

753
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:22,099
Have a good day.

754
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:23,549
Thank you.

755
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,819
Courteous service and safety.

756
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:38,959
Good day.

757
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:47,079
My heart is about to burst.

758
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:49,699
Oh, right...

759
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:52,059
Is it here?

760
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:53,609
- Over here? 
 - Here.

761
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:57,229
 But the problem is that there are guys who are always standing by the door. 

762
00:51:57,229 --> 00:51:59,069
Get on my back.

763
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,989
 Can't we just hit the vital points and knock them out?  

764
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:03,109
 Like this! 

765
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:07,179
 They'd be the ones to hit our vital points, not us. 

766
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:09,299
 Action movies tend to show whatever they want to show 

767
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:11,539
 but knocking them out like that is 

768
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:14,339
 considered crimes of assault and battery and bodily harm. 

769
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:18,499
 Then how about we put something in a beverage and give it to them? 

770
00:52:19,149 --> 00:52:22,779
 Well, considering that the physical force of the other person's body was exercised, 

771
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:23,699
 it would still be basic assault. 

772
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:25,759
 Come on, if we're already committing burglary and special larceny, 

773
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:26,989
 we're all accomplices here. 

774
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:28,469
 Wouldn't mean much anyway. 

775
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:31,209
 What I'm saying is even if we commit a crime, 

776
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:34,369
 we should go with the lightest punishment. 

777
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:37,759
 Why are you making it so difficult? 

778
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,089
 I know, right? 

779
00:52:44,479 --> 00:52:47,269
 - What are they doing? 
 - I don't know, either. 

780
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:54,479
Who are you, Oppa?

781
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:57,359
I guess this isn't the right room.

782
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:02,279
Hyungnim, I think we're at the wrong place.

783
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:07,079
Oh, my gosh, Hyungnim!

784
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,559
Are you okay, Ma'am?

785
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,459
Oh, no! What's wrong?

786
00:53:10,459 --> 00:53:12,149
Her breathing...

787
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:13,949
She's not breathing!

788
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:16,749
Hey, Oppa, can you do something for my sister?

789
00:53:16,749 --> 00:53:18,719
If you contact the hotel employees they'll be able to help—

790
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,839
A person is dying here. Why call them?

791
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,409
- Put her on your back. 
 - Hurry. On your back.

792
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:23,789
- Where? What? 
 - Put her on your back.

793
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:25,479
Hey! Your friend is helping us.

794
00:53:25,479 --> 00:53:26,539
Carry her with him.

795
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,079
Hurry, hurry!

796
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,449
- One, two, three! 
 - Oh, my, Hyungnim!

797
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,309
What's going on here?

798
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:36,069
You married off your kids, and now this...

799
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:48,819
Joon, are you guys in?

800
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:51,559
This is Honey Bee. We're in.

801
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:54,459
So how does it look? Could he do it?

802
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,179
Of course.

803
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:01,699
I can open anything if you want, Attorney.

804
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:04,669
Then we'll head on over to the event.

805
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:08,299
Whoa, baby girl.

806
00:54:08,299 --> 00:54:09,829
"Baby girl"?

807
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,279
Hey! Hwe Jeon Moon*, Hwe Jeon Moon! 
  (Rotating Door) 

808
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:14,169
Let's open it.

809
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:17,789
How dare he calls her "baby"?

810
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:19,769
Why do you like it?

811
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:28,889
   

812
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:35,919
What in the world?

813
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:44,349
It's Song Hwa.

814
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,679
Oh, wow! What in the world?

815
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,209
You're dazzling!

816
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:07,239
I see the light radiating from somewhere...

817
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,109
It's you again, Attorney Kim.

818
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,869
Bravo!

819
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:17,589
I was wondering where the stench was coming from.

820
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:20,079
It was you again.

821
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,259
Nephew.

822
00:55:21,259 --> 00:55:23,769
With so many people around,

823
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:27,569
you shouldn't behave so rudely like that to your elder.

824
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:29,349
Are we in a position to talk about who's older and younger?

825
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:34,329
Last time, I requested a truce so nicely.

826
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:35,339
So how can you do this?

827
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:38,669
You shouldn't have lived such a low life if you don't like it.

828
00:55:43,379 --> 00:55:46,149
Do you think you can handle it, Attorney Kim?

829
00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:50,849
Whatever she's imagining,

830
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:55,939
she'll get to lose a lot more.

831
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:01,229
Stop with the threats.

832
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:03,209
Get lost.

833
00:56:05,649 --> 00:56:08,399
You guys started it this time around.

834
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:11,509
I warned you.

835
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:14,139
All right then.

836
00:56:21,509 --> 00:56:24,919
Don't be intimidated by a threat like that, Ms Song Hwa.

837
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:27,519
I'm not intimidated.

838
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:29,819
I have so many people helping me like this.

839
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,079
I should be courageous.

840
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:35,319
Then shall we go?

841
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:44,089
   

842
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:45,749
Hello.

843
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:49,989
Thank you for coming to this even in your busy schedule.

844
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,599
Let me say my greetings.

845
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,689
I'm Assemblyman Choi Yeo Hwan of the Minguk Party.

846
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,370
   

847
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,659
Seeing so many people attend

848
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:09,429
such a meaningful event as this

849
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:12,979
makes me think that I'm not the only one

850
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:16,779
who's working hard toward gender equality in this country.

851
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:19,689
I'm very comforted by that.

852
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:32,839
Okay...

853
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:37,999
Hey, part-timer.

854
00:57:42,509 --> 00:57:43,919
Yes?

855
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:48,479
You said Assemblyman Choi's people wanted us to play something toward the end of his speech.

856
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:50,249
This?

857
00:57:50,999 --> 00:57:53,299
Well, I can do this.

858
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:56,079
Why don't you two go and grab some coffee?

859
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,439
Should we, then?

860
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:59,299
- Let's go. 
 - Let's.

861
00:57:59,299 --> 00:58:00,929
- You know how to do it, right? 
 - Yes.

862
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:02,889
Rest up.

863
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:16,579
I hope that today's event

864
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:21,189
establishes a base to get rid of disadvantages, inequality, and

865
00:58:21,189 --> 00:58:25,409
unfair treatment that women experience even a little bit.

866
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:27,509
So I would like to chant in unison

867
00:58:27,509 --> 00:58:31,689
what I usually like to say today as well.

868
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:37,769
Girls, be ambitious!

869
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:39,329
Girls, be ambitious.

870
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:42,949
Girls, be ambitious!

871
00:58:55,429 --> 00:59:01,039
 In your eyes there's sensuality there. 

872
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:07,619
 You're not even a virgin. Why do you keep backing away like that? 

873
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,019
 Even now. 

874
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:14,019
 Even though you came here completely wrapped up in clothes, not showing any skin, 

875
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:17,439
 I can see through it all. 

876
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:19,089
 You... 

877
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,339
Turn it off.

878
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:22,669
Turn it off right now!

879
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:28,419
   

880
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:30,539
Hey! Open the door!

881
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:33,719
What are you doing? Open the door! Hey!

882
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:35,449
 Do you need a raise? 

883
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,939
 Is that what you're looking for? 

884
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:49,869
 Excuse me! We would like a word from you. 

885
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:53,869
 He will not give any interviews right now. 

886
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:55,929
 Please make way! 

887
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:07,069
Champagne?

888
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:22,030


889
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:31,150
 In your eyes there's sensuality there. 

890
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,949
 there's sensuality there. 

891
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:38,909
 there's sensuality there. 

892
01:00:41,649 --> 01:00:52,460
♫  I must like you more than anyone else  ♫

893
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,949
♫  I guess I've come to like you  ♫

894
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:59,720
♫  Perhaps it's you for me.  ♫

895
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,350
♫  Today, more than yesterday, it's you.  ♫

896
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,980
♫  I must love you more.  ♫

897
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:10,549
♫  I guess I've come to love you  ♫

898
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:14,359
♫  More than ever  ♫

899
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:19,259
♫  Since when have you been a face which needs explaining?  ♫

900
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:22,009
   

901
01:01:22,009 --> 01:01:24,599
 Go on a blind date? 

902
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:25,879
 It's okay. 

903
01:01:25,879 --> 01:01:27,339
 So are you married then? 

904
01:01:27,339 --> 01:01:29,659
 - You! This guy! 
 - What the? 

905
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:32,409
 - This guy's not all there yet. 
 - Gosh, it's embarrassing! 

906
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:35,939
   
 It will be done traditionally and sincerely. 

907
01:01:36,669 --> 01:01:40,579
 You're not going to be like Do Jin Ki and ask me to marry you out of the blue. 

908
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:41,729
 No! 

909
01:01:41,729 --> 01:01:44,949
 I'm serious about you, but I don't think you feel the same way. 

910
01:01:44,949 --> 01:01:46,949
 I've always felt like I was being chased. 

911
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:49,749
 But when I'm with you, I'm happy. 

912
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:52,499
 You already know that there's no one else for me. 

913
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,200
♫  I guess I've come to like you  ♫
