1
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,789
   

2
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:39,078
The story of how I first fell for Kim Yoo Ri...

3
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:45,526
Everything was easier for me compared to others.

4
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:49,586
Because people were jealous of me, I didn't have many friends.

5
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:52,806
At least not until I met Yoo Ri after transferring schools.

6
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,506
   

7
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:02,316
 - Hey. 
 - Why? Not yet. Can't we just stay seated? 

8
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,486
   

9
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:20,136
 Give it to me. Give it to me! 

10
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:26,166
 It's so loud. 

11
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:29,206
 Hey, Transfer Student, I heard you got all perfect scores. 

12
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:31,626
 Which math academy do you go to? 

13
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:33,516
 I don't. 

14
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:35,396
 - What? 
 - I don't go to one. 

15
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,366
 - Wow! 
 - Wow, daebak! 

16
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,316
 You're amazing! 

17
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:41,776
 Without attending an academy, you took the top rank in the entire school as soon as you transferred? 

18
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,106
 But did you see Kim Yoo Ri's face yesterday? 

19
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,576
 Seeing her face like that was priceless! 

20
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,276
 She was always the top student, and her face was like this when she missed her place. 

21
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:50,626
 Hey, ever since I saw Kim Yoo Ri flaunt, I knew this would happen. 

22
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:52,456
 She's not all that. 

23
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:54,326
 Why? 

24
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:58,166
 Nice, right? 

25
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,736
 Nothing's more satisfying than seeing someone else suffer. 

26
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,496
 But you shouldn't make it too obvious. 

27
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,786
 It makes you look bad. 

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,220


29
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:48,746
 I... 

30
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:52,336
 can't understand why the answer is #5, no matter how I look at it. 

31
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:55,780
 Teach me. 

32
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,590
♫  Every little and small moment
was collected here and became an ocean  ♫

33
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,880
♫  Sometimes it's even turbulent.  ♫

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,376
 So this is... 

35
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:14,636
♫  Even if darkness comes upon us, it won't be dark  ♫

36
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:20,000
♫  I'll be in your arms as we pass through the long night  ♫

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,776
 I think it was from that moment. 

38
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:29,606
♫  They've become vibrant memories  ♫

39
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:34,586
♫  In this moment, everything with you  ♫

40
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:38,876
♫  The sound of the wind brushing your cheeks  ♫

41
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:43,746
 It may have been from this moment as well. 

42
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,696
 - Let's eat tteokbokki. 
 - Okay! 

43
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:47,606
 Hey, we decided to eat tteokbokki. 

44
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:48,986
 Squirrel Snack Bar. 

45
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:52,136
 But their food is spicy! 

46
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:54,996
 Let's get pork lung and dip it in the tteokbokki sauce. 

47
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:57,336
 - Should we also eat ramen? 
 - I'm so hungry. 

48
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,806
 Boiled eggs, Korean blood sausage, and pork lung. 

49
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,436
 Aigoo. 

50
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:04,256
 What shall we do with this poor monk? 

51
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:06,556
 You're trying to go down a hopeless path. 

52
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:09,466
♫  I never thought this before but  ♫

53
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:12,226
 Kim Yoo Ri is really senseless when it comes to these matters. 

54
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:17,266
 She wouldn't understand even if you confessed to her. 

55
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:20,046
 What are you saying? 

56
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:23,266
 Hey, don't worry! This hyung will help you out. 

57
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:28,680
 After all, finding a mate for Kim Yoo Ri has been my responsibility. 

58
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,786
 We're hungry! Hurry up! 

59
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,716
 - Okay! 
 - Okay! 

60
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:36,716
 Let's go! 

61
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:39,016
 Let's go together! 

62
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:42,876
 It's been so long that I don't remember when. 

63
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:50,706
How can anyone have a crush on someone for seventeen years?

64
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:58,746
Just...don't meet that person.

65
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:32,626
 Even if you don't meet that person, that face keeps appearing before you. 

66
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,956
 Thinking of Yoo Ri like that 

67
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:57,376
 is a struggle and painful at times. 

68
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:21,026
 But at least there's no way for us to hurt each other, 

69
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:25,986
 so it's immensely peaceful...and safe. 

70
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,646
I looked it over and stamped my seal.

71
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,166
So if any communication needs to take place unless it's important,

72
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,636
use text messages as you specified in the agreement.

73
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:00,866
Even if we meet, I won't greet you or say hello.

74
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:03,726
I'll be careful not to use the rooftop or the stairs leading to it.

75
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:06,686
And I'll make sure to keep the other 125 terms of the agreement.

76
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,376
So I look forward to a good landlord-tenant relationship.

77
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:12,446
Are you going to accept all these terms?

78
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:16,276
It is a ridiculous power trip by the landlord, but what can I do?

79
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:19,736
This powerless Party B has to follow along.

80
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,756
That's the sound of people putting up the sign.

81
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:29,846
It should wrap up this morning.

82
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:31,546
I shall be off.

83
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:43,326
   

84
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:46,616
   

85
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,846
   

86
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:05,466
Oh, hello!

87
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,406
Hello!

88
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,366
- Joon? 
 - Yes!

89
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,586
You were already here.

90
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:15,056
I saw your resume. So you're attending law school.

91
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:17,136
Yes, I am currently on a leave of absence.

92
00:08:17,136 --> 00:08:19,556
But would you be okay?

93
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:22,966
We're not really a law firm. We're just a cafe.

94
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:26,306
- Oh, regarding law— 
 - Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

95
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,016
Joon.

96
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:34,256
Could you tell that landlord wearing an over-worn tracksuit

97
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,586
to please keep the terms of the agreement

98
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:39,426
regarding not seeing each other aside from special occasions.

99
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:41,006
Excuse me?

100
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:45,916
Technically, the landlord can come to the tenant if he has matters of business to tend to.

101
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,726
See? You didn't even read it carefully.

102
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,346
What kind of unfair contract is this?

103
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,246
You told me not to even talk to you!

104
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,486
Hey you, grown-up man.

105
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:59,856
Surely, you're not thinking of working in a ridiculous cafe like this?

106
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:03,516
Yes! If you hire me, I will do my very best!

107
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:09,186
   

108
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:11,916
Law School of Hankuk University, leave of absence?

109
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,316
If you're taking a leave of absence from a law school, shouldn't you be studying for the bar exam?

110
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:17,646
Or you should be interning at a law firm!

111
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:18,756
Why did you come here?

112
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:22,166
- Well, that is what I've been mulling over— 
 - If you're the landlord, you're the landlord.

113
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,206
Who do you think you are to interfere in someone else's hiring process?

114
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,786
Take a look.

115
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,936
Article 63, Clause 1 of the contract.

116
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:37,446
"Party A has the right to look over the resumes and criminal records of all Party B's potential employees."

117
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,236
Relax for a bit and check for yourself.

118
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:40,376
So your answer is?

119
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:44,106
Oh, well... I just thought it would be fun?

120
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:45,476
- You're hired! 
 - I'm hired?

121
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:48,206
I like your positive and hopeful attitude!

122
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,866
Our cafe needs that.

123
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,746
Thank you so much!

124
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,506
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri.

125
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:58,506
I'm sick of telling you to quit this, so I won't.

126
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:01,886
But if you're going to run a business, you need to do it properly!

127
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:03,406
Do you think a cup of coffee is easy?

128
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:05,276
You need to first study the types of coffee beans

129
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:09,206
and how to grind them, and how to properly drip the coffee—

130
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:42,676
Who...

131
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,776
He's the one who will manage what type of beans we use, how we grind,

132
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,866
and how we'll drip the coffee.

133
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:50,426
Barista Eun Kang.

134
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,716
Wow, a Nel Drip.

135
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:56,796
For a smooth and intense flavor, there's nothing like this method.

136
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:58,886
And I do prefer retaining the oils from the coffee.

137
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:03,156
The more oils it retains, the more unique the flavor and fragrance of the coffee would become.

138
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,016
And the beans...

139
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,606
Blue Mountain!

140
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,786
I blended Blue Mountain with Kona.

141
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,976
You know your coffee very well!

142
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,656
Where did you study it?

143
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:18,466
Did you learn from the master of hand drip, Mr. Baek?

144
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,616
Or from the Tazzadoro School, which only teaches in the Italian style?

145
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:22,846
Cheonggang Penitentiary.

146
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:24,376
Oh! Cheonggang—

147
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:27,866
Attorney Kim and I go back a long way.

148
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:32,536
Wow, a r-real penitentiary?

149
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:35,406
F-For what reason?

150
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:36,446
Arson.

151
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,926
Oh, arson?

152
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:40,766
Wow, daebak!

153
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,186
Really, I've never seen anyone who went to prison before!

154
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,506
How many years were you in prison?

155
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,656
Are you sure you can do this without

156
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:49,196
creating major issues while keeping all the terms of that contract?

157
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:51,616
If you break even one of those terms, I will kick you out immediately.

158
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,116
"Article 103 of the Civil Code."

159
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:58,036
"Legal acts containing terms that violate good morals and other social order are considered invalid."

160
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:01,046
Your ridiculous contract is invalid from the very start.

161
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:05,426
None of the terms in that contract are considered to be violating good morals and social order.

162
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,376
"Article 105 of the Civil Code."

163
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:11,456
"When a party to a legal act expresses an intention different from statutes that are not related to"

164
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:13,626
"good morals or other social order, it shall follow the intention of the party."

165
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:15,426
"In rebuttal: Article 104."

166
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:17,816
"Any legal action that has clearly lost its fairness is considered null."

167
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:21,026
I see. So since that is true, I suppose our contract is nullified then!

168
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:23,586
- Get out now! 
 - Hey!

169
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,946
You motherf***ing a**hole!

170
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:36,326
Just because I went easy on you as a friend, you think this is a joke?

171
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,126
Am I a joke to you?

172
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:42,056
Why do you keep nitpicking and freaking out when I said I'd appease your demands!

173
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:44,096
Know your limits! Take it easy!

174
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,816
You got it?

175
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,576
Ice cold water.

176
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:56,896
So you could cool off a bit, Boss.

177
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,266
- Joon? 
 - Yes?

178
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:17,276
Could you please tell our beloved landlord to please go back up to his floor?

179
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:18,826
Okay.

180
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:20,606
Boss.

181
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:27,186
Mr. Landlord, l-let's go.

182
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,986
Let's go.

183
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,336
Don't follow me outside.

184
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:47,816
In the past year, this has never gone past 100.

185
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:50,276
But look at this right here.

186
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:53,146
As soon as Kim Yoo Ri appeared!

187
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:08,120
What beautiful weather!

188
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:11,536
- Are you here alone? 
 - Yes.

189
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:14,636
My boss says this is for you to drink.

190
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:27,356
Cheer up.

191
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:33,246
After my mother gets angry at my father, he freaks out for days.

192
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:37,286
But then they make up in no time.

193
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,756
Here...

194
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,436
Here. Have some rice cake.

195
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:42,906
- I'm fine. 
 - Gosh.

196
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,786
Have some.

197
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:46,486
Isn't it good?

198
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,386
Why are you eating it?

199
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:55,766
We can share, can't we?

200
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:01,336
Geez, seriously!

201
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:13,386
I think this would look nice at your cafe.

202
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:14,376
It's pretty.

203
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:16,776
Yes, it's so pretty.

204
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:24,576
I was going to go upstairs and say hello in your clinic anyway.

205
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:28,656
Doctor, instead of that, come to my cafe and have some coffee.

206
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:31,726
Okay, should I?

207
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,126
What's wrong?

208
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,776
What? This?

209
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:09,046
Gosh, excuse me for a moment.

210
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:20,546
What could this be?

211
00:16:22,676 --> 00:16:25,756
Why would this be here?

212
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:45,606
Geez, my tummy...

213
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:47,606
Is it indigestion?

214
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,956
   

215
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:49,996
 I don't think I can sleep at night if I don't tell you this. 

216
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:54,636
 Actually, the Taro Cafe owner saw a ghost in there. He pretty much ran away. 

217
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:57,886
 That's why the landlord is trying so hard to stop you from moving in. 

218
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:01,756
 Ma'am, I may be afraid of all kinds of things out there, but a ghost. 

219
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,146
 I'm not afraid of ghosts at all. 

220
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:06,916
 You should fear the living. What's there to fear about the dead? 

221
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,506
 Yeah. 

222
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:21,656
   

223
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:23,556
Take care now.

224
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,816
Attorney Kim, what brings you here?

225
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,136
Doctor...

226
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:32,256
From the downstairs cafe ceiling,

227
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:35,836
I keep hearing strange "thump-thump" sounds.

228
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:38,646
It's empty right above the cafe.

229
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:40,766
Our clinic is pretty quiet.

230
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:43,266
I wonder where that noise is coming from.

231
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:45,806
It's empty?

232
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:48,166
There's no way...

233
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,596
I definitely heard it.

234
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,748
W-Who...

235
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:15,218
Who are you?

236
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:17,568
I heard you at the clinic.

237
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,398
Thump-thump-thump.

238
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:22,108
You said you hear noises?

239
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:27,748
At times...

240
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:32,398
don't you want to just kill everyone?

241
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,228
W-What...

242
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:36,898
a-are you...

243
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,528
I thought you'd know how I feel.

244
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,888
Kim Yoo Ri, call the cops!

245
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,688
Stop!

246
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:39,838
Stop! Stop it!

247
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:41,218
Stop!

248
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:44,118
Hey, you jerk...

249
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,578
You're dead meat.

250
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:50,188
You jerk!

251
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:57,788
Stop right there!

252
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:04,348
You're here for legal counsel?

253
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,828
I'm so sorry...

254
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:12,908
Noise issues.

255
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,178
Noise issues between floors are like murder.

256
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:18,398
It's a slow murder.

257
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:24,158
You must be struggling a lot because of the noise issues.

258
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:27,288
I couldn't sleep at all.

259
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:29,178
For three days.

260
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:35,258
If I can offer  any legal assistance, I'll be glad to help you.

261
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:38,578
It might seem that there is no solution to noise issues.

262
00:22:38,578 --> 00:22:43,108
But if you collect proof of damage, there are ways to take care of it.

263
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:52,008
But it's getting late tonight,

264
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:55,178
and I also need to review some information regarding this.

265
00:22:55,178 --> 00:22:59,428
How about we talk further about it tomorrow?

266
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,748
Okay.

267
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:11,678
I'm sorry.

268
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:15,668
Hey, what's wrong?

269
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:17,128
Are you in pain?

270
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:19,228
Did you get hit somewhere hard earlier?

271
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,228
You'll talk further about it tomorrow?

272
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:23,608
I thought I should give him a consultation tomorrow since you're not feeling well.

273
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:26,708
You just told a guy with a hammer to come back here. Are you in a right state of mind?

274
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,758
And why are you so sorry?

275
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:30,978
I didn't want to put you in a bind by making this matter worse.

276
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:33,552
You both beat up each other, but you clearly hit him first.

277
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:35,962
You're worried about me now?

278
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:41,146
You're the one who puts me in the worst bind.

279
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:47,518
I think you're acting this way since you're in shock. So I'll let it pass.

280
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,228
Let's go upstairs. Let's lie down and talk.

281
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:52,548
Hey! What do you mean "lie down and talk"?

282
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,058
See? You can't even stand up straight!

283
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:00,738
You are in pain!

284
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,808
This won't do. You have to go to the hospital first.

285
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,628
Hey, hey!

286
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:06,778
Where did you touch just now?

287
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,218
What? Touched what?

288
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:10,768
- You just touched my chest with your right hand. 
 - S***!

289
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,458
How can you joke around in the middle of this?

290
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,538
I'm not joking around.

291
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:15,448
Under the Criminal Code Article 298, forced indecent act—

292
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:18,160
If you think it's so unfair, you can touch it too!

293
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,868
You caused a ruckus after 19:00 and

294
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,898
you came up to the rooftop and into my room...

295
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:37,948
How many clauses of our contract did you break just today?

296
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,908
Gosh, you're about to die but your mouth is still running.

297
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:43,548
You! Did you get another stomachache?

298
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,318
You always get a stomachache when you eat rice cake.

299
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,998
You're the one who gave it to me.

300
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:51,288
But why would you eat that just because it was given to you?

301
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:57,888
Geez, I can't believe I'm hearing this from Kim Yoo Ri, who has the world's most sensitive stomach.

302
00:24:57,888 --> 00:25:00,368
I guess I'm done for now.

303
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:03,958
We need to prick your finger. Where do you have a needle?

304
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,118
In my closet.

305
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:11,188
Next to that one.

306
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:14,378
Here?

307
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,398
W-What are you doing?

308
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:50,178
♫  It's permeated me without me knowing  ♫

309
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:59,678
♫  These small everyday moments gather here to become an ocean  ♫

310
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:04,568
♫  Sometimes stirs up rolling waves  ♫

311
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:09,608
♫  Even if darkness comes upon us  ♫

312
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:12,278
♫  It won't be dark  ♫

313
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:14,198
What are you doing?

314
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:17,828
Why do things keep flying into my eyes?

315
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:21,318
Is it fine dust or ultrafine dust?

316
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,448
Go home now.

317
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:28,518
Yeah, I was about to.

318
00:26:28,518 --> 00:26:31,028
Aigoo. I'm so tired.

319
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:34,158
Take some medicine and get some rest.

320
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:36,188
That's  mine.

321
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:38,748
I got confused.

322
00:26:57,688 --> 00:26:59,758
Aigoo, I'm dying here...

323
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,448
I'm tired.

324
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:09,568
You always jump at the sight of a pasta dish as if you starved for three days. Yet you're twirling your fork.

325
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:12,758
So I'm sure something is up.

326
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,888
I'm not really that interested, but I'll listen. What is it?

327
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:19,138
You know, when a person comes close to you,

328
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,438
you could close your eyes, right?

329
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:22,498
What are you talking about?

330
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:24,118
Kind of like a reflex, right?

331
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:26,888
The mystery of the human body. Something like that.

332
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:29,338
Something like that...

333
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:32,758
You didn't drink that much. Why are you talking nonsense?

334
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:36,258
I'm giving up the valuable time I'm supposed to practice water labor with Se Yeon.

335
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:39,808
Aigoo, give me a freaking break. My apologies, sir.

336
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,008
I'm leaving. I'll go.

337
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,628
Hurry up and go home to see your Se Yeon. Go now.

338
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,138
I was just about to do that anyway.

339
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:47,468
Gosh, I'm tired.

340
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,838
You're not going to eat this, right?

341
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:50,348
Hey.

342
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,298
How do you make porridge?

343
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,468
You just add water and rice and boil it.

344
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,638
Just water and rice?

345
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:04,698
Just water and rice.

346
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:27,798
 Don't be ignorant and put ramen and coffee in your aching stomach 

347
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:31,178
 and eat the vegetable porridge that this new tenant made for you. 

348
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,198
 All right then... 

349
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:43,388
The annual economic loss due to food waste is more than 20 trillion won.

350
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,038
Did you know that?

351
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,378
But in various places around the world,

352
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:52,018
even now, more than 1.2 billion people are starving.

353
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:02,578
 But I still couldn't eat it. 

354
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:06,278
Wow... the porridge... it's tough for the porridge to taste like that...

355
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,288
Yet she's done it somehow!

356
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:12,018
She, literally, "boiled porridge."* 
 (Korean saying that means to ruin something)

357
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:13,328
   

358
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:16,658
   

359
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:18,070
 

360
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,750
 

361
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:27,418
Okay.

362
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:29,258
Ready, go!

363
00:29:29,258 --> 00:29:32,798
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20!

364
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,968
Twenty seconds.

365
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:37,588
- Come on! 
 - I did it in 17 seconds.

366
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:49,188
 It's a law consultation cafe. 

367
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,818
 - Is the consultation mandatory?  
 - Welcome!

368
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:53,018
We can just say we came for coffee.

369
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:55,368
- Welcome! 
 - Okay.

370
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:56,718
Welcome!

371
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:58,958
Can we just get some coffee and leave?

372
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,628
Of course! Come in.

373
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:02,438
Come in.

374
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:17,308
Thank you.

375
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:22,528
What is your relationship with that first-floor cafe lady?

376
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:24,428
We're just alumni.

377
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:26,318
But you know, I noticed last time that

378
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:31,978
the way the second-floor doctor looks at the lawyer lady is pretty serious.

379
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,798
- Thank you. 
 - If you're just friends with her,

380
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,508
why don't you help him out?

381
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:42,178
A doctor and a lawyer. They make a nice picture.

382
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:44,808
People can handle relationships on their own.

383
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:47,168
What's there to help out with?

384
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:49,058
Come on, Hyungnim.

385
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:51,858
It's springtime.

386
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,438
L-Look! Look over there!

387
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,838
The doctor is going into the cafe!

388
00:31:08,978 --> 00:31:11,298
Oh, Doctor, you're here.

389
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:12,928
Hello, Attorney Kim.

390
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:16,598
I heard you went through a lot because of my patient last night.

391
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:18,358
He says he scared you late at night.

392
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:19,948
He's very sorry.

393
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:21,438
Oh, no!

394
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:25,038
I opened my cafe to help people like him, just like you, Doctor.

395
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:27,808
Gosh, I'm so sorry about it.

396
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,778
If I'm not being rude, may I ask you what this is?

397
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:34,908
It's a noise monitor.

398
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,248
Try speaking into it.

399
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:40,788
Gosh, I feel so shy.

400
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:43,388
It's nice to meet you, Attorney Kim.

401
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,748
Yes, hello!

402
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:51,338
I'm delighted to meet you as your neighbor as well.

403
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,168
So, why do you need that?

404
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:56,708
I wanted to verify his complaints.

405
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,978
I told him that I'd visit his place.

406
00:31:59,978 --> 00:32:03,648
Of course, you move quickly.

407
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:06,518
Someone told me I' m too rash.

408
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:10,438
Then, later tonight...

409
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:12,708
would it be okay for me to accompany you?

410
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,078
Really?

411
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:16,808
I'd be grateful if you'd do that.

412
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,328
Where do you think you're going?

413
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:20,748
Don't tell me you're visiting that guy with the hammer?

414
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:23,498
Didn't we decide we wouldn't talk to each other?

415
00:32:23,498 --> 00:32:25,708
Why are you being so nosy?

416
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:26,948
Mind your own business.

417
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,408
Do you think I could mind my own business?

418
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,108
Hey, are you trying to save the planet?

419
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:32,588
Do you have a Superwoman complex or something?

420
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:36,808
I'm not saving the planet and I'm just trying to help out a neighbor who came to me for help.

421
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:38,948
- Must you bring up Superwoman or whatever? 
 - Hello.

422
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:40,368
Are you in your right mind right now?

423
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:43,158
How old are you, young man who resembles a chestnut?

424
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:45,558
I'm Bae Joon. I'm 27 years old.

425
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:48,938
- We're noonas who run small businesses here. 
 - Noona.

426
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,768
There's not much to eat in this cafe.

427
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:53,928
There isn't much to eat, but there's a lot to see here.

428
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:55,688
You're so cute.

429
00:32:55,688 --> 00:32:58,318
And would he accept that?

430
00:32:58,318 --> 00:33:00,448
Hey, don't you feel any fear?

431
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:02,608
Don't you worry or think?

432
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,518
You were traumatized last night. Where do you think you're going by yourself?

433
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:08,208
- I'm going with her. 
 - What?

434
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,888
I'm going with her.

435
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,528
What?

436
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,198
They're cousins.

437
00:33:14,198 --> 00:33:16,858
And they get along so well that they're always together.

438
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,058
They're best friends.

439
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,958
Best, my foot.

440
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:24,458
They're... just  Dumb and Dumber  of our neighborhood.

441
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,508
D***, I lost again.

442
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:34,418
Come out, come out. A stick, a stick!

443
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:36,108
- What is he saying? 
 - A stick!

444
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:37,668
Yes, okay!

445
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:41,428
Will we see those two...

446
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:44,738
go separate ways because of a woman?

447
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,458
I couldn't stand the sight of two grown men

448
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,368
going around together with nothing to do.

449
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:51,608
It turned out perfectly!

450
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:53,548
What turned out perfectly?

451
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:56,088
What turned out perfectly?

452
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:57,428
- The sweet potato... 
 - Oh, I see.

453
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:58,598
- turned out perfectly. 
 - Yeah.

454
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:00,438
It's sweet.

455
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,168
D*** it.

456
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:10,228
My wrist is going to give out first at this rate.

457
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,968
It's your turn.

458
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,838
Landlord.

459
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,888
Can't you just go to the cafe lady and ask her when she's coming out?

460
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:20,608
What are you saying? I'm...

461
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:24,168
- totally focused on our game right now! 
 - Hold it!

462
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,728
You're putting Hong* card next to Heuk* card. 
  (Hwatu cards) 

463
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:29,708
How dare you try to lie to yourself and us?

464
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,068
I couldn't see because it was dark. I couldn't see.

465
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:34,068
Since it's nighttime.

466
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,908
Landlord! You left everything here!

467
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,278
What is it?

468
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:55,878
When I was a rookie prosecutor, the first dead body I saw

469
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,418
was someone murdered by a neighbor due to a noise conflict.

470
00:34:59,418 --> 00:35:01,188
So what?

471
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:02,488
Now that I think about it,

472
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:07,208
in a country with 42,250 noise complaints per year,

473
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:11,418
your intention to help your neighbor in suffering is quite commendable.

474
00:35:11,418 --> 00:35:12,898
In regards to this situation,

475
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:16,658
it doesn't make sense for me to sit out when I'm highly experienced.

476
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,738
"Don't you feel any fear? Don't you worry or think?"

477
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:22,598
That's how you were criticizing me just earlier today.

478
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:26,408
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, sure.

479
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:37,288
Were there any customers at the cafe today?

480
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,438
No.

481
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:42,218
There were a few customers who just came to drink coffee.

482
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:44,108
Don't worry too much.

483
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,798
The business will pick up soon.

484
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:13,708
You said you went to Hankuk University  with Jeong Ho, right?

485
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:14,988
Yes.

486
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:17,168
And we went to high school together as well.

487
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:18,398
I see.

488
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:22,198
I've heard about you and your friends from Jeong Ho.

489
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:27,498
So the pretty woman who also has great ambitions was you.

490
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:32,918
Hey, is that what you said—

491
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:35,378
I was talking about Han Se Yeon.

492
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:44,538
By the way, you two also don't seem like simple landlord and tenant either.

493
00:36:48,898 --> 00:36:50,738
My older cousin.

494
00:36:51,348 --> 00:36:52,648
Really?

495
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:55,428
But how come there's no resemblance at all?

496
00:36:55,428 --> 00:36:59,178
Cousins have an average genetic affinity of only 12.5%.

497
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:02,368
It's only natural that we bear no resemblance.

498
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,198
 Hello! 

499
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:15,468
 Please be quiet! Please be quiet! 

500
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:16,928
 Be quiet! 

501
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,978
 Please be quiet! 

502
00:37:22,228 --> 00:37:24,158
Do you hear that?

503
00:37:25,238 --> 00:37:28,348
They're not cautious, no matter how many times I ask them to,

504
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:32,048
so there's no doubt they're trying to drive me insane.

505
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:35,878
To begin with,

506
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:40,418
it is way over the nighttime standard of 52 decibels.

507
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,918
How about you send  a legal notice

508
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:44,958
to the house above and make a formal complaint?

509
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,288
Complaint?

510
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:48,378
I made plenty of complaints.

511
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:50,128
If you communicate via documents,

512
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:52,628
people will take it more seriously.

513
00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:55,268
If you proceed by sending them a legal notice and...

514
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,428
obtain a written diagnosis from the hospital

515
00:37:57,428 --> 00:37:59,518
and collect evidence regarding your damages,

516
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:01,518
we could also try to sue them for damage compensation.

517
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:02,508
That's right.

518
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:05,778
Do you think that will change those people?

519
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:07,798
Really?

520
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:20,038
   

521
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:33,738
Why?

522
00:38:33,738 --> 00:38:36,528
What? Why?

523
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:40,298
You have something to say!

524
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,328
Don't hold back and say it.

525
00:38:42,328 --> 00:38:43,558
You probably won't want to hear this.

526
00:38:43,558 --> 00:38:45,818
Just say it.

527
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:48,088
Okay.

528
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:52,188
By any chance, if tomorrow...  the people living on the floor above that man come to you,

529
00:38:52,188 --> 00:38:54,261
and claim they're suffering because of him,

530
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:57,701
will you write a legal notice for them as well?

531
00:38:59,311 --> 00:39:03,248
Then we'll have to reassess the situation for mutual damage.

532
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:05,268
As we were leaving, in apartment 1112 upstairs,

533
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,508
as well as in apartments 1011 and 1013 on either side of his place,

534
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:09,048
all the lights were off.

535
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:11,888
Only the three apartments downstairs had their lights on.

536
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:15,918
Don't you think you're adding fuel to the fire of an angry man running around with a hammer,

537
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:20,178
without even knowing who the perpetrator is?

538
00:39:21,018 --> 00:39:22,888
Should I continue?

539
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,348
No.

540
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:31,678
Go ahead inside. I have to talk to Hyung.

541
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,158
What?

542
00:39:43,628 --> 00:39:46,008
Hyung, what exactly are you trying to do with Kim Yoo Ri?

543
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:51,088
Does it bother you when I'm with Attorney Kim?

544
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,108
I think you should explain to me first why that bothers you.

545
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,048
Just don't do anything to her.

546
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:59,878
Don't encourage her or help her, and don't be friendly with her.

547
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:03,188
Don't start having any feelings for her, whether it be attraction or curiosity.

548
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:04,758
What's wrong?

549
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:07,558
Don't you think that's a bit over the top?

550
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:15,348
We can't become... anything to her.

551
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:20,688
Neither friends, nor colleagues, or neighbors... nor anything else.

552
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:27,668
For the same reason that I can't be... you can't, either.

553
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:36,678
Have a good time.

554
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:38,798
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

555
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:42,048
Gosh, how much longer do we have to work?

556
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:47,978
 Don't you think you're adding fuel to the fire of an angry man running around with a hammer, 

557
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:52,358
 without even knowing who the perpetrator is? 

558
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:59,128
 That's why I just stay out of the house during the day. 

559
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:01,218
 And stay at my parents' place. 

560
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:04,718
 Well, we have even less to say since we have kids. 

561
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:09,208
If it's noisy, everyone on our floor always thinks it's us since we have kids.

562
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,848
Gosh, these apartments.

563
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:13,328
This is how a person goes insane.

564
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:14,718
That tenth-floor lunatic?

565
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:17,318
Honestly, is there anyone here who doesn't understand that lunatic?

566
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:19,778
Of course, there isn't.

567
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:22,318
Oh, my gosh!

568
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,358
By any chance, do you live in the Green Apartments right there?

569
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:32,948
Come in, come in.

570
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:40,198
There must be a baby upstairs.

571
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,588
A grandma lives alone upstairs.

572
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:44,928
That's why we're going crazy.

573
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:48,118
Since we can't even tell where the noise is coming from.

574
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:51,668
That tenth-floor lunatic is like that, even though no one lives above him.

575
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:53,218
- That's true. 
 - Pardon?

576
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,508
No one lives above him.

577
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:58,918
They moved somewhere else because that lunatic kept making a big fuss.

578
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:01,348
It's already been a few months.

579
00:42:06,468 --> 00:42:10,518
 Then all those noises coming from the ceiling are... 

580
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:12,618
 No one knows the source! 

581
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:17,568
 If we knock from here, the ceiling two floors above us will resonate as well. 

582
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:36,628
This is recorded on a cell phone, so it could be hard to hear,

583
00:42:36,628 --> 00:42:39,788
but the entire apartment had terrible soundproofing.

584
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:42,088
The noise issues between floors are quite...

585
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:46,408
To be honest, this can be resolved by just constructing the floors thicker.

586
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,718
But then the construction fees will increase,

587
00:42:48,718 --> 00:42:52,238
so that's why everyone just builts with the minimum thickness.

588
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,908
What year was the apartment constructed?

589
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:55,208
In 2007.

590
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,638
It's not even that old.

591
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:00,068
It's not that new apartments will be less like that,

592
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:01,628
and old apartments will be more like that.

593
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:03,548
It has nothing to do with that.

594
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:06,388
Was it since 2004?

595
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:08,818
There was a pre-certification system.

596
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,648
Before construction, they made floor test samples and drew blueprints.

597
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:14,508
If they could just get this approved,

598
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:18,168
they didn't even check on how the actual construction progressed.

599
00:43:18,168 --> 00:43:23,088
So from the contractor's side, there's no reason to construct them properly.

600
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:28,798
Green... Apartments...

601
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,538
   

602
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:36,158
   

603
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:42,798
   

604
00:43:44,628 --> 00:43:47,618
   

605
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:58,903
 Thus, this court of law finds defendant Lee Pyeon Woong not guilty. 

606
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,466
It turns out no one lives in the apartment above you.

607
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:29,966
How do you feel about filing a lawsuit against the construction company?

608
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:33,066
Y-Yes, Attorney Kim.

609
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:35,726
I understand what you're saying.

610
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:40,416
Yes. Then please contact me after thinking about it.

611
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:04,586
 Dear Landlord, 

612
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:06,686
 there's a noise that keeps coming from the ceiling. 

613
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:09,576
 Mutually prudent discussion is required. 

614
00:45:21,626 --> 00:45:24,396
I guess you didn't understand the part about not texting me after sunset,

615
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:29,656
but that meant... let's not come up with things to do at night.

616
00:45:29,656 --> 00:45:35,616
Well, what can I do when the indicated phenomenon only happens at night?

617
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:38,346
There's a noise coming from above?

618
00:45:38,346 --> 00:45:41,326
Yeah. Every night, it's as if someone is walking.

619
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:43,406
I hear these stomping noises.

620
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:46,766
I was confused since no one is upstairs.

621
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:49,416
I couldn't focus because I was scared.

622
00:45:50,126 --> 00:45:52,756
What noise are you talking about?

623
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:55,016
You probably don't know,

624
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:57,786
but noise between floors is so distressful.

625
00:45:57,786 --> 00:45:59,446
It's something you can more than relate to

626
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:01,626
if you just experience it yourself.

627
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:04,576
I see. Is that why after much relating,

628
00:46:04,576 --> 00:46:07,386
your resolution is to have these neighbors sue each other?

629
00:46:07,386 --> 00:46:08,646
No.

630
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:10,306
After looking into it today,

631
00:46:10,306 --> 00:46:14,716
the entire apartment building was suffering from the noise traveling between floors.

632
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:16,676
So?

633
00:46:16,676 --> 00:46:22,036
As you said, having these neighbors sue each other with legal notices was not a solution.

634
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:26,556
So I'm planning to have them file a lawsuit against the construction company.

635
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:32,286
Have you finally gone insane?

636
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:35,086
Yeah! Because just like Se Yeon, I'm pretty

637
00:46:35,086 --> 00:46:37,326
and I have great ambitions too.

638
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:39,026
Now that I've started my own business,

639
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:42,526
I'm going to go big and get into everyone's business.

640
00:46:43,406 --> 00:46:46,046
How great of you. How great.

641
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:57,406
And it just so happens that the construction company is Dohan Construction.

642
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:06,466
Don't involve your personal feelings in this.

643
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:10,046
I looked into it, and not only is the standard for preventing noise between floors ridiculous,

644
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:12,046
but, of course, Dohan Construction didn't even comply to that standard.

645
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:13,956
Kim Yoo Ri.

646
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,276
Law Cafe was just an excuse.

647
00:47:16,276 --> 00:47:19,176
Your intentions lie in your father's case, don't they?

648
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:21,746
- It's not like that. 
 - Why can't you—

649
00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:27,656
Why can't you take a single step away from the past?

650
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:31,766
You're the one who can't take a step away from the past.

651
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:36,486
That's why it makes you miserable that I'm here by your side. Am I wrong?

652
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,826
I'm sorry, but I have moved on.

653
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:42,476
Living filled with rage and resentment...

654
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:45,136
I quit doing that because it was pure hell.

655
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:00,166
 My dad doesn't drink alcohol! 

656
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,826
 His face turns red if he consumes even a single drop, so he doesn't drink! 

657
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:04,696
 So shouldn't you do something? 

658
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:07,546
 Do anything to find out the truth. Isn't that justice? 

659
00:48:07,546 --> 00:48:09,216
 There are specific procedures we need to follow, so just wait. 

660
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:12,006
 What's so important about procedures? 

661
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:17,276
 Trials aren't about making the right decisions, 

662
00:48:17,276 --> 00:48:19,836
 it's about maintaining the right procedures. 

663
00:48:19,836 --> 00:48:22,296
 I feel bad for you, but... 

664
00:48:23,186 --> 00:48:26,116
 this is the kind of justice the law speaks of. 

665
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,736
 Dad! 

666
00:48:37,736 --> 00:48:39,756
 Dad, why is this happening? 

667
00:48:39,756 --> 00:48:41,406
 Yoo Ri. 

668
00:48:57,796 --> 00:48:59,586
 Thank you. 

669
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,026
 Kim Jeong Ho. 

670
00:50:04,026 --> 00:50:06,546
 Why are you avoiding me? 

671
00:50:08,236 --> 00:50:10,756
 That day, the reason why I looked at you like that 

672
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:13,156
 is because I needed someone to blame, 

673
00:50:13,156 --> 00:50:16,046
 and you were in front of me. 

674
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:21,426
 But was it book 5 of Cheon Re Do? It says it there. 

675
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:24,896
 When you experience misfortune, you'll be furious at the world. 

676
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:28,916
 But you have to make it clear who you're furious at, especially at times like that. 

677
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:35,756
 You and your father aren't the targets of my fury. 

678
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:37,726
 That day... 

679
00:50:37,726 --> 00:50:40,816
 I was too angry and blamed the wrong person. 

680
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:42,626
 I believe your father 

681
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:47,496
 did his best within the bounds of what he believed to be just. 

682
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:51,986
 So...don't avoid me. 

683
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:58,386
 After my father passed away unjustly, 

684
00:50:58,386 --> 00:51:00,026
 I'm now a gradute in high school, 

685
00:51:00,026 --> 00:51:02,606
 but Mom is busy with the lawsuits, 

686
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:04,836
 so I'm having a really hard time. 

687
00:51:04,836 --> 00:51:07,856
 But what am I going to do if you act like this too? 

688
00:51:53,086 --> 00:51:54,846
 - You— 
 - Ow! 

689
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:57,446
 - Come here! Let me hit you again! 
 - No! 

690
00:51:57,446 --> 00:51:59,696
 No, I was just playing around! 

691
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:01,836
 How could you play around when I was talking earnestly? 

692
00:52:01,836 --> 00:52:03,066
 W-Wait... 

693
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:05,296
 Calm down! 

694
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:07,376
 She's incredible, right? 

695
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:11,006
If it were me, I could never have spoken like that.

696
00:52:12,026 --> 00:52:15,416
That's why I shamelessly endured by her side.

697
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,756
I still believed...

698
00:52:20,616 --> 00:52:22,936
that Father had...

699
00:52:24,296 --> 00:52:28,306
resolved that situation according to his conviction.

700
00:52:29,056 --> 00:52:30,766
 - He's inside, right? 
 - Wait, Prosecutor! 

701
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:33,746
 - Wait, Prosecutor! 
 - You can't do this! 

702
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:36,066
 You shouldn't do this. 

703
00:52:40,986 --> 00:52:43,896
 There's already talk circulating about you and me. 

704
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:46,866
 Must you add to the rumors? 

705
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:48,576
 In the end, it was all you. 

706
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:50,486
 What are you talking about? 

707
00:52:50,486 --> 00:52:53,046
 The fire incident at the Dohan warehouse in 2006! 

708
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:54,846
 The one who messed up the entire case, 

709
00:52:54,846 --> 00:52:56,786
 ordering the cessation of the Dohan investigations too! 

710
00:52:56,786 --> 00:52:58,436
 It was all your doing! 

711
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:01,266
 You're digging around a case with  expired statute of limitation. 

712
00:53:01,266 --> 00:53:02,676
 Should I have just left it alone? 

713
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:05,816
 I just did what I needed to do before talk of leniency arose. 

714
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,156
 That's not it. 

715
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:11,366
 You blocked the investigation since you felt guilty as Dohan Group's son-in-law! 

716
00:53:13,366 --> 00:53:18,166
 When your mom married me, we cut off all ties with the Dohan family. 

717
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:20,066
 We have nothing to do with them. 

718
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:23,706
 Father, why are you doing this when you have nothing to do with them? 

719
00:53:23,706 --> 00:53:28,086
 Back then, this case went to someone else and the charges were almost dropped. 

720
00:53:28,086 --> 00:53:30,526
 I'm the one who barely managed to press charges and put Lee Pyeon Woong on the stand as a defendant. 

721
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:33,376
 But you lost  without even a chance to appeal. 

722
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:38,106
 No matter what you say... 

723
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:41,136
 I have no regrets about the decision I made back then. 

724
00:53:46,486 --> 00:53:52,386
 I don't know what it is you're striving to protect... 

725
00:53:54,076 --> 00:53:56,596
 but I don't think it's the law. 

726
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,926
   

727
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:18,900
♫  After the long rain   ♫

728
00:54:20,446 --> 00:54:26,950
♫  which seemed  like it wouldn't cease passed   ♫

729
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,586
 Hey! 

730
00:54:28,586 --> 00:54:30,076
 Hey, Kim Jeong Ho! 

731
00:54:30,076 --> 00:54:32,026
 What are you doing here? 

732
00:54:32,026 --> 00:54:33,736
 Hey, Kim Yoo Ri... 

733
00:54:33,736 --> 00:54:34,616
 Hey. 

734
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:36,676
 Hey, Kim Yoo Ri, I was waiting for you. 

735
00:54:36,676 --> 00:54:39,136
 Hey, do you... 

736
00:54:39,136 --> 00:54:41,016
 Are you all right? 

737
00:54:41,016 --> 00:54:45,956
♫  On an empty street   ♫

738
00:54:45,956 --> 00:54:53,536
♫  I think my troubled heart
still isn't dry.  ♫

739
00:54:53,536 --> 00:54:59,116
 No matter how brazen I am, 

740
00:54:59,116 --> 00:55:02,746
 I can't endure this any longer. 

741
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:07,436
 What are you saying? 

742
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:14,740
♫  If I could see your heart  ♫

743
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:26,370
♫  If I could, it would be nice if I could  ♫

744
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:31,936
 I'll miss you so much. What am I going to do... 

745
00:55:38,016 --> 00:55:48,916
♫  After a short rain shower when I didn't expect rain  ♫

746
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:05,756
   

747
00:56:05,756 --> 00:56:08,116
   

748
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:11,886
   

749
00:56:44,326 --> 00:56:46,036
CEO.

750
00:56:46,926 --> 00:56:49,636
CEO Whang of Whang &amp; Goo is here.

751
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,936
Aigoo, you're here.

752
00:56:55,936 --> 00:56:57,966
Aigoo, oh, no...

753
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:59,846
You guys, go home.

754
00:56:59,846 --> 00:57:01,826
Get out of here now!

755
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,786
Wow, this is bad. I'm dying here...

756
00:57:16,076 --> 00:57:18,716
This is our company welfare program.

757
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:21,966
Slapping crazy CEO.

758
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:28,256
   

759
00:57:28,256 --> 00:57:29,966
This is the first project since we decided to partner.

760
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:31,596
Did you review it carefully?

761
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:33,866
Well, the result of my review is that

762
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:39,796
there are some parts that used your story and Dohan Construction as an inspiration.

763
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:43,916
But most of the story is creative storytelling.

764
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:45,956
In my opinion,

765
00:57:45,956 --> 00:57:49,536
I don't think I saw anything major that's problematic.

766
00:57:56,766 --> 00:58:01,786
But you know, to say that this is just an internet novel...

767
00:58:01,786 --> 00:58:03,796
It's too close to facts.

768
00:58:03,796 --> 00:58:07,396
It seems like someone from the inside who knows about the case wrote this.

769
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:09,836
He did do a good job of news-gathering.

770
00:58:09,836 --> 00:58:13,586
But he's not singling out Dohan Construction and making an issue out of you

771
00:58:13,586 --> 00:58:17,326
but if you look, he mentions other companies as well—

772
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:19,806
Hey, s***, CEO!

773
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:24,306
Come. Come over here.

774
00:58:24,306 --> 00:58:27,156
There is this woman who gave birth to me, you know?

775
00:58:27,156 --> 00:58:29,326
There must be a woman like that out there, right?

776
00:58:29,326 --> 00:58:32,046
That woman always had some mental issues.

777
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:34,310
But was it when I was 14 years old?

778
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,996
She swung a knife, saying she'd kill my father.

779
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:39,676
So there's this big scar on my father's face.

780
00:58:39,676 --> 00:58:44,796
But how did the CEO get a scar on his face?

781
00:58:44,796 --> 00:58:47,336
Not many people know about this story.

782
00:58:47,336 --> 00:58:50,926
But this... This a**hole knows about that!

783
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:53,256
And what is this a**hole's pen name?

784
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:54,716
It's Whee-seul-Blower.

785
00:58:54,716 --> 00:58:56,906
A whistleblower!

786
00:58:56,906 --> 00:59:01,536
Some a**hole is out there f***ing me over with this!

787
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:08,426
Why, why, why isn't this problematic, you CEO, man? Huh, huh, huh?

788
00:59:08,426 --> 00:59:11,016
If you take him on recklessly,

789
00:59:11,016 --> 00:59:15,406
it'll look like you're actually admitting to what the story says!

790
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:19,386
So, how do I get rid of him nice and clean?

791
00:59:19,386 --> 00:59:22,686
We're giving you money for your advice!

792
00:59:22,686 --> 00:59:24,936
You took our money!

793
00:59:27,716 --> 00:59:30,186
 Don't do this job healf-heartedly just because you're annoyed. 

794
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:33,426
 Please review it carefully with your people. 

795
00:59:33,426 --> 00:59:36,116
 More than anything, find out who this punk is! 

796
00:59:36,116 --> 00:59:38,656
 I must find that out first! 

797
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:43,026
Aigoo, that son of a mistress. He just has a bundle of issues.

798
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:47,966
Geez, I think I made the wrong move by partnering with him.

799
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:54,286
   

800
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:56,406
- Hey, Hyung. 
  - Hi, Jeong Ho. 

801
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:59,226
 Can I have Attorney Kim's phone number by chance? 

802
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:00,646
Why do you want to know that at this hour?

803
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:03,066
Remember Jo Seok Joon from yesterday? From Green Apartments.

804
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:05,326
We have to go right now and stop him.

805
01:00:05,326 --> 01:00:07,716
But I'm kind of far away right now.

806
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:09,386
 I wasn't sure, so I reported it to the police already. 

807
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:11,346
What are you talking about?

808
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:16,466
 He called me just now and said he talked to Attorney Kim this evening. 

809
01:00:16,466 --> 01:00:17,706
Taxi! Taxi!

810
01:00:17,706 --> 01:00:20,426
 He's standing on the rooftop. 

811
01:00:21,706 --> 01:00:24,406
Come on, pick up the phone!

812
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:27,996
Gosh, seriously.

813
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,066
Yeah, what?

814
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:38,946
Oh, no!

815
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:44,006
Kim Yoo Ri, tell me exactly what you told him.

816
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:51,056
 Because he complained so much, the people above him rented another place and live there for months now. 

817
01:00:51,056 --> 01:00:52,546
But I guess he didn't know about it.

818
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:56,356
I told him that when I suggested that he files a lawsuit against the construction company.

819
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:58,336
Maybe that shocked him.

820
01:00:58,336 --> 01:01:00,476
 I'm on my way. So hold him for 10 minutes... 

821
01:01:00,476 --> 01:01:02,886
 No, for five minutes. 

822
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:06,546
 Please. Please come down and let's talk. 

823
01:01:06,546 --> 01:01:09,486
 - Please calm down. 
 - Hello... 

824
01:01:11,086 --> 01:01:12,366
Do you know him?

825
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:14,176
He's my hyungnim. Hyungnim.

826
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:18,036
Hyungnim! You remember me, right?

827
01:01:18,036 --> 01:01:20,336
Whoa, step back!

828
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:26,516
The attorney suggested another way to you. Why are you doing this?

829
01:01:28,586 --> 01:01:31,106
It's all useless.

830
01:01:31,106 --> 01:01:34,026
It's all pointless, anyway.

831
01:01:34,026 --> 01:01:35,226
Why?

832
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:39,076
Because you thought the people above you were the crazies but it turns out you're the crazy one.

833
01:01:39,076 --> 01:01:40,566
So, you just want to die now?

834
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:42,566
What are you doing? Are you really his family?

835
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:45,706
If not, are you going to jump off

836
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,796
and take revenge on all the residents

837
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:50,606
- who live here? 
 - Hey, you!

838
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,936
"March 17, 11:12 a.m. Piano practice.

839
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:07,906
12:39 p.m. Sound of meal prepping.

840
01:02:07,906 --> 01:02:10,166
March 18, 1:20 a.m.

841
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,076
Sound of TV. Don't know where it's coming from.

842
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:14,296
March 19, 4:12 a.m.

843
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:16,766
The sound of a ball rolling. Don't know where it's from."

844
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,586
You wrote it all down meticulously.

845
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:28,926
You have been piling up your anger

846
01:02:28,926 --> 01:02:30,686
and you don't know where you should blow up at.

847
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:32,486
You're so frustrated that it's driving you crazy, right?

848
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:34,166
But you're aiming at the wrong direction.

849
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:36,416
That's not the right direction! You've got it all wrong!

850
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:39,576
What do you know about me?

851
01:02:39,576 --> 01:02:42,726
Do you even know what kind of pain I went through?

852
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,656
No one knows!

853
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:47,456
No one knows, I said!

854
01:02:51,786 --> 01:02:55,466
Just because no one knows about it, do you think you can just let it out anywhere?

855
01:02:56,706 --> 01:03:00,826
When you're facing misfortune, you need to stay alert

856
01:03:00,826 --> 01:03:04,786
and find the right direction to let out your anger!

857
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:08,336
Don't let it out on the wrong places! That's cowardly!

858
01:03:09,546 --> 01:03:12,716
 When you experience misfortune, you'll be furious at the world. 

859
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:16,536
 But you have to make it clear who you're furious at, especially at times like that. 

860
01:03:21,026 --> 01:03:25,516
Attorney Kim found the culprit for you.

861
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:27,606
So, let's fight together.

862
01:03:27,606 --> 01:03:30,006
Not by yourself!

863
01:03:33,436 --> 01:03:35,306
Here.

864
01:03:35,306 --> 01:03:37,486
We'll win this one for you.

865
01:03:38,556 --> 01:03:41,986
Get compensated for the pain you went through all this time

866
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:46,036
and furthermore, we'll make sure those a**holes

867
01:03:46,036 --> 01:03:49,356
will never build another apartment like this again!

868
01:03:54,646 --> 01:04:01,196
So please...hold my hand. Please?

869
01:04:26,026 --> 01:04:28,026
 He got him! 

870
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:35,960


871
01:04:52,816 --> 01:05:00,206
♫  Cold wind breezes by my shoulder  ♫

872
01:05:00,206 --> 01:05:05,680
♫  The night I could only think of painful memories  ♫

873
01:05:06,556 --> 01:05:14,666
♫  Do you remember that time when you came to me quietly to hold my hand  ♫

874
01:05:14,666 --> 01:05:19,616
♫  My frozen tears were falling  ♫

875
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:23,836
No matter how rushed you were, you should dress properly.

876
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,256
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

877
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,846
♫  Do you feel it?  ♫

878
01:05:30,846 --> 01:05:35,706
♫  Can you see with kindly eyes?  ♫

879
01:05:35,706 --> 01:05:43,766
♫  It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long  ♫

880
01:05:43,766 --> 01:05:47,446
♫  Just lean on me  ♫

881
01:05:47,446 --> 01:05:52,476
♫  Embrace me just like this  ♫

882
01:05:52,476 --> 01:05:54,326
Kim Jeong Ho...

883
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,596
I feel weird.

884
01:05:58,596 --> 01:06:02,546
My heart keeps pounding.

885
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:07,210
♫  Are you trying to listen for me as you look for me?  ♫

886
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:16,516
♫  Tell me more of your past that I don't know about  ♫

887
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:21,600
♫  I want to hear it even the painful wounds of your past  ♫

888
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:28,946
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

889
01:06:28,946 --> 01:06:32,676
♫  Do you feel it?  ♫

890
01:06:32,676 --> 01:06:37,386
♫  Can you see with kindly eyes?  ♫

891
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:45,726
♫  You are the last refuge for me.  ♫

892
01:06:45,726 --> 01:06:49,146
♫  Open it carefully  ♫

893
01:06:49,146 --> 01:06:54,566
♫  Do you feel my heart?  ♫

894
01:06:57,986 --> 01:07:01,056
   

895
01:07:01,056 --> 01:07:04,566
 You're actually going to sue Dohan Construction, right? 

896
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:05,686
 You'll lose, 100%! 

897
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:10,596
 Then, give me another idea that could take care of this problem. 

898
01:07:10,596 --> 01:07:12,696
 Why are there so many people trying to screw me over? 

899
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,256
 The fact that videos like this are online means... 

900
01:07:15,256 --> 01:07:16,756
 We can move on to the next stage, right? 

901
01:07:16,756 --> 01:07:18,456
 - Proceed! 
 - Great! 

902
01:07:18,456 --> 01:07:22,510
 Wow! I feel so great! 

903
01:07:23,516 --> 01:07:25,936
 It's because they have no fear. 

904
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:31,316
 If you mess with Kim Yoo Ri once more, I'll rip you and shred you to pieces. 

905
01:07:32,326 --> 01:07:34,800
♫  More than that time  ♫
