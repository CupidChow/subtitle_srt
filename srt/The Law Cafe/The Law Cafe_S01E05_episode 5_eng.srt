1
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:33,126
   

2
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:35,166
We're like family–

3
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:43,826
I don't want to be family with you.

4
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:46,436
I want to be someone else to you.

5
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:49,766
Well, that's...

6
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,436
not something you could become just because you want to...

7
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:57,360
♫  She's waking me up with that pretty smile  ♫

8
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:01,596
♫  You make me smile  ♫

9
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:04,476
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

10
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:10,910
♫  I wonder if you know that I feel this way  ♫

11
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:15,086
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:24,510


13
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:32,286
Due to a lack of proper blood flow in the body,

14
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:35,736
fluids from the internal organs build up in a certain part of the body

15
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,186
and becomes thick and murky...

16
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:40,966
- Mr. Kim Jeong Ho? 
 - Yes? Ouch!

17
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,526
Commonly known as a cramp.

18
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,936
Hey, Jeong Ho.

19
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,026
Hey!

20
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:04,866
Kim Jeong Ho.

21
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:14,876
Hey! Wh-What are you doing here?

22
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,467
H-How did you know I was here?

23
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,033
- Are you a stalker? 
 - No, the market ahjumma told me!

24
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,336
God, that market ahjumma...

25
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:26,086
But... why did you suddenly... get a cramp...

26
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:35,286
The foster parents decided to take back Soo Ah and Ji Ah.

27
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:37,616
Their birth father turned out to be messed up as well.

28
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,916
The way he treated his children was like passing off some baggage.

29
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,406
Just the thought of the children being put back in the care of someone like that

30
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:45,476
makes me feel so frustrated.

31
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,806
You were surprised... earlier, right?

32
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,616
Do you even have to ask?

33
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:58,856
I was surprised, too!

34
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:00,246
Like, that I would...

35
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,106
Especially in front of the police station, kiss–

36
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:07,976
Do that to you...

37
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,806
I understand that it was sudden for you,

38
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:12,136
but for me, it was within a certain flow of things.

39
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:16,146
Since things turned out this way, I won't hold back and tell you outright.

40
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:19,346
You know I don't like confusing people.

41
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:20,356
Wh-Wh-What...

42
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:23,466
What are you saying to me this time?

43
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,176
I think the start of all this was that day.

44
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:29,196
The day when we were on the roof of the Green Apartments,

45
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:30,896
and you adjusted my clothes

46
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:33,536
and told me, "You should dress properly."

47
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:36,096
That day, my heart was beating like crazy,

48
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:38,976
but there's no way that I would feel that way toward you!

49
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:41,006
So, at first, I was in denial.

50
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:43,336
But since that day, whenever I saw you,

51
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,326
my heart started beating rapidly without a cause

52
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:48,576
and that I kept gulping told me that something was up.

53
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,816
Especially when you touch me, blood vessels dilate–

54
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:54,476
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! What in the world are you talking about?

55
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:02,706
I'm merely trying to show how my actions from earlier fit into the overall flow...

56
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:07,936
Hey!

57
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:10,136
- Yes, I was trying to make that clear. 
 - Are you crazy right now?

58
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,686
The doctor's right there, too!

59
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,226
Oh, I'm so sorry!

60
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:15,106
I didn't consider the time and place for things, right?

61
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:17,716
I was in such a rush to explain myself...

62
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:24,026
Then... come out after you finish receiving acupuncture.

63
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:26,286
I'll be waiting.

64
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:36,046
That crazy nut.

65
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,646
Doctor, please remove these now!

66
00:04:57,356 --> 00:05:00,506
So to summarize...

67
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,466
what you are telling me is...

68
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,306
S-So...

69
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,866
what you want to tell me is...

70
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:10,556
in short...

71
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:12,306
You...

72
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:13,756
- me... 
 - Yes.

73
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,666
I like you.

74
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:22,616
Are those words that easy for you to say?

75
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,076
Who said they were easy?

76
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:27,446
My heart is throbbing all the way up to my throat right now!

77
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,946
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri...

78
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:32,536
We spent seventeen years together.

79
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:36,296
You, me, Han Se Yeon, Do Jin Ki. The four of us spent seventeen years together.

80
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:38,267
Then what about those other two?

81
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:41,400
What about those two? They're married, have a child, and live perfectly happily together.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,636
Why? Can't we do that, too?

83
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,446
Then what about our friendship?

84
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:53,016
Are you not afraid that you might lose me as a friend?

85
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:54,446
Is there nothing like that for you?

86
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:57,476
I'm not planning on losing you.

87
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:59,426
If you really don't like me,

88
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,876
I would be sad, but I was thinking of giving up then.

89
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:11,486
So that's possible for you then.

90
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:16,706
That's why you're so rash.

91
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:18,716
It's because I like you.

92
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,156
Once, twice...

93
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:22,776
I kept thinking about it, but I still felt the same way,

94
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,656
so I'm telling you how I feel.

95
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:27,566
I thought I would hear responses like

96
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,666
"Yes," "No," or "I'll think about it."

97
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,736
Who would have thought I would hear such criticisms?

98
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:35,526
What is there to think about between you and me?

99
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:38,330
- That means... 
 - You're not the one for me.

100
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,636
Aren't you being too rash in responding to me?

101
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,646
Are you really saying when we kiss–

102
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:49,476
That you didn't feel anything when our lips met?

103
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,406
Did I not feel anything?

104
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,956
♫  Can you see with kindly eyes?  ♫

105
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,216
♫  It seems like a resting place that you've waited for so long  ♫

106
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,456
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri.

107
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:02,916
For me, that kiss...

108
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,706
is illegal. It's cheating!

109
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:11,006
♫  Embrace me just like this  ♫

110
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:20,256
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

111
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,206
In the year 2022, just because we kissed a bit,

112
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,106
what's he going on about it being illegal?

113
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:28,566
Then is it legal to respond like that when I mustered up the courage to confess my feelings?

114
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:32,196
I mean, I–

115
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:34,386
I've liked her for seventeen years!

116
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,796
Since high school.

117
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,056
I-I obviously want to tell her, too.

118
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,256
Should I tell her? Should I not? Am I going too far?

119
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:41,816
Maybe she would feel it too burdensome...

120
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:45,146
I mean, even if she develops feelings for me,

121
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:48,126
how can she just be like, "Hey, I like you. What about you?"

122
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:49,646
"You don't like me? Fine, I'll just give it up then."

123
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:52,216
Man...

124
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,646
If you really like someone,

125
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:59,296
shouldn't there be some patience?

126
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:03,476
   

127
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:08,286
   

128
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:17,106
Oh, Joon. You didn't leave yet?

129
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:19,066
I told you to get off work early today.

130
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,556
Oh, it's because I have a job interview.

131
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:23,376
Wait, are you doing another job?

132
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:26,176
Am I paying too little... What job is it?

133
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:29,546
It's making sure that Boss gets home safely!

134
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:32,166
Look, we even have a contract.

135
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,356
The employer is the landlord hyungnim. 
    

136
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:37,426
You know what happened at the cafe and all.

137
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:40,256
So it seems like he is quite worried about you.

138
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:42,726
If he was so worried, he should be taking me home then.

139
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,496
Why is he hiring someone else to do it for him?

140
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:48,236
If you're going to avoid me, don't act like you're worried about me!

141
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,976
Oh! Where are you going after closing the cafe early today?

142
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:54,886
I'm going to fight with the government authorities.

143
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,186
The government authorities?

144
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:59,296
This is all your fault!

145
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,676
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,816
You are the one in charge of the case!

147
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,046
Is there anyone else in charge then?

148
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,106
- Do you go around blaming people in charge? 
 - Yes... I think–

149
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,596
- Then whose fault is it? 
 - You should come quickly...

150
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:11,316
I think the police might show up at this rate.

151
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,556
Why is that my fault?

152
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:14,216
It's the fault of the abusive parent!

153
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:17,056
If you had made sure the children were separated from the mother,

154
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,626
this would've never happened!

155
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,686
Both of you, please calm down!

156
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,316
Take a look at the state of this house.

157
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,306
You left without doing anything, having seen this?

158
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,826
Every single house that we receive reports about all looks like this.

159
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:28,176
All of them are a mess!

160
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:31,066
If we start separating every child who lives in a place like that,

161
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,966
where would we send all those children?

162
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,986
- Are you going to take care of them? 
 - "You"?  (Talking down, no honorifics) 

163
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,976
- Did you just say you? 
 - Yes! I said you!

164
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,936
Where did this old blabbermouth come from?

165
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,156
Old?

166
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:42,656
You come over here! You come over here!

167
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,966
This b**** must be crazy!

168
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,686
- Hey! You're dead! 
 - Hey! You–

169
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,086
Whoa! Hey!

170
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:50,966
You won't listen to me! You come here!

171
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,526
Let me go! Let go of me!

172
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,016
- Let go of me! 
 - Come over here, you!

173
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:57,566
Hey! You stop it! That's enough.

174
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:03,436
That little girl... was locked up all day and risked her life to escape by walking on the roof.

175
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,296
It wasn't like there were no reports...

176
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:07,686
There were so many adults who came by and saw the children.

177
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:11,836
Why does the child have to risk her life to stay alive? Why?

178
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:15,106
Why are you asking that of me?

179
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:17,536
That's it. You come over here!

180
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,466
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

181
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:26,236
Sue me! Sue me!

182
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:29,306
And you, watch yourself!

183
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:32,466
Hey! Kim Yoo Ri! Don't throw it!

184
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,556
- Let go of me! 
 - Man...

185
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:37,526
The mindset of that woman is just rotten!

186
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:40,076
You're now going so far as to barge into the district office.

187
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:41,716
Put her shoes on.

188
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:43,766
I mean, how can someone be so shameless?

189
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:46,596
Please just calm down! Relax.

190
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:49,496
I'm sorry to interrupt, but

191
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,466
- would you do an interview– 
 - I'm not doing it!

192
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,916
Give me my bag. My cellphone.

193
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:58,446
- I'll just ask one more thing. 
 - What thing?

194
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:00,206
Did the children not get separated

195
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:02,876
from their mother in a timely manner because of that civil servant?

196
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,676
You're the first to report this issue, right?

197
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:07,336
I told you earlier that I'm not doing the interview!

198
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,936
Don't you dare write an article about the children!

199
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,816
I clearly warned you!

200
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,016
 Soo Yeong, who was locked up all day in a small storage closet on the balcony 

201
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:32,176
 and left in negligence without even a drink of water 

202
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:33,646
 proceeds with a dangerous escape 

203
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:36,756
 through the window while her mother is sleeping. 

204
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,886
 The problem is that a week before this incident, 
   

205
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,866
 a child abuse government case worker was 

206
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,006
 sent to the home after receiving a report from a neighbor. 

207
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:47,096
 Despite that, they could have separated the children from the mother then... 

208
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:49,256
That son of a b****!

209
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:51,566
I told you not to report this.

210
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,226
Reporting ethics, my a**!

211
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,776
Do you think it's fine if you use an alias?

212
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:57,436
You even took a picture of the child's home and put it on the air!

213
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:59,976
People could speculate who it is!

214
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,546
Forget everything else.

215
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,626
Just take down the report immediately!

216
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:13,066
But the report spread to other media companies

217
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,746
so I don't think it will do any good taking down that report.

218
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,036
Take a look at this.

219
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,246
It's spread to all the online communities,

220
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:23,816
and people are all cursing and creating a fuss.

221
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:31,466
I mean, that lady did do the wrong thing,

222
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:36,366
but why do I feel bad seeing people curse her out?

223
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:41,356
You're watching how everyone is blaming the failure of a system on one person.

224
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:43,706
Obviously, you won't feel good about it.

225
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:46,806
What do you want to say?

226
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:50,326
At the time of the visit, the child didn't have any visible injuries,

227
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:52,126
and the mother was cooperative.

228
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:53,736
Just looking at that situation alone,

229
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:56,206
I'm asking if it would've been an easy decision for the worker

230
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:58,426
to separate the children from their mother.

231
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:02,086
They are put in those positions to make those decisions.

232
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:06,106
It's more of a problem with the expertise of the field personnel,

233
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:09,566
rather than an individual's neglect of duty.

234
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:15,376
Hey!

235
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,656
O-O-Officer in charge, we also...

236
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:22,696
We were just feeling sorry about this–

237
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:37,336
Ma'am?

238
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,516
Scared me...

239
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,946
Mommy!

240
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:48,346
I thought you might be feeling low on blood sugar.

241
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,426
Thank you...

242
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:57,686
Regarding last time I was too extreme, right?

243
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,036
At that time,

244
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:01,336
I didn't know things were going to blow up like this...

245
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:05,336
Well, it's not like you said anything wrong, either.

246
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:09,056
I...

247
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,166
I was commissioned last October

248
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,906
and left to perform my duties after just forty hours of practical training.

249
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:16,566
But still...

250
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:20,356
I really tried... to do my best...

251
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,836
Oh, God...

252
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:29,456
But even if we separate the children from their parents,

253
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,836
there really isn't any space in the foster shelters.

254
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:36,026
I called each of them and begged them to please take the children.

255
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,636
Even if they do take the children,

256
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:43,646
in the end, they have to send the children back to their homes.

257
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:48,756
I know that I didn't do the right thing, either.

258
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:52,936
I really know that I did the wrong thing...

259
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:58,316
But... what am I supposed to do now?

260
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,666
Unni, I'm so sorry...

261
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,536
You must have gone through so much.

262
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,136
Unni, I'm sorry...

263
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:17,606
- No, I'm the one who's sorry! 
 - Why are you crying?

264
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:20,006
Because it's so sad...

265
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,356
It's sad...

266
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:30,176
 But even if we separate the children from their parents, 

267
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,256
 there really isn't any space in the foster shelters. 

268
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,676
Hello?

269
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,936
Where did you say you are calling from?

270
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:44,736
Soo Yeong's lawyer–

271
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,016
How does everyone get my number to call me?

272
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:51,146
Why would I go on TV?

273
00:15:58,616 --> 00:15:59,966
Why?

274
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,136
What?

275
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:03,146
Are you going nag at me again?

276
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:30,576
Surprise.

277
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:02,096
Hey, I'm the one who rudely hung up on you just now.

278
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,846
I'm Attorney Kim Yoo Ri.

279
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:07,296
That interview... I'll do it.

280
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,546
 Today, we have Assemblyman Ryoo Jin Hwan of the Democratic Party, 

281
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:21,726
 and the attorney who became famous for handling Soo Yeong's case, 

282
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:26,546
 Attorney Kim Yoo Ri, here on set with us to discuss matters regarding this case. 

283
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,016
 - Hello. 
 - Hello. 

284
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,106
What the? Why is she over there?

285
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:35,196
My understanding is that if the situation with the sisters Soo Yeong and Ji Yeong

286
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:38,696
were handled with a bit more care by the case workers in charge,

287
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:42,366
it makes me think it could have been prevented.

288
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:44,986
There already seems to be a growing public opinion

289
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,906
that the official in charge needs to be punished.

290
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:49,096
Do you agree with this sentiment as well, Attorney?

291
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,206
No.

292
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:52,326
To solely place the blame on a low-level official

293
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:55,256
is a bit... cowardly.

294
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:58,056
Oh... I see...

295
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,556
I was like that.

296
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:02,806
The first thing I did was go to the police station and the district office to rage at them.

297
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:06,086
However, someone said this to me;

298
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,306
if you were in their shoes,

299
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,696
if there was no space in the foster shelters

300
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:11,716
and you were going to be held responsible if the parents filed a lawsuit,

301
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,036
would you be able to separate the child from the parent

302
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:17,116
when she showed no visible injuries?

303
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:18,436
What do you think, Assemblyman?

304
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:21,336
Would you be able to separate them or not?

305
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:24,906
- Geez...  Is this a quiz show? 
 -  Well, I... 

306
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,626
-  That's a bit... well...  
 - Goodness...

307
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,556
 I guess that would be a difficult decision to make. 

308
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:33,236
But Assemblyman, why are you sweating so much?

309
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:34,916
No, no, no...

310
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,416
Is it because you are so beautiful, Attorney?

311
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,576
Is there still a guy that says stuff like that?

312
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,526
 Wow, it's pretty hot in here, isn't it? 

313
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:44,636
 It's not hot in here because I am beautiful. It's just hot in here. 

314
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:50,446
 But once again, I feel that this case focuses too much on who was at fault. 

315
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:54,176
Shouldn't we focus more on discussing

316
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,936
how we can better protect children?

317
00:18:55,936 --> 00:19:01,316
Then what are your thoughts on how we can better protect children, Attorney?

318
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:04,196
I've considered this quite a bit.

319
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:05,936
In the end,

320
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:08,916
 it still came down to money. 

321
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,206
Come on now. Just stop. Really?

322
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:12,596
Excuse me?

323
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:16,206
We need to increase the expertise of field personnel and hire more people.

324
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,546
We need to provide support for foster parents

325
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:21,266
and also increase the number of foster shelters and related services.

326
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:22,756
There is so much to be done,

327
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,506
but in order to get them done...

328
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:25,856
This.

329
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:28,476
This is necessary, don't you think?

330
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,466
 Oh, well... yes, I suppose... 

331
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:35,256
 Shouldn't there be a fixed budget at least, Assemblyman? 

332
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,786
All right.

333
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:41,246
What should I do from here?

334
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,016
Which way should I move?

335
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,906
Right or left?

336
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:46,776
- Here! 
 - Okay.

337
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:48,266
- Make sure you put it on nicely. 
 - Oh, really?

338
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:50,166
Wow, that looks pretty!

339
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,646
- Yay! 
 - Wow!

340
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:07,706
- Oh, thank you. 
 - Thank you.

341
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,986
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:14,466
You've had to deal with all the trouble from the news broadcast last time.

343
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,466
And yet again, because of me–

344
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,966
No, you were great on the broadcast.

345
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,876
 - I'm going to put it on first! 
 - No, I'm going to put it on first! 

346
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:22,646
I'm going to put mine on the bottom.

347
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,056
Put these on, too.

348
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,326
Put these on, the big ones.

349
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:27,406
Yes, put the big ones on.

350
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:30,106
The big ones, the big ones.

351
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,256
Put some on the bottom.

352
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:38,770
How's this?

353
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,516
So cute...

354
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,506
   

355
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:56,956
I've waited for this day.

356
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,976
The hard-earned negotiation for fifteen percent.

357
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,306
- Let's go! 
 - Let's do it!

358
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,356
Let's sell!

359
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:09,586
Eggs for 2,000 won, rice puffs for 3,000 won!

360
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:11,056
♫  It was from the start for me  ♫

361
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:14,786
♫  An indescribable feeling  ♫

362
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:17,076
- Everything's finished. 
 - Thank you, Attorney.

363
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,826
- Get home safely! 
 - Thank you.

364
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:22,036
♫  I was afraid you might find out how I feel  ♫

365
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:25,646
♫  The countless things between us  ♫

366
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:29,096
♫  The many awkward days that passed  ♫

367
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:37,396
♫  Now, I want to protect you  ♫

368
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:47,006
 My child told me to come see you after she saw you on broadcast, Attorney. 

369
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,766
Not too long ago,

370
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,696
I was sued for bodily harm.

371
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,596
It appears you've received a suspension of prosecution. 
    

372
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,366
Although you've been declared guilty,

373
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,966
the prosecutor provided you leniency by not handing it over to trial.

374
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:11,066
What legal advice are you here for?

375
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:15,416
I don't know why I have to receive leniency

376
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,956
as a criminal.

377
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:21,896
   

378
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:26,336
I worked as a housekeeper for a year there.

379
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:28,616
The owner of the place

380
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:31,663
had feelings for me,

381
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:35,523
but I was clear in refusing his advances multiple times.

382
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:42,003
Miss Yeong Boon.

383
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,323
 - Wh-Why are you doing this! 
 - Although I kept telling him that I didn't want to, 

384
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,453
 - I told you I don't want this! 
 - He wouldn't listen. 

385
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:48,353
 He said that if I really didn't like him, 

386
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:50,223
 - I should have quit my job 
 - Yeong Boon! 

387
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:54,273
 and the fact that I was still working there showed that I had feelings for him. 

388
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,133
 And that day, 

389
00:22:56,133 --> 00:23:00,033
 - he kept trying to kiss me... 
 - Yeong Boon... I love you. 

390
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:03,683
 I got so scared, and furious. 

391
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:06,873
 And before I knew it, I... 

392
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,403
But doesn't a suspension of prosecution mean

393
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:19,453
that I'm guilty of a crime, but they're showing me mercy?

394
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:23,463
What crime am I guilty of?

395
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:25,293
Then in that situation,

396
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:28,103
should I have just let him do that to me?

397
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,543
In a case like this,

398
00:23:33,543 --> 00:23:36,123
it is possible for you to file a constitutional appeal

399
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:40,323
and apply for a cancellation of the suspension of prosecution.

400
00:23:40,323 --> 00:23:43,753
A constitutional appeal?

401
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:48,703
But with this... even if the constitutional court accepts your case and cancels the suspension of prosecution,

402
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:51,063
there won't be any compensation

403
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,723
aside from being declared innocent, so...

404
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,953
I have...

405
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:06,603
lived as faithfully and as hard-working as I could.

406
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:09,733
But I was so busy working to feed and clothe my children.

407
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,663
As you could probably tell,

408
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:15,273
I haven't been able to do much for myself.

409
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:22,553
But... for me to allow myself to be branded as a criminal,

410
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:30,493
I would feel so sorry for myself who lived faithfully and worked tirelessly.

411
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:45,273
God! You startled me.

412
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:48,003
- Go and bring me back some copies of the court records. 
 - What?

413
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:51,973
At the constitutional court... we're trying to apply for a cancellation of a suspension of prosecution.

414
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:55,383
You know they're quite strict about the deadlines.

415
00:24:55,383 --> 00:24:57,973
So what do you want me to do about it?

416
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:02,743
The deadline for application is within ninety days of receiving the suspension of prosecution.

417
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:05,663
Turns out, the deadline is by next Monday.

418
00:25:05,663 --> 00:25:08,563
Wait, wait! Okay, okay, okay!

419
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:10,103
I-I'll go. I'll go.

420
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:12,923
Really? Will you really do that for me?

421
00:25:13,863 --> 00:25:16,113
It's really just this once, okay?

422
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:22,483
Gosh, this nuisance.

423
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,013
Man, this impulsive mutant moth.

424
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:33,203
Getting involved in something without even looking at deadlines.

425
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:35,313
She's crazy.

426
00:25:58,163 --> 00:26:00,713
   

427
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,393
Yes.

428
00:26:04,453 --> 00:26:05,783
Oh, you came?

429
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:07,793
Please have a seat.

430
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:13,733
This is the file you asked for last time.

431
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,293
As you've asked, I've looked at all of the prosecutors

432
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:23,303
working for the Central District Prosecutors' Office who handled the case involving Dohan Group.

433
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:27,263
Well... it's difficult to make the case that they are part of

434
00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:29,443
Inspector General Kim Seung Woon's line of influence.

435
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:32,493
Do you remember Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kang Hyung Jo in 2018?

436
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:35,193
He was promoted right after taking on the Dohan Biologics case.

437
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:40,493
But Chief Prosecutor Ahn quit as soon as Inspector General entered the office.

438
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:45,203
Maybe the relationship soured over time, but he was probably part of that line back then.

439
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,223
Come on, I'm telling you, it's not like that.

440
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:54,433
Well, for now, we'll keep digging.

441
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:00,023
 Let's just say... 

442
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:04,903
 if you do find something that proves Inspector General's connection to Dohan Group, 

443
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:08,123
 what do you plan to do after that? 

444
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:14,563
Why didn't you pick up your phone all day?

445
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:16,443
Oh, I–

446
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:18,833
I was meeting someone.

447
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,773
Were you... waiting for me?

448
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:24,073
Of course, I waited for you.

449
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:26,393
You were going to bring me copies of the court records at the cafe.

450
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:28,133
What rec–

451
00:27:35,563 --> 00:27:38,773
 This is the file you asked for last time. 

452
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,633
The copies...

453
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:55,533
You did bring them, right?

454
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,903
I d-did, but...

455
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:04,083
Did you find it?

456
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:11,703
Why? You couldn't find it?

457
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:14,033
I went back to the restaurant,

458
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,413
 but they were closed. 

459
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:18,403
   

460
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,373
I'll take responsibility for this.

461
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,553
No, it's okay. What responsibility will you take anyway?

462
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:32,863
You worked hard making copies of the court records for me.

463
00:28:32,863 --> 00:28:34,403
You should go upstairs and sleep.

464
00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:36,193
Unless you have other things to talk to me about.

465
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:38,653
It's dangerous for you to be with me

466
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:40,973
at this time of night, especially with my ulterior motives.

467
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:42,573
Please don't do that.

468
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:44,883
Where did you learn to say those ahjussi-like comments?

469
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:48,943
What do you mean, learn? It all comes straight from my heart.

470
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:52,133
In any case, as far as what happened today... I'll take responsibility.

471
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,993
What are you blabbering on about? "Take responsibility" for what?

472
00:28:54,993 --> 00:28:59,013
I... remember everything.

473
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:00,373
After reading through it once,

474
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:02,343
he's literally memorized the entire record, even with the appeals! He's a monster.

475
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:03,563
Not a human being.

476
00:29:03,563 --> 00:29:05,383
Even back then,

477
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:08,773
he got a look in his eyes when he entered genius mode.

478
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:11,793
It's a look that he gets only when he's intensely focused.

479
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:15,193
Should I describe it as cold or fiery...

480
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:19,733
In any case, he gets this look that just stirs up

481
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:22,433
someone's heart when you look at his eyes.

482
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,543
You scared me.

483
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,553
Should I not do this?

484
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,003
Give me some space!

485
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,253
Unless you want me to forget everything.

486
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:53,323
My goodness. Do you think I'm going to eat you alive?

487
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:55,383
Well, who knows?

488
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:58,013
It could be too dangerous for me to be with you

489
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:00,683
at this time of night when you are filled with ulterior motives.

490
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:02,853
Hey! That's–

491
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:04,723
Okay.

492
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:11,753
Okay.

493
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:13,833
Until the sun comes up, don't cross over here.

494
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,073
Don't even look over it either.

495
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:29,113
Focus. Focus!

496
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,633
♫  An old memory  ♫

497
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:33,730
♫  The two people who are inside that  ♫

498
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:37,623
♫  You and me  ♫

499
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:40,533
♫  Worn out desks  ♫

500
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:48,390
♫  I liked the wind that breezed on top of it  ♫

501
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:52,563
♫  Even the flower blossoming streets of spring  ♫

502
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:54,783
♫  Even the snow-covered alleyways  ♫

503
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:57,933
 Since things turned out this way, I won't hold back and tell you outright. 

504
00:31:57,933 --> 00:31:59,993
 I like you! 

505
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,953
 I don't want to be family with you. 

506
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,033
 I want to be someone else to you. 

507
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:06,520
♫  If it's with you  ♫

508
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:10,433
♫  You're the one and only romance of my heart  ♫

509
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:14,973
Even the way you confess is so you.

510
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:18,903
♫  Like a page out of a book  ♫

511
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:28,030
♫  You're the one and only romance in my life  ♫

512
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:33,243
♫  You are my romance  ♫

513
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,813
Shall we go over there?

514
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:45,133
Geez, seriously!

515
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,663
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri!

516
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:50,993
How many times do I have to say that a milk carton is not a paper product? It's a paper package product!

517
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:54,123
If we recycle this one thing, it's as effective as a twenty-year-old tree–

518
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:57,713
He's officially our attorney at the Law Cafe.

519
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:03,743
Whom?

520
00:33:03,743 --> 00:33:05,133
- You. 
 - Hey...

521
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:07,833
Why? Why me?

522
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:10,523
   

523
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:16,813
I had no idea I'd come to a place like this in my life.

524
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:20,453
It means you made an amazing choice.

525
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:25,063
It means that in order to protect your rights that have been violated, you've come this far.

526
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:29,403
So you must take a picture when you come to this spot.

527
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,123
Kim Jeong Ho!

528
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:37,133
Let's go.

529
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:40,213
   

530
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:43,763
Here I go. Two, three.

531
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,273
One more time. Up close. 
    

532
00:33:48,023 --> 00:33:50,093
One, two, three.

533
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:51,463
   

534
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,993
One more time! Up close, tightly!

535
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:56,123
Please hold this.

536
00:34:07,783 --> 00:34:11,113
I did that because I liked her.

537
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:15,973
No matter how different the world may be,

538
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:19,373
what's the big deal with a man kissing a woman he likes?

539
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:20,903
How could you say it was sexual harassment?

540
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:24,513
Then how else would I express my feelings?

541
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:27,393
I'm sure you know this well, Young Lady.

542
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:30,163
You sure are pretty.

543
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:33,103
I'm sure guys... you know...

544
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,983
jump on you and stuff, right?

545
00:34:34,983 --> 00:34:37,013
Aren't I right?

546
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:50,223
So if I like you, Ahjussi, it's okay to kiss you and stuff?

547
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:52,283
C-C-Crazy...

548
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:54,203
What the hell!

549
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:56,023
What the hell are you doing?

550
00:34:56,023 --> 00:35:00,963
No matter how much you like her, if she says no, it's not wooing.

551
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:02,623
It's a crime.

552
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:06,333
If you got probation by begging the court for forgiveness,

553
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,963
you must've gone through two-week treatment for sexual violence.

554
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:10,453
If you're still this bad,

555
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:13,273
are you not willing to learn, or are you just stupid?

556
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:15,333
Who the hell are you!

557
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,190
Ahjussi, who I am is not important.

558
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:23,093
Hey, tell him what you came to say.

559
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:25,233
Tell him why you came here.

560
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,863
Okay.

561
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:32,603
You filed a compensation for damages lawsuit against the victim.

562
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:35,133
You're not going to pursue that, are you?

563
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,313
Why wouldn't I? Huh?

564
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:41,173
You have no idea the hell I went through because of that ignorant woman.

565
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,033
Here, here. Look here.

566
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:46,573
She threw a scorching hot stone pot at a perfectly fine person!

567
00:35:46,573 --> 00:35:49,323
Is that something a sane person would do?

568
00:35:49,323 --> 00:35:53,013
I will get the cost of treatment for this and psychological damage—

569
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,693
I'll get it all– S***.

570
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:57,203
I'll get her to pay for all that!

571
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:59,533
It wouldn't be enough if the victim pursued a lawsuit against you.

572
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,173
There isn't a case where the perpetrator has filed a suit and has won.

573
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:06,323
Geez, she really doesn't get it.

574
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:09,643
I'm the victim of the crime of bodily harm.

575
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:11,893
She's the perpetrator. A perpetrator.

576
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:12,743
Yes.

577
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:16,273
So speaking of, Ms. Yeong Boon went to the Constitutional Court today

578
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:18,983
and filed a constitutional appeal on the suspension of prosecution.

579
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:22,163
To put it simply, I'm saying this ridiculous situation

580
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:28,353
where you've become the victim will be cleaned up very soon.

581
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,553
What?

582
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:30,723
That's why...

583
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:34,023
we came to talk to you about a more amicable way to settle this matter.

584
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:38,153
Well, it doesn't look like you're interested in that at all.

585
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:40,163
So all the lewd and wooing texts you sent to

586
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:43,843
Kang Yeong Boon's cellphone, regardless of the time of the day.

587
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:45,733
- Here's more. 
 - You looked up her address and went to her house

588
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:49,013
and stalked her at her other workplaces. All of those behaviors

589
00:36:49,013 --> 00:36:51,383
caused anxiety for her, continuous torment,

590
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:52,743
violation of enforcement of stalking punishment act,

591
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,333
crime of obscene use of communication media,

592
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,883
violation of the privacy act...

593
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,323
- What else? 
 - Attempted trespassing.

594
00:36:58,323 --> 00:37:00,263
Right. Including attempted trespassing.

595
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:01,873
Everything!

596
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:03,993
I'll gather everything!

597
00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:05,833
And sue you for every single offense.

598
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,783
Since you already have red writing* on your record, 
  (Criminal offense in one's record) 

599
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:11,163
why don't you just write up a notebook while you're at it!

600
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:17,053
So were you going to meet that jerk alone if I hadn't come with you?

601
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:18,103
 You're not the one for me. 

602
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,473
 No matter how much you like her, if she says no, 

603
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:21,853
 it's not wooing. It's a crime. 

604
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:26,273
 For me, that kiss is illegal. It's cheating! 

605
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:27,683
What?

606
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:29,453
Hey, Kim Yoo Ri.

607
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,453
Talk to me.

608
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,033
No. I have to go somewhere. You go home alone.

609
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:38,313
What?

610
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:40,153
Where are you going by yourself?

611
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:43,473
Wh– Hey, Kim Yoo Ri, where are you going?

612
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:46,043
Hey– What? Hey!

613
00:37:46,843 --> 00:37:48,023
Hey, where are you going?

614
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:49,993
Hey, hey!

615
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,033
S-She–

616
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:56,103
She does whatever she wants to do more and more!

617
00:37:56,103 --> 00:37:57,303
So precious!

618
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:59,653
Sleepy, are you?

619
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,863
So what is it you want to say?

620
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,283
Say what?

621
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,623
I can tell right away you're dying to tell me what's on your mind.

622
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,253
Do you think I don't know you?

623
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,313
Right?

624
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:13,043
Right?

625
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:17,063
Well I heard this from a friend.

626
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:21,853
Someone confessed her feelings to someone who's been friends

627
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:23,443
just like you and Do Jin Ki.

628
00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:25,393
But then he turned her down.

629
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:29,673
The problem is before she confessed to him,

630
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:34,213
she first kissed him.

631
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:36,223
Kiss?

632
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:39,863
Hey! Who woos so rudely like that these days?

633
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:41,653
Telling the person how you feel through a kiss

634
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,403
is done when you're 99.9% sure about his feelings.

635
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,873
How different is that from sexual harassment?

636
00:38:47,873 --> 00:38:49,833
But still...

637
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:53,233
It's not like she was 99.9% sure, but...

638
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:57,403
he must've given her some type of sign for her to kiss him, don't you think?

639
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:59,813
What kind of signs were there?

640
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:02,623
I mean she's running a business,

641
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:04,603
and she went through some hard times lately.

642
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,693
I heard he totally took care of her.

643
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:10,543
He usually concerns himself about her affairs a lot

644
00:39:10,543 --> 00:39:12,623
- and runs over to her. 
 - Hey.

645
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:15,453
Because of people who misunderstand small kindness and think everyone likes them,

646
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,983
this world is becoming harsher.

647
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:19,623
How could anyone help anyone? For the fear that they'd misunderstand?

648
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,133
In my opinion, he's not interested in her at all 100%, but

649
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,103
she's freaking out all by herself.

650
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:25,473
Right?

651
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,093
Right?

652
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:33,043
Happy, happy, law! Yay!

653
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:35,063
Oh, Boss!

654
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:36,603
- Hello. 
 - Come and have a drink!

655
00:39:36,603 --> 00:39:38,363
Gosh, no. I can't drink.

656
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:39,543
Pour some beer.

657
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,043
- Pour. 
 - No, no...

658
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:46,933
Stop. Okay...

659
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:52,293
Here. Have a drink.

660
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:53,573
Bottoms up!

661
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:55,313
Bottoms up!

662
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:56,953
Bottoms up!

663
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:59,143
Bottoms up!

664
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,843
Bottoms up!

665
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:02,543
Bottoms up!

666
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:04,273
Bottoms up!

667
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:08,193
Bottoms up!

668
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,223
You drink well!

669
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,193
I broke...

670
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:26,743
Criminal Code...

671
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:30,623
Article 298...

672
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,843
What in the world is she talking about since earlier?

673
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,223
2.98 million won?

674
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,563
What? Did you borrow money?

675
00:40:36,563 --> 00:40:38,203
The criminal code...

676
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,863
Article 298...

677
00:40:40,863 --> 00:40:43,803
I think she's talking about Article 298.

678
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:45,583
What was it again?

679
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:51,423
Sexual assault.

680
00:40:51,423 --> 00:40:54,553
   

681
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,853
So how did you know that, Hyungnim?

682
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:59,433
That's my drink.

683
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:02,923
Why?

684
00:41:02,923 --> 00:41:06,733
Why? Why don't you even let me drink?

685
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:14,153
No more... please give me a drink...

686
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:17,533
A drink.

687
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:19,983
Please give me a drink!

688
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:22,273
Please give me a drink!

689
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,203
Boss!

690
00:41:24,203 --> 00:41:26,303
Wake up!

691
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:29,123
 Please hurry up and go home. 

692
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,733
 I'll call Hyungnim. 

693
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:32,493
 Boss! 

694
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,313
 Boss! 

695
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:37,513
 This shirt... 

696
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:40,293
 Do you want to take it off, or should I take it off for you? 

697
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:43,413
 As you like it. 

698
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:25,487
All right, I'm wearing my pants.

699
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:27,267
I'm wearing my pants, I said.

700
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:31,227
It's a good sign. It means I didn't completely self-destruct.

701
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:33,547
I was totally screwed.

702
00:42:33,547 --> 00:42:36,577
 May 7, 2022! 

703
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:38,147
 Around 8 a.m., 

704
00:42:38,147 --> 00:42:42,037
 in front of Hongsan Police station, without your consent, 

705
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:44,547
 I kissed you twice– 

706
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:47,927
 Kim Yoo Ri, Kim Yoo Ri, okay! Stop right there! 

707
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:50,607
 You're embarrassing me in front of the neighbors. Please stop. 

708
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,847
 Criminal Code, Article 298. 

709
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:55,517
 It could also fall under sexual assault. 

710
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,877
 - Regarding such behaviour– 
 - Yoo Ri! 

711
00:42:57,877 --> 00:43:00,197
 - I'm deeply regretful. 
 - You– 

712
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:03,007
 Please don't sue me! 

713
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,087
 Just don't sue me... 

714
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:22,257
♫  Can't I love you?  ♫

715
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:25,727
♫  If you love me  ♫

716
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:32,337
♫  Can't you just understand how I feel?  ♫

717
00:43:32,337 --> 00:43:33,797
 Come. 

718
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:35,547
 What's wrong with you! 

719
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:37,627
 Gosh, one more glass... 

720
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:40,637
 You can't even control alcohol. Why bother drinking? 

721
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:43,037
 Oh! Hey, wait, wait, wait! 

722
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,497
 Wait, wait, wait, wait! 

723
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,327
No! Don't!

724
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:49,177
Don't do it, Kim Yoo Ri!

725
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,897
 Gosh, really! 

726
00:43:57,818 --> 00:44:00,887
 Hey, Kim Yoo Ri, come to your senses. 

727
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:13,297
 Do you want to take this shirt off, or should I take it off for you? 

728
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:18,127
 As you... like it. 

729
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:22,667
 Hey, Kim Yoo Ri! 

730
00:44:35,067 --> 00:44:36,867
 Take this! 

731
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:35,537
Because of the way you look at me,

732
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,027
I keep having dokibyung.*
  (Misunderstanding that someone/everyone likes you) 

733
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,207
I keep misunderstanding and stuff...

734
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:45,617
I apologize for what happened last night.

735
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:49,137
Really. I have nothing to say even if you kick me out.

736
00:45:53,157 --> 00:45:54,897
Hey, forget it.

737
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:56,667
It's not your fault. It was the alcohol.

738
00:45:56,667 --> 00:46:00,417
No. I've been caught up in my feelings only all this time.

739
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:04,577
I'm sorry I've been pressuring you, offending you, and bothering you.

740
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,447
Wh-Why are you apologizing so seriously like this?

741
00:46:10,447 --> 00:46:13,177
It wasn't the first time you freaked out after drinking.

742
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,617
No. I'm not talking about that.

743
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:19,357
About last time when I kiss-

744
00:46:24,777 --> 00:46:26,267
K-K-Kiss–

745
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:27,897
K-Ki-Kiss what?

746
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:30,657
Just spit it out.

747
00:46:34,097 --> 00:46:36,817
I'm sorry for kissing you without your consent!

748
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:43,827
Well...

749
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:48,537
I get that you have no feelings for me.

750
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:53,107
I won't bother you like that anymore.

751
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:17,770
♫  After the long rain passed through that seemed like it would never stop  ♫

752
00:47:19,057 --> 00:47:25,587
♫  After the long rain passed through that seemed like it would never stop  ♫

753
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:28,007
♫  I think of the expression on your face you could not hide  ♫

754
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:31,457
But you know I can't give up on you yet.

755
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:34,257
I know that the way I've been approaching this is all wrong.

756
00:47:34,257 --> 00:47:36,867
I won't cut corners anymore from now on.

757
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:41,547
I'll approach you, considering your feelings seriously, too.

758
00:47:41,547 --> 00:47:44,497
Give me a little bit more chances.

759
00:47:44,497 --> 00:47:51,660
♫  I don't think it's dry from the rain yet  ♫

760
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:59,267
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

761
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:05,837
♫  Like the snowfall from early dawn  ♫

762
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:13,370
♫  If I could see your heart  ♫

763
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:19,637
♫  If I could  ♫

764
00:48:19,637 --> 00:48:25,587
What would be the mature way to get closer to someone you like?

765
00:48:27,607 --> 00:48:30,147
Well, I mean...

766
00:48:30,147 --> 00:48:35,667
Recently, I had a victim of sexual assault as a client.

767
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:40,917
I met the perpetrator, and he was so brazen and said, "I did it because I liked her."

768
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,067
It made me wonder what would be

769
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:49,827
a way to express your feelings without pressuring the other person too much.

770
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:51,347
I see...

771
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:56,357
I think the easiest and the best way

772
00:48:57,357 --> 00:49:01,727
is asking the other person directly.

773
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:04,097
"Can I hold your hand?"

774
00:49:04,097 --> 00:49:07,037
"Can I kiss you?"

775
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:14,157
I thought that question was so old-fashioned and tacky, but my heart just fluttered.

776
00:49:14,157 --> 00:49:15,687
And?

777
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:17,737
Up until recently, people said, "No means no."

778
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:22,157
People used to say if they say no, it means no.

779
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:24,087
But nowadays, you go one more step.

780
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:25,987
People say, "Yes means yes."

781
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:28,137
"Yes means yes."

782
00:49:28,137 --> 00:49:34,097
Yes, so, all other answers besides "yes" means "no."

783
00:49:35,797 --> 00:49:40,387
So if you don't know how the other person feels, never assume.

784
00:49:40,387 --> 00:49:43,217
Just express your feelings with clear words.

785
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:46,157
And if the other person still expresses rejection,

786
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:52,817
well, the best thing we could do is to ask again.

787
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:58,037
"Would it be okay if I waited for you?"

788
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,597
If the person also says "no" to this question,

789
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:05,577
it'd be sad, but I think it's only right to keep that feeling to oneself.

790
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:09,140
I see...

791
00:50:09,867 --> 00:50:13,537
Gosh. It's so sad.

792
00:50:13,537 --> 00:50:16,057
So as for me, before I can get rejected,

793
00:50:16,057 --> 00:50:19,667
I tend to keep my feelings to myself beforehand.

794
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,077
As I cry every night.

795
00:50:22,077 --> 00:50:23,597
I don't think so.

796
00:50:23,597 --> 00:50:25,577
If you find someone you like,

797
00:50:25,577 --> 00:50:28,167
I think you'll rush into things recklessly.

798
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,167
Not at all.

799
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:31,587
I'm not that brave.

800
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:34,427
Oh, yes. Did you know that thanks to you,

801
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:37,167
Attorney, my office has many more patients?

802
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,627
- Really? 
 - Yes.

803
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:42,977
I guess they come for legal consultation and also receive therapy.

804
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:45,097
Wow...

805
00:50:45,097 --> 00:50:48,947
While we're at it, why don't we just form a partnership?

806
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:51,967
First of all, open up a YouTube channel,

807
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:54,420
and we can offer our services together, make tons of money,

808
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,430
and open up an office in Gangnam!

809
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,957
Sounds nice. What business ratio?

810
00:50:58,957 --> 00:51:01,287
Of course, 6:4.

811
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:03,287
That won't work.

812
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:14,887
   

813
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:16,877
   

814
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:25,377
- Geez! Scared me! 
 - CEO?

815
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,447
What in the world am I seeing?

816
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,687
Where did you get a cap that's off season?

817
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,507
Hurry and sit down.

818
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:34,157
You never know who's watching us.

819
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:38,697
Are you filming a spy movie by yourself these days?

820
00:51:38,697 --> 00:51:40,137
Is someone watching you and stuff?

821
00:51:40,137 --> 00:51:43,477
There are too many psychos around me lately.

822
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:46,407
There is nothing to lose by being careful.

823
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:48,527
Not any worse than people around me.

824
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:51,727
- There are crazier people than you? 
 - Geez!

825
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:58,337
You know, some psycho came to my cafe and left a big mess last time.

826
00:51:59,147 --> 00:52:03,107
So why did you mess with Dohan Construction?

827
00:52:03,107 --> 00:52:06,947
Why do you look so shocked? You knew this already.

828
00:52:06,947 --> 00:52:08,757
They're total psychos!

829
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:11,057
What did I do for them to take it that far?

830
00:52:11,057 --> 00:52:14,287
- They even killed a dog! 
 - Yoo Ri.

831
00:52:14,997 --> 00:52:19,697
What is your real reason for disturbing Dohan Construction?

832
00:52:19,697 --> 00:52:23,417
Is it because of your father's incident?

833
00:52:24,127 --> 00:52:25,787
Did you do a background check on me?

834
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:27,797
Just answer me.

835
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:30,667
No. It's not because of my father.

836
00:52:30,667 --> 00:52:32,627
They built such sucky building that

837
00:52:32,627 --> 00:52:37,177
I had so many clients suffering from the noise in the building. That's why.

838
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:45,587
Read it.

839
00:52:45,587 --> 00:52:48,337
You'll enjoy the story, too.

840
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:55,737
   

841
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:59,347
Geez! How could you break into my–

842
00:52:59,347 --> 00:53:02,607
Geez. He sure was Lee Pyeon Woong's gofer.

843
00:53:02,607 --> 00:53:05,437
There's this Manager Han Joo Wan, working under Lee Pyeon Woong.

844
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:07,637
Everything was revealed when I lifted the lid off of his hood.* 
  (Looking into his background) 

845
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:10,617
Why are you going in there?

846
00:53:10,617 --> 00:53:14,327
There's this guy Park Sung Joon. He's a junkie with five criminal records.

847
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:15,757
Besides that,

848
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:18,397
he's got assault, robbery, fraud...

849
00:53:18,397 --> 00:53:20,727
He's got quite a variety of criminal history.

850
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:23,937
He was in Cheongsong Penitentiary in 2015. 
    

851
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:26,947
Yes. He was in the same prison cell as Manager Han.

852
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:28,377
Look at this a**hole.

853
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:29,987
Ever since he met Manager Han,

854
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:33,927
you can see for yourself that his criminal record got much fancier.

855
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:36,787
So he does whatever you want as long as you give him drugs.

856
00:53:36,787 --> 00:53:39,917
   

857
00:53:52,507 --> 00:53:54,207
Excuse me.

858
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:05,387
Is it you?

859
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:09,347
I thought people don't meet face to face these days.

860
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:11,647
You must've been in a rush.

861
00:54:13,037 --> 00:54:15,287
Cut the bulls***.

862
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:18,897
The thing. Hurry up and hand over the thing.

863
00:54:43,557 --> 00:54:45,667
Who the hell are you? A cop?

864
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:48,057
You pull out a knife asking me if I'm a law enforcement?

865
00:54:48,057 --> 00:54:49,787
You just doubled your sentence.

866
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,097
So who the hell are you?

867
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:02,207
Who am I?

868
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:04,447
I'm the dog owner.

869
00:55:05,297 --> 00:55:07,347
You s***!

870
00:55:14,037 --> 00:55:15,277
My apologies.

871
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:17,277
He's forcing himself in here...

872
00:55:17,277 --> 00:55:19,007
Whom?

873
00:55:19,647 --> 00:55:21,847
You can't go in there!

874
00:55:37,357 --> 00:55:40,467
Oh, who is this?

875
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:42,907
It's our prosecutor.

876
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:44,827
What?

877
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:46,787
Get out.

878
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:50,617
We're close! Go!

879
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:54,057
Wait a minute...

880
00:55:54,057 --> 00:55:57,237
Aigoo, when was the last time we saw each other?

881
00:55:57,237 --> 00:56:00,267
Oh! I saw you last in your prosecutor's office.

882
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:02,567
You were freaking out wanting to investigate Dohan Construction,

883
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,967
failed, and got demoted...

884
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:09,467
So why did you drag that in here?

885
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:15,957
When you're at your f***ing age, the inferior complex and things.

886
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:17,987
Don't people usually overcome stuff like that?

887
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:20,837
You should receive some therapy or something.

888
00:56:22,107 --> 00:56:25,177
I did see some doctors, you know.

889
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:29,037
They tell me it's too late for me.

890
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:30,787
I...

891
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,757
I can't be restored.

892
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:38,767
Whether you torment yourself or people around, I don't give a s***!

893
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:44,437
But don't you dare mess with people around me.

894
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:48,367
You don't have to beat around the bush.

895
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:51,697
You're talking about Attorney Kim Yoo Ri, right?

896
00:56:51,697 --> 00:56:54,127
Don't say that name with that mouth of yours.

897
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:55,917
Why not?

898
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:59,167
Well, do I have to play with something else?

899
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:03,897
Oh, Kim Yoo Ri, that girl... Is she yours?

900
00:57:05,707 --> 00:57:08,677
Geez, man! You can't say what's yours and mine between family members!

901
00:57:08,677 --> 00:57:11,107
We should all... you know... share...

902
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:15,927
So what... do you... do while playing with her?

903
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,457
Let me be in on it, too...

904
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:19,707
You crazy a**hole!

905
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:20,897
Okay. Okay!

906
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:24,587
Hey! Really, I told them to just play a little bit and stop...

907
00:57:24,587 --> 00:57:28,487
but... that girl... I kept noticing that girl...

908
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,487
Gosh, she's really pretty.

909
00:57:37,717 --> 00:57:40,757
I thought you were just trashy. You're not even f***ing human.

910
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:44,727
Yeah! I told you, I'm lost cause, Jeong Ho!

911
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:56,747
You think you're the only crazy one, huh?

912
00:57:56,747 --> 00:57:59,182
Listen up.

913
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:02,902
I'm not interested in sending bastards like you to the slammer, either.

914
00:58:03,656 --> 00:58:06,676
If you mess with Kim Yoo Ri once more,

915
00:58:06,676 --> 00:58:09,346
all these things you own,

916
00:58:09,346 --> 00:58:12,606
all the things you wanted to own...

917
00:58:12,606 --> 00:58:14,726
I'll shred all of them to pieces.

918
00:58:14,726 --> 00:58:16,756
Man, how could you talk to your uncle–

919
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:19,336
So please!

920
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:24,366
Let's not mess with each other.

921
00:58:26,876 --> 00:58:28,876
I give up.

922
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:48,816
What? What happened to your face...

923
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,986
Did you get into a fight?

924
00:59:04,436 --> 00:59:06,086
Oh, sorry.

925
00:59:06,086 --> 00:59:07,416
No means no.

926
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:09,536
I forgot again.

927
00:59:09,536 --> 00:59:11,546
Wait.

928
00:59:12,586 --> 00:59:17,800
♫  After the long rain passed through that seemed like it would never stop  ♫

929
00:59:18,796 --> 00:59:24,716
♫  After the long rain passed through that seemed like it would never stop  ♫

930
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:26,626
I know I shouldn't, but...

931
00:59:26,626 --> 00:59:31,056
♫  I think of the expression on your face you could not hide  ♫

932
00:59:31,056 --> 00:59:33,636
I know this will confuse you, but...

933
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:37,646
♫  I fall into deep thoughts  ♫

934
00:59:37,646 --> 00:59:40,876
I'm having a tough day...

935
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:44,286
♫  Empty streets, my heart disturbed  ♫

936
00:59:44,286 --> 00:59:48,256
♫  I don't think it's dry from the rain yet  ♫

937
00:59:48,256 --> 00:59:51,496
Can I hug you?

938
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:53,616
For a moment.

939
00:59:53,616 --> 00:59:57,196
♫  Like the rain that fell throughout the long night  ♫

940
00:59:57,196 --> 00:59:59,106
I asked if I could hug you.

941
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:05,686
♫  Like the snowfall from early dawn  ♫

942
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:13,296
♫  If I could see your heart  ♫

943
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:16,456
♫  If I could  ♫

944
01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:23,410
♫  It would be so nice if I could  ♫

945
01:00:28,326 --> 01:00:38,670
♫  I wonder where you are looking at standing behind me  ♫

946
01:00:41,526 --> 01:00:47,926
♫  If you come one step closer to me  ♫

947
01:00:47,926 --> 01:00:51,700
♫  This rain would stop, too  ♫

948
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:57,026


949
01:00:57,026 --> 01:01:03,246
♫  I will become an umbrella for you  ♫

950
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:09,836
♫  So I could cover whatever pain you feel  ♫

951
01:01:09,836 --> 01:01:16,970
♫  If I could let you know this heart of mine  ♫

952
01:01:18,886 --> 01:01:22,156
♫  If I could  ♫

953
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:26,256
♫  It would've been so nice if I did  ♫

954
01:01:26,256 --> 01:01:29,206
   

955
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:31,436
 I'll take care of the cafe. Just rest. 

956
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:32,216
 How nice of you. 

957
01:01:32,216 --> 01:01:33,986
 Are you looking down on me because I haven't done this? 

958
01:01:33,986 --> 01:01:35,066
 Imprisonment up to two years. 

959
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,836
 It felt like she was being sentence by a prosecutor, not receiving counsel. 

960
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:43,236
 I found the Whee-seul-Blower. 

961
01:01:43,236 --> 01:01:48,066
 - Hey! 
 - So getting rid of those jerks is doing good for the world. 

962
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:50,736
