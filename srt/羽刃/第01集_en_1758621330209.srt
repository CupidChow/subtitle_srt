1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Just go to 602-Pingam to get your tildes and

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:19,240
you can change your germs and

3
00:00:49,240 --> 00:01:17,120
The Gongle

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Foreign

5
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Foreign

6
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Every day, I live in the pain of being tortured by nightmares.

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,120
I want to save me.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Raise your head.

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Welcome to the lucky game.

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,120
My only way out is to follow him to find my last ten fingers.

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,120
The Lucky Game

12
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Every year, there is entertainment and every year, there is a surprise.

13
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Welcome to the most mysterious and gorgeous game of the year, the lucky game.

14
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Let us welcome the lucky girl from the last generation, Xiao Ya.

15
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Today, you have the first chance to rewrite your name in your life.

16
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,120
You are no longer a daughter of the deceased, or a label of the deceased.

17
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,120
You are the master of your own destiny.

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Even if you were injured in the past, you can turn over and rewrite your name.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Your name does not belong to destiny.

20
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,120
She belongs only to you.

21
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,120
So the code on the drawing can be entered into the lucky game. Is it true?

22
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,120
The lucky girl who is elected can go to the lucky room to make a wish.

23
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
The room number 8 can fulfill all her dreams.

24
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Next, the lucky score begins.

25
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
The Prime Minister, Yi Tai, Cai Zhi.

26
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
The lucky girl from the lucky game is here.

27
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Okay.

28
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Make it tighter.

29
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Thank you for your wonderful performance.

30
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Let us welcome the last player, Liu Ying Ying.

31
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Why did you come to the lucky game?

32
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Hello, everyone. My name is Liu Ying Ying.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Please let me stay here.

34
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Because I really have no way out.

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
My father is a gambling addict.

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
He owes a lot of money.

37
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
My mother has also left.

38
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,120
I really don't want to be bullied for the rest of my life.

39
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:21,120
I heard that as long as you come to the lucky game, you can change your life.

40
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,120
If you choose me, I will be very obedient.

41
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Very obedient.

42
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Please let me stay here.

43
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
The highest score in the first round of the lucky game is Liu Ying Ying.

44
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Thank you.

45
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Thank you.

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
You have worked hard.

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
You are more hard.

48
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
What do you mean?

49
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
I heard that you did what the public told you to do.

50
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,120
You did what you didn't tell me to do.

51
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Mrs. Lin, you have to look at the master.

52
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
You work for Young Master Gong.

53
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
I work for Young Master Gong.

54
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
We should be water-loving.

55
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
The lucky game is not only the business of the Gong family.

56
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,300
It is also the business of the New

57
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,120
News.

58
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,120
If something goes wrong, I want to see if Young Master Gong will come to me for help because of your dog.

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,120
And your hair smells really strong.

60
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Your hair smells really strong.

61
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Ying Ying.

62
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Congratulations.

63
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Tonight is the highest score in the whole factory.

64
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Come on.

65
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Drink one.

66
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I don't know how to drink.

67
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
The enemy is Bai Cheng.

68
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
I am in charge of the lucky game.

69
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,120
I can introduce you to some rich bosses.

70
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Then you are the first.

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
It will be more stable.

72
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Thank you.

73
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Don't do anything bad.

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Don't make trouble.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Who do you think you are?

76
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,120
You let Brother Cheng wait for so long.

77
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
How did Cheng teach you?

78
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Treat the beauty with medicine.

79
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Yes.

80
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,120
The girls here are all for going up.

81
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Brother doesn't mind being your step.

82
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Don't forget me when you are in trouble.

83
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Come on.

84
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Drink one.

85
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
You didn't drink this.

86
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Is the alcohol level so low?

87
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Do you want me to send you back to your room?

88
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
No.

89
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
No.

90
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Don't touch me.

91
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
What are you doing?

92
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
I am sorry.

93
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120

Coco, you want to die?

97
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,120
You are not in charge of the whole city.

98
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
You came to me to do something.

99
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
I am sorry.

100
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
You...

101
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Who are you?

102
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
I am sorry.
