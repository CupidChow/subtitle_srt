1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
**Intro music**

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,240
Alors nationals

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You want to be discovered?

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's you.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Where is this?

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is a secret room.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've been in the Entertainment City for so long.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I've never been here.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But we're late.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Look.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There are many traces of wires.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It seems like they've installed some electronic equipment.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It could be a surveillance room.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It could also be a lab.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's clear that you're working inside the Entertainment City.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're also from the Entertainment City.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why are you investigating his blood?

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What about you?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why would a person who lost his memory

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
be so interested in a person who's never been born?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because I think Xiaoya shouldn't die.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She won't commit suicide.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is the equipment you lied to me about.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have more clues.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You take me to the city.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll tell you.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll go with you.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
From that place to here,

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
there's a two-story building.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When I saw her,

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
she disappeared.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Maybe someone was after her.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
At that time, Xiaoya was already very weak.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But the murderer didn't catch her.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I like to see the prey being scared.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She's been sitting here.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The window is very high.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The extinguisher wasn't here.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Someone dragged it here.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's footprints on it.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is the original position of the extinguisher.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is the last trace of her jumping.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You mean she wasn't dragged away?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not her.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But she just became a lucky girl.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How could she commit suicide?

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
She has a lot of wounds.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is the doubt.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Someone must have forced her to jump.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We don't have any evidence.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Maybe.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This place is obviously unreasonable.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Did someone drag Xiaoya away?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Something is missing.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sure there's something pink on her head.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But when she fell from the stairs,

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
there was nothing on her head.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you sure she was the one in the dark?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You don't believe me?

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Liu Yiying, you'll be in danger if you keep investigating.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Will you help me?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Me?

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When?

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When you were testing your courage,

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you helped me.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you don't help me,

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll tell the others in the entertainment city

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that you're investigating Xiaoya's death.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're very brave.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Will you help me or not?

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You go and check.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll help you ask the supervisor.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are you doing?

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Xiaoya likes white.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You also think she didn't kill herself, right?

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She's already dead once.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How could she kill herself?

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What did she experience?

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't expect you to find the truth.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I just hope that in this world,

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
there's one person who misunderstands her.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
My life ended by that river.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It started from there.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sister.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Sister.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sister.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't come over.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I have something for you.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't come over.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sister, this is my favorite hair clip.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's for you.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your favorite?

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why didn't you keep it yourself?

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sick.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't wear it.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mom said that living is the best.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I want to be a good kid.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You too, right?

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll help you wear it.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't cry.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're going to be good girls.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sister, if I'm not here,

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you can't cry or surrender.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I've found a way to save you.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
As long as you become a lucky girl,

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you can fulfill all your wishes.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You'll meet them all.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So she's always wearing that hair clip.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's the hope that Xin Xin gave her.

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But the person who has hope

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
is not the one who can save her.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But the person who has hope

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
won't kill herself.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Can you tell me what the hair clip on her head looks like?

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There must be some clue

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
related to the hair clip.

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm afraid that I can't see it.
