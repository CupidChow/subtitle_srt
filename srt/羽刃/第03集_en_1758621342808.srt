00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,540
welcome centre for the media.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't cry, don't cry.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't cry, don't cry.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Can I ask you a question?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're already asking.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The ring on my neck

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is very tight.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Can you help me adjust it?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You'd better not do this.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just adjust a little bit.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Please.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you pretend to be poor again, I'll just adjust it to the lowest level for you.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's much more comfortable. I knew you were a newbie.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
By the way, will this photo album affect the results of the courage test?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No way. They're looking for people in the dark. It's the sound.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're talking to me?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not. I don't know what you're talking about.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Liu Ying Ying enters the test. If you don't get caught by the man in black and find the exit, you win.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Remember, you have to stay elegant at all times.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can do it. I'll find my memories. I won't waste my time.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The dark is not scary. This is just a game. I won't get trapped.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The dark is not scary. This is just a game. I won't waste my time.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The dark is not scary. This is just a game. I won't waste my time.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The dark is not scary. This is just a game. I won't waste my time.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Open the door. Hurry up. I want to come in.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He belongs to you.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's Xiaoya. Why is he here?

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can be a lucky girl if I pass.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
20 steps forward, 2 steps left.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How did he do that? He scared me to death. I thought he was a running man.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Congratulations on passing the courage test, Miss Liu Ying Ying.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I...I saw a...

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why is this wound exactly the same shape as the water drop in my dream?

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Be quiet! Don't talk nonsense about Xiaoya's suicide. Go back to your room if you have nothing else to do.

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Suicide? How is that possible? He just became a lucky girl yesterday.

51
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What nonsense are you talking about? He's a running man. Don't you see that?

52
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's there to say? Go back to your room.

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If he's a suicide, why does he have a strange wound on his body?

54
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Liu Ying Ying.

55
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why is there a wound?

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What do you want to say? You want to say someone is raping him, right?

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is too dangerous. I don't want to be a lucky girl. I want to go.

58
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't go.

59
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Stand there!

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What are you doing?

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Bai Cheng!

62
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is not the time for you to make trouble.

63
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Listen up. The lucky draw is not the school or the charity center.

64
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If the Entertainment Center can fulfill your dream, it can destroy everything.

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It seems that I can only find the truth by myself.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I was standing on the wall and counted 30 heartbeats.

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When the man in black came, I was hiding in this corner.

68
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then Xiaoya appeared in front of me.

69
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm afraid I can't reach the top. I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm afraid I

70
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,080
I cut him in unterwegs

71
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,280
i

72
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,920
Give him my head

73
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,800
He derivates my hands

74
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,520
The past is only a stone

75
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,040
I didn't dare to snot

76
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,680
Can't get I read the cr· Robert

77
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
He です

78
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,000
I
