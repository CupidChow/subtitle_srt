18 year old girl

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Take the raincoat immediately

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Search

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sleep

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Little crow

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why?

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The people who chase you only recognize the necklace

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Not face

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know why they want to chase you

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But I know

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You will be in danger

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I took your necklace

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And they took it away

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then I lost my memory

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So you took the necklace

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In my place

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I really have no way

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I know

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I know in the dark place

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How scary it is to be locked up

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't want you to go through this

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want you to go through this

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Go

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's leave here

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've been in the entertainment city for three years

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just to find you

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now I found you

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We don't have to stay here

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There are some things in the cave

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think you should go and have a look

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's so touching

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You are still protecting her

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Remove the

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You lied to me

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sorry, Keke

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I just want to survive

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Survive?

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If it wasn't for me

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You would have been in the department

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And die on the first day

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I never let you save me

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If it wasn't for you

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Maybe I wouldn't have happened

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
On the list

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Xiaoyu.

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,240
Three years have passed.

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm not the same person anymore.

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,120
Mr. Gong made me lure you here.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,520
Who knew you were so stupid?

70
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,760
It can't be you.

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
Didn't you say

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,560
innocent faces are the best for lying?

73
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,600
Let go.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,160
You traitor.

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,680
You're still as stubborn as your mother.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,160
I remember she's called

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,840
Gu Xiangci, right?

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,440
How do you know?

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
My father loved her very much.

80
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,200
But she ran away after she got pregnant with you.

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,920
We've been looking for you all these years.

82
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,520
But we couldn't find you.

83
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,920
You're hiding so well.

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,640
But in the end,

85
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,160
it's all about emotions.

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
Mr. Gong

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,120
is not about emotions.

88
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,280
My dear sister.

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,400
What sister?

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,360
Our father is sick.

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,640
You have to use your blood

92
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,800
to fully recover his health.

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,960
What do you mean?

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,040
Don't you understand?

95
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,840
Do you think

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,640
we came to you

97
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,720
to take you back as a daughter?

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,920
Your mother

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
gave birth to a daughter for the Gong family

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and saved her father.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's her greatest honor.

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,080
You murderers.

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,760
You have nothing to do with the Gong family.

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,520
Mr. Gong.

105
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,240
I have something to tell you about him in private.

106
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,160
What do you want to tell me?

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
I'm not afraid of you.

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:31,380
2

109
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:08,180
姐姐似雨 无尽的嘲笑声 萦绕在耳朵

110
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:16,180
她遮住我的眼头 她操纵我的双手

111
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,180
她盯的人在傲慢的 疾风车

112
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,180
她下不甘的路口站 无法挣脱

113
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,180
她念故味过灿烂 她懂事爱和自由

114
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,980
有有谁能够逃离出 这别的 欲念交小就渴望了

115
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,980
得到救赎 她遮住我的冷漠
