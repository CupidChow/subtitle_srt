Episode 2

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You can't surprise the hunters.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've prepared this surprise for you.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You killed all the trusted people.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why?

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I didn't want to kill them.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But their lives are too fragile.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Death has no value.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The country can be used to continue the life of the father.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you didn't hide it for so many years,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
they wouldn't die.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's you.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You killed them.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The watermark wounds on their neck

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and the truth of the new luck bureau

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What is it?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's easy to know the truth.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You'll know everything when you become a lucky girl.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How dare you?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The real master of the game

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
will be defeated by the enemy.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You made the choice

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to kill me or run away.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I've already remembered your faces.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No matter where you run,

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can find you.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Right, Lele?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're forcing me to kill you.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You dare not.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're too funny.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then call the police.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The guilty and the guilty are all here.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The people at the door will be shocked

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
when they hear the warning.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know if they're dead or alive.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I won't let you get away with it even if I die.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Someone's here.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Brother.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It seems you've lost many enemies outside.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You've been tied up in your own territory.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Good thing I came in time.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's really cold here.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's like the basement of the house.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you remember?

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When I made a mistake when I was a kid,

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
my father locked me up.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Then you grew up.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I rarely went there.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You've been smart since you were a kid.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Excellent.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
People say this is the son of Mr. Gong.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But I...

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No one cares.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Once I beat the principal.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I thought he'd see me this time.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But you kneeled down and admitted your mistake.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And...

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You even took away my favorite watermelon-flavored candy.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You even couldn't even get Aida.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're so afraid that Mr. Gong will see me.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All these years, you've been looking for your sister.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You just want to take away Mr. Gong's inheritance.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're not going to give up, are you?

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you?

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Li Li, you won't have a chance to fight with me again.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Aida...

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's because...

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're so stupid.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She...

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She's a woman.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The fate of this old man is not mine.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's yours.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But...

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It can't be you.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not going to let you go.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I...

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm...

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm...

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm...

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm...

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He's dead.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No one has the right to fight with you.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And that girl didn't die for a day.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The old man might have climbed up from the bed.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The Gong family won't be mine.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There's something in his pocket.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not good.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not good.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How about you...

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You can give him a call.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm more important than anything.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're more important than anything?

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm a man of my word.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Tell everyone,

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
go look for your sister,

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
find her, and kill her.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's go.

110
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
He...

111
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,000
He killed his own brother.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
The company just recorded the key to the luck check.

113
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,920
Now, they're dead.

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
The clue is broken.

115
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
They've exposed the truth.

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Keke.

117
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,360
I have something to tell you.

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Wait for me.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Keke.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Roasted sweet potatoes?

121
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you remember?

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,800
Three years ago, we were like this.

123
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
We sneaked out at night.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You said you've never eaten roasted sweet potatoes.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
I'll treat you to this.

126
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
This is the best thing I've ever eaten

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
since my mom left me.

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Try it.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
How is it?

130
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Is it good?

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
It's sweet.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's like melted sugar.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,400
You've eaten so much good food.

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you really think it's good?

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My mom made me

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
all the food I eat.

137
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
Today is the first time I eat what I want to eat.

138
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,000
From now on, I'll take you

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
to eat all the good food in the world

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and eat what we want to eat.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I said

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'd take you to eat all the good food in the world.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now I've found you.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can start to fulfill your promise.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Keke, I...

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If I'm not here,

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
what will you do?

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The old days are not over yet.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm still in the same world.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He is not love and freedom.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's just a taste.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Who can escape from this rule?

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The more you think about it, the more you forget.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you get it, you lose.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He is my old me.
