1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,300
Kan somehow got too excited.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:23,560
I lost.

3
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Come on.

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Come on.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Come on.

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Come on.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Are you cold?

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Seeing you like this,

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,560
I really feel sorry for you.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Liu Yingying,

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
a girl with no identity,

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
to find her memory,

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
she entered the lucky draw.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Only by becoming a lucky girl,

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
can she solve all the problems.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
Look at this.

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Is this a familiar face?

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Doesn't it look like it?

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
There are two people who look like this in the world.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
To be honest,

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,560
when I first saw you,

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
I was also surprised.

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
What are you doing?

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
The girl in the photo is called Xiaoyu.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,560
She is very important to someone.

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,560
I want you to use this face

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
to lure her out.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
I can't do it.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
I am not Xiaoyu.

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Of course I know you are not her.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Because I threw her into the river in person.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Xiaoyu is dead.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
If you are willing to cooperate,

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,560
I will consider to remove you from the list of eliminated people.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Liu Yingying,

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
you know to come back?

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Something happened.

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Liu Yingying made a mistake at the dance party.

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
She was taken away.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Liu Yingying,

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Liu Yingying,

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Who?

43
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Who?

44
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Liu Yingying,

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Liu Yingying,

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Yingying,

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Liu Yingying,

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Wake up.

49
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Wake up.

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Wake up.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Wake up.

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Wake up.

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Wake up.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Open your mouth.

55
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
It's dangerous.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
It's dangerous.

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Those people chased you and killed you.

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
What did you say?

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
You were not taken away by them.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
It's really great.

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Go after them.

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
A thief just ran into the yard.

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Miss, Miss.

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
What's wrong?

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Someone just broke into the yard.

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
I heard you.

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
A crow just flew by.

68
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
I was scared.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
That's why I came out.

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Miss, have a good rest.

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
I know.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
What's your name?

74
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
What's your name?

75
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Name?

76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
My name is Miss.

77
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
What's your name?

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Since I was a child,

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
they all called me Miss.

80
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
What about you?

81
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
I...

82
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
My mom didn't let me tell anyone my real name.

83
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
She said that I would be taken away by the bad guys.

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Or you can call me Little Crow.

85
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I heard that crows are ominous.

86
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Where the crows fly, they fly.

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
They are free.

88
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
They don't care about others' thoughts.

89
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Free?

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
It's weird that I keep calling you Miss.

91
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
My mom calls me Little Fish.

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,560
How about I give you this name?

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
So I can call you Little Fish.

94
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Thank you, Little Fish.

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I have to go now.

96
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Why is your window locked from outside?

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
You can't go out.

98
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Do you want to go out?

99
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Stay here for a while.

100
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
What else do you remember?

101
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Then you two jumped out from the second floor.

102
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
We two jumped down from the second floor.

103
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
We went to many places to play.

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
And then we went to many places to play.

105
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
It's really you, Little Fish.

106
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
It's me, Coco.

107
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm Little Fish.

108
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm Little Fish.

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I'm Little Fish.

110
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
I'm Little Fish.

111
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm Little Fish.

112
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm Little Fish.

113
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm Little Fish.

114
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm Little Fish.

115
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
I'm Little Fish.

116
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm Little Fish.

117
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm Little Fish.

118
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm Little Fish.

119
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I'm Little Fish.

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm Little Fish.

121
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm Little Fish.

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
I'm Little Fish.

123
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm Little Fish.

124
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
I'm Little Fish.

125
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm Little Fish.

126
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm Little Fish.

127
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I'm Little Fish.

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm Little Fish.

129
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
I'm Little Fish.

130
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm Little Fish.

131
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm Little Fish.

132
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
I'm Little Fish.

133
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm Little Fish.

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
I'm Little Fish.

135
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm Little Fish.

136
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
I'm Little Fish.

137
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm Little Fish.

138
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
I'm Little Fish.
