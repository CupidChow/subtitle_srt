48

You're here

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you okay?

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why did you only press once?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Didn't you say you were in danger and you had to press twice?

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And your necklace?

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I did press once just now

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why did you suddenly come?

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're worried about me

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Bai Yanren suddenly rushed over

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I was in a panic

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I accidentally lost my necklace

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where were you?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Follow me

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll take you to see the truth of the lucky draw

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
These lucky girls are still alive

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They're all here

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
These scumbags

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't let them go

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's go

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's go to a safe place

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and find a way to save them

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't move

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When did you learn this?

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Did you forget?

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm a doctor

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I won't let you go back to that kind of place

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But this entertainment city

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's the difference between that place and that place?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why are those girls locked up?

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why are they locked up?

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
To continue their lives for their husbands

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please don't

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Dr. Wang, it's too noisy

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
When people are in extreme fear

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
they will separate out a gene called Pusus

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It can combine the cells that are seriously ill

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The girl from the police station

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The mark on her neck

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
is a special kind of lipstick

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
After reacting with the sweat

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,820
the

91
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Pusus S

92
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,000
The lucky girl is the one who has the most Pusus S in the test

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Their blood is medicine

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This project is called the water drop plan

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So they are tortured and blood-pulling repeatedly

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Just to make one breathe

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just one breath

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If the husband wants to survive

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
he needs to use his life to kill his wife

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Your life

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is his life

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Of course, the husband's life is at risk

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's not a threat

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The Pusus S is dead

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The one who has the full power now is the son

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Tell everyone to find the sister

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and kill her immediately

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
As long as we kill the son

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
we are free

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The lucky girl is harming a woman

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I will pull them out

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and save everyone

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You have always been very brave

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And this water drop plan

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The person who invented it and implemented it

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I will find them

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I won't let go of any of them

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will deal with the son

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When I am done

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you take these girls away

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's a small house

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come on

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Dr. Bao

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Dr. Bao

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You still call me Dr. Bao

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wake up, old man

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He is not your man anymore

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are awake

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have been under you for many years

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You are sad

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I am the eldest son of the Gong family

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But since childhood

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you have never had me in your heart

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The Gong family

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You are the son of the Bai family

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Even the dog who guards the house

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
knows that I am not your first choice

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
By the way

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I tell you, doctor

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He is dead

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Now I am the only one left

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I am sorry, dad

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's not my fault

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You can't even get out of bed

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and still hold the group in your hand

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
From now on

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will take care of the Gong family

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Dr. Bao

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Where are you?

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't move

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I am looking for your dad

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He will come soon

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you know what you are doing?

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mr. Gong

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Gong family

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The Gong family

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The Gong family

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The Gong family

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The Gong family

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The Gong family

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The Gong family

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The Gong family

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The Gong family

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The Gong family

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The Gong family

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The Gong family

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The Gong family

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The Gong family

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The Gong family

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The Gong family

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The Gong family

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The Gong family

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The Gong family

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The Gong family

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The Gong family

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The Gong family

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The Gong family

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The Gong family

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The Gong family

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The Gong family

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The Gong family

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The Gong family

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The Gong family

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The Gong family
