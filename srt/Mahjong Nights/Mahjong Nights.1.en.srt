1
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:20,614
The person in the viral video
is so pitiful.

2
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:24,173
It’s wrong to steal,
but what can the mother do

3
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:27,370
to feed her children when her husband
is sick in a tent somewhere?

4
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:32,423
Imagine, to go to jail just
because of one pack of milk.

5
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,573
Where will a person go,

6
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,729
if they don’t have relatives
who can help them here in Manila?

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,995
It’s everybody for themselves
in this kind of situation.

8
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,346
Because you can’t just ask
someone for help.

9
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:52,448
It’s dangerous, forbidden even,
to get involved with someone you know,

10
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:55,140
and you can’t even go out.

11
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:57,333
You remember the news,

12
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:02,131
the wife was sent to the hospital
for having severe COVID symptoms,

13
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:06,506
The husband was on home quarantine
and couldn’t visit his wife.

14
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:10,339
Then when the wife returned home,
the husband was dead.

15
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:13,260
Because there’s no one
to check on him.

16
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:16,423
He just ran out of oxygen, they said.

17
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:20,214
Their only child also died
of COVID two months ago.

18
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,690
Family members are in the province.

19
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:28,667
This pandemic—there are
the obvious effects

20
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:32,378
like deaths,
overcrowded hospitals,

21
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:36,799
overworked frontliners, unemployment.

22
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:38,299
Yes, we cope,

23
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:44,714
but there are a lot of other problems
that go unnoticed and unresolved.

24
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:49,656
A lot of it we just forget until it comes
again or it's back in the headlines.

25
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:54,312
Of course, one issue gives birth to many
other problems, and so forth.

26
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,284
This crisis really exposed
and magnified

27
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:02,062
our weaknesses, inefficiencies
and the inequalities.

28
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:07,923
The very basic issues of health,
money, work,

29
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:15,008
food, safety, freedom and justice
are all connected.

30
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,948
People go hungry and jeepney drivers
beg on the streets.

31
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,381
While in other areas,
farm produce is spoiled.

32
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:26,683
Not everyone was able to receive

33
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:30,007
monetary assistance,
some even die while waiting in line.

34
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,792
When it comes to punishment,

35
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:38,203
the quarantine violators who are
well-connected even get appointed.

36
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:42,464
But it’s a different matter
if the poor is caught.

37
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,116
Now, we see the headlines but what
about the problems

38
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,211
that afflict the country in a big way.

39
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:53,964
The ones we don’t prioritize or often
go unreported, especially those

40
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,381
that are exacerbated by the pandemic?

41
00:02:56,406 --> 00:03:00,464
Alexa, come down and help us out.

42
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,738
The increased domestic
or sexual abuse cases,

43
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:07,673
what they call
the 'shadow pandemic'

44
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:12,273
- Actually, even during times of crisis...
- Alexa!

45
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,828
Alexa, come on, your godparents
are arriving!

46
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,555
- That’s right.
- Come down.

47
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,472
There are predators everywhere.

48
00:03:19,497 --> 00:03:21,625
Though we’re said to be
a religious country...

49
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,617
I’ve called you a dozen times,
you know your godparents are coming.

50
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:27,622
Alright, alright, I’m here.

51
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:28,722
Hurry up.

52
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,164
It’s all prepared,
I’ll just put them in the pot.

53
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,647
Don’t dawdle, go.

54
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,157
Hey, Wylo!

55
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:40,540
Esther! We’re near already!

56
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:41,565
Really? Okay.

57
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,690
I’ll call when I’m in the area,
ETA 5 pm.

58
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:47,735
Heavy traffic at the checkpoint,
you know. Okay?

59
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,314
Alright, take care. See you!

60
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,576
Big boy, have you brought
the table from the stockroom?

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Not yet.

62
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,212
What? Come,
I’ll help you get it.

63
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:00,237
Okay.

64
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,798
I don't know why...

65
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:05,915
your mom really had
to leave us at this time.

66
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:11,032
Just when we have
visitors coming around.

67
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:12,838
I’m sorry.

68
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:16,190
Quick, my friends are arriving already.

69
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:16,965
Yes.

70
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:43,108
- What took you so long?
- I’m sorry.

71
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,176
- I’ll shove your phone down your throat.
- Sorry, sir.

72
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:19,532
Esther!

73
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,535
Alexa!

74
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,092
Big boy!

75
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:41,842
Finish that, and get the
groceries from the car.

76
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,587
Hurry up...

77
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,215
I have somewhere to go.

78
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,928
Have somebody help you.

79
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:40,556
Alexa.

80
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,923
Tell your mom
I’ll be home by evening.

81
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,215
Yes.

82
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,898
Ma’am, careful.

83
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:07,735
Here it is, Big boy!

84
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:10,065
Wipe the dust off, alright.

85
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,212
Sure.

86
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,571
The drawers are here,
take them too.

87
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,923
-Is it too heavy, Big boy?
-I can carry it.

88
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:33,931
Don’t rush.

89
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:38,704
Look, here are my friends.

90
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:45,100
It's Ason and...
go ahead, Big boy.

91
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,751
Wait, my bag.

92
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,079
Esther Montes!

93
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,681
Esther, how are you?

94
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,131
I think I’m tearing up!

95
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,759
Me too!

96
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:09,440
I thought crows would turn white
before we see each other again.

97
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,587
How are you?

98
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,231
-Wait...
-Why?

99
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:14,106
Show me your RT-PCR results first.

100
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,131
Okay.

101
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:16,940
You know what...

102
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:17,923
Wait...

103
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:21,648
My opening lines to you were so heartfelt
and yours is to demand PCR result?

104
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:23,315
That’s why I miss you.

105
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,440
Negative.

106
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:25,606
Negative? Let me see.

107
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,381
Mine?

108
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:27,815
Yours, Wylo.

109
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
And here’s mine.

110
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:30,212
Negative!

111
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:33,090
Alright,
you can kiss me now.

112
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,169
It’s been so long!

113
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,148
How’s everything?

114
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:39,173
You’re still fresh-looking,
you haven’t changed one bit.

115
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:40,315
That's true.

116
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,017
The face that refreshes.

117
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,090
How you talk!

118
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:47,631
Amparo called,
said she’s on the way here.

119
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:49,940
She's on her way.

120
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,590
You know her, she always comes
at the end, like a climax.

121
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:55,773
Acts like a royalty.

122
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,673
So what does that make us,
penalty?

123
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,856
It seems so.

124
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:04,845
So here’s our historical
mahjong table!

125
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:07,648
Finally! This will be fun.

126
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,228
Thank you, Big boy.

127
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,565
We haven’t played for so long!

128
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,773
I’m so excited for your strong explosions.

129
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:20,690
Save your energy,
your battery might run out.

130
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:25,735
Won’t happen, I’m fully charged
and ready for 36 hours nonstop.

131
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,622
Yes!

132
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,313
Your song is ancient.

133
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,338
How young you are!

134
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,606
How about this?
Body language, Body language…

135
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,631
Disgusting.

136
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:35,827
She’s imitating Myrna Castillo.

137
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:38,773
No, not Myrna Castillo.

138
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,273
Body language- that’s Pia Moran!

139
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,523
Pia Moran!

140
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,884
Body language, body language.

141
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:46,356
You're so wild!

142
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,173
We’re gross.

143
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:48,360
How about some coffee first?

144
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:53,650
Yes, before the earth swallows us up.
Let’s have coffee.

145
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:55,798
Alexa, dear!

146
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:01,690
Hi, godmother!

147
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,315
Hi Alexa!

148
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,923
Prettier than ever.

149
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:06,915
Of course.

150
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,316
They’re negative, don’t worry.

151
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:11,204
Beautiful.

152
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:16,231
You’re so busy with mahjong, you don’t
notice your goddaughter under your noses.

153
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:17,798
You’re addicts!

154
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:20,056
Her aura’s different.

155
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:22,696
No longer like Virgin Mary.

156
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:26,690
Choose your words wisely.

157
00:11:26,715 --> 00:11:28,275
Stop it, Wylo.

158
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,856
She’s blossomed into a woman,
I mean.

159
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:32,106
Beautiful.

160
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:33,743
Isn’t she?

161
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:35,548
Let’s have coffee now.

162
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,673
She can become an actress.

163
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:40,642
Yes, let her become an actress.

164
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,481
I don’t want her
to be an actress.

165
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:43,506
Why not?

166
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,595
She’s fine as she is.
Thank you, dear.

167
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,870
- Oh, the...
- Wait.

168
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:50,923
Anyway, where’s Leo?

169
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:56,603
As usual, he is
managing the business.

170
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:58,840
We can turn him into
an actor if you like.

171
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:06,840
-I think there’s someone else.
-A new one?

172
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:09,173
I don't know if she'll bring him.

173
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:14,696
That’s not surprising.
I’ll be surprised if there’s no one.

174
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:15,923
Right.

175
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,815
You’re too much.
Let’s not talk about Amparo.

176
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,833
Aren’t you righteous?

177
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,079
Hey.

178
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,419
What is it?

179
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:26,806
Is that Amparo’s car?

180
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:28,523
I don’t know but---

181
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,856
That’s her, no one else is
expected today.

182
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,769
And we’re gossiping about her.

183
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,794
Speaking of...

184
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,190
What if she’s planted
microphones around here?

185
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,190
I don’t think she’ll bother.

186
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:40,231
That’s her.

187
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:41,340
She’s the only visitor we’re expecting.

188
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:43,376
Right.

189
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,921
Is that... oh yeah!

190
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:46,465
Are you sure it’s her?

191
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,056
That’s Amparo. Come,
let’s welcome her.

192
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:57,233
She hasn’t stepped
off the van yet.

193
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,314
Rumor's confirmed.

194
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,315
She’s really taking her time.

195
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,704
Amparo!

196
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:09,756
It’s really her.

197
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,356
Esther!

198
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,548
PCR?

199
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,731
Wylo Lee!

200
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:16,273
She's already brandishing
her PCR result.

201
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,940
You fabulous demented man!

202
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,603
What’s the latest gossip?

203
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:24,135
Which young star got knocked up?
Tell me.

204
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,182
Asuncion Concepcion Salvacion!

205
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:29,106
Complete name?!

206
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:31,315
The queen of small loans.

207
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,190
How are you?
The Indian lenders will get mad at you.

208
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,548
Are you all negative?

209
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,782
Yes, we are.

210
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,815
Of course!

211
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
How about you?

212
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:43,690
Negative...

213
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:44,856
Let me see.

214
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:47,148
I’m negative.

215
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:50,635
It says, not detected.

216
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,440
Okay, alright!

217
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,698
What will it be?
30 to 60?

218
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:57,606
No, 50 to 100.

219
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,565
We’ll play for three days straight.

220
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,856
I did not come here to play
for thirty pesos.

221
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,798
I need to recover
my gas expenses.

222
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:05,981
This place is too far.

223
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:09,815
Have a heart, Amparo,
I haven’t earned for three months

224
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,065
because of this damned pandemic.

225
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,792
I even brought my piggy-bank.

226
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:14,923
Alright...

227
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,114
30 to 60 will do.

228
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,681
What’s important is that...

229
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,898
we are all together.

230
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:23,648
That’s right,
come on, let's begin!

231
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:25,440
Let's go.

232
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,268
So, how's the payment scheme?

233
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:32,885
Since you asked,
I decided to write down the rules.

234
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,273
Because I know how your brains work,
especially you Amparo.

235
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:37,381
You're singling me out again.

236
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,523
You’re always disagreeing.

237
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,215
Look at Oakley, he agrees with us.

238
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,423
Quiet.

239
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:44,114
Alright.

240
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:56,452
[DISCUSSING MAHJONG RULES]

241
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,371
Jai alai?

242
00:14:57,588 --> 00:15:00,183
60, so it’ll be high.

243
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,215
Back to back?

244
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:02,806
Same, 60.

245
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,090
What about pao?

246
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,383
30 each.

247
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,266
And since you can’t seem to
remember what I’ve just said,

248
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,190
hard copies are available
for two pesos each.

249
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:16,094
But for you Esther, it’s free,
because you serve fine food here.

250
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,940
I love you, Wylo Lee.

251
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:21,289
Here we go!

252
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,023
Let’s start, let’s start.

253
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,687
Start building walls now.

254
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:36,950
Your nails are still long.

255
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,981
Still got the hands for it?

256
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:49,923
Of course.

257
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,273
Did you miss this?

258
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,940
Wow, you’re quick as ever.

259
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,148
Of course.

260
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:56,836
Still the quickest stacker.

261
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:08,359
My god! I missed this.

262
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:09,387
There.

263
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,231
Okay, game.

264
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:13,256
Dice.

265
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:18,670
Three!

266
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:21,055
One, two, three, you start.

267
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
Service.

268
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:26,815
Here.

269
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,875
Thank you, thank you.

270
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,048
-You’re so slow.
-Sorry!

271
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,648
You're rusty, Wylo.

272
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:36,101
Here you go, Ason.

273
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:38,981
My hands are tingling.

274
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:40,465
-Thank you.
-Give it to me.

275
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,231
You gave to her what
I’ve given you.

276
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:44,398
That’s not true.

277
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:45,631
Give this to her.

278
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,090
Mine’s incomplete.

279
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,840
You bypassed me,
are you angry at me?

280
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:01,760
I still need six.

281
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,558
I'm ready.

282
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,898
Joker.

283
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,026
Seven!

284
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,756
One, two, three, four, five.

285
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,500
Seven, hey.

286
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:18,398
That's our joker.

287
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:19,981
There!

288
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:20,965
I’ve nothing.

289
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,245
Okay...

290
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,270
so...

291
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,831
-Why so slow?
-Okay, wait a sec.

292
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:44,631
What’s with you?

293
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:47,548
What’s come over you?

294
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:59,363
I can’t believe
we’re all here.

295
00:18:03,564 --> 00:18:06,956
That we’re actually
together again.

296
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,590
What now?

297
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,065
We look insane.

298
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,006
My God.

299
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:50,506
We are still alive.

300
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,773
Alright, let’s begin.

301
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:05,581
We’re overdramatic.

302
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,315
Game!

303
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,273
My glasses fogged up.

304
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,362
Enough of the drama.

305
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:22,299
We’re like lunatics, we were laughing,
then suddenly we’re crying.

306
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:26,784
So today, we're going
to do seafood gumbo.

307
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,190
We're used to Filipino food.

308
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,393
And yes, we're very competitive.

309
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,745
It’s missing something.

310
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:38,292
Our dishes have so many influences.

311
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:40,870
And when you say,
world cuisine...

312
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:45,023
You must understand the culture
behind the dish also.

313
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:48,135
Alexa, which do I use?

314
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:50,096
This one?

315
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:53,198
Just a bit? Alright.

316
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,823
Others prefer thick sauces...

317
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,385
Others don't like that,
some like it dry...

318
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,414
Alexa, what do I do with this?

319
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:08,190
Peel them.

320
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:09,266
Okay.

321
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
What is it?

322
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,539
Can I have a glass of water?

323
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:20,965
Sure.

324
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:28,940
This looks delicious.

325
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:29,965
Of course.

326
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,360
You’ve been tested?
Right?

327
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:35,438
Of course.

328
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:37,173
Thank you.

329
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:38,323
Are you hungry?

330
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:41,077
May I eat now?

331
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:44,440
Yes. Aren’t you
Aunt Amparo’s driver?

332
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:47,539
I’m starving.
We got stuck on the road for hours.

333
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:52,006
There was an accident.

334
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:55,565
You look like you haven’t
eaten the whole day.

335
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,590
You said it!

336
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:00,654
I’m sorry.

337
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,381
Have this.

338
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:10,756
May I have another?

339
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,654
Alright.

340
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:18,493
If you need anything else,
just tell me.

341
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:19,762
Spoon and fork.

342
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,590
Of course.

343
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:25,506
Thank you.

344
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,565
That guy looks famished.

345
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,965
Yes, he’s shoveling
food on his plate.

346
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,141
Is this nearly cooked?
Let me taste.

347
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,578
You’re getting better at this!

348
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,953
Finish up...

349
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:48,023
They’re probably hungry now.

350
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,048
Yes!

351
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,023
Hey!

352
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,305
What’s that, Wylo?

353
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:26,798
There! Siete pares.

354
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:28,266
Ambisyon.

355
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:31,460
- You’re lucky.
- Get this one.

356
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,836
- This is what I’ve been waiting for.
- I'll eat later.

357
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,664
Payment’s 90-90.

358
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,832
Fortune’s not with us, Oakley.

359
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,440
That’s what I’ve been waiting for.

360
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:42,840
I don’t care, I’m waiting
for your payment.

361
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:45,065
Mom, food is ready.

362
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,690
Keep the change.

363
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:50,065
The food’s ready, let’s eat.
Let’s continue after.

364
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,274
Wylo is on a winning streak.

365
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,282
I'm winning.

366
00:22:55,274 --> 00:23:00,606
Give some food to
your Aunt Amparo's driver.

367
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,023
What’s your driver’s name?

368
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,048
Gaspar.

369
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:05,860
Don’t make her call me her Aunt,
I‘m not much older than she is.

370
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:08,250
Sis Amparo will do.

371
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:10,873
Ma, I’ve given him food.

372
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:11,731
Oh, you have?

373
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:12,590
Yes.

374
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:15,481
Is that so. Thank you.

375
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:18,196
You want to pretend you’re young,
we’ll humor you.

376
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:21,190
Why, it’s true,
I’m the youngest among you.

377
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:22,215
Thank you, dear.

378
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,648
Wait...

379
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:24,881
why don’t you join us?

380
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:27,315
I’m alright,
I need to do something first.

381
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:28,637
Okay, then.

382
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:32,648
So his name is Gaspar.

383
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:35,625
Check on them,
they might need something.

384
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,758
Yes.

385
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,610
My goddaughter
serves delicious food.

386
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:46,440
If you didn’t know, she’s taking up
Culinay Arts.

387
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:47,715
That’s why.

388
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,883
How does she study?

389
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,231
Online.

390
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:53,227
Everything’s online these days.

391
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:57,360
Online class isn’t effective.
Kids just play Mobile Legends.

392
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,315
That’s what they say.

393
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,315
They turn off the mic
and they play.

394
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,815
Professors think they’re studying,
but they’re not.

395
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,898
Many have been caught doing that.

396
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:09,690
What if there’s an exam?
They can cheat.

397
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,789
That happens.

398
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,606
So you’re wasting money
paying for that.

399
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:15,606
Not with Alexa.

400
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,606
You have a point.

401
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:20,315
Other kids learn nothing.

402
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,899
Well Alexa’s cooking is delicious,
though we have a critic here.

403
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:25,940
Who?

404
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,523
Who else,
but our candidate Ason.

405
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,673
She sits down and declares
it all divine.

406
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,148
It's true that the
food is delicious.

407
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,006
She’s like that ever since.

408
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:38,506
We haven’t tasted anything,
and you already conclude it’s delicious.

409
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:40,731
She says she can tell by her nose.

410
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:41,756
I want shrimps.

411
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:42,859
Give me some too.

412
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:44,856
Wait...

413
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:50,731
since you all
understand this online thing,

414
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,946
guess what’s trending now?

415
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:53,837
What?

416
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:55,258
JFF.

417
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,565
JFF?

418
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,548
What is that?

419
00:24:57,573 --> 00:24:58,573
Just For Fans.

420
00:24:58,706 --> 00:24:59,414
Funs?

421
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,356
Yes, Just For Fans.

422
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:01,340
Just For Fans, what’s that?

423
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:02,240
Funds?

424
00:25:02,265 --> 00:25:03,565
Fans. Admirers.

425
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,298
Okay.

426
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:06,956
Back in the day, fans used to give
sampaguita garlands to their idols,

427
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:08,023
or ask for autograph.

428
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,856
These days you pay 1,500 and
you can watch your idols have sex.

429
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:12,532
What!

430
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:13,981
I like that.

431
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:14,690
Oh you!

432
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:15,423
I like that.

433
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,125
Amparo, really.

434
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,731
For how much again?

435
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,648
Just 1,500 a month.

436
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:22,440
No problem, I can pay right away.

437
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:25,731
Make it 2,000, and I’ll have you
registered myself.

438
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,815
Sure, I’ll send the money to you.

439
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,414
Yes, they’ll have sex,
and you can watch.

440
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,398
Can I join that?

441
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:33,090
What?

442
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:34,106
Hey, Ason!

443
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:35,298
You’ll join Just For Fans?

444
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:36,073
Yes.

445
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,023
My god, I’m eating.

446
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:40,840
Now I’m imagining you’re naked.

447
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:41,865
Yes.

448
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,690
Who’ll pay 1,500 for you?

449
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:46,274
You’re the one who
should pay viewers.

450
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:52,836
It’s punishment to see you naked,
and we must pay?

451
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:57,356
Well, I thought I heard you say ‘collab’.

452
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,565
-Collab?
-Yes.

453
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,898
I said no such thing.

454
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:01,023
You did, earlier.

455
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:02,731
Maybe you know about this already!

456
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:05,547
No! No, seriously.

457
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:07,813
Come to think of it, that would
be a brilliant idea.

458
00:26:07,838 --> 00:26:10,231
Any collaboration with you will collapse.

459
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:11,648
Hey!

460
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,524
Just eat!

461
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:18,922
- We'll have a short exam next week.
- Okay, ma'am.

462
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:21,809
- That's all for today.
- See you tomorrow!

463
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,375
Goodbye!

464
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:33,883
Big boy, I will be outside, okay?

465
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:34,908
Okay.

466
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,703
Nice hiding place.

467
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,107
This is delicious.

468
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,515
You cook well.

469
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:09,100
I grew interested in cooking…

470
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:11,797
because of Big boy’s mother.

471
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,727
Big boy, the one in the kitchen earlier?

472
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
What do you mean?

473
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,578
You’re so judgemental.

474
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,822
I bet Big boy’s smarter than you.

475
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,044
This place is nice.

476
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:32,726
You can roam about even
during the pandemic.

477
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,715
It’s alright.

478
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:39,125
How long have you
owned this resort?

479
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,673
This is not a resort.
It’s just a house.

480
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:47,485
You’re lucky, you’re rich.

481
00:27:49,256 --> 00:27:50,465
This is not ours.

482
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:57,227
More rice?

483
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,209
No, I’m full. Thanks.

484
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,561
What’s your name,
by the way?

485
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:08,798
Alexa.

486
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,232
You?

487
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:11,381
Gaspar.

488
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:15,048
You have an Instagram account?

489
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:16,467
I have.

490
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:18,998
I’ll follow you.

491
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:20,565
What’s your username?

492
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,115
Alexa415.

493
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,506
Okay.

494
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:32,161
I’ll just bring Oakley to the van
and have a smoke.

495
00:28:32,606 --> 00:28:33,606
Okay.

496
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:34,731
Goodbye Oakley.

497
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,162
Say goodbye, Oakley.

498
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,842
Goodbye Oakley.

499
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,481
You want coffee?

500
00:28:40,506 --> 00:28:43,725
I really thought we’d win today.

501
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:49,568
You didn’t bring me luck.
Disappointing.

502
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:53,674
Help me win later, okay?

503
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,157
When will you help me win?

504
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:58,715
What’s your cuteness for?

505
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,081
Ma’am!

506
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,395
Where have you been?

507
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:10,186
I just ate.

508
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:11,277
Where?

509
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:14,725
Your friend’s daughter gave me food.

510
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:17,643
Take him to the car.

511
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:26,523
-Gcash works like this.
-Okay.

512
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:30,398
You can make an online transfer
instead of holding cash.

513
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:33,523
For example, I will borrow
50,000 from you.

514
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:36,965
If we both have Gcash, you can easily
transfer the fifty thousand to me.

515
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,273
Ah, okay.

516
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:40,465
So you're sending me
fifty thousand?

517
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:43,251
-Fifty thousand?
-Yes, Fifty thousand.

518
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,648
I don’t have that.

519
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,440
I can give you...

520
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:48,340
Two.

521
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:49,381
-Two?
-Yes.

522
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:51,981
Two thousand?
What am I, a reporter?

523
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:56,856
Put another zero
to make it 20,000.

524
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,958
Then transfer it to my Gcash account.

525
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:01,398
I have to download the app?

526
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:03,698
I’ll be home by Sunday.

527
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,203
Okay, Sunday...

528
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,773
And we were even
waiting for you.

529
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:10,612
Don’t wait for me.
That’ll jinx my game.

530
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:11,899
I didn't know
you left.

531
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:12,971
Alright. Whatever.

532
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:17,463
Okay, tell hi
to Esther and Leo for me.

533
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:19,238
Why are you in a hurry?

534
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:21,096
What are you doing?

535
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:24,549
- Well, fine, I'm busy.
- Okay, sure.

536
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:26,587
- Enjoy there.
- Bye.

537
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:32,985
As if I don’t know you’re just checking
how long you can be with your mistress.

538
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:38,100
Give me a massage.

539
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:07,285
That feels good.

540
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:13,576
How about this?

541
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,857
I'll do this for your account.

542
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:17,946
Where’s Amparo?

543
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:20,773
I thought she’ll just smoke
and put Oakley in the van.

544
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:21,798
What’s new?

545
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,516
He’ll play for me.

546
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,815
I’ll just make a call.

547
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,815
Okay.

548
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,610
Come on. Let’s start.

549
00:32:28,688 --> 00:32:31,090
Ask him if he also has Gcash.

550
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:33,148
Oh, Wylo.

551
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:34,173
He is handsome.

552
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:37,756
Hello.

553
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,881
Here?

554
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,961
Yes, take Amparo’s seat.

555
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:50,715
Are you good at feeling tiles?

556
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,398
What’s wrong with my question?

557
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:57,118
Your questions have innuendos.

558
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,523
Why do you stare?
You’ve a question for me?

559
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:08,210
No, it’s just that I think
I’ve watched you on Youtube.

560
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:11,243
You’re too polite.
Call me Wylo.

561
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,482
Which video did you see?
I’ve been in many.

562
00:33:17,507 --> 00:33:18,836
Eye to Eye?

563
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,235
No, but it was a very old one.

564
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:23,548
Ouch!

565
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,423
It’s like a knife’s
been shoved into me.

566
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:28,365
That’s not possible,
you’ve thick skin.

567
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,930
I remember Inday.

568
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:34,523
Don't worry, I’m sure she
remembers you too,

569
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,305
and will pay you a visit.

570
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,008
I was with her for a long time.

571
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:42,798
Just two million?

572
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,063
Is this a joke?

573
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:47,625
Don't they know I’m worth
more than that?

574
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:53,006
Throughout the campaign my name
will be associated with their company.

575
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,050
Do they think they're lucky?

576
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,525
Tell them they should
be ashamed of themselves.

577
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:04,618
I’ll shove that two million
down their throats.

578
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,826
Don't get mad...

579
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,164
Alright, I’ve better things to do.

580
00:34:10,189 --> 00:34:13,282
I’ve no idea where he’s from.

581
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,148
That show was horrible anyway.

582
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:18,731
Wylo’s on a roll again.

583
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,173
Whose turn is it?

584
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,315
Bring Oakley here,
and my long sleeves too.

585
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,131
Okay.

586
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:25,856
Hey, let’s continue this
conversation, alright?

587
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:26,969
Sure.

588
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:28,648
You flirt!

589
00:34:28,673 --> 00:34:29,648
Whose turn is it?

590
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:31,555
I'm just friendly, girl.

591
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:37,110
We need to endure,
and make the right decisions.

592
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:40,451
Most of us, we're tired
and we're just coping.

593
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:42,391
Sometimes, we're hanging
by a thread.

594
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,380
We try to be brave.

595
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:47,399
Keeping a smile on our faces,
because we have to.

596
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,593
It's good to have friends.

597
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:51,387
Hey, sorry I left
my plate outside.

598
00:34:51,412 --> 00:34:53,091
I’ll help you do the dishes
tomorrow if you like?

599
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:55,465
I’m bored here in the van anyway.
Your cooking is yummy, I swear.

600
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,379
Add me, okay. This is Gaspar.

601
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,086
This is my IG account.
Kabayo’s my username.

602
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:00,961
This is a song
by Shanne Dandan.

603
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:02,468
It's "Hanggang sa Langit".

604
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:05,235
I’m excited to eat tomorrow,
What’s for breakfast?

605
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,798
Kabayo? Your username stinks!
Horse Gaspar.

606
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:15,840
Sure, you can come for coffee
in the morning.

607
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,188
Why’s your username Kabayo?
You’re just a little pony.

608
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:28,631
Yes, that’s what my basketball friends
call me, Kabayo. Little pony?

609
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:33,981
Thanks for accepting my request.
I’ll have that coffee in the morning.

610
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,157
My boss is stingy, she doesn’t
bring food when we travel.

611
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,039
And she’s really Strict too.

612
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:44,565
Thanks for the delicious food again,
I hope it’ll be the same tomorrow.

613
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,833
I’ll stay up til this
mahjong game ends.

614
00:35:46,857 --> 00:35:49,391
Hope my boss wins,
she might give me something.

615
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:57,930
Swarmed by mosquitos here…
I hope I don’t get dengue.

616
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,256
Alright Miss Beautiful.
Sorry to disturb you.

617
00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:33,782
Good evening, sir.

618
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,825
You’ve turned this place
into a giant trash can.

619
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:41,972
Pick that up.

620
00:37:44,173 --> 00:37:45,048
I’m sorry.

621
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:55,940
I’ll put down four balls.

622
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:58,131
Wait a sec. Chow!

623
00:37:58,524 --> 00:37:59,923
Throw!

624
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:04,453
It’s mine again.

625
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:05,456
For you.

626
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:06,481
Throw again.

627
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:07,506
Hey.

628
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:08,759
Leo!

629
00:38:09,381 --> 00:38:10,643
Have you eaten?
Do you want to eat?

630
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:11,584
I’ve had dinner.

631
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:18,023
Leo, stay a bit, let’s talk.
Where have you been?

632
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:20,423
You seem so busy, Leo.

633
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:22,455
Not that busy.

634
00:38:23,423 --> 00:38:25,539
Nice reunion.
Anybody winning yet?

635
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:29,673
No, we’re just relaxing.
Just relaxing.

636
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:31,633
Just a diversion.

637
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:37,787
You’re lucky you’ve time
for diversions. I don’t.

638
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:40,696
Are you sure you don’t have one?

639
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:48,420
I’m all about business.

640
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:51,423
Just a reminder...

641
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:55,203
make sure you use the ashtray
when you smoke.

642
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:57,828
Of course.

643
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,090
Come inside, let’s talk.

644
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:22,516
Are you winning?

645
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:26,485
Not yet… we’ve just started.

646
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:34,693
You should demand tong from them.
You’ll feed them.

647
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:39,048
Leo… is that necessary?

648
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:40,725
I’m telling you.

649
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,548
And tell Amparo...

650
00:39:44,778 --> 00:39:45,778
What is it?

651
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:48,219
Her driver’s littered the parking lot
with cigarette butts.

652
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:52,180
Okay. I didn’t know.
I’ll tell her.

653
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:57,166
Don’t stress yourself,
I’ll attend to it. Alright?

654
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,022
Well that's your money.

655
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:03,047
Yes.

656
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,430
What happened?

657
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:12,125
He’s complaining about
your smoking.

658
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:44,227
That’s bad for me.

659
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:04,478
Alexa.

660
00:44:44,673 --> 00:44:45,673
Oops.

661
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:47,548
We don’t have the luck.

662
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,590
Okay.

663
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:55,517
Kang!

664
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,134
Game!

665
00:44:58,381 --> 00:44:59,381
Your turn to throw.

666
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,731
Hurry, here.

667
00:45:02,756 --> 00:45:04,523
Wait. Ambition!

668
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:07,478
Todas! Seven pairs.

669
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:09,356
Pay up, pay up! 90 each.

670
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:11,173
You are lucky, Esther.

671
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:14,243
Pay up. 90!

672
00:45:16,736 --> 00:45:19,715
We lost again, Oakley.

673
00:45:25,498 --> 00:45:26,498
Alexa.

674
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:29,693
Alexa!

675
00:45:44,462 --> 00:45:46,087
You're here again.

676
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:28,259
Alexa!

677
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:22,923
Damn, it’s so early.
What do you want?

678
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:30,798
Come to the house,
I’ll hand it to you.

679
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,840
Leo…

680
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:35,700
who's that?

681
00:47:36,756 --> 00:47:37,756
You…

682
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:40,106
Damned creditors collecting this early.

683
00:47:40,131 --> 00:47:42,294
You just woke up and
you’re angry already.

684
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,110
Leo…

685
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:41,590
Come here.

686
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,185
What do you think you're doing?

687
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:46,756
Getting friendly with that driver?

688
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:49,381
Stop flirting.

689
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
Why? What do you care?

690
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:55,107
You dare ask me why?

691
00:48:56,256 --> 00:48:57,256
This is my house.

692
00:48:58,131 --> 00:48:59,631
Respect me. In my house!

693
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:01,631
This is my house.

694
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,606
Your daughter really cooks well.

695
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:19,715
Salve’s influence. Didn’t Salve work
with my mom for years?

696
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,896
She’s perfected the Kapampangan dishes.

697
00:49:22,887 --> 00:49:26,348
How’s your mother’s restaurant?

698
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:29,255
Well. A lot of business closed
because of this pandemic.

699
00:49:29,287 --> 00:49:30,598
Hard times.

700
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:31,947
You said it.

701
00:49:34,006 --> 00:49:35,006
Wylo!

702
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:36,051
Yes!

703
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:38,269
What are you doing? Praying?

704
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:41,927
What do you think I’m doing,
the laundry? These hags.

705
00:49:41,952 --> 00:49:43,966
-Dive in!
-It's cold.

706
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:48,169
I might have a seizure.

707
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:49,715
Esther...

708
00:49:50,506 --> 00:49:55,856
Why don’t we play mahjong over there,
underneath the trees?

709
00:49:55,881 --> 00:49:56,715
You prefer that?

710
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,573
There?

711
00:49:57,793 --> 00:49:59,521
If that’s what you want,
fine with me.

712
00:49:59,825 --> 00:50:04,106
We’ve been confined for so long.
Air’s fresh over there.

713
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:05,256
It’s alright with you?

714
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:06,315
Yes.

715
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,919
Amparo agrees. How about you?

716
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,148
Fine with me.

717
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,599
Okay, go. We’ll play there later.

718
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:13,146
-Let’s eat first.
-Sir.

719
00:50:34,173 --> 00:50:34,715
Sir.

720
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:38,506
Your boss is persistent.

721
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:43,798
Here.

722
00:50:45,938 --> 00:50:47,173
Tell your master,

723
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,381
he can chew on that.

724
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,840
You know, sometimes I’m scared.

725
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:56,065
I’ve a feeling he’s incurred
a huge debt.

726
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,090
How much?

727
00:50:57,115 --> 00:50:58,115
I don’t know.

728
00:50:58,977 --> 00:51:00,824
How come you don’t know?

729
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:02,649
He’s managing
your money too, right?

730
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,985
You should be informed of everything,
you must insist.

731
00:51:07,037 --> 00:51:08,938
Which of your businesses failed?

732
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:10,610
Most of it.

733
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:13,731
Though the flower shop’s
doing well.

734
00:51:13,756 --> 00:51:17,235
The auto repair shop, it’s doing better.
But the rest didn’t prosper.

735
00:51:20,131 --> 00:51:23,743
Gambling doesn’t mix
with business.

736
00:51:27,055 --> 00:51:30,883
I’m scared, I think there are
people going after Leo.

737
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:38,824
This one’s very tasty.

738
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:39,849
It does.

739
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:41,959
Get more.

740
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:48,684
Gaspar, come here.

741
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:53,410
Massage my back.

742
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,131
My god, I’m shocked.

743
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:21,551
Stunned by that beautiful body.

744
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:23,360
Let me see it again!

745
00:53:24,465 --> 00:53:26,190
You tease!

746
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:27,215
Crazy.

747
00:53:27,418 --> 00:53:29,043
Hey, Esther!

748
00:53:29,068 --> 00:53:31,940
Your daughter is so beautiful,
she should be an actress.

749
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:33,856
Take a look at her.

750
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:36,145
You’re wasting her in the kitchen!

751
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,023
Look at that body!

752
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,981
The waistline, as narrow
as a leche flan molder!

753
00:53:42,849 --> 00:53:44,565
You keep locking her up
in the kitchen!

754
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,449
Wylo, really.

755
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,832
What a body, 21-inch waistline.

756
00:53:54,048 --> 00:53:55,881
This is how you walk gracefully.

757
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:07,715
Hello.

758
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,020
Hey, what's the update?

759
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:13,075
I haven't heard from you.

760
00:54:13,506 --> 00:54:14,948
What a thick skull you have.

761
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,160
I told you I’ll pay.

762
00:54:17,215 --> 00:54:19,357
I thought you might've forgotten me.

763
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,746
I’m sending somebody already.

764
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:22,945
You said, you'll pay today.

765
00:54:23,403 --> 00:54:25,746
Where's your messenger then?

766
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:27,920
Damn it.

767
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:29,714
How many times do
I have to say it?

768
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:30,527
You're mad?

769
00:54:30,552 --> 00:54:32,012
You're the one
who owes me.

770
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,380
Damn it.

771
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:35,231
I will pay you!

772
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:37,131
Out of my way!

773
00:54:43,006 --> 00:54:43,673
Big boy!

774
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,590
Are you okay?

775
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:29,551
What were you doing earlier?

776
00:55:33,652 --> 00:55:35,863
My command was very simple.

777
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:38,403
But what did you do?

778
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:43,926
I just want to be happy.

779
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,340
You want to be happy?

780
00:55:52,712 --> 00:55:54,045
Since you were a child,

781
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,074
I’ve given you everything you desired.

782
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:00,204
Even now.

783
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:06,488
But you cannot obey
one regulation?

784
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:08,256
This is my house.

785
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:23,298
You want to be happy?

786
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:34,887
You want to have fun?
I can give you that.

787
00:57:36,446 --> 00:57:37,613
Where are you going?

788
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:39,192
Go back.

789
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,798
Esther...

790
00:57:50,105 --> 00:57:53,824
After all this time you still hesitate
to tell us your troubles?

791
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,169
Especially the ones concerning Leo.

792
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,004
Aren’t we a family already?

793
00:58:04,004 --> 00:58:07,106
Be wise, Esther.

794
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,523
Me, I’m married…

795
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:14,027
But I’m not subservient
whether it’s about money or…

796
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:15,285
I just do what I want.

797
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:21,273
Hey, todas!

798
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:22,006
What!

799
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,284
Bunot 60.

800
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:24,871
Really!

801
00:58:24,896 --> 00:58:26,184
How did that happen?

802
00:58:26,817 --> 00:58:29,648
I think she’s cheating us somehow,
while she’s doling out advice.

803
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,356
I must recoup my losses, at least.

804
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:32,565
I've been waiting for this

805
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,923
-I won already.
-Here's my payment.

806
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:35,418
There, beautiful.

807
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:38,798
You know what...

808
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:41,340
maybe Leo...

809
00:58:42,356 --> 00:58:46,090
he borrowed money for gambling...

810
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:47,115
and...

811
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,606
well, he made a mistake.

812
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:52,648
But he’s working.

813
00:58:52,673 --> 00:58:53,465
Yeah right.

814
00:58:54,738 --> 00:59:00,715
Do you still see your share of profits
from the business?

815
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:06,856
I bet he begrudges what little cash
you spend on this game.

816
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:09,168
No, he’s not like that.

817
00:59:09,193 --> 00:59:12,473
And we have everything we need.

818
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:16,168
You know, when someone gambles,

819
00:59:16,193 --> 00:59:18,690
even if he has a job,
nothing’s safe.

820
00:59:18,715 --> 00:59:20,790
Maybe he makes you sign documents,

821
00:59:20,815 --> 00:59:22,565
next thing you know the
house’s already mortgaged.

822
00:59:22,652 --> 00:59:25,190
Families have been
ruined by gambling.

823
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:26,496
Some kill each other.

824
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,402
Esther, loan sharks are dangerous.

825
00:59:30,427 --> 00:59:35,565
I know someone,
his thumbprint was taken while he slept.

826
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:37,773
He didn’t know his
house was already sold.

827
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:38,856
Can that happen?

828
00:59:38,881 --> 00:59:39,881
Definitely.

829
00:59:39,906 --> 00:59:41,324
Anyhow...

830
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:46,434
it’s difficult when someone
else is controlling your life.

831
00:59:48,204 --> 00:59:50,879
When you aren’t free.

832
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:56,902
Are you sure, Esther,

833
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:59,238
that Leo doesn't raise
his hands against you?

834
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,152
No...

835
01:00:07,177 --> 01:00:09,631
No. He doesn’t.

836
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:15,481
-Wait, you guys want to take a break?
-Okay.

837
01:00:15,506 --> 01:00:16,506
Let's rest a bit.

838
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:17,856
Let’s have coffee.

839
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:18,715
Yes.

840
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:21,065
Alright. Coffee.

841
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,832
Let’s go inside for a while.

842
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:24,665
Okay.

843
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:26,298
Let’s go.

844
01:00:34,314 --> 01:00:35,189
Esther…

845
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:43,558
I’m hungry, actually.

846
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:46,785
I wonder what Alexa's serving.

847
01:01:39,923 --> 01:01:40,715
Leo...

848
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:44,652
can you tell me,

849
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,298
how much you owe,

850
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:53,131
and what have you
sold and mortgaged?

851
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:56,340
What?

852
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:11,417
Leo, please answer me.

853
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:20,840
Don’t pester me.

854
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:24,887
I’ve mortgaged nothing.
I’ve sold nothing.

855
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,606
Who are those men
you keep talking to?

856
01:02:26,631 --> 01:02:27,707
That’s none of your business.

857
01:02:27,732 --> 01:02:29,273
Is that possible, Leo?

858
01:02:29,298 --> 01:02:30,006
Yes.

859
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:33,035
How can I not worry,
you’re always furious when they call.

860
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:38,074
Why, I permit you to play mahjong.

861
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:40,582
It’s not your concern who I talk to.

862
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:42,881
Remember...

863
01:02:43,337 --> 01:02:45,254
I’m the one who’s
working in this family.

864
01:02:45,356 --> 01:02:46,980
I earn.

865
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,756
Don’t pry into my affairs.

866
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:52,131
Yes, I know.

867
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:55,559
But don’t I deserve
a bit of explanation-

868
01:02:56,006 --> 01:03:00,004
Remember, don’t interfere!

869
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:06,363
Damn it.

870
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:09,434
I probably lose because of you.

871
01:03:20,336 --> 01:03:24,113
What happened to your other driver?

872
01:03:26,446 --> 01:03:29,346
Flirted with my daughter’s
piano teacher.

873
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:30,371
Fired!

874
01:03:30,709 --> 01:03:32,238
Yes, the girl too.

875
01:03:32,263 --> 01:03:35,023
Gosh, how violent your scenes are.

876
01:03:35,048 --> 01:03:37,832
I can’t count how
many you’ve sacked.

877
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:43,692
Well, now you have Gaspar,
driver and sweet lover.

878
01:03:43,717 --> 01:03:45,481
Accepts coins in the morning.

879
01:03:45,506 --> 01:03:47,192
Here’s the food.

880
01:03:47,548 --> 01:03:48,298
Thank you.

881
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:49,573
Hey, Alexa lollipop.

882
01:03:50,337 --> 01:03:54,840
Sit here, let’s talk as we eat.

883
01:03:55,077 --> 01:03:58,027
I’ve received a lot of phone-in
questions from your fans.

884
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:02,512
They want to know
if Bataan has fallen?

885
01:04:03,911 --> 01:04:06,691
Respect the food before you.

886
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,440
What’s wrong with my inquiry?

887
01:04:08,465 --> 01:04:10,332
It’s in history, the fall of Bataan.

888
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:11,565
Don’t interrupt us.

889
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,340
You’ve a boyfriend already?

890
01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:14,373
I had one.

891
01:04:14,398 --> 01:04:15,065
You have?

892
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,090
But only online.

893
01:04:16,106 --> 01:04:17,106
Online?

894
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:20,565
How can Bataan fall
if the siege is online?

895
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,715
How long did this
affair last?

896
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:22,823
Two months.

897
01:04:22,897 --> 01:04:25,387
Two months? Like a short film.

898
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:29,449
Millennials are like that,
it’s all games now.

899
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,215
At least they’re not addicts.

900
01:04:31,818 --> 01:04:33,800
We all have addictions, Ason.

901
01:04:33,923 --> 01:04:34,715
I don't.

902
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:37,184
You’re addicted to something,
you just can’t admit it.

903
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:39,277
I’m sure I don’t have one.

904
01:04:39,371 --> 01:04:40,590
You’re just suppressed.

905
01:04:40,615 --> 01:04:43,324
No. I think you meant, repressed.

906
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:50,648
I’m so impressed.

907
01:04:50,673 --> 01:04:58,190
I’m your friend on-air and this is Miss Hot
Compress, warm and tightly pressed.

908
01:04:58,215 --> 01:05:02,479
To those who want to be squeezed,
call this program, “Squeeze Me Baby”.

909
01:05:02,504 --> 01:05:03,934
Let’s promote...

910
01:05:04,582 --> 01:05:09,246
She vanished. What’s that about?

911
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:10,942
She walked out on us.

912
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:14,840
Gaspar.

913
01:05:15,256 --> 01:05:15,881
Ma’am

914
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:18,910
Play for me.

915
01:05:19,673 --> 01:05:20,215
Okay.

916
01:05:21,065 --> 01:05:21,731
Should I go there now?

917
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:22,673
Hello, Jessie?

918
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:24,465
Later, we’re on our break.

919
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:26,332
Where’s Oakley?

920
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:28,837
Hereabouts, I let him roam for a bit.

921
01:05:28,862 --> 01:05:31,301
Okay. I’ll be home tomorrow.

922
01:05:31,434 --> 01:05:33,834
Okay ma'am,
I'll just fix stuff here.

923
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:37,301
Yeah, sure.
I’ll call when I’m on the road.

924
01:05:37,418 --> 01:05:39,675
Okay, ma'am.
Take care.

925
01:05:42,098 --> 01:05:44,152
-You know what, Wylo.
-What?

926
01:05:44,177 --> 01:05:48,356
I wondering how I’ll be able
to get my money back from debtors.

927
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:50,131
I keep calling them,
but they're not answering.

928
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:51,822
And we can’t force them
at this time, right?

929
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:56,004
Why are you suddenly telling me this?

930
01:05:56,301 --> 01:05:59,898
You’re hinting that I should
pay my debts, aren’t you.

931
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:02,238
Oh, no.

932
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:04,613
Look, Gaspar’s coming towards us.

933
01:06:04,638 --> 01:06:05,388
Hello.

934
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:06,481
Gaspar, hey.

935
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:08,065
Ma’am Amparo told me
to play in her stead.

936
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,131
Is that so.

937
01:06:09,156 --> 01:06:12,059
Move, he’s going to play with us.

938
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:13,496
Our original seats.

939
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:15,590
Why? Alright.

940
01:06:16,215 --> 01:06:17,762
Change would be nice though.

941
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:18,954
What’s Amparo doing?

942
01:06:19,048 --> 01:06:20,801
She said she’ll be resting for a while.

943
01:06:22,676 --> 01:06:25,523
It’s good that you can play.

944
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:26,731
Of course he can.

945
01:06:26,756 --> 01:06:29,340
Didn’t I ask him earlier
if he’s good at touching?

946
01:06:30,043 --> 01:06:32,523
Mama told me to take her place.

947
01:06:32,548 --> 01:06:33,398
Okay then.

948
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:34,898
Alright.

949
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:36,543
The more the merrier.

950
01:06:36,568 --> 01:06:40,129
Better than being alone with Ason,
she’s spouting nonsense.

951
01:06:41,738 --> 01:06:43,371
Okay.

952
01:06:43,387 --> 01:06:46,715
- Stop staring too much...
- At who?

953
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,523
The way you look at Alexa,
it’s like you’re remembering your youth.

954
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,023
I am.

955
01:06:52,048 --> 01:06:54,231
Yes, I was very beautiful then.

956
01:06:54,256 --> 01:06:56,231
What a liar you are.

957
01:06:56,256 --> 01:06:58,090
How you lie,
and to these kids’ faces too!

958
01:06:58,115 --> 01:06:59,315
You’re mean.

959
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,731
Well, she was beautiful back in the day.
But only on during daylight.

960
01:07:02,756 --> 01:07:04,474
I was always beautiful then.

961
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:06,777
She was beautiful.

962
01:07:06,802 --> 01:07:11,059
But only one day in a week.

963
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:12,793
It comes and goes.

964
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,994
Sometimes she’s pretty on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

965
01:07:16,523 --> 01:07:17,731
You’re too much.

966
01:07:17,756 --> 01:07:20,715
Then she becomes ugly again on
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

967
01:07:21,256 --> 01:07:22,256
Can we start?

968
01:07:22,281 --> 01:07:23,923
Give me the dice.

969
01:07:26,603 --> 01:07:27,950
Okay.

970
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:30,715
Oops!

971
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:32,048
Seven.

972
01:07:32,896 --> 01:07:33,938
I will choose.

973
01:07:34,715 --> 01:07:35,715
Alexa...

974
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:38,048
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

975
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,775
That’s yours.

976
01:07:51,677 --> 01:07:52,677
Yours.

977
01:07:57,256 --> 01:07:58,978
More.

978
01:08:03,697 --> 01:08:07,236
I think I’ll get lucky this time.

979
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:10,103
We’ll see.

980
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:20,090
What.

981
01:08:24,223 --> 01:08:25,596
Damn it.

982
01:08:29,361 --> 01:08:30,441
- Hello?
- Bro?

983
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:34,715
Can you load me a hundred?

984
01:08:36,268 --> 01:08:38,107
You're asking
a loan for that?

985
01:08:38,131 --> 01:08:39,846
Of course I’ll pay you.

986
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:44,556
You must've forgotten
that you still owe me!

987
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:47,077
What, you don’t trust me?

988
01:08:47,213 --> 01:08:48,963
It's better to be safe
than sorry.

989
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:50,912
We're talking about money here.

990
01:08:50,937 --> 01:08:53,478
They lost. Alright.

991
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:55,756
After my payment.

992
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,256
You’re greedy. Alright, alright.

993
01:09:18,881 --> 01:09:19,881
One character.

994
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:21,939
Todas!

995
01:09:23,252 --> 01:09:25,606
Jai alai, 60! Todas 30-90!

996
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,881
You’re lucky!

997
01:09:28,963 --> 01:09:32,814
I’m sleepy.
I must say good night now.

998
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:33,839
Well...

999
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:41,408
This is Wylo Lee
signing off for tonight.

1000
01:09:41,433 --> 01:09:43,773
130 AM in your frequencies.

1001
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:45,523
I love you, tomorrow.

1002
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:46,940
-See you.
-Okay.

1003
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,190
Farewell.

1004
01:09:48,215 --> 01:09:49,978
Good night, from this
seductive witch.

1005
01:09:50,807 --> 01:09:53,283
I’m exhausted!
My neck hurts.

1006
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:55,541
Come on, let’s sleep.

1007
01:09:56,295 --> 01:09:57,879
The way you invite me,
it’s like we’re sleeping together.

1008
01:09:57,904 --> 01:09:59,369
Did you win?

1009
01:10:01,478 --> 01:10:03,061
I’ll just count this.

1010
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:08,275
I think I just recovered what I lost.
You?

1011
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:12,150
Same.

1012
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,565
Uncle Wylo keeps winning.

1013
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,494
Yeah, he’s been killing us.

1014
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:22,642
I didn’t know
you’re good at mahjong.

1015
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,736
No, just lucky.

1016
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:29,236
That didn’t look like luck,
you play like an expert.

1017
01:10:35,003 --> 01:10:38,795
Let’s clear this.
It’s past midnight already.

1018
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:39,820
Okay.

1019
01:12:07,492 --> 01:12:13,531
My god, Ason snores
like a speedboat.

1020
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,317
Ason!

1021
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:18,173
She’s really asleep.

1022
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,090
Oh my god.

1023
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:02,548
Hey, Amparo's coming.

1024
01:13:03,215 --> 01:13:04,215
Oh no...

1025
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,039
So you've finished playing.

1026
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:30,632
Where’s Gaspar?

1027
01:13:31,506 --> 01:13:32,506
I don’t know.

1028
01:13:33,999 --> 01:13:35,083
What happened here?

1029
01:13:35,488 --> 01:13:36,488
The box fell.

1030
01:13:38,117 --> 01:13:41,648
Oh no, they're going
to get caught.

1031
01:13:54,965 --> 01:13:56,090
Where have you been?

1032
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,590
I just…

1033
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:00,090
washed my face.

1034
01:14:01,798 --> 01:14:03,048
Here’s the money.

1035
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,548
We just won back what we lost.

1036
01:14:07,644 --> 01:14:10,273
Don’t do anything stupid,
you son of a bitch.

1037
01:14:10,298 --> 01:14:11,786
Why, what have I done?

1038
01:14:21,715 --> 01:14:24,497
What are you waiting for?
Come.

1039
01:16:11,678 --> 01:16:13,771
What’s that creaking sound?

1040
01:16:22,215 --> 01:16:24,825
Unbelievable.

1041
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,826
Alexa.

1042
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:40,840
Damn it, he’s persistent.
He’s not content,

1043
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,048
he wants another round.

1044
01:16:45,715 --> 01:16:46,951
Alexa.

1045
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:29,148
I couldn’t wake up last night,
I took a pill.

1046
01:21:29,173 --> 01:21:30,458
You didn’t return either?

1047
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:33,552
My campaign manager
gave me migraine.

1048
01:21:33,577 --> 01:21:39,731
Oh the great events that
transpired on this table!

1049
01:21:39,756 --> 01:21:42,076
Hey, your driver was nice.

1050
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:43,715
What great events did we miss?

1051
01:21:43,763 --> 01:21:46,606
We had fun practicing
our tactile skills.

1052
01:21:46,631 --> 01:21:47,381
Didn’t we, Ason?

1053
01:21:47,423 --> 01:21:48,173
Yes.

1054
01:21:49,215 --> 01:21:51,622
And Alexa’s very good at the game.

1055
01:21:51,647 --> 01:21:52,940
Did she win?

1056
01:21:52,982 --> 01:21:53,440
Yes.

1057
01:21:53,465 --> 01:21:55,060
Oh, she’s lucky at gambling.

1058
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:58,544
When she went with me to the casino,
we hit the jackpot.

1059
01:21:58,569 --> 01:22:01,398
Hey! Pong, todas!

1060
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:01,981
Let me see.

1061
01:22:02,006 --> 01:22:02,590
Sixty.

1062
01:22:02,615 --> 01:22:03,407
Wow.

1063
01:22:03,432 --> 01:22:05,927
The old woman finally won.

1064
01:22:06,545 --> 01:22:08,606
Wait. I’ll go to the CR.

1065
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:09,911
Alright.

1066
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:12,482
I'll leave you three for a bit.

1067
01:22:12,507 --> 01:22:14,919
There! My back hurts too.

1068
01:22:16,048 --> 01:22:17,654
Hey, Amparo.

1069
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:19,600
Are you sure about running?

1070
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:20,898
Yes, for councilor again.

1071
01:22:20,923 --> 01:22:22,773
Ah, a reelectionist.

1072
01:22:22,798 --> 01:22:25,552
I hope you go mad.
No, I hope you win.

1073
01:22:26,332 --> 01:22:27,856
The things you say!

1074
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:29,023
You’re easily offended.

1075
01:22:29,048 --> 01:22:30,357
How was your sleep?

1076
01:22:30,382 --> 01:22:32,169
It was great.
How about you?

1077
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:36,982
I almost got caught.

1078
01:22:37,007 --> 01:22:39,068
Yeah.

1079
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:45,756
What are you doing here?

1080
01:22:47,381 --> 01:22:48,923
I don’t allow drivers in this kitchen.
Get out.

1081
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:10,868
You’re good, aren’t you?

1082
01:23:14,177 --> 01:23:17,466
You'll let anyone rub that itch.

1083
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:23,302
Have a bit of self-respect.

1084
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,340
Self-respect?

1085
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:28,131
Do you have that?

1086
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,122
It’s you who taught me
to be this way, right?

1087
01:23:32,756 --> 01:23:34,286
Stop what you’re doing.

1088
01:23:36,756 --> 01:23:39,701
Or Amparo’s driver’s going to get it.

1089
01:23:41,822 --> 01:23:43,780
You and your mother too.

1090
01:23:44,298 --> 01:23:47,724
Do what you like.
I’ll do what I like.

1091
01:23:48,826 --> 01:23:49,826
This is my body.

1092
01:23:50,434 --> 01:23:53,536
You didn’t contribute one
single hair to this.

1093
01:23:54,759 --> 01:23:55,967
You’re lucky you
even tasted this.

1094
01:24:06,014 --> 01:24:06,848
What’s that about?

1095
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:08,798
Nothing.

1096
01:24:10,131 --> 01:24:11,131
What do you mean?

1097
01:24:14,798 --> 01:24:15,548
Leo…

1098
01:24:16,798 --> 01:24:18,638
Did Alexa do anything wrong?

1099
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:24,313
I’m just correcting your daughter.

1100
01:24:25,475 --> 01:24:28,693
She shouldn’t let drivers
into my house.

1101
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:32,631
Maybe you just have a dirty mind?

1102
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:36,589
What did you just say?

1103
01:24:38,465 --> 01:24:39,465
I’ve got a dirty mind?

1104
01:24:40,896 --> 01:24:42,661
You’re saying I’m in
the wrong here?

1105
01:24:46,543 --> 01:24:48,232
I’m just protecting you.

1106
01:24:48,631 --> 01:24:49,631
Your daughter.

1107
01:24:50,673 --> 01:24:51,673
Our daughter.

1108
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,756
Have I ever mistreated you?

1109
01:24:55,923 --> 01:24:56,923
Either of you?

1110
01:24:57,735 --> 01:25:01,544
Have I acted badly
towards your friends?

1111
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:23,090
Hey!

1112
01:25:29,974 --> 01:25:31,881
I’m sorry about earlier.

1113
01:25:33,798 --> 01:25:36,715
That’s alright. I understand.

1114
01:25:38,506 --> 01:25:39,731
Is that really your father?

1115
01:25:39,756 --> 01:25:41,315
He’s not.

1116
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,708
But he provides for me and my mother.

1117
01:25:43,952 --> 01:25:45,583
Where’s your real father?

1118
01:25:46,131 --> 01:25:47,529
In Australia.

1119
01:25:48,615 --> 01:25:50,341
He rarely visits.

1120
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:53,662
Why don’t you go to him?

1121
01:25:54,646 --> 01:25:55,809
I want to.

1122
01:26:02,473 --> 01:26:03,473
I don’t like it here.

1123
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:14,622
Will you help me escape?

1124
01:26:16,509 --> 01:26:18,661
Escape? What for?

1125
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:27,482
Ma’am’s coming here.

1126
01:26:28,001 --> 01:26:29,001
Hide yourself, there.

1127
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:31,891
Damn it!

1128
01:26:41,506 --> 01:26:42,173
Ma’am!

1129
01:26:44,256 --> 01:26:45,006
Cigarettes?

1130
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,865
My friends annoy me.

1131
01:26:49,962 --> 01:26:50,670
Why?

1132
01:26:51,215 --> 01:26:53,786
They’re ganging up on me.

1133
01:26:54,087 --> 01:26:56,513
Don’t mind them, Ma’am.

1134
01:26:59,235 --> 01:27:01,402
Screw you, I’ll get even with you.

1135
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:13,037
You need a massage, Ma’am?

1136
01:27:19,732 --> 01:27:23,298
If I were you, Ma’am, I wouldn’t think
too much of what they say.

1137
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:25,965
They don’t mean it.

1138
01:27:28,756 --> 01:27:31,423
Just relax, Ma’am.

1139
01:27:39,215 --> 01:27:40,298
Come here.

1140
01:30:52,693 --> 01:30:53,735
Hey.

1141
01:30:57,092 --> 01:30:58,717
Good afternoon, sir Leo.

1142
01:30:58,742 --> 01:31:00,117
What’s your problem?

1143
01:31:00,142 --> 01:31:02,281
We've come to get the money.

1144
01:31:02,306 --> 01:31:03,306
Someone sent you?

1145
01:31:03,331 --> 01:31:04,935
Boss Ben sent us.

1146
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,224
You can't wait till I pay your Boss?

1147
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:11,396
Screw you, you can’t threaten me here.

1148
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:15,060
This is my territory!
Get out of here!

1149
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:20,870
And you idiot, don’t open
the door for these scum!

1150
01:31:20,895 --> 01:31:22,966
I’m sorry, sir.

1151
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,441
- We're just following orders.
- Close the door.

1152
01:31:25,466 --> 01:31:28,315
Moron. Get out of here!

1153
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:29,411
I’ll close it now, boss.

1154
01:31:30,648 --> 01:31:31,648
What else can you do?

1155
01:31:31,673 --> 01:31:33,279
I’m closing it, sir.

1156
01:31:48,465 --> 01:31:49,310
Leo.

1157
01:31:50,584 --> 01:31:51,584
What’s that?

1158
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,685
It’s nothing. Don’t mind them.

1159
01:31:56,848 --> 01:31:59,877
You’re angry again.
Want to relax?

1160
01:31:59,902 --> 01:32:02,860
Take my place for a while.
You know how to play, right?

1161
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:04,267
Wylo’s there.

1162
01:32:05,514 --> 01:32:08,974
I’ll just help Alexa prepare dinner.

1163
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,220
Okay.

1164
01:32:12,279 --> 01:32:13,810
Just relax, okay?

1165
01:32:18,506 --> 01:32:19,506
Hey, Leo.

1166
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:25,240
You’ll play with us?

1167
01:32:26,884 --> 01:32:27,884
That’s nice.

1168
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,773
Can we change places?

1169
01:32:29,856 --> 01:32:30,981
Whatever suits you.

1170
01:32:31,006 --> 01:32:33,654
We’re glad you’re here, really.
I’ll sit here.

1171
01:32:35,435 --> 01:32:36,965
Okay, I’ll switch seats.

1172
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:39,583
I thought you’d completely
snub us.

1173
01:32:40,451 --> 01:32:41,967
Your money.

1174
01:32:41,992 --> 01:32:42,950
Wait, the money.

1175
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:43,958
Right.

1176
01:32:44,037 --> 01:32:45,773
Is this Amparo's?

1177
01:32:45,798 --> 01:32:49,458
I don’t like this one,
no winnings here, I don’t need that.

1178
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:51,724
Let's begin.

1179
01:32:59,025 --> 01:33:02,123
Leo, it’s good you decided
to play with us.

1180
01:33:02,148 --> 01:33:04,326
We haven’t seen each
other for a long time.

1181
01:33:04,351 --> 01:33:06,669
You’re busy talking to people.

1182
01:33:08,396 --> 01:33:10,856
Always on the phone.

1183
01:33:10,881 --> 01:33:13,349
Just managing the business.

1184
01:33:13,974 --> 01:33:17,005
Stay here, talk to us.

1185
01:33:25,732 --> 01:33:27,006
Okay.

1186
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:41,631
Okay.

1187
01:33:47,931 --> 01:33:48,931
Hey.

1188
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:52,443
Let’s not serve according
to seniority.

1189
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,755
Serve her.

1190
01:33:55,935 --> 01:33:57,106
Thank you.

1191
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,131
What’s that.

1192
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:00,565
Serve him.

1193
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:02,190
Old woman!

1194
01:34:02,215 --> 01:34:04,396
Your energy’s gone down.

1195
01:34:05,923 --> 01:34:07,669
I’m sniffling.

1196
01:34:14,098 --> 01:34:15,716
Flores, flores.

1197
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:24,940
-The game suddenly feels serious.
-You need four tiles?

1198
01:34:24,965 --> 01:34:26,756
Of course, Leo’s here.

1199
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:28,224
Here.

1200
01:34:30,423 --> 01:34:31,763
One for you.

1201
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:38,965
Okay.

1202
01:34:52,215 --> 01:34:53,215
You’ve completed yours?

1203
01:34:53,673 --> 01:34:54,590
Yes.

1204
01:34:55,006 --> 01:34:56,006
Roll the dice.

1205
01:35:06,798 --> 01:35:07,798
Throw.

1206
01:35:12,965 --> 01:35:13,590
Okay.

1207
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:16,815
I’m thinking.

1208
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,840
You don’t like that?

1209
01:35:17,865 --> 01:35:20,990
Nothing. Zero balance.

1210
01:35:51,256 --> 01:35:52,256
Chow.

1211
01:36:03,881 --> 01:36:04,881
Damn this.

1212
01:36:06,148 --> 01:36:07,315
That bird keeps coming back.

1213
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:08,724
Hide it!

1214
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:12,669
-Birds are attracted to you.
-That's right.

1215
01:36:13,048 --> 01:36:14,506
Maybe because
I look like a flower.

1216
01:36:22,896 --> 01:36:23,896
Todas.

1217
01:36:26,694 --> 01:36:27,403
He’s good.

1218
01:36:27,654 --> 01:36:29,648
I was waiting for that one.

1219
01:36:29,673 --> 01:36:32,146
You’ve a lucky start.

1220
01:36:42,693 --> 01:36:44,872
Will you accept cigarettes as change?

1221
01:36:46,607 --> 01:36:51,940
Dear, thank you for
cooking for your godparents.

1222
01:36:51,965 --> 01:36:55,190
They’re so impressed
with the food we serve here.

1223
01:36:55,215 --> 01:36:56,615
They say it’s delicious.

1224
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,716
I really made it
special for all of you.

1225
01:37:03,626 --> 01:37:05,876
Is this beef or pork?

1226
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,773
Beef. Stew, just what you like.

1227
01:37:08,798 --> 01:37:10,529
This is your specialty, right?

1228
01:37:16,444 --> 01:37:17,528
Am I chopping it right?

1229
01:37:19,048 --> 01:37:20,536
That’s alright, Ma.

1230
01:37:27,673 --> 01:37:29,298
Do you need tomatoes for it?

1231
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:32,146
Sure ‘Ma. Just cut it in half.

1232
01:37:37,756 --> 01:37:39,888
I am just messing with Ason.

1233
01:37:40,881 --> 01:37:42,006
You haven’t lost your sense of taste?

1234
01:37:43,048 --> 01:37:44,048
Your hearing?

1235
01:37:44,923 --> 01:37:49,106
Hearing’s the first to go.

1236
01:37:49,131 --> 01:37:49,756
Wait!

1237
01:37:51,756 --> 01:37:52,756
Okay.

1238
01:38:31,965 --> 01:38:34,381
Here. Eat this.

1239
01:38:44,381 --> 01:38:47,208
She dropped it.

1240
01:38:50,631 --> 01:38:51,631
Here.

1241
01:38:52,881 --> 01:38:53,756
Todas.

1242
01:38:56,256 --> 01:38:58,966
How lucky, he’s won already.

1243
01:39:01,911 --> 01:39:03,560
I’m stunned.

1244
01:39:05,747 --> 01:39:10,340
I thought I'd win this round,
because I have a lot of jokers.

1245
01:39:17,412 --> 01:39:21,536
Actually, the topic
Violence against Women,

1246
01:39:21,561 --> 01:39:25,042
it is still a sensitive topic.

1247
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,888
But it must be addressed.

1248
01:39:27,921 --> 01:39:30,083
Because it's happening
all over the world,

1249
01:39:30,108 --> 01:39:33,271
and in our country
because of this pandemic.

1250
01:39:33,417 --> 01:39:40,857
The cases of Violence against women
is still high in our country.

1251
01:39:41,063 --> 01:39:42,203
Imagine...

1252
01:39:45,086 --> 01:39:51,094
One in every three women
experience abuse.

1253
01:40:04,535 --> 01:40:05,535
Your turn, Wylo.

1254
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:11,420
Hey.

1255
01:40:12,904 --> 01:40:14,321
I heard you’re running...

1256
01:40:16,748 --> 01:40:18,373
for reelection as councilor.

1257
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:22,189
I am.

1258
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:29,631
I’m sure you’ll win.

1259
01:40:31,317 --> 01:40:32,766
That’s bound to happen.

1260
01:40:35,548 --> 01:40:36,548
Naturally.

1261
01:40:37,256 --> 01:40:38,256
You’re rich.

1262
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,531
Very rich, Leo.

1263
01:40:43,567 --> 01:40:45,025
I can’t count my money.

1264
01:40:46,257 --> 01:40:48,227
And I never get into debts.

1265
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:49,312
Not one peso.

1266
01:40:50,131 --> 01:40:53,590
You want me to lend you some? I will.

1267
01:40:55,173 --> 01:40:56,798
How much do you need?

1268
01:40:56,823 --> 01:40:58,364
Ten million?

1269
01:40:59,423 --> 01:41:00,590
How will you pay me?

1270
01:41:03,324 --> 01:41:06,615
And Leo, you know I didn’t acquire
my wealth through illegal means.

1271
01:41:09,661 --> 01:41:11,606
You’re so clean, Amparo Cua.

1272
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:12,631
Spotless.

1273
01:41:12,912 --> 01:41:14,531
I am, Leo.

1274
01:41:16,006 --> 01:41:17,006
Really?

1275
01:41:18,178 --> 01:41:21,180
Is that why you bring trash
into my house?

1276
01:41:23,064 --> 01:41:25,469
You want me to point
them out one by one?

1277
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:29,165
I’ll just have a cigarette break.

1278
01:41:38,566 --> 01:41:39,566
Me, too.

1279
01:41:48,623 --> 01:41:49,898
That was intense.

1280
01:41:49,923 --> 01:41:50,923
Yes.

1281
01:41:50,986 --> 01:41:54,398
They’ve clashed before.
It’s terrifying when they quarrel.

1282
01:41:54,423 --> 01:41:55,695
Exactly.

1283
01:41:57,121 --> 01:41:59,008
How much have you won?

1284
01:41:59,625 --> 01:42:03,492
Not much, I lost a lot.

1285
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:04,434
What?

1286
01:42:04,826 --> 01:42:08,055
I haven’t counted,
but I’ve lost several times.

1287
01:43:06,584 --> 01:43:08,578
Here she is.

1288
01:43:08,905 --> 01:43:09,905
Let’s play now.

1289
01:43:09,954 --> 01:43:11,154
Okay, let's go.

1290
01:43:19,131 --> 01:43:19,840
What now?

1291
01:43:22,657 --> 01:43:23,731
Let’s continue.

1292
01:43:23,756 --> 01:43:25,344
Whose turn is it?

1293
01:43:25,369 --> 01:43:26,258
My turn, I think.

1294
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:27,283
I'll pick.

1295
01:43:41,436 --> 01:43:43,170
Going back to our topic.

1296
01:43:47,756 --> 01:43:48,756
That was good.

1297
01:43:49,715 --> 01:43:50,715
Interesting.

1298
01:43:54,619 --> 01:43:57,286
What part of my life do you
want to talk about?

1299
01:43:58,631 --> 01:44:01,965
You really want me to be the subject
of the conversation, don’t you?

1300
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,648
It’s interesting.

1301
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:14,389
For council.
Amparo Cua, Reelect!

1302
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:16,110
Right?

1303
01:44:17,218 --> 01:44:19,590
Amparo Cua, reelect!

1304
01:44:21,522 --> 01:44:25,189
Poor voters. They don’t know
they’re voting for trash.

1305
01:44:28,356 --> 01:44:29,356
Enough of that.

1306
01:44:29,381 --> 01:44:29,965
Let's play.

1307
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:32,641
At least, I’m not molesting anybody.

1308
01:44:36,329 --> 01:44:37,246
What did you say?

1309
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,683
You think I don’t know

1310
01:44:40,708 --> 01:44:44,274
that you’ve been molesting
Esther’s daughter for a long time?

1311
01:44:44,314 --> 01:44:46,856
Screw you! Don’t make up
stories about me!

1312
01:44:46,881 --> 01:44:49,266
Don’t you dare swear at me!

1313
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,290
Screw you!

1314
01:44:50,423 --> 01:44:51,789
Screw you too! Motherfucker!

1315
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,570
Screw you!

1316
01:44:56,298 --> 01:44:57,965
Screw you, Amparo!

1317
01:44:59,805 --> 01:45:01,173
Screw you!

1318
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,090
Gaspar!

1319
01:45:04,756 --> 01:45:06,383
Screw you!

1320
01:45:09,048 --> 01:45:11,631
Screw you, Amparo!

1321
01:45:20,465 --> 01:45:21,798
Screw you too!

1322
01:45:22,756 --> 01:45:23,423
Sir!

1323
01:45:27,298 --> 01:45:28,298
You shit!

1324
01:45:31,774 --> 01:45:33,214
You piece of shit.

1325
01:45:33,394 --> 01:45:34,577
Sir, don't.

1326
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:39,797
Damn you! Bastard!

1327
01:45:39,822 --> 01:45:42,266
Sir, don’t, sir! Sir, no!

1328
01:45:43,195 --> 01:45:44,881
Piece of shit!
What?

1329
01:45:44,906 --> 01:45:47,836
Meddling son of a bitch!

1330
01:45:47,861 --> 01:45:49,736
Screw you, you aren’t contented.

1331
01:45:50,031 --> 01:45:53,663
-You are not content with your mistress!
-Sir, no!

1332
01:45:53,867 --> 01:45:55,914
Screw you!

1333
01:46:15,095 --> 01:46:16,553
Screw you all!

1334
01:46:21,489 --> 01:46:22,539
Alexa?

1335
01:46:25,756 --> 01:46:26,423
Alexa!

1336
01:46:41,998 --> 01:46:44,055
Alexa...

1337
01:46:59,702 --> 01:47:01,504
Don’t be scared…

1338
01:47:24,491 --> 01:47:25,957
Alexa!

1339
01:48:04,524 --> 01:48:05,524
Alexa!

1340
01:48:05,983 --> 01:48:08,266
You ungrateful bitch!
