00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,040

(Ji Seung Hyun)

3
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,830
(Koo Jun Hoe)

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,710
(Mom)

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,950
(No Mercy)

6
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,950
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

7
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,950
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,030
- Open it.
- What?

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,730
No way.

10
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,800
Damn, dude.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,130
I think I just went blind...

12
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,000
all of a sudden.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,910
Whatever's dazzling my eyes...

14
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,170
has to be the light, right?

15
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,240
Thank you.

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,010
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

17
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,880
I threw in some extra,

18
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,250
so send me solid guys this time.

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,720
Reliable ones, not like those flakes
who keep bailing on me.

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,260
Keep that shit up
and we'll have problems.

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,460
You got it.

22
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,090
I'll...

23
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,430
round up every sharp guy in Korea,

24
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,300
whip them into shape,

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,400
and deliver them straight to your door.

26
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,610
So don't you worry.

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,980
And that thing we discussed last time...

28
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,310
You said one of your operations
got shut down, right?

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,050
So I went ahead...

30
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,890
and brought this hotshot with me today.

31
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,760
Hey, come on in.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,030
It's an honor to meet you.

33
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,370
Meet Lee Seung Tae.

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,540
In this field,
phones, shops, and cards,

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,640
you name it,
this guy's got it all locked down.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,810
Basically, he's like the cannon.

37
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,350
All right.

38
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,420
So you're the cannon.

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,390
Let's blow something up together.

40
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,690
Boom.

41
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,060
You got it.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,130
I'll take care of the supply, no problem.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,700
Let's have a drink.

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,300
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,910
Nice.

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,140
Speaking of which,

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,480
Let's see what you're really made of.

48
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,710
I need a favor.

49
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,820
I'll make it worth your while.

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,760
Sorry, but what kind of test...

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,410
(No Mercy)

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,930
(Episode 2)

53
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,770
Based on your dad's phone records,

54
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,370
we've confirmed that your mom's missing

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,110
is linked with the Ilseong clan.

56
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,020
It's our case now.

57
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,920
Hang in there.

58
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,520
If you hear anything about your mom,
call me right away...

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,990
You think those scumbags

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
will actually pay?

61
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,400
Of course.

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,770
When we catch them,
they're looking at least...

63
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,240
What, for how long?

64
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,610
Five years?

65
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,110
Maybe ten for whoever's running it?

66
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,720
So Min.

67
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,950
I know how hard this is for you right now.

68
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,450
They do their time, get out,

69
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,020
and they're square with the law.

70
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,460
That's not justice.

71
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,360
That's just killing time
until they're back on the streets.

72
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,300
I don't believe in
the law's idea of justice.

73
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,170
Then trust me instead.

74
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,110
Forget the law. Trust me.

75
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,720
I think we'll be able to
find your mom soon.

76
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,280
How?

77
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,150
Where's my mom?

78
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,140
(Missing Person)

79
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,280
You sure this is her?

80
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm good with faces.

81
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
Definitely.

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,290
When and where exactly did you see her?

83
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,760
Two days ago,
I saw her at Seongan Intersection Station,

84
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,260
then today at City Hall Station.

85
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,490
So mostly around subway stations.

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,100
Did you notice anything unusual...

87
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,070
about her?

88
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,930
She didn't look homeless or anything,

89
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,210
but every time I saw her,
she's got the same outfit on.

90
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,580
That's when it clicked,
after seeing the missing person banner.

91
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,540
So the clothes were always the same.

92
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,010
Other than the subway stations,

93
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,420
have you seen her anywhere else?

94
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,350
Right.

95
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,750
I once saw her entering a building
over by Gyodong Elementary School.

96
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,060
A building?

97
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,960
Yes, she was carrying a backpack.

98
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
That's near my place.

99
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,520
I should've seen this coming
when you started talking about acting.

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,920
So it finally came to this disaster.

101
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,860
What? You dropped out?

102
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,530
If I'd asked, you never would've let me.

103
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,700
We should've talked about this.

104
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,100
You're just letting me know
what you decided.

105
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,070
You decided on your own and just told me.

106
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,640
What did you expect me to say?
"Great, sweetheart?"

107
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,280
I tried talking to you before. You said
you were busy and just walked off.

108
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,940
I don't want to hear it.

109
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,210
Get back to that school
and undo this mess right now.

110
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,120
What do you mean, undo it?
You can't just cancel it.

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,620
Why can't it be done?
I'll do it, now move aside.

112
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,920
What could you possibly do?

113
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,820
So Min.

114
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,660
You worked yourself to the bone

115
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,030
to get into the police academy.
Won't you regret throwing that away?

116
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,990
Not at all.

117
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,300
You think this is all just a game?

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,660
You think acting's easy?

119
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,030
You think you can just work hard

120
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,570
and make it like school?

121
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,540
I'll grovel at that school if I have to.

122
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,040
I'll cancel it.
Get out of my way.

123
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,210
Where do you think you're going?
What are you going to do about it?

124
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,910
- Who says I can't?
- Seriously.

125
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,980
Forget it! I'll go.

126
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,810
I can't stand this anymore.

127
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,620
Don't you walk away from me!

128
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,630
I can't believe this.
That's what I raised?

129
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,360
She's everything to me.

130
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,210
(Mom)

131
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,920
Min.

132
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm terrified.

133
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,990
They hit me with a car

134
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,520
and won't let me go home.

135
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,090
You're lying.

136
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,260
What?

137
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,700
Who are you?

138
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,470
You can't even recognize
your own mother's voice?

139
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,930
How disappointing.

140
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,300
Who the hell are you? Where's my mom?

141
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,770
Mom.

142
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,410
Your mommy?

143
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,450
Your mom's...

144
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,820
always right there with you, sweetheart.

145
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,950
Shut up, you sick freak.

146
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,160
I want my mom right now!

147
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,360
I'm so scared.

148
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,830
You need to watch your mouth, kid.

149
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,800
You just crossed that line big time.

150
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,470
But you know what?

151
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,110
I wasn't lying about that part.

152
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,310
What the hell are you talking about?

153
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,510
That mom you're looking for?

154
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,150
She's right there with you. Look around.

155
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,220
She's around me?

156
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,120
Yes.

157
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,390
You'll find her yourself, won't you?

158
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,390
Then my job's done here.

159
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,940
The number you have dialed is
no longer in service.

160
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,980
(SOS, I need help.)

161
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,080
(That was a false alarm.)

162
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,690
(SOS message will be sent
to My Wife shortly.)

163
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,890
(My wife)

164
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,930
(Husband)

165
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,070
(Seongan Intersection Station)

166
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,510
(Seongan Intersection Station, Exit 1)

167
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,630
Are you all right?

168
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,610
(My wife, SOS, I need help.)

169
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,730
Excuse me.

170
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,660
This doesn't add up.

171
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,330
She's wearing the same clothes
from the day she went missing,

172
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,030
and wandering around her neighborhood
every day?

173
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,770
Someone must be behind this.

174
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,670
So I looked into those buildings

175
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,710
near Gyodong Elementary School.

176
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,480
And guess what?

177
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,710
Check this out.

178
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,610
(Olim Telecom)

179
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,050
Olim Telecom.

180
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,680
I looked into this prepaid phone company.

181
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,020
Something stinks about it.

182
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,220
Fishy as hell.

183
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,920
Their sales numbers are way too high.

184
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,190
Okay, that's got to be it.

Exactly.

188
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,070
I bet they're using missing people
to move these phones around.

189
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,570

190
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,470

with a crime syndicate.

How...

406
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,720
Like I said,

407
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960

410
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,330
So I got smart.

411
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,370
Answer was right here.

412
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,770
One voice, perfect disguise.

413
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,510
So I borrowed your mom.

414
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,950

You wench, where's your mom?

423
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,070
- Where did you hide her?
- What are you talking about?

424
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,070
You're in on this too, right?

425

437
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,900
That mess before,

438
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,200
I heard a cop's sniffing around.

439
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,810
Don't worry about it.

440
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,240

447
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,230

Two thousand?

530

535

What? You don't want that either?

536
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,220
So you can't pay...

537
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,630
and you don't want me to hurt him?

538
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,130

00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,080
Thanks.

555
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,510
Be careful.

556
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,550
If you die from losing too much blood,

557
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,320
I'll be in trouble.

558
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,260
I heard you got arrested...

559
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,430
but unfortunately walked free.

560
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,800
Look, about last time,

561
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,730
I'm really sorry.

562
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,670
Never mind that.
I need to ask you something.

563
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,240
Who do I have to go through...

564
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,670
to reach the ringleader?

565
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,580
What?

566
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,380
Tell me who.

567
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,680
Your son goes down...

568
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
unless you talk.

569
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,670
Well done, kid.

570
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,440
I'll call you back in ten.

571
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,540
Darn it.

572
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,450
Taxi!

573
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,250
To Dooil Bank, please.

574
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,360
A group known
as Team Leader Park Min Su...

575
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,130
reportedly used Victim A's voice

576
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,200
to carry out phishing scams on citizens.

577
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,360
Manager Kim Mi Yang,

578
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,530
who recently went viral online,
is the one involved.

579
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,600
The head of a voice phishing operation...

580
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,370
can face up to 15 years in prison.

581
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,910
There's concern over
these increasingly ruthless criminals...

582
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,310
Only 15 years
for destroying people's lives?

583
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,650
People want tougher sentences.

584
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,930
I'm here.

585
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,860
Just put the money...

586
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,370
in our account.

587
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,050
Hong Hwa, my boy.

588
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,390
What did you do to him?

589
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,960
You used my mom.

590
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,570
Now I use your kid.

591
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,570
You psycho jerk.

592
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,600
You hurt him,

593
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,540
you're dead.

594
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,740
So...

595
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,840
You'd better answer me
before something happens to him.

596
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,760
Hello?

597
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,000
I want to report someone
collecting money for phone scammers.

598
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,500
Say it.

599
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,700
Who is it?

600
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,880
You don't want to?

601
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,850
Then never mind.

602
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,090
I don't care if your son's life
goes down the drain.

603
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,220
Mr. Kim.

604
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,590
Mr. Kim?

605
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,300
He sends kids to the call centers.

606
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,330
The only way to the boss

607
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,500
is through Mr. Kim.

608
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,990
Sorry, I'm just doing what they told me.

609
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,490
The transaction has been canceled.

610
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,690
Please select the transaction you want.

611
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,130
They said they'd kill my son...

612
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,470
if I didn't help them.

613
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,770
What mother wouldn't do anything
to save her child?

614
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:38,920
Want to take them down?

615
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,550
Once we get this Mr. Kim guy,

616
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,860
it's finished.

617
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,530
I'll handle it.

618
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,100
Tell me where he is.

619
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,830
It won't be easy,

620
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,940
whether it's going to China

621
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,470
or taking him out.

622
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,420
(Seongan Police made victims
suffer all over again.)

623
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,220
(Manager A phishing case,
was there outside pressure?)

624
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,790
(Seongan Police Agency)

625
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,790
(Seongan Police's suspected of colluding
with Team Leader Park Min Su's gang.)

626
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,560
(No wonder nobody trust the cops.)

627
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,260
(Once it starts rotting inside,
there's no stopping it.)

628
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,790
(Seongan Police is seriously sketchy.)

629
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,000
Who leaked this?

630
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,970
Who leaked this case to outsiders?

631
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,440
We tried to pass this off,
but now it's all on us.

632
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,940
What about the damage
to our agency's reputation?

633
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,640
Since it's come to this,

634
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,810
you got one month.

635
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,320
Get those Ilseong bastards,
whatever it takes.

636
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,450
Thank you for the tip.

637
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,490
Seongan Police Agency.

638
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,390
Allegations of outside pressure on
the investigation into the Ilseong clan

639
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,930
the country's top financial scam group.

640
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,300
That's a killer headline.

641
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,030
Yes, you could call it tentpole-level.

642
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,700
Dig deeper and we might have
a major story.

643
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,470
Are you sure about this?

644
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,510
If they find out who you are,

645
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,610
Then I'll be famous. No big deal.

646
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,850
When it happens, people would cheer for me
even if I just went to the bathroom.

647
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,580
I'll be in touch.

648
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:37,770
So Min.

649
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,640
I'll be on my way now.

650
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,770
There's only one person

651
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,480
Ma Seok Gu fears in Ilseong.

652
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,010
Who's that?

653
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,580
Someone named Park Gye Soon.

654
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,180
- Park Gye Soon?
- Yeah.

655
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,520
She's the only one
who can control Ma Seok Gu,

656
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,290
the head of the Ilseong clan.

657
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,330
But right now,

658
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,800
she's missing.

659
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,270
Nobody knows where she is.

660
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,610
You're saying we pretend to be her
to infiltrate the Ilseong clan?

661
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:18,910
Can that even work?

662
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,380
It's all about technology and smarts now.

663
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,080
They played us,

664
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,420
so we play them back.

665
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,520
since we're already set on
getting revenge.

666
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,090
But how would that even work?

667
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,890
Deepfake technology.

668
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,130
Meet my informant.

669
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,530
That's one hell of a name.

670
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,200
Want to test it out on Mr. Kim?

671
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,170
Test what?

672
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,110
Curious what the test is?

673
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,280
If you want to know, pay a dime.

674
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,050
I'm so fucking fed up.

675
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,120
How long do I have...

676
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,170
to do this shit?

677
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,540
Fuck this. I'm done.

678
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,640
Keep this up...

679
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,810
and I'll lose my mind.

680
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,720
What the hell?

681
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,750
(Hi.)

682
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,920
Who the hell is this?

683
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,320
Who are you?

684
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,230
(Who could it be?)

685
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,060
What?

686
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,230
Who are you?

687
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,400
(If you want to know, pay a dime.)

688
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,100
Son of a bitch.

689
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,570
(You'll be shocked if you find out who.)

690
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,570
What kind of nutjob is this now?

691
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,540
What the hell?

692
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,680
It must be some dumbass.
I'll just pick it up.

693
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,780
How have you been?

694
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,550
It's

695
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,450
Park Gye Soon.

696
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,120
You...

697
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,630
How...

698
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,890
Since I pissed off that cunning bastard,

699
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,560
I've been living a new life.

700
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,270
Aren't you happy to see me?

701
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,770
(No Mercy)

702
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,940
Who the fuck are you?

703
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,610
I said, who are you?

704
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,970
I've got an informant,

705
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,980
someone using you to get Ma Seok Gu.

706
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,410
I need to get on that boat.

707
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,650
If you're going to call the cops...

708
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,020
Don't worry. Just stick with the plan.

709
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,150
This works with only the copy,

710
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,490
no hacking app, no password needed.

711
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,320
This is how you do it, idiots!

712
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,860
Wi Chang Ok?

713
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,330
You were under Park Gye Soon?

714
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:24,590
What do you want from me?

715
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,500
Get me in with your guys
and send me to China.

716
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,770
You run the investigation,

717
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,600
but...

718
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,400
do it my way, got it?

719
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,340
Are you threatening me?

720
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,870
That’s not how you treat a VIP.

721
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,810
It must’ve been rough
coming all the way here.

722
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,950
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
