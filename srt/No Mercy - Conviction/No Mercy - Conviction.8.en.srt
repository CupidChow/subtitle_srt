Damn it. You're useless to the very end.

Park Jeong Hun!

10
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,151
Jeong Hun.

11
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:29,018
Hey.

12
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:33,756
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:35,558
So Min.

14
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:38,728
I used you.

15
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:41,064
Stop talking. You're bleeding.

16
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:45,568
Don't forgive me.

17
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:49,305
Damn it, why did you do that?

18
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:55,678
Now, everyone, we need your cooperation.

19
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:57,180
Please call an ambulance.

20
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:03,753
Lee, call an ambulance now!

21
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:04,721
Hurry!

22
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:07,824
Jeong Hun.

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,128
Park Jeong Hun!

(No Mercy)

25
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:27,910
Mr. Chairman,
is everything really settled?

26
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:30,480
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:32,248
I'm talking about what happened today.

28
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,417
What happened?

29
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:38,755
A man is dead!

30
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:42,191
It was one of my guys' doing.

31
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,394
You were with me golfing,

32
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:46,362
so you don't know anything.

33
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:48,164
You already gave your statement
as a witness.

34
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:49,332
Still,

35
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,567
what really worries me is...

36
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:55,838
that the victim was
a private equity investor.

37
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:59,575
If my political career ends...

38
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:02,011
because of you...

39
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,553
The secretary, high on drugs,

40
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:14,657
accidentally killed the investor.

41
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:18,061
Ma Seok Gu supplied the drugs!

42
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:21,998
We were out all day,
we didn't see a thing.

43
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:23,633
How many times do I have to repeat it!

44
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,901
Just how many times!

45
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,002
How many times!

46
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,841
Still!

47
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,682
there was an undercover cop involved.

48
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:44,787
If that's what worries you, relax,

49
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:48,625
He's in a coma.

50
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,728
We just need to make sure
he doesn't wake up.

51
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:57,634
Well then.

52
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,280
This is a real mess!

53
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,287
Tell Ahn I'm on my way.

54
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,622
I want everything prepped,

55
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:21,424
from strategy meeting to legal counsel.

56
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:27,363
Call Commissioner Park right now.

57
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:28,665
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:38,841
Hey.

59
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:42,545
Find out which hospital
Park Jeong Hun is at, now.

60
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:45,014
And Seok Gu.

61
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,950
Get rid of him right now.

62
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:48,217
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,123
I need to find out where he is
and deal with him.

64
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,293
(Chairman Kim Doo Sik)

65
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,062
Have you eaten, Chairman?

66
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:06,636
Wait.

67
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,807
What are you still doing here?

68
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,814
I think you might need this.

69
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:25,888
Did you hear?

70
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:27,590
Hear what?

71
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:34,330
What, that all this...

72
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:37,734
happened because I sold the drugs?

73
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:41,671
Or that you ordered him to get rid of me?

74
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:44,007
- That's not...
- Let me make you an offer.

75
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:47,577
I'll give this to you, Chairman.

76
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:48,745
In return,

77
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:51,414
you have to give me what I want.

78
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:59,789
This seat.

79
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,729
How do I know...

80
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:10,867
that little device is even what I need?

81
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,468
Why should I believe you?

82
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,237
My goodness.

83
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:18,608
You always need proof for everything,
don't you?

84
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:20,643
Right?

85
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:32,355
Take a look for yourself, Chairman.

86
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,860
Chairman.

87
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,037
We're back, sir.

88
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,339
You're back earlier than I expected.

89
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,541
I retrieved the slush fund
you mentioned, sir.

90
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:56,679
It's me.

91
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,482
Tell them to call off the arrest operation
on Ma Seok Gu.

92
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:07,123
Sir, you know what I mean.

93
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:09,792
I was speaking figuratively.

94
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:13,463
Even with the drugs and hit-and-run death,

95
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:14,731
the media has been silent.

96
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:17,033
You know better than anyone why.

97
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,379
I've got no reason to say yes.

98
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:32,115
Whether I get it or not,

99
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,984
you'll still want my spot.

100
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,887
Let's see what you can do.

101
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:45,261
That's disappointing to hear.

102
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:47,096
Seok Gu.

103
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:49,365
Do you remember what I told you?

104
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:53,736
I brought you this far
because I believed in your confidence.

105
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:55,405
Thanks to that,

106
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:58,341
I've gotten this far.

107
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,311
Right.

108
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:03,980
I put you where you are,

109
00:08:06,582 --> 00:08:08,017
and you're not even worth it.

110
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:12,588
Watching some rookie girl...

111
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,291
play you like a fool made me realize...

112
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,661
that even the position you hold
is more than you deserve.

113
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:26,469
After all the dirty work I've done,

114
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:31,541
after staying loyal,

115
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,278
and yet you throw me away
whenever I'm not needed?

116
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:36,546
Damn it.

117
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,085
You don't give a damn about me?

118
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:44,921
Seok Gu.

119
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,523
You've always been my lapdog,

120
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,959
then and now.

121
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:54,731
Fucking hell!

122
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,343
Goddamn old bastard...

123
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,480
won’t stop pissing me off!

124
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,714
Ahh!

125
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:14,984
Ahh!

126
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,028
It's me.

127
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:28,564
I'm heading to China now.
Have a boat ready.

128
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,602
And there's someone
I want you to bring in.

129
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:35,838
Congressman!

130
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,280
Commissioner, how's your son doing?

131
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:47,850
I've been told he's unconscious.

132
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,257
Your son...

133
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:56,626
ruined everything for us!

134
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:58,561
That bastard!

135
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:02,332
I mean, that kid was working for...

136
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:04,300
Chairman Kim to bring us down.
Did you know that?

137
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:07,670
I didn't know that far.

138
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:10,873
Lucky he's in a coma.

139
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:12,842
The moment he wakes,

140
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:14,444
it's the end of all of us!

141
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,016
We can't even trust Chairman Kim anymore.

142
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm at my wits' end.

143
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:31,060
Please,

144
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:37,600
you need to handle this.

145
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:41,804
What do you mean?

146
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:46,175
You need to make sure...

147
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,145
your son never wakes up.

148
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,080
If you do,

149
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:53,983
we can bury this matter on our end,

150
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:56,152
one way or another.

151
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:59,055
If we get through this one,

152
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:02,225
I'll do whatever it takes
to secure your nomination.

153
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,429
The party will fully support you.

154
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,264
Commissioner!

155
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:26,209
Don't sleep too long.

156
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,948
I'll come back tomorrow.

157
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,686
Don’t mention I was here.

158
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:37,787
Carry on.

159
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,429
Where should I drive you?

160
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:47,664
Let's head to Cheongdam-dong.

161
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:01,177
Listen up, everyone. Detective Yoon.

162
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:01,978
Yes, sir.

163
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:04,347
Call the homicide unit and find out...

164
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:06,115
- who the murder suspect is.
- Yes, sir.

165
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:07,250
- Detective Kim.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,585
You know the private equity fund
investor case?

167
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:12,355
Analyze the victim's financial records
and send them over!

168
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:13,289
Yes, sir.

169
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:15,458
My goodness.

170
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,560
Listen,

171
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:22,165
I don't remember a thing
after taking that drug from Ma.

172
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:23,833
So you're really sticking with that story?

173
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:26,936
You think...

174
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:29,138
Chairman Kim left you anything?

175
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:32,308
Hate to break it to you,

176
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,311
but he didn't leave anything,
not even a penny in your name.

177
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,715
Chairman Kim died yesterday.

178
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,918
Are you going to keep lying?

179
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:53,830
Come in.

180
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:00,136
Commissioner.

181
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,573
Have you seen
the messages for the Commissioner?

182
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,341
No, why?

183
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,677
The team in charge called.

184
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:09,245
This case is sensitive,

185
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:11,214
you should probably look into it yourself.

189
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,195
(and Chairman Kim Doo Sik
of Gyumin Construction.)

190
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:27,730
What the hell is this?

191
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,566
What should we do?

192
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,901
Don't you know what to do?

193
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:36,372
Get the team to keep quiet.

194
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:37,674
Make sure this doesn't get out.

195
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:41,077
And find out who posted this, now!

196
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,578
- Yes, sir.
- Get moving!

197
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,316
Who did this?

198
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:47,650
Who the hell is it?

199
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:54,090
Who else knows?

200
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:03,366
Commissioner.

201
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:07,904
Don't you want to know?

202
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,506
The messages for the Commissioner.

203
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,941
What?

204
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,045
You want me to repeat it louder?

205
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:20,817
Why didn't you come in yourself yesterday?

206
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,488
We're done as father and son.

207
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,926
I suppose turning yourself in
isn't an option.

208
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:30,994
Turning myself in?

209
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,231
That's ridiculous.

210
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:38,201
Why would I turn myself in
when I didn't do anything wrong?

211
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,405
If you're not coming down on your own,

212
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:45,975
I'll have to bring you down myself.

213
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,814
(Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu)

214
00:15:51,814 --> 00:15:53,516
We found it on his clothes from that day.

215
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,785
Get it out of my sight.

216
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:58,688
He must've had a tough time,

217
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:01,457
having a corrupt cop for a father.

218
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:02,592
Enough, stop!

219
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,866
You can't really hate your own family,

220
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,668
no matter how hard you try.

221
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:16,906
Maybe that's why.

222
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:24,380
Park Jeong Hun...

223
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:27,850
might still care for you, Commissioner.

224
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:48,371
Yes.

225
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:52,909
I'll be right over.

226
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:20,136
So far,

227
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:21,904
digital forensics confirmed...

228
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:24,307
the suspect's server.

229
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:27,910
We're checking if there are...

230
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,078
any more phishing victims.

231
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:30,546
What about Ma Seok Gu?

232
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,348
We don't have solid evidence yet.

233
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:35,752
so it's hard to confirm it's him.

234
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:36,786
Also, since yesterday,

235
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,088
that IP hasn't been detected in Korea.

236
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:40,757
So that means...

237
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:43,660
he's left Korea.

238
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,363
- Jong Chan.
- Yes, Chief.

239
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:48,231
What's he saying?

240
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:51,601
He's been quiet
ever since he heard about...

241
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,336
Chairman Kim's death.

242
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:54,837
No surprise he's silent.

243
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,272
The dead say nothing.

244
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:58,741
Well then.

245
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:01,544
My goodness.

246
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,584
Chairman Kim is dead?

247
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,220
So Min.

248
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,993
You saw Detective Park
at the hospital, right?

249
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,662
How's he holding up?

250
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:21,464
Still unconscious.

251
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:23,299
Do you think he'll be okay?

252
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,801
Let's hope so.

253
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:26,703
This is exhausting.

254
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:28,605
He needs to wake up...

255
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:30,673
so we can handle those scumbags.

256
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,644
We only have circumstantial evidence.

257
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,946
Is there no other evidence?

258
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,816
Detective Park must've gathered evidence.

259
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,352
We looked everywhere.
Nothing turned up.

260
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:44,787
It's either too small to see...

261
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,056
or someone took it.

262
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:50,760
Anyway, let me know when he wakes up.

263
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:51,995
Sure.

264
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:21,624
What if the Ilseong clan is tailing you?
You're reckless.

265
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,660
I'm heading to China.
Make the preparations.

266
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,495
What? You're going again?

267
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,864
Jeong Hun had evidence.

268
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:29,799
Ma Seok Gu must have taken it.

269
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,969
He even killed Chairman Kim.

270
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:34,537
Who knows what he’ll do next.

271
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:38,274
What do you need me to prepare?

272
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:40,510
Park Kye Sun.

273
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:42,478
Make it again.

274
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,920
You're here, Chairman.

275
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:55,024
What's the status on the guy
I told you to bring in?

276
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:57,093
Yes, perfect timing.

277
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:58,494
He's almost here too.

278
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:00,596
Mr. Chairman.

279
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:02,432
I'll serve you as best I can.

280
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,601
Just tell me anything you need.

281
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:06,636
Anything I need?

282
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:08,237
Yes, sir.

283
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:09,539
Where are you from?

284
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,640
China or Korea?

285
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,275
Heilongjiang, China.

286
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:14,744
Heilongjiang?

287
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:15,945
Yes.

288
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:16,813
You're adorable.

289
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:20,183
Thank you, sir.

290
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:35,798
Yeah, this is where I belong.

291
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,069
(CEO MA SEOK GU)

292
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:45,875
(I will go to China. Death is near.)

293
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,776
Kye Sun?

294
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:50,446
Park Kye Sun?

295
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,950
(Kye_sun)

296
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:03,526
It's me, Park Kye Sun.

297
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:04,694
Hey.

298
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:07,130
Hey, you!

299
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,466
Park Kye Sun, you clearly...

300
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:11,868
Are you disappointed that I'm still alive?

301
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:13,836
I heard...

302
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:17,073
Chairman Kim's dead.

303
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:21,511
We can’t leave that position empty.

304
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:27,283
It's already mine.

305
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,886
If anything happens to me,

306
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:33,056
Ma Seok Gu will be responsible.

307
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:38,428
(Will)

308
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:42,799
I even have his will.

309
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:46,636
He's a pain till the very end.

310
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:48,771
Yeah.

311
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:52,442
I’m thinking of going to the cops myself.
What do you say?

312
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,078
Aren't you curious what will happen?

313
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:58,014
Damn it, I killed you before!

314
00:21:58,014 --> 00:21:59,115
You're dead!

315
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,288
Stay put, you bastard.

316
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:08,391
Get on your knees.

317
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:16,833
Seok Gu.

318
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,569
Speak or I'll end you.

319
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:22,171
Did you really kill Park Kye Sun
back then?

320
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:24,474
Here's the thing. What happened was...

321
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:25,642
I'm sorry, Seok Gu.

322
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:27,277
I screwed up, forgive me!

323
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:28,645
I messed up!

324
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:29,746
- Please forgive me!
- You little shit.

325
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,248
Fuck!

326
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:37,787
Fuck, you set me up?

327
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:40,990
Get up.

328
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:42,592
Get up, you son of a bitch.

329
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:44,227
Get up!

330
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,130
You told Park Kye Sun...

331
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,899
to send Kim Mi Yang's daughter to me,
right?

332
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:50,800
No.

333
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,735
I really didn't know...

334
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,405
who she was, I swear.

335
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,041
You disgusting bastard.

336
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:01,577
Out of nowhere!

337
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:03,446
Park Kye Sun started...

338
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:08,885
showed her face on messenger
and threatened me.

339
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:10,820
Messenger? She showed her face?

340
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:12,822
You didn't meet in person?

341
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:15,358
No, I never saw her...

342
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:17,794
never in person.

343
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:21,798
Well, well.

344
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:26,803
I really owe you a lot...

345
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:29,172
for all your help, right?

346
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,677
So... can I go now?

347
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:36,479
Nope.

348
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,249
You still owe me something.

349
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,586
What? What do you mean?

350
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:45,288
Take it easy, okay?

351
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:47,123
Seok Gu, what exactly do I owe you?

352
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:48,791
What is it? What?

353
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,526
Seok Gu! What do I owe you?

354
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:53,296
You damn bastards, aren't you letting go?

355
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:54,931
Let go.

356
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:56,265
Let go!

357
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,967
Your finger's going to get cut off.

358
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,502
Seok Gu!

359
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:00,436
Seok Gu!

360
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:03,072
Seok Gu! Hey!

361
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:07,510
- Heilong.
- Yes, sir.

362
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,412
I need you to go to Korea...

363
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:10,947
and eliminate someone.

364
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,016
If you succeed,

365
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,218
I'll put you in charge.

366
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:16,019
Can you handle that?

367
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:17,520
Thank you, sir.

368
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:26,696
(Kye_sun)

369
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:29,899
What do you want?

370
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:33,636
I hate one-sided deals.

371
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:35,972
Let's make it fair.

372
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:37,240
Go ahead.

373
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:40,176
I'm listening, you cunning bastard.

374
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:42,011
It's simple.

375
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,048
I'll turn a blind eye
to the chairman's death.

376
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:48,151
Just give me that seat.

377
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:52,088
You want the chairman's spot?

378
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:55,124
I’ve lost a lot of time because of you.

379
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:58,995
That much should be okay, don't you think?

380
00:24:58,995 --> 00:24:59,862
You think so?

381
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:03,666
Then show me what you'll give.

382
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,369
Stick to what you're good at,

383
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:08,538
rather than a construction company.

384
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,908
(Lux VIP CEO Ma Seok Gu)

385
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:14,978
I know a lot of people everywhere.

386
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:17,614
I can hook you up with them.

387
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,518
Deal.

388
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,021
So you just need this camera?

389
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:26,889
Let's sign the contract first.

390
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,393
We already agreed verbally.

391
00:25:30,393 --> 00:25:31,427
Isn't that enough?

392
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,530
Let’s handle this face-to-face.

393
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:36,165
If I leave now,

394
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,735
I can get to Wari Port at around 9 p.m.
How's that?

395
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:42,739
Sure.

396
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,074
Just one thing. Come alone.

397
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:47,477
Don't bring any company.

398
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:49,045
Don't worry, I won't.

399
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:53,182
In secret deals,
only the parties should meet, right?

400
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,053
I just don't trust anyone.

401
00:25:58,187 --> 00:25:59,922
See you later then.

402
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,405
Taxi.

403
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,911
(Park O Hun)

404
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:43,766
(Park O Hun)

405
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:23,873
Who are you?

406
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:22,732
Well, well.

407
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,435
If it isn't Wei Chang Yu.

408
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:28,104
Wait, no.

409
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:31,007
Kim Mi Yang's daughter is here.

410
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:33,042
I just gave a little push,

411
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:34,844
and you came running all the way.

412
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:42,085
You must be confused.

413
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,487
This isn't what you expected, right?

414
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:49,759
Cunning bastard.

415
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:53,997
That's what Park Kye Sun used to call me.

416
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:54,764
Not the other way around.

417
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:57,333
Welcome.

418
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,269
I was getting bored.

419
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:02,105
Let's have a sincere talk, So Min.

420
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:06,542
You want me to go first?

421
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:08,511
Where do I start?

422
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:11,848
How did your mom look before she died?

423
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:13,316
Or maybe...

424
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,252
how much your dad's loan limit was?

425
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:18,488
Shut the fuck up!

426
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:22,525
That's not it?

427
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:26,596
Then should I tell you my plan?

428
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,931
From now on,

429
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:31,701
everyone around you will suffer,
one by one.

430
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:33,036
Why?

431
00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:36,706
I'll make it happen.

432
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:40,443
You jerk!

433
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:42,612
You son of a bitch.

434
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:50,620
Hey, take it easy.

435
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,921
That's enough, stop it.

436
00:29:58,261 --> 00:29:59,462
Let's see.

437
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:01,397
Who should we start with?

438
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,433
I did this one, and this one too.

439
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:04,567
Okay.

440
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:05,435
Hey.

441
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:09,305
All right.

442
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:15,044
Auntie, it's me, So Min.

443
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:16,746
Why are you crying, sweetie?

444
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:18,581
Did something happen again?

445
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:22,752
Auntie, I've been kidnapped!
Please help me!

446
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:24,253
What? Kidnapped?

447
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:26,556
Where are you?

448
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:28,725
I don't know where I am.

449
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,862
Is this a voice-phishing call?

450
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:38,334
My goodness, she's so doubtful.

451
00:30:40,603 --> 00:30:41,938
See for yourself, ma'am.

452
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:47,844
Oh no, Min! Where are you?

453
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:51,648
Please don't kill Min!

454
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,483
Please help!

455
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:56,219
What can you possibly do
in this situation?

456
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,555
Min!

457
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:01,658
- Hey, get her out of the way.
- What do I do?

458
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,532
What can you actually do?

459
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,114
Hwa Young, it's me, So Min.

460
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,083
Can you talk right now?

461
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:31,087
I'm trying to get revenge on the guy
who killed my mom.

462
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:32,488
But I'm short on cash.

463
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,758
If I miss this shot,
I won't get another chance.

464
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,193
Eun Bi.

465
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:39,228
Please think it over.

466
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:41,464
You know I don't usually ask for favors.

467
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:45,068
Remember when we acted together?

468
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,773
I'm pretty smart.

469
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:53,176
I'm great at improvising.

470
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:03,119
I made this money in just one day.

471
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:08,424
Then and now,

472
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:11,361
you couldn't protect your people.

473
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:13,096
Pathetic bitch.

474
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:21,638
I took care of him.

475
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:23,039
Good work.

476
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:28,144
Wow.

477
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:34,017
Ta-da.

478
00:32:35,084 --> 00:32:36,686
Guess whose this is?

479
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:44,160
Such a delicate finger, Detective Park.

480
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,994
Right?

481
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:52,101
I always get what I want,
that's how I roll.

482
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:55,438
You son of a bitch.

483
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:56,906
Let go!

484
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:03,980
- Well done.
- Thanks.

485
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,682
You really wanted to be in charge?

486
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,584
This is the final test.

487
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:11,087
Her.

488
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:12,922
Kill her in front of my eyes.

489
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:26,836
Don't.

490
00:33:41,884 --> 00:33:43,219
Are you nuts?

491
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:45,188
What the hell are you doing?

492
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:50,827
Can't you tell?

493
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:57,033
This is the moment
you have to beg for your life.

494
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:06,609
Looks like you forgot. That's sad.

495
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,111
Cunning bastard.

496
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,979
Park Kye Sun.

497
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:12,982
You really were alive?

498
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:20,590
Detective, you need to check this out.

499
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,662
While you were hospitalized,
we did some digging.

500
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:28,865

(Probability of identical person- 99.999%)

502
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,075
Yes

503
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:40,877
Is this Ms. In Ye Hyang?

504
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,646
I'm Park Jeong Hun
from the voice-phishing unit.

505
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:46,950
If you have a moment,

506
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:49,052
can we talk?

507
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:03,333
Kye Sun?

508
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,070
It's been a while.

509
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,408
Do you know...

510
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:16,446
how long I had to hide in Korea
because of you, cunning bastard?

511
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,949
I worried you might come after my son too.

512
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:21,050
So I went into hiding...

513
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,453
again and again.

514
00:35:24,787 --> 00:35:25,655
Because of...

515
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,459
that sneaky Kim,

516
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:32,962
we end up meeting like this.

517
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:33,796
What?

518
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,399
Did you really think...

519
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:39,469
that spot would be yours if I disappeared?

520
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,138
But guess what?

521
00:35:45,141 --> 00:35:47,644
It's your turn to vanish.

522
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:21,044
Freeze!

523
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:21,911
Police!

524
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:26,349
Freeze!

525
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,421
Police! Freeze!

526
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:39,629
You bastard.

527
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:43,399
Hand over Jeong Hun's evidence.

528
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:46,469
Wow.

529
00:36:47,036 --> 00:36:50,139
So you really want me to end you, huh?

530
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:53,376
What evidence? This thing?

531
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:57,480
Oh boy.

532
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:04,287
Too late. It's gone.

533
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,159
Come here.

534
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:13,229
I'll kill you just like I did your mom.

535
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:14,163
Huh?

536
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:19,836
Hey.

537
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:24,841
Does that hurt?

538
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:27,477
Shit!

539
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:39,522
Hey, come here.

540
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:45,194
You little shit.

541
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:49,499
I clawed my way to the top,

542
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:51,367
and you cling to me like a leech.

543
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,070
Do you know what your mom did?

544
00:37:54,537 --> 00:37:56,973
Please, don't kill me.

545
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,675
Try it yourself!

546
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:29,539
Does it hurt?

547
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:32,475
If this hurts you,
imagine how much my dad suffered!

548
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:35,979
And my mom!

549
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:41,417
What about my mom!

550
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,620
So Min!

551
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,183
There’s been a huge public debate...

552
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:50,353
over the case where Ha,
a voice phishing victim,

553
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:53,423
took revenge herself on the ringleader.

554
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:57,293
What are your thoughts on this incident?

555
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:58,828
The victim took matters into
her own hands...

556
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:02,098
because law enforcement...

557
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:03,499
couldn't solve it.

558
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:06,536
Victim protection laws must be updated...

559
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:09,272
to prevent this from happening again.

560
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:10,607
Still,

561
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:13,910
when the law is ignored,
society falls into chaos.

562
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,913
Because individuals
can't take the law's place.

563
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:19,916
There should be a discussion,

564
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:23,052
but ignoring judicial procedures...

565
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,455
is unacceptable.

566
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:28,558
Viewer reactions on social media are...

567
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:31,027
very heated in real time.

568
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:35,264
Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu
turned himself in for collusion.

569
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:38,268
He was escorted to the prosecution,

570
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:40,169
leaving only an apology.

571
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:41,137
My fellow citizens,

572
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,673
I sincerely apologize for...

573
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,175
the trouble I've caused.

574
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:47,844
Earlier,

575
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:51,547
Congressman Seo Jung Geun
was also taken into custody...

576
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,616
and is now under investigation
by the prosecutors.

577
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:56,786
The hero who cut off their tails...

578
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:59,489
was surprisingly Park,
the son of the former commissioner,

579
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:00,890
and a detective
at the Seongan Police Agency.

580
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:15,939
Are you all right?

581
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,808
I'm fine, and you?

582
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,984
I'm not sure.

583
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,554
I don't know how to live from here.

584
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,259
You don't need to rush.

585
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:38,962
Just keep going your way,

586
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,296
at your own pace.

587
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:44,834
If the path ends, make a new one.

588
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:47,303
If a path doesn't feel right,

589
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:48,271
don't take it.

590
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,274
Going your own way...

591
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,110
doesn't mean it's wrong.

592
00:41:56,245 --> 00:41:59,115
I didn't know you could say
something like that.

593
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:03,353
What I'm saying is,

594
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:05,989
just follow your heart...

595
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:07,724
like you've always done.

596
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:10,960
I'll always be supporting you.

597
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:17,100
Thanks.

598
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,665
(Five years later)

599
00:42:57,473 --> 00:42:59,609
(Door securely locked)

600
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,546
Number 181.

601
00:43:03,546 --> 00:43:05,281
Your sentence ends today.

602
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:07,951
You've held up well.

603
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:10,019
Your parents will appreciate it.

604
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:13,423
Go out now and live your life.

605
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:16,492
That's what your parents
would want for you.

606
00:44:01,704 --> 00:44:03,306
(Kim Do Jin)

607
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:06,709
Yes, Do Jin?

608
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,745
Did you see my present?

609
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,347
Present?

610
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:14,684
I put it in your pocket
when we met earlier.

611
00:44:14,684 --> 00:44:15,685
Look for it.

612
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:19,522
I stayed up all night preparing
after hearing you were getting out.

613
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,294
A flash drive? What's this?

614
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:26,296
You want to know?

615
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:30,033
If you want to know, pay a dime.

616
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:31,000
I'll hang up.

617
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,510
Min, can you hear me?

618
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:43,012
Mom.

619
00:44:43,613 --> 00:44:44,614
Have you eaten?

620
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:48,584
Sweetheart, have you had a hard time
because of me?

621
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:53,022
I only ever wanted you to be happy,
sweetheart.

622
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:56,826
Somehow, I think I ended up
hurting you more.

623
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,130
But you know what?

624
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:06,169
I thought I'd given you so much love.

625
00:45:06,803 --> 00:45:07,870
But actually,

626
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:11,808
the one who got the love was me.

627
00:45:15,078 --> 00:45:15,979
You,

628
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:20,583
simply existing, bring me joy...

629
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:22,518
and love.

630
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,390
Then why didn't you come into my dreams?

631
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:30,226
I got so much from you.

632
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,162
I'm really sorry.

633
00:45:34,263 --> 00:45:36,866
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you enough.

634
00:45:38,134 --> 00:45:40,937
I'm sorry for being against you
pursuing acting.

635
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,642
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it to...

636
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:48,311
a single one of your shows.

637
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:51,914
So here's my question.

638
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,183
If you were born again.

639
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:57,053
would you still want to be my daughter?

640
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:02,825
I promise I'd do so much better then.

641
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:05,295
You would, right?

642
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:13,269
Sweetheart, you've become a lead actress.

643
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:15,204
I'm not worried about you at all.

644
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:19,175
Go out there and shine, okay?

645
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,447
Hold your head high
and take care of yourself.

646
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:28,484
Sweetheart,

647
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:31,654
I love you so much.

648
00:46:32,822 --> 00:46:35,525
I love you, Min.

649
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,328
Love you, Min.

650
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,065
I love you.

651
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:49,439
I love you too, Mom.

652
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:40,790
(No Mercy)
