00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,244
(Lee Joo Young)

(Ji Seung Hyun)

3
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:36,032
(Koo Jun Hoe)

4
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:47,910
(Mom)

5
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,150
(No Mercy)

6
00:00:56,152 --> 00:00:57,153
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

7
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,154
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:58,154 --> 00:00:59,489
When are you coming?

9
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:05,295
So Min, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:07,830
Based on your dad's phone records,

11
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,132
we've confirmed that your mom's missing...

12
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,267
is linked with the Ilseong clan.

13
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,803
I don't believe in
the law's idea of justice.

14
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:18,141
The only way to the boss is...

15
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:21,878
through Mr. Kim.

16
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:23,980
You're saying we pretend to be her
to infiltrate the Ilseong clan?

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,148
Can that even work?

18
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:27,450
They played us,

19
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,852
so we play them back,

20
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,654
since we're already set on
getting revenge.

21
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:32,855
Wei Chang Yu?

22
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:34,524
You were under Park Gye Soon?

23
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:38,361
What do you want from me?

24
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:40,163
Get me in with your guys...

25
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:41,831
and send me to China.

26
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:42,899
Newbies.

27
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,467
This is professional work.

28
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,936
Each of you uses your expertise...

29
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:49,005
to win clients' trust.

30
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,907
She's already earned $36,000.

31
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,110
He's calling for you.

32
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,613
That's not how you treat a VIP.

33
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,314
Nice to meet you, I'm Ma Seok Gu.

34
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,849
What's your game?

35
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,151
Tell me what you want from me.

36
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,454
I want to hold a position here.

37
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:06,189
Prove yourself with performance.

38
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,491
So Min made it to China after all.

39
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,393
Let's see what we can do.

40
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:14,931
I'll pay the debt.

41
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,466
I'll give you the money.

42
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:17,667
Try it if you can.

43
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:19,535
It's $500,000.

44
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:20,870
This is the price of my mom's life.

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,006
Wei Chang Yu just made...

46
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,874
a whopping $500,000 from just one client.

47
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,876
To celebrate our new leader Wei Chang Yu,

48
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,745
let's party hard today!

49
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,714
Here, drink up.

50
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,684
Hello,

51
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:36,719
I'm Manager Kim Mi Yang.

52
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,656
Who is that?

53
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:40,957
You know,

54
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:43,359
some horribly unlucky lady.

55
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:45,561
I'll kill you.

56
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:49,032
The day she joined the call center,

57
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:51,501
the Korean handler was caught,

58
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,870
and Mr. Kim disappeared too.

59
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,138
Dig deeper on Wei Chang Yu.

60
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,974
Use solid sources.

61
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:03,212
(No Mercy)

62
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,502
I just learned
something really interesting.

63
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:28,738
Guess what?

64
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:41,551
This Wei Chang Yu,

65
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:44,020
is this the same person as
this Wei Chang Yu here?

66
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:49,025
This came out of our mascot's wallet.

67
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,560
Do you two know each other?

68
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,797
(Kim Mi Yang)

69
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,068
No, I don't.

70
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:00,737
You don't know each other?

71
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:04,474
Is an actor...

72
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,211
supposed to know every random person...

73
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,146
who comes to see a show?

74
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:22,292
Out of everything I do,
gardening is the most tedious.

75
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,027
Why?

76
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,928
Because once I trim these things back,

77
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,999
they just keep growing out of control.

78
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:35,972
Trimming them down one by one
is a pain in the neck.

79
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,776
But at the same time,

80
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:41,978
there's also a thrill to it,
so I can't stop.

81
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:51,354
Hey, you idiot!

82
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:53,356
I told you to think before you speak.

83
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:54,424
Yes, sir.

84
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,025
If you've got doubts, get proof first,
not later,

85
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,994
Make that a habit, you idiot.

86
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,830
Don't waste my time with ticket stubs...

87
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,900
during important conversations, you idiot!

88
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:07,236
My apologies, sir.

89
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:09,205
It was my mistake.

90
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:17,880
Now, where were we?

91
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,220
Do you know Mason Dedrick?

92
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:25,755
(Episode 5)

93
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:27,323
Mason is the guy...

94
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:30,526
who made a name for himself
as a pit boss in Macau.

95
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,762
- Now...
- He's with Black Kara.

96
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:35,932
Not L.TM?

97
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,301
I'll tell you straight.

98
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:42,372
L.TM's already finished.

99
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,641
What the hell are you talking about?
How is it finished?

100
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:45,675
You didn't know?

101
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:48,878
Everybody's heard that secret
that's been floating around.

102
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,615
Black Kara snatched Mason up
for a huge sum...

103
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,050
months ago now.

104
00:05:56,753 --> 00:06:00,089
There's no way I'd miss something
like that if there were signs.

105
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,593
Of course.

106
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:06,629
The Yankees stole the guy...

107
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,398
who was running the place,

108
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:12,268
no one's stupid enough to show it.

109
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:15,638
The way I see it,

110
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:20,176
this could actually be a good opportunity.

111
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:22,946
An opportunity?

112
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:25,448
As you know well,

113
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:27,984
the next big junket market is...

114
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,160
going to be Singapore.

115
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:41,931
How could you do that?

116
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:45,468
I invested in Singapore
because of this one business.

117
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:47,737
I knew the Macau market would go south,

118
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,872
so I'd already been building a base
in Singapore.

119
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:54,377
Do you know which Korean company
actually owns...

120
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:56,512
a casino in Singapore?

121
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:59,616
Genie Tourism Development.

122
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:00,917
They operate Genie the Star Resort.

123
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:05,989
They've been desperate to recruit Mason.

124
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:06,889
So...

125
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:10,159
You're saying we should recruit Mason
for Genie, right?

126
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:12,862
Don't be ridiculous.

127
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:17,000
How could we possibly reel in
a giant like him?

128
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,168
I may not know Mason personally,

129
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:22,839
but I know his right-hand man well.

130
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,242
That guy is the one...

131
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,680
who's got Mason wrapped around
his little finger.

132
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:46,562
His name is Eric Choi.

133
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:49,799
Eric Choi.

134
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:02,879
(CIISC1225)

135
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:05,548
Hey, Wei Chang Yu.

136
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:08,084
How's it going?

137
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:10,586
I almost didn't recognize you.

138
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:12,789
I thought you'd dropped off the map.

139
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,123
How've you been?

140
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:15,358
Your boss treating you well?

141
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:16,492
Of course.

142
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:19,262
Thanks to me, he's been in
back-to-back meetings.

143
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,496
Is that right?

144
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:22,532
I heard you've been busy...

145
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:24,634
managing restaurants for Black Kara.

146
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:29,205
Yeah, I'm busting my ass
trying to raise his value.

147
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:31,941
Black Kara doesn't measure up,
not even close.

148
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,344
Some places are offering extra money
just to get him on board.

149
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:36,679
Sounds like big money.
Who's making the offer?

150
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,716
Chang Yu, I can't tell you that.

151
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:40,817
It's business.

152
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:44,320
Anyway, what are you up to?

153
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:46,089
I'm in China right now.

154
00:08:46,522 --> 00:08:49,092
Have you ever heard of
the Yanbian businessman, Mr. Ma?

155
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,760
Wait.

156
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:52,762
Isn't that the guy
who got kicked out of L.TM?

157
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,466
I heard he's just sucking up to
Chairman Kim...

158
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,935
and making a living
with his fucking voice phishing schemes.

159
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,437
And people call him a businessman?

160
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,575
I'm Mr. MA.

161
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,044
Please, go on.

162
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,179
My goodness.

163
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:12,248
Please forgive me...

164
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,717
for saying something offensive.
I ask for your understanding.

165
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,388
Honestly, you work for Chairman Kim,

166
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:21,724
and I work for Mason. We're both
just employees doing what we're told.

167
00:09:21,724 --> 00:09:23,960
We're in this together.

168
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,864
Your apology sounds insincere.

169
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,132
Of course not.

170
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:32,068
I'm about to get thrown out myself,
just like you.

171
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:34,938
About Mason,

172
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:38,508
you know Marine Bay Casino in Singapore?

173
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:41,811
They're replacing the entire management.

174
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:46,382
Wait, they're replacing
Marine Bay's entire management team?

175
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:50,153
That son of a bitch Mason...

176
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:52,855
wants to kick me out
and put his wife in my director position.

177
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:55,558
This is why you can't trust anyone
in this business.

178
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:56,459
Damn it.

179
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,928
I can see why you'd be upset.

180
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:01,230
Think about it, Mr. Ma.

181
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,700
After all those years of loyalty,

182
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,102
we're always the first ones...

183
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:07,203
thrown away.

184
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:09,939
If we're disposable tails to be cut off,
we might as well bite back.

185
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,074
Don't you agree?

186
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:13,443
You'd betray your boss?

187
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,745
No, I wouldn't call it betrayal.

188
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,214
It's more like a business transaction.

189
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:22,018
So if someone wants Mason,

190
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,153
you'd hand him over?

191
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:27,223
A deal isn't complicated.

192
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:29,425
It's just give-and-take.

193
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:32,095
If both sides' needs match,
that's all it takes.

194
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,432
I feel like we'll get along pretty well.

195
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:40,069
I'd like to meet and talk in person.

196
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:43,339
As for me,

197
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,976
I really like people I vibe with.

198
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,012
There's no reason to say no.

199
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:50,947
All right.

200
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:53,182
I'll share the location in Korea...

201
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:55,318
Since I'm doing business in China,

202
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,253
it's tough for me to leave.

203
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,355
As you know,

204
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:02,725
I make a living
with my fucking voice phishing schemes.

205
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,328
I'll give you a proper welcome
if you come.

206
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:18,441
You'll need to cover the ticket.

207
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:23,546
That's just the basic manners as a host.

208
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,684
We'll set up the time and date for you.

209
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:39,128
I knew he wouldn't fall for it easily.

210
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:42,999
We need to lure Ma Seok Gu
to Korea quickly...

211
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,767
so we can do anything.

212
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:47,937
Do you have to go?

213
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:50,239
I have to.

214
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,911
Yes, Chairman, I took the call for Mr. Ma.

215
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,080
What took you so long to answer the phone?
Where's Seok Gu?

216
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,981
Get him on the phone now.

217
00:11:58,615 --> 00:11:59,549
I'm sorry, sir.

218
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,584
Mr. Ma's in a meeting now.

219
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:04,487
Why haven't I heard anything
about the business ledger?

220
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:06,623
I'm sure he's still reviewing it.

221
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,391
I'm scheduled to sign the contract...

222
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:11,160
with L.TM Agency tomorrow at 3 p.m.

223
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,463
How come it hasn't been sent yet?

224
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:14,564
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:16,232
We'll send it right away, sir.

226
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,234
What meeting...

227
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,104
is he in right now?

228
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:25,408
He's in a script development meeting.

229
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,414
A script development meeting...

230
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:35,084
You really expect me to believe that?

231
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:38,821
I'm losing my mind over here,
and he's just chilling in a meeting?

232
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,023
That is bullshit.

233
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,827
Well...

234
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:46,729
Is Seok Gu...

235
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,033
going behind my back...

236
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,434
because of this incident?

237
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:53,136
Absolutely not, sir.

238
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:56,005
It's just for a new business venture.

239
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,774
Is that so?

240
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:01,044
He's starting a new project...

241
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,680
without my approval, huh?

242
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,682
That's not it.

243
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,016
Tell him...

244
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:09,319
to also hand over
the slush fund account too.

245
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:13,489
I can't trust my money with someone
who's got other plans.

246
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:15,825
That's all I have to say.

247
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,827
Make sure he gets the message
loud and clear.

248
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,197
Chairman!

249
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,173
Looks like your staff is giving you
a headache.

250
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,644
This is why people need power.

251
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:35,678
Take me, for example.

252
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm just a businessman,

253
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,149
so my people keep causing me problems.

254
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,287
My son is nothing but trouble,

255
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:46,055
so who am I to judge?

256
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:50,093
One day, he'll come around.

257
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,527
Do you think so?

258
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:54,998
In any case,

259
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:58,268
my son won't give you any more trouble...

260
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,203
over this matter.

261
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,151
Chang Yu, you still look stunning.

262
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,121
You haven't aged a day.

263
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:20,456
Seems like I'm the only one aging.

264
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:24,560
How should I address you?

265
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,096
Where are my manners?

266
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,601
Just call me Eric.

267
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:33,369
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

268
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:34,704
All right.

269
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,740
Wow, a surveillance manager.

270
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:40,643
I didn't realize you were running
the whole operation.

271
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:43,112
You're quite mysterious.

272
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:46,115
Why would I show myself?

273
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,584
That would just draw unwanted attention.

274
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:51,821
I see.

275
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:56,592
I've crossed paths with Mason at L.TM.

276
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,862
I've met most of his people.

277
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:03,733
But since we've never met,
I wanted to learn more about you.

278
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,771
I thought we'd be discussing business,

279
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,273
so I rushed over,

280
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,775
but it seems you just wanted to
check me out.

281
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:15,945
As potential partners,

282
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:18,247
we need to get to know each other.

283
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,317
Mason's not your average guy.

284
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:24,020
He's a major player
in the casino business.

285
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,990
And an Asian pulling the strings
on a guy like that,

286
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,059
that's pretty impressive.

287
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,161
I'm more than just a pretty face.

288
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:34,497
I'm full of surprises.

289
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,702
And you showed up like this,

290
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:41,704
like you'd been waiting for this.

291
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,341
This is quite a start.

292
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,512
It's great to see you two...

293
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:50,680
hitting it off already.

294
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:51,748
You think so?

295
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:57,687
To make good partners, we need chemistry.

296
00:15:58,354 --> 00:15:59,689
Let's make it work then.

297
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:00,790
Shall we?

298
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,726
If not, we'll figure it out.

299
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:07,030
Fair enough.

300
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:32,188
It's not much, but this is my business.

301
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,959
It actually looks pretty impressive to me.

302
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:38,428
Let's go inside.

303
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:49,238
(Chairman)

304
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:50,239
What the hell?

305
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:52,542
Is he some kind of loan shark or what?

306
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,611
He's causing a scene in broad daylight.

307
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:55,945
Here, you hold onto this.

308
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,881
Any update on what I asked?

309
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,516
Word from Samhaphoe is that...

310
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:02,685
Eric Choi's pulling Mason's strings.

311
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,623
pparently he was in a Filipino gang in LA.

312
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,524
Are we sure he's the same guy?

313
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:12,195
They weren't completely sure
from the screenshots,

314
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,130
but they think it's him.

315
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:21,404
Hey, stop.

316
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,108
My apologies for that.

317
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,077
My guys tend to be cautious.

318
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:30,146
It's fine.

319
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:31,614
It's like at airports,

320
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:33,549
you have to go through security.

321
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,551
Let's head in.

322
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:45,862
Have a seat.

323
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,808
I was planning to ask you
for a tour later,

324
00:17:58,808 --> 00:17:59,776
but with these monitors,

325
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:03,346
you can see everything from here,
so we can skip the tour.

326
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:07,717
I like to have everything
under control...

327
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:08,918
for peace of mind.

328
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,890
I'll go get us some drinks.

329
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:15,992
I'll give you two some privacy.

330
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,193
Okay.

331
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:25,668
Where are you going?

332
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,541
When you have a guest, you should...

333
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,609
get drinks for them, right?

334
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:33,810
Well then.

335
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:36,479
I'll have my guys bring them.

336
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:38,214
You can stay inside.

337
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:39,449
No worries.

338
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,484
I need to use the restroom anyway.

339
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,826
(CCTV CONTROL BOX)

340
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,298
What's going on?

341
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:58,735
Yoo Seung, the cameras are out.

342
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:00,837
Tell the guys to fix them now.

343
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:08,478
How do you know Mason?

344
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,046
Actually,

345
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:13,516
I had some Filipino friends in LA.

346
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:16,252
To be honest, my life was
a complete mess back then.

347
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:19,555
Then one day, this guy approached me...

348
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:22,325
and asked me if I wanted to work together.

349
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:24,827
That guy was Mason.

350
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:31,367
Sounds like Mason knows
how to pick his people.

351
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:36,005
I'm more of a thinker,

352
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,907
so I'm not much of a sports guy.

353
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:39,275
I can't throw a curveball.

354
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,911
Let me ask you something directly.

355
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,212
Sure.

356
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:46,049
Can you put me in touch with Mason?

357
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:50,086
You haven't heard my answer yet.

358
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:51,421
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

359
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:00,396
You really blindsided me there.

360
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:03,700
Okay, let me put it differently.

361
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,369
You've heard of
Genie Tourism Development, right?

362
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,673
They just built the largest resort
in Singapore.

363
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:14,377
They want to scout Mason.

364
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:17,547
Are you saying...

365
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:21,284
you want to hand Mason over to Genie?

366
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:25,955
All the money from that deal is yours.

367
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:29,292
I only want the business contract.

368
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,562
What do you say we partner up?

369
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:36,666
That's not difficult to arrange.

370
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,968
If we're going to be in the same boat,

371
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:42,305
investing in my venture...

372
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,741
might be a better option.

373
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,076
An investment?

374
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,921

376
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:07,864
Hold on.

377
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,633
This is an online casino game, isn't it?

378
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,636
You want me to invest in this?

379
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:19,142
I guarantee you'll make money.

380
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,778
Unfortunately, it seems we want
different things,  so let's end this here,

381
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:22,812
while I'm still being polite.

382
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:37,327
Take a look and think it over.

383
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,228
You won't regret it.

384
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:49,405
Do you recognize this person?

(Congressman Seo Jung Geun proposes
a self-regulation bill for P2E games)

386
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,813
Can't you speed it up?

387
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,421
You wanted to see me?

388
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,924
They're fixing the security cameras.

389
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:44,327
Make sure everyone stays
extra alert in the meantime.

390
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:45,295
Yes, sir.

391
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,735
Congressman Seo Jung Geun?

392
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,303
He's the one who signed off on...

393
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:29,973
Genie Tourism Development's
resort project.

394
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:33,343
He's also helped my business.

395
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:35,678
So what you're saying is...

396
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,080
Like you said,

397
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,083
if you can't throw a curveball,
throw it straight.

398
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:40,950
Think about it.

399
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,952
Even if we deliver Mason to Genie,

400
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:45,822
there's no guarantee
we'll get the contract.

401
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:46,723
But,

402
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:48,958
what if we go straight to the person
who controls it?

403
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,564
Are you saying you'll introduce me
to Seo Jung Geun?

404
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:57,867
As long as you agree to my proposal,

405
00:23:58,901 --> 00:23:59,936
I can make that happen.

(DEB GAME Investment)

407
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:07,377
Documents like this are easy to fake.

408
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:11,814
How can you prove you really know...

409
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,182
Seo Jung Geun?

410
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:14,150
You want proof?

411
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:18,354
That's easy to prove.

412
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:21,057
The truth speaks for itself.

413
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:24,327
Give me a second.

414
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:31,467
Yes, sir. It's Eric.

415
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,037
Eric, where are you?

416
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,039
I see you're calling internationally.

417
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:40,310
I'm in China meeting a potential partner.

418
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:42,445
I see.

419
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:44,180
Anyway, about the public hearing.

420
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:45,982
The schedule's set.

421
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:48,051
It worked out the way you wanted.

422
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,319
Is that true?

423
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:52,622
People in this country are naive.

424
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:56,859
They don't care
about complex issues like P2E.

425
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,966
When you throw around fancy words...

426
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,734
like freedom,

427
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:06,703
they think that's democracy.

00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:09,839
- Those kinds of abstract ideas...
- Whoa, they fixed it really fast.

429

can mean whatever you want them to mean.

430
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,112
They don't realize
they're being manipulated by politicians.

431
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:18,247
They're too busy fighting with each other.

432
00:25:24,954 --> 00:25:25,888
Oh my gosh.

433
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:30,693
It's done.

434
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,662
You, watch things here.

435
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:35,965
You, go through the cameras in each room.

436
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:36,866
Yes, sir.

437
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:40,270
Anyway,

438
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,640
you won't make it to the meeting
with Chairman Ahn then.

439
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,607
Chairman Ahn?

440
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:47,610
Enjoy it for me.

441
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,446
Genie went global thanks to you.

442
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:53,483
You deserve all the credit.

443
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,488
Don't flatter me like that,
you're embarrassing me.

444
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:00,456
We've been talking too long.

445
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:03,559
I'm afraid I've kept you too long.

446
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,928
I'll visit when I get back to Korea.

447
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:08,898
The chairman is demanding
the secret account.

448
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,101
Damn, he's serious?

449
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:14,871
Hold on.

450
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,573
Hello, Congressman.

451
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,643
I'm Ma Seok Gu,
I'm setting up a business in Singapore.

452
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:24,580
Hi.

453
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:27,317
Pleased to meet you.

454
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:30,086
Is this really Congressman Seo Jung Geun?

455
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:32,422
Well...

456
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,191
I'm not sure what you mean.

457
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:37,493
My apologies.

458
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:38,861
It's just...

459
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:42,598
I'm thinking about investing
in Eric's business,

460
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:43,733
based on your connection.

461
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:46,970
You're investing in someone
you've never met just because of me?

462
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:50,239
Isn't that rather hasty?

463
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,521
I'll trust you,

464
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:08,391
I'll invest $5 million.

465
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:10,593
But I need a favor.

466
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:12,528
I need the junket operating license.

467
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:15,398
Could you put me in touch with
Genie Tourism?

468
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:17,800
For now,

469
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:19,135
sure.

470
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:23,139
I'm having lunch with Chairman Ahn
tomorrow, I'll update you later.

471
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:26,209
He'll be very interested.

472
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,513
He's been looking to expand
his casino operations.

473
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:32,582
Is that so?

474
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:36,019
Thank you, Congressman.
I won't forget this.

475
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,123
If money's coming in, why would he refuse?

476
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:46,195
Looking forward to working together.

477
00:27:59,776 --> 00:28:01,344
I need to send...

478
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:03,513
your email address to him.

479
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:05,648
Can I use the email
from your business card?

480
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,116
Of course.

481
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,184
Great.

482
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:11,087
Can you transfer the funds?

483
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:12,355
What form of payment?

484
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:16,025
It's in cryptocurrency.

485
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,360
That works, right?

486
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,928
Absolutely.

487
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:20,196
That's even better.

488
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:25,969
What are you doing here?

489
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:28,705
Well...

490
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:30,106
I asked what you're doing.

491
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:32,976
I need to check something.

492
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:34,143
Let me see it.

493
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,144
Hand it over.

494
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:37,547
Give it to me.

495
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:42,986
I didn't think we'd get along at first.

496
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:46,289
But now I think we're perfect partners.

497
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:47,790
I guess so.

498
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:51,294
Maybe we knew each other in a past life.

499
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:54,764
By the way,

500
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:59,135
where do Chairman Ahn and Congressman Seo
usually meet for lunch?

501
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:01,070
Usually...

502
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,072
Sir!

503
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:06,943
Let go, I said let go.

504
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,111
Seriously.

505
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:10,280
Sir!

506
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,115
Sorry about the disturbance.

507
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,449
Seems like something urgent came up.

508
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:16,586
What's his problem?

509
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:18,955
Let go.

510
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:22,492
What's this about?

511
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:24,994
She's acting suspicious.

512
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:27,297
I caught her doing something.

513
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,333
I told her to give it to me,
but she won't.

514
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:36,773
Let go!

515
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:51,487
Let go already!

516
00:29:54,524 --> 00:29:57,360
I didn't do anything wrong!

517
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:58,861
What is it?

518
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:17,847
Wait, first...

519
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:20,650
let's check it first.

520
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:23,019
Check what?

521
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,221
Where's the congressman?

522
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:30,193
He's probably busy
with the election campaign.

523
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:35,465
Then he'll definitely make lunch tomorrow.

524
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,169
He'll review my contract too.

525
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:41,537
Sure.

526
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:43,740
That's what he said on the phone.

527
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:48,411
But why would such a busy man...

528
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,179
at the prosecutor's office?

529
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:55,685
What do you mean?

530
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:05,528
Apparently, this was big news today.

531
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:09,666
How could someone caught up in this...

532
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,734
had the time to chat with me?

533
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:15,204
Are you accusing me of faking it?

534
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:16,906
With someone that important?

535
00:31:17,073 --> 00:31:17,941
Well...

536
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:20,576
Technology's advanced enough these days,

537
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:23,279
anything's possible.

538
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:32,422
You knew all about it, didn't you?

539
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:36,526
This is Kim Doo Sik's doing, isn't it?

540
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:39,095
He's trying to take my stuff again!

541
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:40,196
No.

542
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:41,130
Damn it.

543
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,100
That's enough.

544
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,301
That's enough?

545
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,469
That's enough?

546
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,905
Then prove it.

547
00:31:49,606 --> 00:31:51,975
Bring Congressman Seo here.

548
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,509
Then I'll believe it.

549
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:00,249
What? You can't?

550
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,790
The person you are calling is unavailable.

551
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,493
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.

552
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:12,962
Get him here. Now.

553
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:16,766
When you hear the beep,
press the star or pound key.

554
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:18,034
You have five hours.

555
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,805
Congressman Seo, we have a situation.
I need you here.

556
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:25,575
I'll explain everything when we meet.

557
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:28,611
You can spare some time.

558
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:30,413
It's urgent.

559
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:33,049
Meet me at Seungam-sa Temple
at 8 p.m. today.

560
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:39,822
You have five hours, Eric.

561
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:43,059
That's your window
to get home in one piece.

562
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,033
- Hey, get in here.
- Yes, sir.

563
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:51,334
Get them on the boat.

564
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:53,202
- We're heading to Korea.
- Yes, sir.

565
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:12,255
Damn it!

566
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,718
You're running out of time.

567
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,988
I gave you an extra hour and five minutes.

568
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:47,190
Why are you testing my patience?

569
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,625
Huh?

570
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:55,298
Eric!

571
00:33:56,899 --> 00:33:58,368
What's all this about?

572
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:01,638
Hello, sir.

573
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:05,541
Eric, what in the world is this?

574
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:07,310
Well...

575
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:17,587
We need to get Ma Seok Gu to Korea
at all costs.

576
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:21,224
If it were that easy,
he'd be in jail already.

577
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,494
You didn't know that, did you?

578
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:28,231
Back when I was at the police academy,

579
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,400
I was a reporter.

580
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:33,736
That's my ace in the hole.

581
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,742
You want me to play a corrupt politician?

582
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:41,044
That day,

583
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:44,180
I'll make you look like
a corrupt investor.

584
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:45,682
You mean...

585
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:48,651
the tax office will actually
raid my house?

586
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:51,955
My wife will have a heart attack.

587
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:54,657
Have I ever let you down, sir?

588
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,926
Not once.

589
00:34:57,493 --> 00:35:00,363
You've only ever helped me.

590
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:07,070
Every time I remember losing $1 million...

591
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,173
to those bastards,

592
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,208
it makes my blood boil.

593
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:16,145
I'll take those bastards down for good.

594
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:18,948
You're with me, right?

595
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:24,354
I'll do whatever you need.

596
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:26,222
Don't screw this up.

597
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:27,357
Yes, sir.

598
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:31,494
This stays between us.

599
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:32,428
As you know,

600
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:38,101
to pull off something big,
what you have to guard most is your mouth.

601
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:47,810
Are you Mr. Ma?

602
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:49,646
Yes, sir.

603
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:53,216
Tell me what's going on, Mr. Ma.

604
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:54,550
Well...

605
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,620
Sir, actually...

606
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,421
Excuse me.

607
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,659
There's been a misunderstanding.

608
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:03,960
A misunderstanding?

609
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:05,561
What do you mean?

610
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:10,233
Well...

611
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:13,069
I'm really sorry.

612
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:16,439
Greed got the better of me.
Eric and I plotted...

613
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,508
to steal your investment returns,

614
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,511
and send them to Mr. Ma instead.

615
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,414
And then?

616
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:25,882
And then Mr. Ma...

617
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:28,818
refused to betray you.

618
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:32,522
He was furious and made us
come apologize in person.

619
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:48,438
Gosh, you fool.

620
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:51,874
You'd throw away our trust
for pocket change?

621
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:53,643
I'm really sorry.

622
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:56,079
Also, sir,

623
00:36:56,412 --> 00:36:59,649
Mr. Ma has people inside
the prosecutor's office.

624
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,052
I've got a man in the prosecution.

625
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:06,122
I'll make sure today's case...

626
00:37:06,122 --> 00:37:07,223
gets dismissed.

627
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:13,129
We've only talked on the phone,
but you're already proving reliable.

628
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,564
Thank you, sir.

629
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:16,399
Thanks.

630
00:37:16,966 --> 00:37:17,967
I appreciate it.

631
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:21,671
I suppose I should return the favor.

632
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,674
Does that mean...

633
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,342
I'll reach out to Chairman Ahn...

634
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,013
and put in a good word for you.

635
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:40,857
Thank you, sir.

636
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:55,505
Genie Tourism Development probably emailed
you the contract details.

637
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,508
You can take a look.

638
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,511
When the deal closes,

639
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:04,380
don't forget our investment agreement.

640
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:14,123
(Request: cooperation on resort
development investment and bonus payouts)

641
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:16,759
(Meeting venue)

642
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:19,162
(Rococo Hall, second floor,
Genie Sky Hotel, Tiong Bahru, Singapore)

643
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:23,633
(Connection failed)

644
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:25,868
What the hell?

645
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:31,574
Damn it.

646
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:49,926
(Ma Seok Gu)

647
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:51,427
Yes, boss.

648
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:54,097
Hey, take them back to Seungam-sa Temple.

649
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,733
What? You just said...

650
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:59,335
to take them to Wari Port.

651
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:02,305
You little shit, talk back again
and you'll be the one getting dumped.

652
00:39:02,772 --> 00:39:04,240
Do it now!

653
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:05,942
Yes, sir.

654
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:19,722
Congressman Seo, I received your email.

655
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:24,193
Mr. Ma, are you on your way?
Where are you?

656
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:25,461
Yes, I'm on my way.

657
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:27,930
I just passed Seongan Bridge.

658
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:30,400
I see.

659
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,268
Everything’s okay, right?

660
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:35,038
Sorry? What do you mean?

661
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,409
Everything's still fine?

662
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:41,210
I don't know what you mean.

663
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,165
Thank you, Do Jin.

664
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:05,268
I was terrified cursing him out like that.

665
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:07,403
But I did okay, right? Not bad acting.

666
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:09,172
I don't look too bad.

667
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:10,673
Maybe I should be an actor.

668
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:20,843
You're awake, Mr. Ma.

669
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:21,811
Mr. Ma?

670
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:23,613
Are you badly hurt?

671
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:28,785
Fuck, Wei Chang Yu, you fucking bitch!

672
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:32,055
I'll call the police and an ambulance.

673
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,091
No.

674
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:36,726
Don't.

675
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:38,828
Don't you dare, you psycho!

676
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:40,897
Right.

677
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:44,233
Word is you're on the wanted list.

678
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:45,335
- Is that right?
- Damn it.

679
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,136
If I report you, you're screwed.

680
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:49,238
Maybe I should call the chairman instead?

681
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:51,407
Fuck!

682
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:53,977
Will you shut the fuck up?

683
00:41:54,544 --> 00:41:55,812
Just joking.

684
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:57,847
By the way,

685
00:41:57,847 --> 00:42:01,084
I wonder if Chairman Kim knows
he's down $5 million.

686
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:02,719
- Shit.
- Relax.

687
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:06,289
We've got that $5 million safe and sound.

688
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:10,093
(Meeting venue)

689
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:10,860
(Connection failed)

690
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:12,762
(Seongan Bridge)

691
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,368
(Cryzeon coin transaction)
(Withdrawal - maximum)

692
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:20,203
(Withdrawal completed
- five million dollars)

693
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,338
Got it.

694
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,540
Sorry about that.

695
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:27,510
This is all I know from being a thug.

696
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:29,512
You little shit.

697
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,583
You and that son of a bitch,

698
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,019
you're both dead.

699
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:39,589
You're still worrying about others
when you're half-dead?

700
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:40,990
Don't worry.

701
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:44,193
See you in hell, you son of a bitch.

702
00:42:44,193 --> 00:42:45,028
Hey.

703
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:46,796
Hey!

704
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:49,932
You bastard!

705
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:53,036
Fuck!

706
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,676
(No Mercy)

707
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:35,812
Watch your back from here on out.

708
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:37,814
hey'll come after you.

709
00:43:37,814 --> 00:43:39,983
You know that guy from earlier, right?

710
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,318
So I couldn't really see his face.

711
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,153
But he had this weird tattoo on his neck.

712
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:45,989
A man went missing...

713
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:47,523
near Seongan Bridge last night.

714
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:48,358
Missing?

715
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:50,793
I think it's Ma Seok Gu.

716
00:43:50,793 --> 00:43:54,163
By the time you find him,
my money will already be gone.

717
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:57,033
Bring me the real thief.

718
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,402
Are you sure it's Ma Seok Gu?

719
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:01,337
Your life could be in danger.

720
00:44:01,337 --> 00:44:02,505
Then why?

721
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,841
He's been lurking around.

722
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:06,709
Jeong Hun.

723
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:09,078
Where in Korea...

724
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:10,546
could Ma Seok Gu be hiding?
