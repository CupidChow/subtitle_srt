1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,244
(Lee Joo Young)

2
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:25,955
(Ji Seung Hyun)

3
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:36,032
(Koo Jun Hoe)

4
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:47,910
(Mom)

5
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,150
(No Mercy)

6
00:00:56,152 --> 00:00:57,153
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

7
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,154
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:02,825
The Samhaphoe guys
wouldn't have just sat back.

9
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:04,193
So how'd you handle it?

10
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,664
We made a deal for steady supply,

11
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:09,899
high-purity product.

12
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,134
Less risky,

13
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,137
and we cut the middlemen.

14
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:16,839
Can you get bulk quantities?

15
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,008
Twenty kilos have already come through.

16
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,244
Fifty more coming next month.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,316
We're finally looking at decent money.

18
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,517
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:28,785
Here.

20
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,153
Good work.

21
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:43,967
Thank you.

22
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,468
Thank you, sir.

23
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,847
Any progress on Singapore?

24
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,983
Thanks to your backing,

25
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:01,951
looks like we'll close the deal soon.

26
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:06,623
Seok Gu.

27
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,257
You ever think about...

28
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,461
how many people had to work...

29
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,397
just to get this one spoonful of rice
on my table?

30
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:16,699
From growing the rice,

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,601
to selling it, distributing it,

32
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,670
and cooking it.

33
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:24,407
It goes through countless hands
before reaching my table.

34
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:26,876
But in the end,

35
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:31,714
no matter how hard they worked,

36
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:33,983
none of that matters...

37
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,518
if I don't pick up this spoon.

38
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,887
Look.

39
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:40,023
Until I pick up my spoon,

40
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:41,724
you can't eat either.

41
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,698
That's power.

42
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,603
Haven't you figured it out?

43
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:56,406
Your parents spent their whole lives
serving my family.

44
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:59,742
You can look up at the sky all you want,

45
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:03,012
but it won't change your position.

46
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:08,017
After all, we were born and raised
in completely different worlds.

47
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:11,754
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,968
That old bastard still thinks...

49
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:28,137
I'm some stray dog living off his charity.

50
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:36,045
Let's see who ends up...

51
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,816
on their knees,

52
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:41,851
groveling at my feet.

53
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:43,319
Okay?

54
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,896
(No Mercy)

55
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:06,042
It must've been rough
coming all the way here.

56
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,646
I'm Ma Seok Gu. Good to meet you.

57
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,617
That mom you're looking for?

58
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,787
She's right there with you. Look around.

59
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:33,136
Son of a bitch.

60
00:04:41,377 --> 00:04:42,478
Ms. Wei Chang Yu?

61
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:53,523
(Episode 4)

62
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,658
Thank you.

63
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:02,332
Have we met before?

64
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:04,367
You look familiar.

65
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:07,070
I know that face.

66
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,106
Tell me the truth.
We've met before, right?

67
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:14,677
Wouldn't it be weird...

68
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,314
if I said we hadn't?

69
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:20,450
It makes no sense to say...

70
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,518
we've never crossed paths...

71
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:24,554
in such a small world.

72
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,691
Especially since we share the same roots.

73
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:31,594
Right.

74
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,063
If you worked for Park Gye Soon,

75
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,366
we must've crossed paths sometime.

76
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,469
Let's talk more inside.

77
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,086
Hello, I'm Kim Mi Yang,

78
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:59,222
always here by your side
for your job search.

79
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,192
I completely understand.

80
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:04,594
I'd like to send you a product...

81
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:06,663
with the same care as a mother would.

82
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,164
Is now a good time?

83
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,067
News says...

84
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,569
they're using voice technology
to catch us.

85
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,405
So I got smart.

86
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:18,308
One voice, perfect disguise.

87
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,110
So I borrowed your mom.

88
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:23,947
Hi, I'm Kim Mi Yang,
your trusty hiring manager.

89
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:25,815
- How can I help you today?
- I'm Manager Kim Mi Yang.

90
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:27,250
I understand.

91
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,418
I've got a great product...

92
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:29,919
I'd like to recommend.

93
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:32,789
You're in on this too, right?

94
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,659
That crazy Kim Mi Yang
turned my son into a criminal.

95
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:38,594
Mom!

96
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:42,298
What do I do?

97
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,543
Your verification is complete.

98
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:03,786
First off,

99
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:07,357
I did some digging into you,
Ms. Wei Chang Yu.

100
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,828
But anyone can forge documents like this,

101
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:13,062
so I can't fully trust it.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,469
This piece of paper won't convince me.

103
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:21,471
Let me cut to the chase.

104
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:25,675
Why did Park Gye Soon's person
come crawling in here?

105
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,379
She just wanted to share what she had.

106
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:35,485
Let's say you're stranded
on an island with a friend.

107
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,489
You're starving for days,

108
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:42,692
then suddenly a pig shows up.

109
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,996
What would you do?

110
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:49,899
How would you handle it?

111
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:52,735
You'd have to kill your friend then.

112
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,738
So you can have the pig all to yourself.

113
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:00,710
Park Gye Soon didn't get that.

114
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,812
She's too busy sharing.

115
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:08,217
At the end of the day,
you took it all from her, didn't you?

116
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:12,088
Even her life.

117
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:14,691
That's why you betrayed the group
that raised you...

118
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:15,792
and came here?

119
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,927
After more than a decade? Just like that?

120
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:24,400
That means you could
stab me in the back anytime.

121
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:26,736
To me,

122
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:30,006
you're not my friend. You're the pig.

123
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:33,543
Why is that?

124
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:34,844
If you kill your friend,

125
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,948
people just point fingers, then it's over.

126
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:40,483
But...

127
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:44,287
no one in their right mind
would cut open a pig...

128
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:46,889
after raising its worth so high.

129
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:50,727
This thing about greed...

130
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,796
once you feed it, it just keep growing.

131
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:57,500
Since I've got the skills,

132
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:01,838
so I should fatten up the pig properly.

133
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:05,341
The bigger it gets,

134
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,377
the more satisfying it'll be.

135
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,278
So basically,

136
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,315
you'll fatten me up...

137
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:15,251
and sell me at my highest value.

138
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:27,230
Holding back hunger...

139
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,931
for the product's future value.

140
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,935
I love the sound of that.

141
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,004
But...

142
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:41,010
Why are you doing this?

143
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,513
You did your homework on what I like,

144
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:45,982
but I told you. I don't trust easily.

145
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:50,053
I don't trust papers,

146
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,722
and I sure won't fall for smooth speeches.

147
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,591
Tell me straight.

148
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:57,794
Who sent you?

149
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,463
How can I make you believe me?

150
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:05,034
Prove you're not a double agent yourself.

151
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,237
That's where I'll begin trusting you.

152
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:28,024
Ever heard of the Heungsami clan?

153
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:31,561
This guy is their spy.

154
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:33,963
Hey.

155
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:43,706
This is the Ilseong clan.

156
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,976
And this one is the Heungsami clan.

157
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,212
They're the top dogs
in northeastern China.

158
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:50,880
That's them.

159
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,336
I'm curious to see.

160
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:15,138
In the end, let's see who goes down,

161
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:16,706
me or her.

162
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,175
The choice is yours.

163
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:20,910
I'll be waiting.

164
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,715
I'm working my ass off because of someone,

165
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,251
and you still have time to think.

166
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:30,386
I'm sorry, chief.

167
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,022
Once we wrap up the investigation on
Lee Seung Tae,

168
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:34,457
we'll hand him over to the prosecutors.

169
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,025
Case closed.

170
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:37,460
Wait, chief.

171
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,762
Did Lee Seung Tae talk about...

172
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:41,798
where the Ilseong clan's base is?

173
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,232
That punk doesn't know anything.

174
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,703
The only thing he knew in Korea was
where the captain lived.

175
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,871
But that guy vanished too.

176
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,808
Looks like they threw some small fish
under the bus...

177
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,010
to protect the big guy.

178
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,713
What's the point of nabbing the small fry?

179
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:58,715
Will they even get punished properly?

180
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,252
They do their time, get out,

181
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,122
and they're square with the law.

182
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,490
That's not justice.

183
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:09,959
That's just killing time
until they're back on the streets.

184
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,935
What's going on?

185
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:25,174
It makes sense.

186
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,278
I almost turned into a papa's boy.

187
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:30,280
Thank you, sir.

188
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:32,882
I'm leaving.

189
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:34,517
Hey.

190
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:36,452
Where the hell do you think you're going?

191
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:01,010
(Evidence storage room)

192
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,230
Here's where they kept it.

193
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,243
(The crackdown on
voice phishing operations)

194
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:15,985
Sorry for being rude earlier,
especially since we know each other.

195
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:19,455
You must be hungry after the long trip.

196
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:21,124
Have some meat.

197
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:27,764
Feed that to Happy.

198
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:36,706
Hey, you're lucky as hell today, right?

199
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,976
Eat up while it's fresh.

200
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,616
To bring you in,

201
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:49,052
I needed to know you're on my side.

202
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,854
You're obviously talented,

203
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,657
so I was getting impatient.

204
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:02,432
Honey,

205
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:05,602
my phone died, so I borrowed
a temporary one from the store.

206
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:07,470
It's text-only.

207
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:10,506
You should've been more careful.

208
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,509
I've got a work call coming up.

209
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,011
So I need to get a new phone fast.

210
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:18,348
Yeah, that's just how it is.

211
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,551
Problem is,

212
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,053
I need my ID to activate it,

213
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,522
and I forgot my wallet.

214
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,627
Take photos of both sides of my ID...

215
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,195
and text them over.

216
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:34,631
Man,

217
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,933
Can't believe pieces of shit like this
are still out there.

218
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:38,101
Don't you agree, everyone?

219
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:41,938
It's hard to believe scum like this
still exists.

220
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,511
So you really did send those pictures?

221
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:49,479
Yes.

222
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:52,815
Later, the bank called my husband,

223
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:56,119
asking if he really moved all $60,000

224
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:58,421
from our account.

225
00:15:58,855 --> 00:15:59,722
Everyone.

226
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:03,059
the scammers used...

227
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:04,360
the victim's ID photos...

228
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,296
to set up mobile banking.

229
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:09,198
The problem is,

230
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:12,402
then they can pull out big money easily.

231
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,974
It reveals the weak spots
in the financial companies'

232
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:19,742
digital services.

233
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:22,979
Thanks to you,

234
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:25,548
numbers have been through the roof.

235
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,284
But now that it's blown up,

236
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,720
everyone's going to copy us.

237
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:32,722
In that case,

238
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:35,425
it's time for a fresh approach.

239
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:37,060
Right?

240
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:39,495
We've got...

241
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,532
a new motto.

242
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,102
Bleed each target dry.

243
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:48,471
Volume and small scores are...

244
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,607
for the amateurs at the call center.

245
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,042
We recruited you,

246
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:56,012
so show us what you got.

247
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,051
I'll do my best.

248
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:03,753
Good.

249
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:08,725
Let's fatten up the pig real good.

250
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:10,126
Okay?

251
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,133
It's all...

252
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,702
about the intel, not the skills.

253
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:24,307
Everyone uses this database.

254
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:29,445
So we need a different angle, right?

255
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,918
This is the database we'll be using.

256
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:38,688
Likes,

257
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:40,089
favorite foods,

258
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,624
hobbies,

259
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:42,892
special skills,

260
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:44,594
voice tone,

261
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,095
and speaking style.

262
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:47,964
Kim has disappeared.

263
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:50,800
Really? Since when?

264
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:53,336
Since before the illegal gambling house
got exposed,

265
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,672
so it's been over a week.

266
00:17:57,106 --> 00:18:00,076
That son of a bitch is hiding money
from me?

267
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:02,011
Isn't it a bit strange?

268
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:03,012
Strange how?

269
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:06,683
Why did she come through Mr. Kim,
of all people?

270
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:09,585
It could happen.

271
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:11,454
The day she joined the call center,

272
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:14,324
the Korean handler was caught,

273
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,026
and Mr. Kim disappeared too.

274
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,495
He's now on the wanted list.

275
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,431
Something's off, right?

276
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,401
Dig deeper on Wei Chang Yu.

277
00:18:26,502 --> 00:18:28,605
Use solid sources.

278
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:29,572
Check everything.

279
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,007
Yes, sir.

280
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,844
With just the internet,

281
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:37,647
we can easily figure this out.

282
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,984
So, using deep voice...

283
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:42,018
Deep voice is...

284
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:45,121
a method we've always used,
and you know it.

285
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,357
That's not it.
What I'm trying to say is...

286
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,891
Our team lead told me...

287
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,661
you're great at finding
people's weak spots.

288
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,364
Let me ask one thing.

289
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,367
What's my weakness then?

290
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,436
If you worked for Park Gye Soon,

291
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:02,905
you must've learned something.

292
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,144
Are there any old phones...

293
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:10,179
or tablets?

294
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,515
(Build number)

295
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,560
Phone, please.

296
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:42,312
If devices logged into the same account...

297
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,647
are in China and Korea,

298
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,582
a call from China...

299
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:48,451
shows up as a Korean number.

300
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,090
Cops caught on.

301
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,358
This trick's dead.

302
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:58,962
It's dead?

303
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:01,731
Thailand's been doing this for a while.

304
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,134
If we can't get ahead of others,

305
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:08,571
we at least can't fall behind, right?

306
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:14,477
Let's take a short break.

307
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,158
Make an obituary...

308
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:30,994
and put it up here.

309
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:36,366
Isn't this a fancy apartment complex?

310
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,367
How do we handle it?

311
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,144
You clearly know what you're doing.

312
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:49,746
The lighter...

313
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:52,448
or the work?

314
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:56,686
What's your game?

315
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:00,490
Tell me what you want from me.

316
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:04,193
I want to hold a position here.

317
00:21:09,732 --> 00:21:11,534
Yeah, that look.

318
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:13,836
It wasn't ordinary from day one.

319
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,373
I really like it.

320
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,209
For a deal like that,

321
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:22,812
prove yourself with performance.

322
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:24,981
Instead of begging outright like this,

323
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:27,517
make me look for your help.

324
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:30,553
That's much classier.

325
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,325
Proving with performance is...

326
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:38,494
only natural.

327
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,743
(Obituary)

328
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:56,079
(Message sent)

329
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:00,116
What?

330
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:01,050
Nice timing.

331
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:07,056
(Two unread messages)

332
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,759
So Min made it to China after all.

333
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:11,260
Awesome.

334
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:12,495
Yeah.

335
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:14,597
Let's see what we can do.

336
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:16,232
(Connection failed)

337
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:18,735
We infected the phone
and turned it into a zombie phone.

338
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,805
The phone I'm handling...

339
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:25,008
has no real personal data.

340
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,210
It seems like a secondary phone.

341
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:29,112
All I see are...

342
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:32,248
idol photos.

343
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:34,350
Remember what I said?

344
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:38,154
This is the time for a pro...

345
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:40,089
to find a way in.

346
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:47,730
Want me to do a demo?

347
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:51,567
What we do is
customer satisfaction service.

348
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:53,836
Understand the clients' needs...

349
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:55,805
and meet them completely.

350
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,140
The key is...

351
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:59,542
natural connection.

352
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,478
The easiest way is to let them sleep.

353
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:06,749
Make it feel like a dream, not real life.

354
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:13,523
Then they're bound to pay...

355
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:16,759
for the service on their own.

356
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:23,766
(Lee Gi Myung)

357
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:25,401
Hold on.

358
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:26,235
Okay.

359
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,041
Hello?

360
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:33,910
Hi, Mr. Lee Gi Myung.

361
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,913
This is Cho Hwa Young
from Howl Coffee's event team speaking.

362
00:23:36,913 --> 00:23:39,015
You applied for Rosanna's fan meeting,

363
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:41,317
but unfortunately, you didn't get chosen.

364
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:44,354
Yeah, I know.

365
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,689
Since the competition was so fierce
this time,

366
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,524
we've planned a surprise event...

367
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:51,561
where fans who didn't win can have...

368
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,696
a brief one-minute call with Rosanna.

369
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:54,497
Really?

370
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:57,433
You've won the one-minute call event...

371
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:59,936
with Rosanna.

372
00:24:02,505 --> 00:24:03,439
Yay!

373
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,348
We'll begin your one-minute call.

374
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:13,616
Hope you make some great memories.

375
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:17,620
Hi, Gi Myung.

376
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,455
I'm so happy to talk to you.

377
00:24:20,523 --> 00:24:21,557
It's Rosanna.

378
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:22,492
Hi.

379
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:24,827
How long have you been my fan?

380
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:27,563
Today marks 2,571 days.

381
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:28,598
Really?

382
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:29,966
What?

383
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:32,035
You've been a fan since my debut.

384
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:35,004
That's amazing, I'm touched.

385
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:38,308
I was front row at your concert
with your first album.

386
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,578
You pointed at the guy...

387
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:44,380
with the bunny ears.

388
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,915
That was me.

389
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,619
My goodness, I remember that.

390
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:51,788
Please release your fifth album soon.

391
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:54,023
I've been waiting so long.

392
00:24:54,023 --> 00:24:54,991
Right.

393
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:57,093
About the fifth album...

394
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,633
Unfortunately, your one-minute call
ends here.

395
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:05,969
Wait, hello?

396
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:07,737
Rosanna wasn't done talking yet.

397
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:10,773
Please continue supporting Howl Coffee.

398
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,609
Thank you for participating.

399
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:13,710
Have a great day.

400
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,411
Hello? Hello...

401
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:21,317
Wow.

402
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:24,020
You're good at acting.

403
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,056
Wipe that grin off your face...

404
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:28,925
unless you want to die here.

405
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:31,594
Death threats now?

406
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,029
And you're supposed to be a cop?

407
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:40,336
Hello?

408
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:42,272
Hello? Is this Mr. Lee Gi Myung?

409
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,407
I'm Rosanna's manager.

410
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:47,210
Please don't share what I'm about to say.

411
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,245
Or if it ends up in court,

412
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:50,513
it'll be bad for both of us.

413
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:52,215
Rosanna said...

414
00:25:52,215 --> 00:25:54,717
she wants to be in touch with you
personally.

415
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:55,518
What?

416
00:25:56,886 --> 00:26:00,156
She wants to keep in touch with me?

417
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,125
Why?

418
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,327
I want to speak with Rosanna.

419
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:06,663
Actually,

420
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,600
she's not in the mood to take a call
at the moment.

421
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,567
One moment, please.

422
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,402
Rosanna.

423
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:14,504
Do you want to talk to Gi Myung?

424
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:16,139
No.

425
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:20,243
What's going on?

426
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:22,378
The thing is,

427
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:25,682
she just found out
they canceled her fifth album.

428
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:27,650
I told you not to say anything.

429
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:31,788
What do you mean?

430
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:34,824
The production went over budget,

431
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,559
now we're in trouble.

432
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:39,929
We had everything lined up,

433
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:41,931
and now this.

434
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:45,268
I've waited so long for this comeback.

435
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:47,470
How can I face my fans now?

436
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:51,474
Is there anything...

437
00:26:51,474 --> 00:26:54,510
I can do to help?

438
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:55,912
No,

439
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:00,149
It doesn't feel right
accepting help from fans.

440
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,719
Let me talk to Rosanna again.

441
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,153
I'll try talking to her.

442
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:09,859
Gi Myung.

443
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,096
What do you mean?

444
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:14,697
Well,

445
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:17,834
I have a small startup.

446
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,435
We recently got some investment,

447
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,638
I've got some cash on hand.

448
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:24,807
You've given me so much
through your music. Let me help you.

449
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:26,876
Gi Myung.

450
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:29,746
Thank you so much.

451
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:32,515
How can I ever repay you?

452
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:35,685
I just have one favor to ask.

453
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:37,453
On the last day of the concert,

454
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:40,556
you said something to us. Remember?

455
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:42,625
Just do that once.

456
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,560
That's all I need.

457
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:47,597
What do you mean?

458
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,668
You know, the thing you always say
thinking of us.

459
00:27:51,668 --> 00:27:52,702
Your trademark.

460
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:56,005
I see.

461
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,676
That?

462
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:04,113
You didn't forget it, did you?

463
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:07,283
That's impossible.

464
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:10,553
Are you really Rosanna?

465
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,988
Yes, I am.

466
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:14,223
I'm Rosanna.

467
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:16,025
I really am.

468
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:21,798
Really?

469
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,135
Jeez.

470
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:29,272
Hey, how's it going?

471
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:31,941
I've asked around,

472
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:33,142
but strangely,

473
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:35,478
nobody knows anything about Wei Chang Yu.

474
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:36,479
Is that so?

475
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:38,381
Okay then.

476
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:41,517
Why are you doing this to me?

477
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:44,754
What on earth are you doing?

478
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:47,590
Hey.

479
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:48,825
Let her be.

480
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:53,129
What's your relationship with
this psycho bitch?

481
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:54,831
Who are you?

482
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,733
I'm here to deal with this bitch.

483
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:57,600
Who are you?

484
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:01,371
I'm just a fan.

485
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:04,374
I don't know the full story,
but violence isn't...

486
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:06,242
What's wrong...

487
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,177
with collecting money someone owes?

488
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:10,647
That's...

489
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:12,682
Stay out of this if you don't want to die.

490
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:15,318
I'm calling the police.

491
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,319
What? The Police?

492
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,322
Go ahead, try it.

493
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:35,371
Please, stop.

494
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,809
Who beats a woman that brutally?

495
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:40,610
What?

496
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:44,147
Seems like you want to pay for her.

497
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,416
You don't know what you're getting into.

498
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,052
I'll pay the debt.

499
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:50,620
I'll give you the money.

500
00:29:52,055 --> 00:29:53,189
What did you just say?

501
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:56,793
I'm not sure exactly how much it is,
but I'll take care of the debt.

502
00:29:56,793 --> 00:29:57,627
Really?

503
00:29:58,861 --> 00:29:59,862
Try it if you can.

504
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:01,698
It's $500,000.

505
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,035
$500,000?

506
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:08,538
No, Gi Myung.

507
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:15,878
I'll...

508
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:17,146
give you the money.

509
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:19,882
So please stop harassing Rosanna.

510
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,018
Then fine, I can't argue with that.

511
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:24,354
Leave it in locker 22...

512
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:27,123
Seoul Station, Exit 9
before seven tonight.

513
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,360
If you go to the police...

514
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,829
No, never. I won't call the police.

515
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:13,636
This is the price of my mom's life.

516
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:52,909
Field, just picked up the black money.

517
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:03,987
All done here.

518
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:09,592
(Transaction history)

519
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:10,827
Damn it, it's money.

520
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:13,596
- Money.
- My goodness.

521
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:14,697
Hey, hang on.

522
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:16,899
Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand...

523
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,568
500,000.

524
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:19,736
Is this really $500,000?

525
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:26,843
What's our highest single-day sales?

526
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:28,278
$1 million.

527
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:31,981
What's the most anyone's ever made
in one day?

528
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:33,549
$70,000?

529
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:34,984
- Wasn't it $100,000?
- $100,000?

530
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:37,487
Looks like Chang Yu broke that record.

531
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:40,623
Wei Chang Yu just made...

532
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,992
a whopping $500,000 from just one client.

533
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:48,164
To celebrate our new leader Wei Chang Yu,

534
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,700
let's party hard today!

535
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,773
Let's party.

536
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:15,959
Here, drink up.

537
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:26,269
Nice.

538
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:41,751
Hey, tell me.

539
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:45,288
What did you learn
while working for Park Gye Soon?

540
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,491
Are you that curious...

541
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:50,627
about what I learned from her?

542
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,562
Yes, I'm dying to know.

543
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:57,333
She could do anything.
I'm fucking jealous.

544
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,304
Before she died,

545
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:04,107
did she teach you how to mesmerize people?

546
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:06,709
If so, I want to learn too.

547
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:10,280
It's not just how to mesmerize people.

548
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:19,155
This place is really different from
our previous shop.

549
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:20,623
It's like...

550
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:23,159
that place was in the shadows,

551
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:25,261
while this one's in the light.

552
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,965
Mr. Ma.

553
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:32,001
Don't you want to come outside?

554
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:34,837
You're sharp.

555
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:38,207
Here's the thing. I want to do business...

556
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,509
I can help you...

557
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:44,047
go legitimate
and turn this into a real business.

558
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,424
Man, Wei Chang Yu.

559
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,659
What you just said is nuts.

560
00:34:57,293 --> 00:34:58,394
Help?

561
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,362
You're offering to...

562
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:00,363
help me?

563
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:06,970
I'll teach you how to charm people...

564
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,772
like I learn from Park Gye Soon.

565
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:12,241
But first,

566
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:15,612
promise me one thing.

567
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:18,848
Promise?

568
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:20,516
I'll teach you,

569
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,153
then make sure I earn more than
what I've taught you.

570
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:29,058
This is insane.

571
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:32,295
You're drunk.

572
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,030
Damn it, you think I'm drunk?

573
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:39,736
Yes, I'm drunk.

574
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:43,840
I'm drunk on you.

575
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,209
I'm drunk on Wei Chang Yu.

576
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,913
This stuff is pricey, so drink up.

577
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:52,715
It's all yours, Chang Yu.

578
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,884
I'll walk you inside.

579
00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:55,852
Come on.

580
00:35:56,452 --> 00:35:58,221
I'm the boss, and you refuse?

581
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:00,089
I don't go easy on women.

582
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:15,004
Come on, drink up. Keep drinking.

583
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:19,008
Dude, why are you just standing there?
Dance.

584
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:21,778
You're a dancing machine.

585
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:25,148
Have fun. Let's party.

586
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:44,801
No.

587
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:46,502
You can't rest yet.

588
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,472
Let's see.

589
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:51,307
Hey.

590
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:54,143
Our mascot.

591
00:36:56,913 --> 00:36:58,214
Hello,

592
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,316
I'm Manager Kim Mi Yang.

593
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:13,830
Who is that?

594
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:15,999
You know,

595
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:19,002
some horribly unlucky lady.

596
00:37:20,703 --> 00:37:21,671
How so?

597
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,241
I killed her myself.

598
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,030
Thanks for everything.

599
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,131
I'll make good use of your voice.

600
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,975
There goes another one.

601
00:38:02,912 --> 00:38:03,880
Hey.

602
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:07,016
You know what's easier than...

603
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,385
getting caught by the cops?

604
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:13,122
Killing someone and making a mascot.

605
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:20,063
Ta-da.

606
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:23,199
Let's see.

607
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:25,168
Hey.

608
00:38:26,002 --> 00:38:27,537
Can you see it?

609
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:31,941
Do you want this?

610
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:35,645
It's from that girl
who always got her nails done.

611
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:36,980
What do you say?

612
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:39,983
You seem really drunk.

613
00:38:43,686 --> 00:38:44,520
Hey.

614
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:46,756
I'm giving it to you. You don't like it?

615
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:50,460
Not just anyone gets it.

616
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:00,236
Fine then.

617
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,276
Jeez.

618
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:09,379
Gosh.

619
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:37,640
(Chairman)

620
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:45,615
You've got a call from the chairman.

621
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:49,752
Mr. Ma.

622
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:51,120
What?

623
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,055
You have a call.

624
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,824
Damn it.

625
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:07,937
Yes, Chairman.

626
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,608
One moment, please.

627
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:15,745
Move.

628
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:22,752
The ledger?

629
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,656
Yes, we had a good month.
You're going to love the numbers.

630
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:27,657
Don't worry.

631
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,868
(Photomoment)

632
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:50,546
Let's see.

633
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:54,417
Damn it.

634
00:40:58,154 --> 00:40:59,022
Chairman.

635
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,225
Could you hold on a second?

636
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:03,826
I'll call you right back.

637
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,228
Thank you.

638
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:09,666
Crap.

639
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,811
(Connection failed)

640
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:23,546
(Installing)

641
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:29,485
Damn it.

642
00:41:54,911 --> 00:41:57,213
(Installing)

643
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:11,127
Hey, just leave her be.

644
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:36,986
First up,

645
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:39,255
show me how they have
everything set up overall.

646
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:43,593
(Hacked)

647
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,005
Well, well.

648
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,775
Look at that setup.

649
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:02,912
High-end audio surveillance,

650
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:04,347
that's not cheap.

651
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:10,386
Chairman, so...

652
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:13,222
you want me to just give up the books?

653
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:15,692
Chen Yao Qing from Sunset Group
was arrested two days ago.

654
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:17,760
Macau's toast.

655
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:20,563
Then where will the big mainland money go?

656
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:22,932
That's why I was assigned Singapore.

657
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:24,667
You said you'd make me big...

658
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,936
in Singapore with the junket business.

659
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:28,271
Seok Gu.

660
00:43:29,038 --> 00:43:30,073
Yes, sir.

661
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,909
How's the Singapore contract coming along?

662
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:35,011
You mean, L. TM Agency?

663
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:37,080
It's in the final stages.

664
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,749
Once we lock funding,
we can seal the deal quickly.

665
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:42,018
Trust me, I'm sure of it.

666
00:43:43,252 --> 00:43:44,320
Listen.

667
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:47,323
I got you this far
because of that confidence.

668
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:49,125
But you know what?

669
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:51,194
When I say something like this,

670
00:43:51,194 --> 00:43:53,630
there's meaning and philosophy behind it.

671
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:57,100
I'm not sure what you mean.

672
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,803
The L. TM Agency in Singapore
is going to sign with us.

673
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:03,139
Wait, Chairman.

674
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:04,307
Wait.

675
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,243
What do you mean?

676
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:10,146
Just hand over the ledger and back off.

677
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:11,981
I'll find you another business.

678
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:13,916
How could you do that?

679
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,854
I invested in Singapore
because of this one business.

680
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:19,856
I knew the Macau market would go south,

681
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:22,058
so I'd already been building a base
in Singapore.

682
00:44:22,058 --> 00:44:22,959
Do you...

683
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,295
still don't know me?

684
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:29,032
I wish you had half the instincts
of Park Gye Soon.

685
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:37,040
Fuck, how long has Park Gye Soon
been dead?

686
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:39,609
And he's still obsessing over her.

687
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:42,445
Kim Doo Sik, you fucking asshole!

688
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:45,448
Hey,

689
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:49,352
bring over the lowest performer here.

690
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,854
The one who's been taking my money...

691
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:54,424
and not making anything.

692
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:55,725
Now!

693
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:01,597
Fucking idiots.

694
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:08,304
Hey.

695
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:11,240
It's you?

696
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:13,242
Hey.

697
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:16,346
Damn it.

698
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,748
How much did you make this month?

699
00:45:20,216 --> 00:45:21,484
$5,000.

700
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:24,454
How much did you take from me?

701
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,689
That's...

702
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:27,657
You want me to tell you?

703
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:30,860
Seven grand base,
plus 50 percent commission,

704
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,329
plus I cover your food and housing.

705
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:35,465
That sums up to $10,000,
you son of a bitch.

706
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:36,699
Does that sound fair?

707
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:40,903
Do you think this makes any sense?

708
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:43,406
I'll work harder.

709
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:45,908
I swear I'll raise the profits this time.

710
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:48,978
Just give me one more chance.

711
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:51,014
Listen.

712
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:54,817
I got you this far
because of your desperation.

713
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:57,120
But you know what?

714
00:45:58,054 --> 00:45:59,622
When I say something like this,

715
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:03,793
there's meaning and philosophy behind it.

716
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,596
You're taking my money,

717
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,401
and this is how you pay back the favor?

718
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:14,304
You're the reason...

719
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:16,739
You're the reason our company...

720
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,075
is in such a mess, you son a bitch.

721
00:46:24,147 --> 00:46:25,248
Damn it.

722
00:46:25,982 --> 00:46:28,318
Did you just grab my leg
with those filthy hands?

723
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,154
I can't stand this bastard.
Get rid of him.

724
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,388
Get him out of here.

725
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:34,357
and bring me his hands.

726
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,826
Fuck off!

727
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,330
This is a great time to stir things up.

728
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:45,301
We have to act before Chairman Kim.

729
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:48,137
I'm talking about a project...

730
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:50,506
that CEO Ma would find irresistible.

731
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:08,691
I hit the jackpot.

732
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,576
It's so nice out.

733
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,748
How's your hangover?

734
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:35,084
Don't ask, I feel like crap.

735
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:37,020
Damn it.

736
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:39,422
I could do better than him.

737
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:42,258
That sly old bastard.

738
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:43,726
Mr. Ma.

739
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:48,031
You know exactly how to rise to the top.

740
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,937
Do you know Jenga, the board game?

741
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,540
You stack it high as you want,

742
00:47:58,341 --> 00:47:59,676
but if the foundation's weak...

743
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,711
it all comes down.

744
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:04,247
Organizations are the same.

745
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:06,182
The boss needs...

746
00:48:07,116 --> 00:48:08,918
someone to watch his back.

747
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:12,088
Otherwise, they crumble
under any pressure.

748
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:14,424
That's why...

749
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:19,062
I told you I'd help.

750
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,318
I just learned
something really interesting.

751
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,654
Guess what?

752
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,467
This Wei Chang Yu,

753
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,103
is this the same person as
this Wei Chang Yu here?

754
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:05,375
(Kim Mi Yang)

755
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:39,075
(No Mercy)

756
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,311
Do you know Mason Dedrick?

757
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,513
I may not know Mason personally,

758
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:46,416
but I know his right-hand man well.

759
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,450
Any update on what I asked?

760
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,952
Word from Samhaphoe is that...

761
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:51,287
Eric Choi's pulling Mason's strings.

762
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,122
I knew he wouldn't fall for it easily.

763
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:56,326
We need to lure Ma Seok Gu
to Korea quickly...

764
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,027
so we can do anything.

765
00:49:58,027 --> 00:49:59,362
He's starting a new project...

766
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:01,864
without my agreement?

767
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:04,834
What are you doing here?

768
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:07,070
You knew all about it, didn't you?

769
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,373
This is Kim Doo Sik's doing, isn't it?

770
00:50:10,373 --> 00:50:11,608
He's trying to take my stuff again!

771
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,509
You have five hours, Eric.

772
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,812
That's how long you have to get home
in one piece.
