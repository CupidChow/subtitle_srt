(Mungyeong Station)

9
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:24,948
So Min.

10
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:29,485
Dad.

11
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,721
Mom.

12
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,590
Why do you look so startled?

13
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,093
Let's go, our little princess.

14
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:41,030
Come on, you still think
she's a little girl?

15
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,132
What? She still looks like
a little kid to me.

16
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:46,636
Goodness, you're such a softie.

17
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:47,570
Let's go, sweetheart.

18
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,180
Where's Dad?

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,449
He probably went to get water.

20
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,988
How's everything going these days?

21
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:07,390
What do you mean?

22
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:10,827
I mean, acting.

23
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,429
How's that working out?

24
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,569
I'm still building my experience.

25
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,207
You're this age
and still gaining experience?

26
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,642
My goodness.

27
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:29,679
If you were a police officer,
you'd be high-ranking by now.

28
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,114
Mom, please.

29
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:35,218
At this rate, when will you
ever land a lead role?

30
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,721
I'm seriously losing my patience.

31
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,400
Hey, look at you.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,001
What are you laughing at?

33
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,570
I'm happy, that's all.

34
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,542
You just asked me for the first time...

35
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:01,711
about my work.

36
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:05,615
You think that's funny?

37
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,084
No, I'm not laughing at you.
I'm just happy.

38
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:12,789
My goodness, you're so silly.

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,996
(No Mercy)

40
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:26,469
Mr. Ma, are you on your way?
Where are you?

41
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:27,804
Yes, I'm on my way.

42
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,673
I just passed Seongan Bridge.

43
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:31,641
I see.

44
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,476
Everything's okay, right?

45
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,579
Sorry? What do you mean?

46
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,567
(Ambulance)

47
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,239
Seongnae Hospital's ER is full.

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,075
Call the nearest hospital.

49
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:08,845
Traffic accident victim, male in his 40s,
needs CPR.

50
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:11,080
The accident happened at 9.50 p.m.

51
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:21,224
Emergency patient coming through.
Clear the way!

52
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:26,996
What do you think you're doing?

53
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:10,840
You scared me.

54
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:13,209
Why are you looking at me like that?

55
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,079
Good thing you're still alive.

56
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,181
Is So Min around?

57
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:19,115
About that...

58
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:20,717
we have a problem.

59
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:21,751
What kind of problem?

60
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,787
It's about those false rumors
going around about you.

61
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,591
You don't look that handsome
from this angle.

62
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:30,593
Who called you a handsome detective?

63
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:32,929
It's a mystery.

64
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:35,832
Just tell me if So Min's here.

65
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:37,333
If you want to know,
it'll cost you 50 cents.

66
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,335
Enough of this from you. Understood?

67
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,537
Tell me where she is.

68
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:44,974
Over there.

69
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,780
(Episode 6)

70
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:53,016
What's so serious?

71
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,797
Do you think he's dead?

72
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,467
We already checked.

73
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:13,469
Does that worry you?

74
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:15,805
It feels kind of empty.

75
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,440
It's normal to feel that way.

76
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:19,609
But...

77
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,045
watch your back from here on out.

78
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,347
They'll come after you.

79
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:27,283
So, you should stay here for a while.

80
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:28,251
I don't want to.

81
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:35,024
It's over now.

82
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:35,925
So Min.

83
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,261
Your life could be in danger.

84
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:42,332
I don't care about that.

85
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,269
When I decided to kill Ma Seok Gu,

86
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,305
I put my life on the line too.

87
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:50,540
You put your life on the line?

88
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,477
You should realize how precious life is.

89
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:57,914
Be grateful that both your parents
are alive.

90
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:58,881
I don't care.

91
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:05,021
What's the point of having parents alive?

92
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:07,924
It's like they don't exist.

93
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:13,830
My dad uses me for his reputation.

94
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,898
My mom went crazy
after being labeled a mistress.

95
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:18,835
How's that normal?

96
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:25,174
You think only the easy path
is worth taking, right?

97
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:26,876
No.

98
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,380
Even if it's not a glamorous path,
if it's easy for you to walk,

99
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,481
it's a good path.

100
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:33,950
That's why...

101
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:36,419
I want you to pick yourself up...

102
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,454
and figure out the right path for you.

103
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,691
I won't let you throw everything away.

104
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:47,630
Fine.

105
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:49,599
You mean it?

106
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,303
- You promised.
- All right.

107
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,307
Thanks for this. Bye.

108
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:06,182
Thanks.

109
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:07,450
For what?

110
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:09,252
Just... thanks.

111
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,334
(For rent)

112
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:27,403
(So Min Soup and Rice)

113
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,148
What can I get you?

114
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:14,384
Two regular sundae soups
and one special, please.

115
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:15,385
You got it.

116
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:17,620
Two regular, one special.
Get the stove going.

117
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,454
Okay.

118
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:21,524
Goodness, the sides aren't ready.
What are you doing?

119
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:22,392
It's burning.

120
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:26,829
How long are you peeling that onion?
Forever?

121
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:27,964
It's making my eyes burn and water.

122
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:29,899
For crying out loud.

123
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:31,267
Here you go.

124
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:37,540
Dad, what should I do?
My eyes are burning.

125
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,675
Take your time.

126
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:47,050
Okay, quick question.

127
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,318
- Mr. Ha Hyun Jin?
- Yeah?

128
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,520
Why did you marry Ms. Kim Mi Yang?

129
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:52,622
Hmm.

130
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:54,557
Because she's pretty.

131
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,028
Come on.

132
00:09:59,028 --> 00:09:59,862
Why?

133
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,865
- So Min.
- Yeah?

134
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,702
Do you know how much our soup costs?

135
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,671
What? Eight dollars?

136
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,540
Wrong.

137
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,076
Just one bowl? But there are two of you.

138
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:16,379
I always bring my grandson here
for free food.

139
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,680
I feel bad about it.

140
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:21,517
It's normal to eat two bowls for two.

141
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:24,220
Why do you always feel bad about it?

142
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,022
Just a moment.

143
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,357
I bet you're hungry, huh?

144
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:31,694
Two bowls of soup.

145
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:37,700
Why are you spacing out?

146
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,068
I told you to peel the onion.

147
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,003
I am.

148
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:42,438
You're the queen of spacing out.

149
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:44,407
Here you go.

150
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:45,375
Be careful.

151
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,012
- So Min.
- Yes?

152
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:51,547
You know that expression.

153
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:54,183
Tough on the outside.

154
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:56,552
What's it called?
Tough on the outside.

155
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:57,854
Girl crush?

156
00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:59,022
No, that's not it.

157
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,624
Tough outside, gentle inside.

158
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:03,626
That's what I love about her.

159
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:05,995
When you listen to your mom talk,

160
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,865
it sounds harsh,
like she's rubbing salt in a wound.

161
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:11,067
But if you listen closely,

162
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,569
she's actually putting medicine on a cut.

163
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,838
That's the kind of person your mom is.

164
00:11:15,838 --> 00:11:19,008
Stop it. When did you
start bragging about your wife so much?

165
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:20,710
All right.

166
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:25,782
Here.

167
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:55,578
(Water bill - Ha Hyun Jin)

168
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,375
The commissioner will be here soon.

169
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:54,604
(Commendation)
(Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu)

170
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:01,811
You made it.

171
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:10,320
It seems you'd even be willing to...

172
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,622
put yourself in danger for that girl.

173
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:15,325
So I guess...

174
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,694
you'd risk your life for this woman.

175
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:21,364
Do you think I abandoned you and your mom?

176
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,299
I can't say otherwise.

177
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,970
I know how much you value your reputation.

178
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,239
Jae Gyu?

179
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,341
Back off!

180
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,675
Please don't go.

181
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,110
What about Jeong Hun?

182
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,445
Damn it!

183
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,348
Jeong Hun.

184
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:43,152
You may resent me now,

185
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,723
but once you grow up
and experience the world,

186
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:49,158
you'll understand why I did this.

187
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,362
Please don't go.

188
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:53,963
- Let go of me!
- Mom.

189
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:56,399
Mom.

190
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,545
(Police Commissioner Park Jae Gyu)

191
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:14,851
Looks like you're not satisfied
with the position you got...

192
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:16,219
by abandoning your first wife.

193
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:23,926
You thought you could control me...

194
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:26,696
by holding Ha So Min over my head.

195
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:27,664
Not happening.

196
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:31,601
I'll catch Ma Seok Gu
and lock him up myself.

197
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,305
So just drop it, all right?

198
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:39,142
I don't want to see
how low a man calling himself my dad...

199
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:40,510
will stoop.

200
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,114
Jeong Hun.

201
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:51,287
What you see isn't the whole picture.

202
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:54,557
My one mistake was...

203
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:59,462
not exposing you to the real world sooner.

204
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:04,901
If seeing that world is what it takes,

205
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:07,270
then I'd rather stay blind.

206
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,551
(Damage per victim)

207
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:25,488
Why are you gathering statements
from the phishing victims?

208
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:27,991
What are you up to?

209
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,427
Jong Chan, stay out of it.

210
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:33,863
You could get hurt.

211
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:35,331
Detective Park.

212
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:37,100
Yes, Chief.

213
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,334
Come with me for a second.

214
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:44,207
What's going on?

215
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,677
A man went missing
near Seongan Bridge last night.

216
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:49,112
Missing?

217
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:51,147
I think it's Ma Seok Gu.

218
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:53,650
Ma Seok Gu?

219
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:57,186
There was a major accident
in that area last night.

220
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:00,056
The paramedics were ambushed
by gang members...

221
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:02,859
and murdered.

222
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,996
Every security camera in the area
was destroyed.

223
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:09,365
They even took the dashcam footage.

224
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,333
It was all planned out.

225
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:11,901
And?

226
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:16,005
According to witness statements,
the unidentified patient...

227
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,775
matches the description
of the Ilseong clan's leader.

228
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:21,377
But...

229
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,579
you know what pisses me off?

230
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,086
Our superiors wanted us to cover this up.

231
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,921
I don't know what changed their minds,

232
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:33,990
but now they're demanding
we bring this bastard in.

233
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,191
(Wanted - voice phishing suspect)

234
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:41,798
Well, well.

235
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,868
It's embarrassing, I'm always
the one asking favors from you.

236
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,705
Nonsense.

237
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:53,242
I was hoping you might reconsider...

238
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,411
what you said last night.

239
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,480
You mean about the campaign funding?

240
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:07,023
I heard the Democratic People's Party
approached you...

241
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,726
and the Korea Freedom Party as well.

242
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,861
Yes, that's how things worked out.

243
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:14,931
Talented people get noticed everywhere.

244
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:18,901
So, which party have you chosen?

245
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:23,239
I need to figure out
which option serves you better,

246
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,841
so I'll need a bit more time to think.

247
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:26,042
That makes two of us.

248
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:27,777
Sorry?

249
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,445
I haven't decided yet.

250
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:34,717
I need to think about what's best for me.

251
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:36,786
On top of that,

252
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,455
one of my people stole from me.

253
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:44,060
We're doing everything we can
to catch Ma Seok Gu.

254
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,461
Just give us a bit more time.

255
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,696
That said,

256
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,197
something tells me...

257
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:52,735
that my guy was set up by someone.

258
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:57,273
So even if you find him,

259
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:59,409
my money will already be gone.

260
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:01,611
So you're saying...

261
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:04,180
Bring me...

262
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:06,783
the real thief.

263
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:12,588
I'll make sure they learn
what happens to anyone...

264
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,290
who steals from me.

265
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:17,727
Bring them to me,

266
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,763
and I'll go through with the funding
I withdrew.

267
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:26,336
Yes, sir.

268
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:33,176
- Welcome.
- Hi.

269
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,947
I remember you from before.

270
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,382
You came looking for your mom.

271
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,118
Were you able to find her?

272
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:43,853
Yes, I found her.

273
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,288
Thank goodness.

274
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:48,458
I've been worried ever since that day.

275
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,728
What kind of flowers do you need?

276
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:53,863
Are they for your mom?

277
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:58,968
What's typically used for memorials?

278
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:03,006
Well...

279
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:06,142
(Camellias)

280
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:18,721
I'll take these, the camellias.

281
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:38,341
By the way,

282
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:42,011
you know that guy from earlier, right?

283
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:44,681
What guy?

284
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:45,682
You don't?

285
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:51,721
There was a man here right before you...

286
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:53,890
who also bought camellias for a memorial.

287
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,726
He asked for red ones specifically,

288
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,261
so I figured you two
might know each other.

289
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:03,032
(Love Hall)

290
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:30,426
I told you, I can't show
security footage to just anyone.

291
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:31,961
Please, just this once.

292
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:34,797
Someone I don't know visited my parents,
and I have no clue who it was.

293
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:37,567
Probably someone who knew them.

294
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,669
If I could just see the footage,
I'd know if they were acquainted.

295
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,071
For crying out loud, you're persistent.

296
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,673
The answer's no. Please go.

297
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:47,310
Then did you happen to see anyone
carrying camellias?

298
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,745
How am I supposed to remember...

299
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:51,014
Hold on.

300
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:52,949
Camellias?

301
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,320
Yeah, I do remember.

302
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,690
Usually people bring lilies or hyacinths,

303
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,159
but someone left camellias, which was odd.

304
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:05,595
Was it a man?

305
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:07,997
What did he look like? How old was he?

306
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:09,832
It was a man.

307
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:12,869
He had sunglasses on,
so I couldn't really see his face.

308
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:17,106
I remember this. He had...

309
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:18,007
this weird tattoo on his neck.

310
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,683
You mean a tattoo like this?

311
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:29,485
Like this one?

312
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,388
Yeah, that looks like it.

313
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:34,490
Thank you.

314
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,603
(I think Ma Seok Gu is still alive.)

315
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:48,871
(We need to meet.)

316
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,315
The commissioner wants to see you.

317
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:06,556
I need to ask you something.

318
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,226
Were you behind
what happened to Ma Seok Gu?

319
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:11,361
Of course not.

320
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,763
How would I know where that bastard is?

321
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,066
So you're telling me
you had nothing to do with it?

322
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:19,202
Like I said, it wasn't me.

323
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:24,841
Are we done here?

324
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,209
Jeong Hun.

325
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,243
Sorry, I've got somewhere to be.

326
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,822
Five minutes. I'm coming.

327
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:41,858
I can go by myself.

328
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,760
No way, it's too risky.

329
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:47,697
Are you sure it was Ma Seok Gu?

330
00:22:47,897 --> 00:22:49,432
I'm not sure,

331
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,468
but the tattoo matches exactly.

332
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:54,470
Tattoo?

333
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:56,439
You mean...

334
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:00,810
that weird irezumi tattoo?

335
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,913
That son of a bitch came to our house...

336
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:05,315
and my parents' restaurant.

337
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:08,051
What makes you think so?

338
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:08,952
He left clues,

339
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,988
like going through the mail,

340
00:23:12,322 --> 00:23:13,790
and leaving flowers behind.

341
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,794
I heard something at the station today.

342
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,730
Ma Seok Gu vanished...

343
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,766
while being transported to the hospital.

344
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:28,504
So he's still alive?

345
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:30,473
It's possible.

346
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:31,808
Then why?

347
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,811
He's been lurking around.

348
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:37,513
He could grab me anytime if he wanted.

349
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:39,048
It's like he's trying to intimidate me.

350
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,819
Don't worry, everything will be fine.

351
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:46,456
But something feels off.
Like he's up to something.

352
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:49,859
I'm almost there.

353
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:15,051
You looking for me?

354
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:41,978
One against many looks cool in movies.

355
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,486
I take that back.

356
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:09,172
Hold on.

357
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,511
Get him. Move!

358
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,881
Quick, go!

359
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:20,984
Catch that son of a bitch!

360
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:28,291
Where are you?

361
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,692
You, check over there.

362
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:16,172
What's taking him so long?

363
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:27,884
Park Jeong Hun!

364
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:33,957
So Min.

365
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:58,681
Things might look bad,
but there's always a way.

366
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:00,316
Come on, get in.

367
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,555
The spicy one's mine, cheese is yours.

368
00:27:06,456 --> 00:27:07,690
We need to call the cops first.

369
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,393
If we report this as a kidnapping,

370
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:12,762
they'll find out we're involved with them.

371
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,598
We'll end up behind bars too.

372
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:17,333
I can't go back to prison.

373
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,902
So what, we just sit here and do nothing?

374
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:24,307
We'll find him on our own.

375
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:29,112
We're inseparable.

376
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:33,016
They're getting further away.

377
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:35,151
Sir, please speed up.

378
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:37,387
I'll throw in an extra 50 cents.

379
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,397
(Power off)

380
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:49,198
(Location)

381
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:51,601
Oh my gosh.

382
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:53,236
What the, what happened?

383
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:55,405
Signal's gone.

384
00:27:55,772 --> 00:27:57,407
I think they noticed something.

385
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:58,775
What?

386
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:06,449
Hey.

387
00:28:08,084 --> 00:28:09,118
Hey.

388
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:19,862
Let me ask you one last time.

389
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:22,865
Where's the money?

390
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,201
You think money fetches itself...

391
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:26,903
when you snap your fingers?

392
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:52,962
(Speaker)

393
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,197
Hello?

394
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:56,966
Hello?

395
00:28:57,734 --> 00:29:00,136
Losing your parents should've been enough.

396
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:03,006
Why'd you have to steal from me
and make things worse?

397
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:06,643
Transfer the money you stole from me
to a cold wallet.

398
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:09,212
Drop it in locker two at Gyodong Station
by tomorrow night.

399
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:11,648
If I'm short even one penny,

400
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:14,183
your friend will end up like your parents.

401
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:16,419
(Video)

402
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,592
You think the money will just appear...

403
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:24,260
when you snap your fingers?

404
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,611
Mom!

405
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:47,150
We should give it back.

406
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:49,018
What?

407
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:49,919
The money.

408
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,655
I'm telling you, let's give it back.

409
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:54,724
Hold on, just calm down.

410
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:57,827
But his life is on the line,
how can I calm down...?

411
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:01,497
I'm sorry.

412
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,937
I just can't watch more people die.

413
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:11,207
Even if it's not a glamorous path,

414
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:13,142
if it's easy for you to walk,
it's a good path.

415
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:15,511
I want you to pick yourself up...

416
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,680
and figure out the right path for you.

417
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:20,617
I won't let you throw everything away.

418
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:23,753
Do Jin.

419
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:26,889
Can you transfer the money...

420
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:28,992
into that cold wallet thing right now?

421
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:31,995
You're seriously giving it back?

422
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:44,574
Even my one and only...

423
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:47,610
Ms. Kim is abandoning me.

424
00:30:52,815 --> 00:30:54,117
What's the point anymore?

425
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,619
I might as well just die.

426
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:23,112
Pathetic piece of shit.

427
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:27,684
What?

428
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:52,875
Please don't kill me.

429
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,444
I'll pay back everything I owe
by tomorrow.

430
00:32:02,418 --> 00:32:04,220
Where in Korea...

431
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:06,489
could Ma Seok Gu be hiding?

432
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:08,925
I don't know.

433
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:11,628
I don't know anything.

434
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:14,998
I swear, I don't know.

435
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:18,935
Because of that bastard Ma Seok Gu,

436
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:20,169
my life is completely fucked.

437
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:26,876
As ruined as mine?

438
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:30,113
Well, not exactly.

439
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:31,981
I never meant for that to happen.

440
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:32,882
I'm sorry.

441
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:39,656
How about we team up?

442
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,793
What? Team up with you?

443
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:45,328
You're out of your mind.

444
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,397
Even if I've hit rock bottom,

445
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:49,232
you think I'd work with someone
who used to work under me?

446
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:52,835
What is it?

447
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:55,805
(Wanted - voice phishing suspect)
(Ma Seok Gu)

448
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:57,106
There's fifty grand if we pull this off.

449
00:32:57,941 --> 00:32:58,741
We split it.

450
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:01,144
Only $50,000?

451
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,248
I take sixty, you get forty.

452
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:06,616
Six.

453
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,184
Four.

454
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,487
Forget it,
why would I chase pocket change?

455
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:12,355
Seventy-thirty.

456
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:14,757
Seven...

457
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,327
Still not enough.

458
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:23,566
Ninety-ten. That's my final offer.

459
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:26,235
Where do I start?

460
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,841
Wait, just listen for a second.

461
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:34,644
Come on,

462
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,412
you need to know
what you're signing up for.

463
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:37,347
Exactly.

464
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:41,084
So I'm paying you $1,000 upfront, got it?

465
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,619
Stop overthinking and just do it.

466
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,188
Wait, this is illegal, isn't it?

467
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:46,489
Forget it then.

468
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:47,924
Unbelievable.

469
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:52,562
Listen up.

470
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:53,796
We're going to be...

471
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:55,565
being antiheroes.

472
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:57,567
Anti... what?

473
00:33:58,268 --> 00:33:59,102
What the hell is that?

474
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:01,571
I use anti-aging products too.

475
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:02,639
Dumbass.

476
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,774
So it means...

477
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:06,676
Never mind, Just trust me.

478
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:09,045
It means you're a villain who does good.

479
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,413
That makes zero sense.

480
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:12,215
Hey, you don't trust me?

481
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:14,784
- Get in here.
- You're in then?

482
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:19,455
What's the job?

483
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:22,258
How should I know?

484
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:28,831
Wait, you're
the Chinese-Korean from earlier.

485
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:30,233
Wow.

486
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,537
Pretty sweet setup you got here.

487
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:37,840
Funny how nobody's behind bars.

488
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,481
You've got customer records
at your shop, right?

489
00:34:45,481 --> 00:34:47,583
Nope. The cops took everything.

490
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:48,718
Is that so?

491
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:54,624
Out of these accounts made with
stolen identities...

492
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:55,925
These ones?

493
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,760
Mr. Lee Seung Tae right here...

494
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,762
begged me, so I couldn't say no.

495
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,864
You were happy enough
when I offered money.

496
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,434
Still cost me extra though.

497
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:06,936
Even the foreigners figured it out quick.

498
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:08,638
You think they'd hand over
their info for free?

499
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,206
Cost me fifty bucks each.

500
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:13,676
That Kazakh guy, Obolbek?

501
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:16,746
He pushed to sell, so I helped him out.

502
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:19,182
Hey, I paid for it.
That makes it legal, right?

503
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:20,149
Whatever.

504
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:23,152
Give me info on a few more people,
including the Kazakh.

505
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:25,388
Also, for the Ilseong clan,

506
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,490
where do I post a job listing
for a collector?

507
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:37,233
(High-paid part-time job available)
(Simple collection work)

508
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:52,649
Mr. Obolbek?

509
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:59,155
I'm the one who called yesterday.

510
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:03,126
Can we talk for a moment?

511
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:07,864
You'll be managing clients
for our company.

512
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:10,466
When do I start?

513
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:14,637
Normal hours are nine to six,
Monday through Friday.

514
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:17,206
But we have an urgent job today,

515
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:19,242
so we need you to start right away.

516
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,878
Okay, I understand. It's urgent.

517
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:22,845
Understood.

518
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:25,815
This client declared bankruptcy
and has serious problems,

519
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:28,651
so they can't make bank deposits directly.

520
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:30,753
It's a large amount,
that's why we need you.

521
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:33,489
Where do you need me?

522
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,792
Head to Gyodong Station.

523
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:07,123
Once you've picked up the package,
head to Seongan Intersection Station.

524
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:09,592
Seongan Intersection Station?

525
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:12,362
Hand it off to our guy at Exit 3.

526
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:30,280
Once you get the package
from the client's courier,

527
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,415
look for the waffle cart on Buil-ro 3-gil.

528
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:49,999
- Head to Buil Community Center.
- Sir.

529
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,368
Sir, Buil Community Center, please.

530
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:56,839
(Location of S14)

531
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,046
Use this phone going forward.

532
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:05,448
We'll call you.

533
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:09,218
Wait.

534
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:13,489
Stop selling your personal information.

535
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:28,871
Pull over here, please.

536
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,340
Follow that car, please.

537
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:27,457
You're here?

538
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:30,326
What happened? Are you okay?

539
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:31,294
I'm fine.

540
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:35,798
So Min.

541
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,468
Do you remember what I said?

542
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:42,805
Everyone seems to have
their own right path.

543
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,847
What are you doing?

544
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:58,321
Sorry.

545
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:00,823
This is my path.

546
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,666
A guy came before you...

547
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,101
and also bought camellias for memorials.

548
00:41:12,435 --> 00:41:13,636
It was a guy.

549
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,173
He had sunglasses on,
so I don't really remember his face.

550
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:19,976
I remember this. He had...

551
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:22,011
this weird tattoo on his neck.

552
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:24,213
Oh my gosh.

553
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:25,415
What the, what happened?

554
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:26,716
Signal's gone.

555
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:28,685
I think they noticed something.

556
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:29,986
What?

557
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:35,525
That's enough.

558
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:39,829
How is it?

559
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:42,298
Does it seem real?

560
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,568
At this point, maybe the money...

561
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:47,170
and whoever the chairman thinks
stole it...

562
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,173
will reveal themselves.

563
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:57,880
How long?

564
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:16,432
All right then.

565
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,434
Good luck.

566
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,741
You son of a bitch!

567
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:39,889
Damn it.

568
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:12,789
(No Mercy)

569
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:14,524
Did you know...

570
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:16,392
that Park Jeong Hun is working
with the Ilseong clan?

571
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,395
You received a video call,

572
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:20,496
and it was me calling?

573
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:23,266
Your son's quite something, Commissioner.

574
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,568
You'll pit father against son?

575
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:27,337
That doesn't make sense.

576
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,706
Any word on the woman who got away?

577
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:32,175
We've looked all over,

578
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:33,309
but nothing yet.

579
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:34,777
Tell me the truth.

580
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:36,613
You had your own agenda
when you joined, didn't you?

581
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,380
I know.

582
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,350
You should be scamming,
not getting scammed.

583
00:43:40,883 --> 00:43:42,518
You barely know him.

584
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,220
And you really trust him?

585
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,456
Show me you're trustworthy.

586
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:49,592
Die!
