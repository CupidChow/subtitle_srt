00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:29,686
You're here?

10
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,555
What happened? Are you okay?

11
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:33,423
I'm fine.

12
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,894
So Min.

13
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:40,596
Do you remember what I said?

14
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:45,368
Everyone seems to have
their own right path.

15
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:53,843
What are you doing?

16
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,082
Sorry.

17
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:00,717
This is my path.

18
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:03,553
Since when?

19
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:21,638
(VOICE CHANGER)

20
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:25,475
Damn it.

21
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:26,576
It's me.

22
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:29,512
Yoo Seung caught Wei Chang Yu.

23
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,848
I'll send you the address.
Go take care of it.

24
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:43,726
All right then.

25
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:45,828
Good luck.

26
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,299
You son of a bitch!

27
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,819
We're going to be late. Let's go.

28
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:30,974
Damn it.

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,327
Let's go inside.

30
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,565
You little bastard.

31
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:58,268
You bastard.

32
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:01,371
You son of a bitch.

33
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,238
Chairman.

34
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:12,682
We're back, sir.

35
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:15,251
You're back earlier than I expected.

36
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,420
I retrieved the slush fund
you mentioned, sir.

37
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,995
There was no good cover to bring it back.

38
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,131
But you found it just as planned.

39
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:30,266
Good job.

40
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:31,668
Thank you, sir.

41
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:33,636
You filthy bastards.

42
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:36,205
Well, well.

43
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,143
You still have some energy left to talk,
huh, Seok Gu?

44
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,513
I'm so sorry, sir. Please forgive me.

45
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:44,380
I've done...

46
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:47,050
something unforgivable.

47
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:51,821
It'll never happen again.

48
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,789
I'm really sorry.

49
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:54,557
Go ahead then, talk.

50
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,392
Sorry?

51
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,430
"Don't kill me, sir."

52
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,733
Beg for your life.

53
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:08,504
Who knows?

54
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:10,006
I might change my mind.

55
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:11,708
Woof.

56
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:13,743
Woof.

57
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,245
Bark like a dog.

58
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:24,087
This is why I hate keeping dogs.

59
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,956
They never listen when you talk nicely.

60
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,262
Forget it.

61
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,601
Now you know...

62
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:43,506
who owns you, don't you?

63
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:48,311
You should always know your place.

64
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,314
Thank you, Chairman.

65
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:54,550
Just give me any order.

66
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:57,387
I'll do whatever you command.

67
00:05:58,321 --> 00:05:59,255
Thank you, sir.

68
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:24,914
(No Mercy)

69
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:36,826
Ugh, crap.

70
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,260
Hey, hit them.

71
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,128
Yes, sir.

72
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,826
I've dealt with all of Ma's men.

73
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,528
Bring that girl too, on your way back.

74
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:47,030
Yes, sir.

75
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,267
Bring her back alive.

76
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:53,069
The Chairman wants to
take care of her himself.

77
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:54,337
Yes, understood.

78
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:57,507
Let's go.

79
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,945
This is fun.

80
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,818
Where's my darling?

81
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,119
Where is he?

82
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:11,988
Where is he?

83
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:13,690
Do Jin.

84
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:14,991
Over here.

85
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,469
Well, that's a first.

86
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,172
I'm usually the one being cuffed,
not uncuffing people.

87
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:31,774
How'd you know I was here?

88
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:32,709
What?

89
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:36,079
I had no idea you were here.

90
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,716
I just saw this was
his last known location.

91
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,618
You said you lost his signal back then.

92
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:44,187
Even if you lose the signal,
it'll reconnect if it's meant to.

93
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:47,323
I saw him log into the app,
so I rushed over.

94
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:48,658
But it's gone now.

95
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:53,129
Every time I get close,
he pulls further away.

96
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:54,764
Did you know?

97
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:56,733
About what?

98
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,802
That Park Jeong Hun is working
with the Ilseong clan?

99
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,137
What?

100
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:03,806
Who said that?

101
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:05,308
Some rumor?

102
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:07,176
You see what happened here?

103
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:10,113
That bastard lured me here
and stole my money.

104
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,585
If that's the case, it's no fun.

105
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,387
No, that can't happen.

106
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,756
Ilseong guys can't find out I'm here.

107
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,025
- Drag her out now.
- Oh no.

108
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,828
Do Jin.

109
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:27,797
How did you get here?

110
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:29,732
Taxi.

111
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,668
- You don't have a driver's license?
- I have one but never use it.

112
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:33,202
Damn it.

113
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:39,909
Don't move.

114
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:42,478
Don't test me.

115
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:44,547
I'll blow us all up.

116
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:46,849
- Damn it.
- Go ahead.

117
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,719
Don't move or I'll do it.

118
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,588
- Damn it.
- Go ahead.

119
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:53,489
Go ahead.

120
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:56,693
Get her!

121
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:10,473
Get her!

122
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,815
Get her!

123
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,390
Hello, sir.

124
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:03,359
Who the hell are you?

125
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,197
Did you just hit him with that?

126
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:09,432
- Damn it.
- You did.

127
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:10,400
Get in the car.

128
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,936
I said get in, now.

129
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:13,736
Okay.

130
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:23,179
You have a license?

131
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:24,747
- I have one, but I've never used it.
- Crap.

132
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:41,898
Last time,

133
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:44,500
I told you to catch the one
who took my money.

134
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:47,704
Why haven't I gotten any updates?

135
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:48,771
Well...

136
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:52,609
We're looking everywhere for them.

137
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:58,781
I thought you'd have found them by now.

138
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:00,883
Am I wrong?

139
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:03,186
Sorry?

140
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:05,989
What do you mean?

141
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,226
Your son's quite something, Commissioner.

142
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:12,762
Did you know...

143
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:17,133
he's been working for me since last year?

144
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:19,535
What?

145
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:22,305
Chairman.

146
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,942
What exactly do you mean?

147
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:30,713
He just recovered my slush fund.

148
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:33,116
Now he's completely become my man.

149
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:39,289
You wanted campaign funding, right?

150
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:40,857
Then...

151
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,527
show me you're better than your son.

152
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:45,828
What?

153
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:50,166
We'll talk about the funding later.

154
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,869
Sir,

155
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,472
you'll pit father against son?

156
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:58,308
How is that even possible?

157
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:01,611
With your experience and reputation,

158
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:05,315
you can't let some young punk
get the better of you, right?

159
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,484
You've got your dignity
as Police Commissioner.

160
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:13,890
Speaking of which,
I've got a little favor.

161
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,360
One of my dogs...

162
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,196
has been making a mess everywhere.

163
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,966
I'd like you to clean it up for me.

164
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:46,522
Did you have to do that?

165
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:49,158
You're the one who took Mom...

166
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:50,426
from me first.

167
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:53,296
Your mom was mentally ill.

168
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,165
If you couldn't be there for her,
you shouldn't have hurt her.

169
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,500
What?

170
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,970
She might have meant nothing to you,

171
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,171
but to me,

172
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,210
she was my whole world.

173
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,845
It's all in the past.

174
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:13,283
You threw everything away for that?

175
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:14,884
You pathetic fool.

176
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:18,621
I'll show you how pathetic...

177
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:19,689
I can be.

178
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:26,963
Are you ready?

179
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,601
If you stand in my way,

180
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:35,238
I won't spare you,
even if you're my own son.

181
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:36,806
I look forward to it.

182
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,174
Well, then.

183
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,581
I've got a car waiting up front, sir.

184
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,983
All right, let's go.

185
00:14:58,261 --> 00:14:59,295
It's me.

186
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,665
Tell them to call off the arrest operation
on Ma Seok Gu.

187
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:11,107
Sir.

188
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:15,778
I've farmed this land my entire life.

189
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:17,180
Compensation?

190
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,815
I don't need any.

191
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:22,785
Just let me keep farming it.

192
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:24,821
Please, sir.

193
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:28,124
Yes, I understand.

194
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:31,094
Come back next week
and bring it up again at the meeting.

195
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,095
Show him out.

196
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:33,396
Yes.

197
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,037
Detective Park?

198
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:46,542
Hope we're not interrupting.

199
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:49,545
What brings you two here?

200
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,180
Please, have a seat.

201
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:52,515
Sure.

202
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:54,517
Thank you.

203
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,555
It's really nice out.

204
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:04,060
What brings you here all of a sudden?

205
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,430
I heard the tourism promotion bill...

206
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,399
has passed the committee.

207
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,101
As party leader,

208
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,937
I surely have the power to manage that.

209
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:16,906
Thank you.

210
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,375
I know how much work you've put in.

211
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:24,547
So the land development issue is
settled then?

212
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:25,448
Now...

213
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,885
the key is selecting a private developer.

214
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:34,490
That might be tricky.

215
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:39,595
I represent the people.

216
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,565
Shouldn't I be working for them,

217
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:44,867
not for personal gain?

218
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:54,477
I heard your son gave up
his US citizenship...

219
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,045
and joined the military.

220
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,815
That's very admirable.

221
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,122
I've got a phone call.

222
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:09,392
I'll step outside and leave you two
to talk comfortably.

223
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:19,035
Sir, you know what I mean.

224
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:22,538
I was speaking figuratively.

225
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:26,476
Even with the drugs and hit-and-run death,

226
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:27,910
the media has been silent.

227
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,480
You know better than anyone why.

228
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:33,583
Well, the thing is...

229
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,785
You're in that seat...

230
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,887
because I put...

231
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,689
personal interests...

232
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:42,625
over the public good, isn't that right?

233
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,098
Yes.

234
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:50,633
You're right.

235
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:54,070
I'm always grateful.

236
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:01,577
Tell me the truth.

237
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,113
You had your own agenda
when you joined, didn't you?

238
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,616
Of course not.

239
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:09,485
Are you really jealous...

240
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:10,987
that I took the seat you wanted?

241
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,027
That's why...

242
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:20,129
you shouldn't trust people so easily.

243
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:22,799
You should be scamming,

244
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,534
not getting scammed.

245
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:27,437
Who do you think you are?

246
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,773
You're really testing me, aren't you?

247
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:38,715
Nice hands. It'd be a shame
if something happened to them.

248
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,518
Watch yourself,

249
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:43,786
mister.

250
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:53,896
That bastard.

251
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,304
Seok Gu, no, Jeong Hun.

252
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,206
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:05,308
Do you know where this is?

254
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:09,545
Isn't this the resort site
you'll be developing?

255
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,081
Wrong.

256
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:15,051
This isn't just any resort.

257
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:17,353
It's a miracle.

258
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,124
The kind that will make me...

259
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:23,226
a world-class CEO.

260
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:26,529
So we just need investors now?

261
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:28,364
That's the tricky part.

262
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:32,568
We don't have anything
to make investors bite.

263
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:35,338
We have Congressman Seo.

264
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,206
One isn't enough.

265
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:40,677
We need a face for the company.

266
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,113
Then...

267
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,883
what if we created one?

268
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:59,495
So you're saying...

269
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:03,266
we should use a deep-fake model
for promotion?

270
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:07,537
For private equity investors?

271
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:09,639
Correct.

272
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:13,543
We'll put political heavyweights in front.

273
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:18,147
Once we pump up the value and cash out,

274
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:19,882
the returns will be massive.

275
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,219
If they knew, who would report it?

276
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,755
In the end, they'll be in the same boat.

277
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:27,991
Would...

278
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,393
three days be enough?

279
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:32,495
Yes, sir.

280
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:35,098
You're here.

281
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:37,000
Any word on the woman who got away?

282
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,403
We've looked all over,

283
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,571
but nothing yet.

284
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:45,642
With all our guys here,

285
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:48,411
how is it possible we can't catch a girl?

286
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:49,712
My apologies, sir.

287
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:53,149
Chairman.

288
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,318
I'll make sure to catch her myself.

289
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,887
Go on.

290
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,431
Chairman.

291
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:11,501
I know this might be overstepping,
but can I ask you one thing?

292
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:13,202
If you know you're overstepping, why ask?

293
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,106
I'm not trying to impress you,

294
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,976
I'm genuinely worried about you.

295
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:23,446
Why do you keep that guy around?

296
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:25,782
It's complicated, so just drop it
before I lose my patience.

297
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:27,617
You barely know him.

298
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:29,218
And you really trust him?

299
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,755
I've served you for twenty years.

300
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:34,090
But you won't hear me out.

301
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,726
You think I trust him?

302
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:40,029
Sorry?

303
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:44,901
There's nothing as foolish as
trusting people.

304
00:21:45,702 --> 00:21:47,870
They always show
their true colors eventually.

305
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:50,473
In this situation,

306
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:52,909
who do you think is playing into a trap?

307
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,210
Me?

308
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:55,411
Him?

309
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:57,647
Or you?

310
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:02,318
I only see the results people show.

311
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:05,521
If you want to speak, show me.

312
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:13,830
Yes, sir.

313
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:29,746
Why can't they make up their minds?

314
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:32,215
If they're going to keep changing their
minds, they can catch him themselves.

315
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:35,718
Chief, is everything okay?

316
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:39,222
They told us to stop going after
Ma Seok Gu now.

317
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:41,924
Last time they told us to catch him
as soon as possible.

318
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:43,626
That's exactly my point.

319
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:44,927
They told us to catch him, then not to.

320
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,396
We've got almost
all the security camera footage.

321
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,866
We just need to trace the final route.

322
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:53,236
This is really driving me crazy.

323
00:22:57,573 --> 00:23:00,777
Lee Jong Chan, voice phishing unit,
Seongan Police.

324
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:02,145
Yes.

325
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:04,247
What?

326
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:06,616
Understood.

327
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,419
What's wrong?

328
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:12,989
The investigative unit handed us a case.

329
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:17,026
The suspect is...

330
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:35,211
I can't go home or use my phone for days.

331
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:37,447
What on earth is going on?

332
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:47,924
Can I just check my phone real quick?

333
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,233
(Phone powering on)

334
00:24:01,137 --> 00:24:03,339
You're pretty popular, So Min.

335
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,676
(16 unread messages)

336
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:13,516
(Ms. Ha So Min has been named a suspect
and must come in for questioning.)

337
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:18,588
I didn't see that coming.

338
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:23,226
(Hye Dam - missed call)

339
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,731
- Hye Dam.
- So Min, where have you been?

340
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:30,199
Why haven't you been answering?

341
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,200
Let's meet.

342
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,269
I need to see you and talk.

343
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,043
You received a video call,

344
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:41,477
and it was me calling?

345
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:42,812
Yeah.

346
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:47,984
So Min, what's going on?

347
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:49,052
Where are you?

348
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:50,653
I'm in China.

349
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:51,955
What?

350
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:53,923
Why are you there?

351
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:56,059
They promised good money,

352
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,427
but it's a voice-phishing operation.

353
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,028
What do I do?

354
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:03,032
Just prepare a copy of your ID.

355
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:06,135
Then we'll guide you through the process.

356
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:07,704
Wait.

357
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:09,706
You're Ha So Min, right?

358
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,376
Hey, are you okay?

359
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:14,310
Yeah, for now.

360
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,413
They killed someone yesterday
for trying to escape.

361
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:19,849
They're saying I have to pay
if I want to get out alive.

362
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:20,583
What should I do?

363
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:23,186
How much are they asking for?

364
00:25:23,753 --> 00:25:24,754
$30,000.

365
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:29,092
Hye Dam, I hate to ask,

366
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,126
but can you help me?

367
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,694
Hey.

368
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,464
I don't have that kind of money.

369
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:37,200
Someone's coming. I have to hang up.

370
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,635
If I get caught, I'm screwed.

371
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:41,871
Hye Dam, please do me this favor.

372
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:43,873
I'll pay you back once I'm back in Korea.

373
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,141
Where should I send the money?

374
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:49,312
You know what the reply was?

375
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:56,286
"So Min, I sent the money."

376
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:57,520
Can you get out right away?

377
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,855
(Sorry, but you just got scammed.)

378
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:00,223
(You can't trust anyone in this business.)

379
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:02,925
Who the hell was that?

380
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,329
Hey, Wei Chang Yu.

381
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,331
How's it going?

382
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:11,234
This is why you can't trust anyone
in this business. Damn it.

383
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:23,780
Where's Park Jeong Hun now?

384
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:27,016
With Chairman Kim, most likely.

385
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:28,851
And where can I find that bastard?

386
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:31,154
I'm not sure about that.

387
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:35,858
Scissors.

388
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,628
Scissors, scissors, rock.

389
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,998
Turn off your phone.

390
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:45,034
The cops are tracking us.

(Hearin Real Estate)

392
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,412
What are you talking about?

393
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,748
You're going to get yourself in
serious trouble.

394
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:36,519
The property was leased to Ahn, not Kim.

395
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,321
The names don't even match.

396
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:39,822
Look,

397
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:41,357
if I were shady,

398
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:43,593
would I have my business...

399
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:47,530
right here in this neighborhood?

400
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,500
I've been here for 20 years.

401
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,943
(Real estate contract)

402
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,878
Check the back.

403
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,447
There's evidence of pyramid schemes.

404
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:09,886
Feel like you got screwed?
Should I tell the cops...

405
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:11,854
that Kim set you up?

406
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:17,593
What do you think?

407
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:21,197
Yeah, looks good.

408
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:23,099
Everything I asked for is done.

409
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,502
Soundproofing, ventilation,

410
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:29,072
and power, everything is solid.

411
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:32,609
Security cameras only cover this side.

412
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:33,876
Sir,

413
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:36,713
I'm paying you well.
This better be secure.

414
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:39,849
Absolutely.
You've got nothing to worry about.

415
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:41,684
As you can see,

416
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:44,487
it's a quiet area.

417
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:46,222
Also,

418
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:49,359
you know the VIP room
costs extra if needed.

419
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,596
The cops won't be a problem.
I've got them handled.

420
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:58,301
Mr. Kim and Ma Seok Gu go way back.

421
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,270
They're thick as thieves.

422
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,905
But word is Chairman Kim's the one...

423
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:04,374
who landed him the captain's spot.

424
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,777
I'm counting on you.

425
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:09,612
Right back at you.

426
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:11,614
I don't need to count it, right?

427
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:12,949
Please. We're professionals.

428
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:14,784
To honesty and transparency.

429
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:15,685
Cheers to that.

430
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:23,926
Mr. Kim.

431
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,632
Did you miss me?

432
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:31,367
Wei Chang Yu?

433
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:34,203
What are you doing here?

434
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,238
Ma Seok Gu,

435
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:36,539
forget about him.

436
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:38,174
The guy he works for.

437
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,476
Where is he?

438
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,412
You show up out of nowhere...

439
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:44,847
with this crap?

440
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,184
Does Ma Seok Gu know...

441
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:50,987
you're hiding out here?

442
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:53,556
What?

443
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,224
Answer me,

444
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:57,860
or everyone finds out
what you've been doing.

445
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:09,072
Good to see you, sir.

446
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,274
Hope the drive wasn't too bad.

447
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,643
Thanks for sending the car.

448
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:14,844
It made it easy.

449
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:18,348
Nice to meet you, sir.

450
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:20,083
I'm Park Jeong Hun, we spoke before.

451
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:23,186
- Good to finally meet in person.
- Nice to see you too.

452
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:30,727
You sure you don't need me to come?

453
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:32,795
Stay here and watch.

454
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:34,130
If something happens,

455
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,332
knock twice.

456
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:37,700
Don't say a word.

457
00:30:38,768 --> 00:30:40,570
But what if Detective Park
really is working with them...

458
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:44,374
If I'm not back in an hour,

459
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:45,608
call the police.

460
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:46,542
Okay.

461
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:00,623
Let me show you...

462
00:31:00,623 --> 00:31:03,860
how much of
Seongan's main development area...

463
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,094
the Gyumin Construction project covers.

464
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:05,928
Okay.

465
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:18,641
So it's basically done.

466
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:20,076
By the way,

467
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:24,047
are these investors the people
I think they are?

468
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:24,881
Which ones?

469
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,051
(Potential investor list)
(Seo Jung Geun)

470
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:30,453
You mean Congressman Seo Jung Geun?

471
00:31:34,324 --> 00:31:36,059
My goodness.

472
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:40,463
Sorry I'm late. I had to finish
my work at the Assembly.

473
00:31:41,497 --> 00:31:42,265
Nice to meet you.

474
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:44,968
Oh boy.

475
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,605
How have you been, Chairman?

476
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:50,640
You're right on time.

477
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,037
Then this must be...

478
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:21,838
(Park Jae Gyu)

479
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:24,841
The Commissioner couldn't make it...

480
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:26,776
since he's at a briefing.

481
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:30,246
His son's here instead. You can trust him.

482
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:31,781
I see.

483
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,685
It's too soon to be surprised, sir.

484
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,189
This project...

485
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:42,759
isn't just construction.

486
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,195
We're turning Seongan into
a global tourism hub...

487
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:48,364
that'll put Korea on the map.

488
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm Lee Myung Gi, former Minister of Land.

489
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,335
Gyumin Tourism Construction...

490
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:55,038
will lead Korea's tourism industry
into the future.

491
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:58,908
They're all investing?

492
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,111
That shows the company's value...

493
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:04,681
and credibility, doesn't it?

494
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:07,283
I agree.

495
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,819
The government is fully behind this...

496
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,254
Sorry, excuse me a moment.

497
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:12,855
Sure.

498
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:44,454
What are you doing?

499
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,195
I guess I'm nervous.
I needed to use the restroom.

500
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:57,934
Chairman wants you. Let's go.

501
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:59,769
Sure.

502
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:02,805
What've you got there?

503
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:06,276
He told me not to tell anyone.

504
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:07,644
Sorry, I can't tell you.

505
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:09,445
Let's go.

506
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:11,581
Sure.

507
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:28,998
Everything okay?

508
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:36,005
This all sounds good,
but I have a question.

509
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,373
Please, go ahead.

510
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:40,877
Casino regulations in Korea are strict.

511
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:42,845
Isn't it risky...

512
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:44,948
trying to ease regulations...

513
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,616
and get approval?

514
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,685
Well,

515
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:50,520
as for that matter,

516
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:54,457
we're working on a special bill...

517
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:57,260
to boost the economy...

518
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,495
through tourism.

519
00:35:00,129 --> 00:35:00,997
Listen.

520
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:03,866
Once it passes,

521
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:05,902
we'll coordinate with the Assembly...

522
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:11,341
and local governments.

523
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:12,809
No problem.

524
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:15,979
I see.

525
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:19,415
This is Gyumin Tourism Development's...

526
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:22,418
first project of this scale.

527
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,021
Why should I trust...

528
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:26,489
an inexperienced company?

529
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:28,825
You said trust?

530
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:31,961
Yes.

531
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,531
I need to see some trust from you too.

(Seongan Police Agency - crime unit)

533
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:43,606
Wait, Chairman.

534
00:35:44,274 --> 00:35:46,276
I can explain.

535
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,711
Please hear me out. This is a setup.

536
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,347
Wait, Chairman.

537
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:52,148
Hey.

538
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:53,516
Stop it!

539
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,519
Chairman!

540
00:35:58,721 --> 00:35:59,722
Chairman!

541
00:36:00,323 --> 00:36:01,424
Let go!

542
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:03,559
You bastard, stop it!

543
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,295
Chairman!

544
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,676
You broke my trust.
What am I supposed to do about that?

545
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:23,346
Chairman.

546
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,949
I swear I had nothing to do with this.

547
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,584
Please believe me. I'm innocent.

548
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:32,588
I don't care
whether you're involved or not.

549
00:36:33,923 --> 00:36:37,327
To me, trust is just business.

550
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:43,900
Sir.

551
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:53,676
I had a backup plan.

552
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:56,379
I brought in another investor
just in case.

553
00:37:15,932 --> 00:37:16,899
So you're saying...

554
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,769
Wei Chang Yu is on her way here?

555
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:20,837
Yeah.

556
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:22,038
I just figured...

557
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:25,408
I figured I'd give you a heads up.

558
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:28,745
Got it.

559
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:30,480
Good job.

560
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:33,449
She'll come back.

561
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:34,484
She'll be back.

562
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:36,486
What do I do?

563
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,294
Who are you?

564
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,163
So Min?

565
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,338
You two are working together, aren't you?

566
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:57,507
No. You've got it wrong.

567
00:37:57,507 --> 00:37:58,875
You son of a bitch!

568
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:01,811
Please don't kill me!

569
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:03,513
Everything okay?

570
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:08,217
How'd you get her here?

571
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:11,854
I set a trap.

572
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:13,690
They took the bait.

573
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:18,428
From the moment you latched onto me,

574
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:21,197
I knew you were playing both sides.

575
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,869
And I knew you let her escape on purpose.

576
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:28,705
But...

577
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:32,141
I'll give you credit. You're quite useful.

578
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:36,346
That's not true.

579
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:38,881
Is that so?

580
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,084
You're saying it's not true?

581
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:46,189
All right, I'll believe you.

582
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:11,748
These two...

583
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:15,151
screwed up a big deal for me.

584
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,987
Show me you're trustworthy.

585
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:19,522
And...

586
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:21,758
Then I'll spare one of them.

587
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,533
Hate to interrupt the drama.

588
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,647
Police are looking for me too.

589
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,051
Don't push so hard, you bastard!

590
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,120
Be gentle.

591
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,561
Stop them!

592
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:32,495
Move!

593
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:33,763
Get out of the way!

594
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:36,232
Chairman.

595
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,468
We need to go now.

596
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,538
Chairman.

597
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:46,776
Chairman!

598
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:51,114
You're useless to the very end.

599
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,617
Die!

600
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,910
(No Mercy)

601
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,946
He accidentally killed the investor.

602
00:41:57,614 --> 00:42:00,450
Ma Seok Gu supplied the drugs!

603
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,385
Is there any other evidence?

604
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:04,754
Detective Park must've gathered evidence.

605
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:06,723
We looked everywhere. Nothing turned up.

606
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:08,124
It's me, Park Kye Sun.

607
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,025
Park Kye Sun?

608
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:10,760
Jeong Hun had evidence.

609
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,629
Ma Seok Gu must have taken it.

610
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:14,631
Now there's no telling what he'll do.

611
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:15,531
Who did this?

612
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:17,066
Who the hell is it?

613
00:42:17,066 --> 00:42:18,601
Commissioner,

614
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,937
you need to handle this.

615
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:23,139
Kim Mi Yang's daughter is here.

616
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,874
Hand over Jeong Hun's evidence.

617
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:28,411
Everyone around you will suffer,
one by one.

618
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:30,913
I'll make it happen.
