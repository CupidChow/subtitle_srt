00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,244
(Lee Joo Young)

00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:25,955
(Ji Seung Hyun)

3
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:36,032
(Koo Jun Hoe)

4
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:47,910
(Mom)

5
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,150
(No Mercy)

6
00:00:56,152 --> 00:00:57,153
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

7
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,154
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:09,866
Why are you surprised?

9
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,108
($5,000)

10
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:35,291
Hey, the charging station is
right next door.

11
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,359
Have fun.

12
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:38,728
Hey.

13
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,397
Hey, you little sprout.

14
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:44,200
Felt pretty good spending
other people's money, didn't it?

15
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:48,104
What? You think money just grows on trees?

16
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:49,872
What are you going to do?

17
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:53,776
Your hair's all wild like Tarzan,
you little shit.

18
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:54,844
I'm here, boss.

19
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:56,646
Hey, you're here?

20
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,328
Knucklehead.

21
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,529
My goodness.

22
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:17,567
You broke your promise with the grown-ups.

23
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:18,434
Right?

24
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,837
That's no good, you little punk.

25
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,039
By the way,

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,009
you're in charge of the captain's house.

27
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:29,212
Can't you find any decent guys
in Korea anymore?

28
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:32,081
All we get are these useless little punks.

29
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:34,684
Damn, these pathetic little minnows.

30
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:39,155
These young punks put up with injustice,

31
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:43,693
but they can't handle
the slightest inconvenience to themselves.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,236
We caught one of those call center workers
who ran off last night.

33
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:55,638
Turns out,

34
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:58,508
he was someone brought in
by the Korean captain's house.

35
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:00,877
Was it that son of a bitch
who Kim from Gyodong brought again?

36
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:05,848
Shit, why do all his guys keep running?

37
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,818
Damn it, he brings in
nothing but losers like himself.

38
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,090
One of the rats you ran off
and got caught.

39
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,793
Looks like you've got your hands full,
Kim.

40
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:20,096
Did one of them run away again?

41
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:22,699
My goodness.

42
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,401
Just tell me who that bastard is.

43
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,837
I'll quietly take care of
that punk smoothly,

44
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:30,239
so it doesn't come back to bite you.

45
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:32,275
Can we let it slide just this once?

46
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,310
Remember that rookie who ran off
with the cash from the exchange...

47
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,745
and ended up dead?

48
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,680
And before that, the mole too.

49
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,415
Fuck, and you're saying, "just this once"?

50
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:41,818
Hey, Mr. Kim.

51
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:44,520
I trusted you with all domestic scouting,

52
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:47,357
and you keep dragging in losers.

53
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,058
I'm sorry, man.

54
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:51,794
Bro, I'm on my knees.

55
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:52,629
Mr. Kim.

56
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:53,997
Bro.

57
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:56,165
If you don't want things to get ugly,

58
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,335
let's end this kind of mess now, okay?

59
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,305
I've put up with this
only because I owed you.

60
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:04,741
But fuck, if it keeps going like this,
I won't stand for this shit anymore.

61
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:06,709
Wait...

62
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,880
Damn it, you son of a bitch.

63
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:13,316
I'm ten years older than you.

64
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:18,655
Anyway, where are we supposed to find
useful guys again?

65
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,923
Damn it.

66
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,626
I'll be on my way.

67
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:25,595
Bye.

68
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,034
(No Mercy)

69
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,370
Have you been well?

70
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:36,072
It's

71
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:37,907
Park Gye Soon.

72
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:41,511
Since I pissed off that cunning bastard,

73
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:43,813
I've been living a new life.

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,982
Aren't you happy to see me?

75
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,885
What the hell is this about?

76
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:50,353
What?

77
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,957
You know that better than I do.

78
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:01,164
Stop right there, you fucking bitch.

79
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,532
Shit.

80
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:05,134
Stay right there!

81
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:06,169
Shit.

82
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,812
What the hell, she fell off the cliff?

83
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:18,848
I was this close to catching her.

84
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,151
Damn rat bitch, Park Gye Soon.

85
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:28,491
So...

86
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,361
So why the hell aren't you dead?

87
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:34,597
Why I'm not dead, you say?

88
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:37,867
I almost died,

89
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,869
and that's what you say to me?

90
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:42,438
Shut up. Where the hell are you right now?

91
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:43,506
Show yourself right now.

92
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:44,741
Come out here.

93
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,076
Bro.

94
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:49,979
Take a good look at yourself.

95
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,782
You look really old.

96
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,584
You've been quiet all this time,

97
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:57,854
why lose your shit now?

98
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,490
You should know that.

99
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,325
It's obvious, isn't it?

100
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,061
Let me be blunt.

101
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:09,132
I'm here to get revenge for
what you did to me.

102
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:10,266
What? Revenge?

103
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:15,972
Hey, what can you possibly do to me now?

104
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,041
Well...

105
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,245
I could tell the cunning bastard...

106
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,547
that I'm still alive.

107
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:25,748
The cunning bastard...

108
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,218
Seung Tae?

109
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:33,623
What do I do?

110
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,959
What am I going to tell Seung Tae?

111
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:37,827
What the hell do I do?

112
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:40,596
I'm seriously losing my mind.

113
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,601
How do you think the cunning bastard
will react...

114
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:47,670
when he finds out the woman
he ordered dead is...

115
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:50,006
still alive?

116
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:55,111
That'd be no fun at all, right?

117
00:06:56,679 --> 00:07:00,183
I've been waiting over ten years
for this moment.

118
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,153
I've spent years thinking of ways...

119
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,023
to fucking destroy you.

120
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,025
So then what?

121
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,128
You're going to screw yourself over soon.

122
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:13,563
What?

123
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:17,834
What makes you say that?

124
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,302
Don't underestimate me.

125
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,805
I've got people everywhere.

126
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,475
"People everywhere," my ass.

127
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:28,778
Hey, why should I believe you?

128
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,882
Word is you've been pocketing
loads of money

129
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:34,717
putting your guys on side jobs
behind the cunning bastard's back.

130
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,055
How the hell did you know that?

131
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,090
Who told you?

132
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:44,794
Who the hell told you that?

133
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:46,696
Who knows?

134
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:51,567
People get paranoid when they're scared.

135
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:54,070
If you want to move up in the world,

136
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,674
you need to screw over your old friends.

137
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,642
That's the rule in this world, isn't it?

138
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,878
Tell me right now which bastard it was!

139
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,047
Well then, I wish you luck.

140
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,383
Hey.

141
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,921
Shit.

142
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:14,290
What?

143
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:20,330
Shit.

144
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:27,537
Fuck it.

145
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:31,841
First time's always the hardest, right?

146
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:42,752
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:43,586
What is it?

148
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,188
The client's reporter...

149
00:08:45,188 --> 00:08:47,790
is asking about the production scale
of "Scam of Scams."

150
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,528
I'll score something big soon.

151
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,565
You just hype it up
as much as possible, got it?

152
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:57,433
Hey.

153
00:08:57,734 --> 00:09:00,603
The one we couldn't sign last time
because of the price?

154
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,971
Call him right now.

155
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,207
Tell him we'll sign him right now.

156
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:05,541
Sorry?

157
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:06,576
Also,

158
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,646
call Olim Telecom right now.

159
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:12,315
The cops are all over there.

160
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:15,818
Why are the cops there?

161
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:17,520
Beats me.

162
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:19,722
Maybe they did something wrong.

163
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:21,457
Fine, I got it.

164
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:22,892
Hang up now.

165
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,197
What the fuck?

166
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,269
(In Cheol, Olim Telecom)

167
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:35,438
No, wait.

168
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:45,982
If you want to move up in the world,

169
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:49,552
you need to screw over your old friends.

170
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:51,521
That's the rule in this world, isn't it?

171
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,091
We've got lots of room open here.

172
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:57,927
Why side with other people?

173
00:09:58,528 --> 00:09:59,362
What?

174
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:02,165
I really don't get it.

175
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:04,133
So,

176
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:05,969
did you get...

177
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,371
enough insurance?

178
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,339
Got enough backup?

179
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,276
- Are you okay?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:14,611
Yeah, you'll get hit again then.

181
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,816
Hey, you motherfuckers,

182
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,652
who ran their mouth about our shop?

183
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:24,253
You come out...

184
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:26,356
or what?

185
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:29,058
You little shits.

186
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:33,229

"I stole it,

189

00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:40,570

would know about this business...

195

196
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:52,815

198
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,985

204

shows up out of nowhere,

218
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,882
saying she's back to get revenge on me.
That's strange enough.

219
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,951
And now suddenly,

220
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:04,253
one of her underlings...

221
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,990
shows up, saying I'm in danger?

222
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,492
And...

223
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,829
you expect me to buy this?

225
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:19,836
I said, who are you?

226
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:25,908
I'm a spy.

227
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:27,810
A spy?

228
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:32,448
Do you know how many people
Park Gye Soon has under her?

229
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,818
She's got a hundred people
working for her.

230
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,655
So what do we do with them?

231
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:41,090
Use them as a spy,

232
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,127
to get the crew back on top.

233
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:48,831

you're planning to smack Park Gye Soon

in the back of the head?

242

It's not that I suddenly changed my mind.

243

I've been waiting for that bitch
to make a move.

244

247

At such a young age,

250
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:07,076
that's fucked up.

251
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:14,417
So I need an ally to side with me

252

and help kill Park Gye Soon.

253
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:18,721

you want to team up with me

255
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:23,259

00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,370
Kim runs a shaman scam...

372
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,672
in the fishing villages.

373
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,276
Heavenly spirits, underworld spirits.

374
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,811
Spirits of heaven and earth.

375
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,780
Bring us wealth and fortune...

376
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,482
and safely guide us.

377
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:53,449
Let's go!

378
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,153
The villagers think they're praying...

379
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:59,656
to the Yongshin
for their prosperity and health.

380
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:02,258
They don't know their dragon god
is really just Ma Seok Gu.

381
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,694
It's really just for the Ilseong crew.

382
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:06,062
Goddess of Mercy.

383
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:07,263
Bless us with health and longevity.

384
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,599
Goddess of Mercy.

385
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,301
Goddess of Mercy.

386
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:14,003
One, two, three...

387
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:17,206
five, six, seven,

388
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,842
eight, nine, ten.

389
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:22,178
Hi there.

390
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,147
Good work.

391
00:21:24,147 --> 00:21:24,948
Here.

392
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:25,848
Thank you.

393
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:28,351
- Well done.
- Thank you.

394
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,086
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

395
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,821
Shots for everyone.

396
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:34,223
How much was that?

397
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:37,460
Nothing beats the smell of money.

398
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:39,996
The important thing is the people.

399
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:42,632
After the festival,

400
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,068
they all go to a call center in China.

401
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:48,371
The day before or after
the Yongshin festival, a boat docks

402
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:49,739
and hauls them all.

403
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,608
- Safe travels.
- Thanks.

404
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:52,609
Make lots of money.

405
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:53,643
Thank you.

406
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,346
That's why today's the day.

407
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:59,048
It's the safest way to cross into China.

408
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,718
(Father)

409
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:08,658
So Min, I'll step out for a bit.

410
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:10,226
Where are you going?

411
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:14,330
I got a call I wasn't expecting.

412
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:16,165
Who called you?

413
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:20,036
My father.

414
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:22,338
Jeong Hun.

415
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,475
I need to get on that boat.

416
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:28,111
If you're going to call the cops...

417
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:28,945
So Min,

418
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:30,213
don't worry.

419
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,016
You know we don't get along.

420
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,285
Don't worry. Just stick with the plan.

421
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:36,786
I'll be back soon.

422
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,261
What? Why the green light?

423
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:46,396
Do Jin.

424
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:47,530
Yes?

425
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,765
Yes.

426
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,200
Listen carefully.

427
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,035
Okay.

428
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:56,873
Hello?

429
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:00,243
Just because you got demoted,
you abandoned your post?

430
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:01,477
You're making me look bad.

431
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:03,913
- I was clear about this.
- I won't say more.

432
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:05,214
Return...

433
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:06,582
to your original post.

434
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:08,117
I won't.

435
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,156
You made this mess, so you deal with it.

436
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,659
You went to the press to screw me over.

437
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,761
You should've expected the consequences.

438
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:21,264
You run the investigation,

439
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:22,031
but...

440
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:23,800
do it my way, got it?

441
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,501
I've already said no.

442
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:28,204
The victim's daughter, was it Ha So Min?

443
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,840
You went to the police academy
together, right?

444
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:34,410
Not sure what you're planning with her,

445
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,045
but just think about it.

446
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,246
Just maybe,

447
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:38,314
what if

448
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:40,750
she ends up dead too?

449
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:44,687
Are you threatening me?

450
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:46,055
I'm curious to see.

451
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:48,958
In the end, let's see who goes down,

452
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,660
me or her.

453
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:53,329
The choice is yours.

454
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:54,931
I'll be waiting.

455
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:02,138
Come in.

456
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:05,842
Chief, Chairman Kim is here.

457
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,044
- My goodness.
- Oh dear.

458
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,146
I hope I'm not bothering you
while you're busy.

459
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:11,481
Not at all, sir.

460
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,216
I've been waiting for you.

461
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:14,684
Please, have a seat.

462
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:20,256
I don't believe in
the law's idea of justice.

463
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:23,960
Then trust me instead.

464
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:26,396
Forget the law.

465
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:28,564
Trust me.

466
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:43,579
Why are you so surprised?

467
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:45,515
You look like you've been caught
red-handed.

468
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:48,384
Boss says come in. Let's head inside.

469
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,896
Your profit is $7,600,

470
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:03,399
which means you can withdraw $7,700 total.

471
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,534
This is customer support.

472
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:07,303
Your ID is gomgom2, right?

473
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:08,037
Our records show...

474
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:10,073
as a new customer,
your profit is unusually large...

475
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:13,443
compared to your initial $300 deposit.

476
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,812
For big withdrawals like this, you need to
deposit 3 million points first...

477
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:17,146
so we can process a withdrawal.

478
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:18,615
So you need to make a deposit first.

479
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:20,483
Yes.

480
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:27,724
We've finished confirming.

481
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:29,292
You're good to go for withdrawal.

482
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,828
You don't have to worry.

483
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:34,497
If you refer lots of people,

484
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:35,632
that'd be great.

485
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:38,368
It's finished.

486
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:44,841
My goodness.

487
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:46,276
Good grief.

488
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:48,144
If it weren't for you,

489
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:50,280
I would've been in real trouble.

490
00:25:51,714 --> 00:25:53,249
So, thanks a lot.

491
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:56,319
What the heck?

492
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:00,156
Wait.

493
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:04,560
What the hell are you doing right now?

494
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,762
I did something terrible.

495
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,197
I lied to you.

496
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:10,533
The police threatened me into it.

497
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:12,669
They made me lie to you,
so I had no choice.

498
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:15,638
What, the police are on my tail?

499
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:17,006
I've got an informant.

500
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:20,276
Someone using you to get Ma Seok Gu.

501
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:24,380
The truth is,

502
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:29,118
the police were listening to everything.

503
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,991
Damn it.

504
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:39,662
Get over here, you bitch. Get up.

505
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:41,431
Hey.

506
00:26:42,432 --> 00:26:43,800
You're done for, damn it.

507
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,634
Wait!

508
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:50,907
This could be an opportunity.

509
00:26:52,642 --> 00:26:54,344
A chance to return the favor to Ma.

510
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:02,552
Once someone reports it,

511
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,054
the bank freezes everything.

512
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:05,955
Forget it.

513
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:09,292
I'm going to give it back to
the original owner.

514
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,227
So unfreeze my account this instant.

515
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,564
Unfortunately, we can't do anything until
the person who reported your account...

516
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:17,600
sends written proof within a week.

517
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:19,435
What? A week?

518
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,337
That's the timeline
for the written confirmation.

519
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:23,072
Even if both parties reach an agreement,

520
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:24,073
- it takes at least...
- Hey!

521
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,742
That's bullshit.

522
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:29,145
What the fuck is going on?

523
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:37,520
(cloud1101)

524
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,322
I fucking knew it.

525
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:43,559
(You were the one
who blackmailed me, right?)

526
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,327
(Yep.)

527
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:46,696
(I'm sending money now.
Unfreeze the account right now.)

528
00:27:46,696 --> 00:27:48,698
(Pay $300 and I'll lift the freeze
right away.)

529
00:27:56,673 --> 00:27:57,874
$300, okay.

530
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,443
(Okay, where?)

531
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,612
(Streetlight at Jugang-ro 38 by 1 p.m.)

532
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:09,018
That's kind of tight to make it.

533
00:28:18,895 --> 00:28:20,596
Damn it, why aren't you moving?

534
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:25,702
Come on, move, damn it.

535
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,087
Out of the way, you pieces of shit.

536
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,223
If you don't want to be dead, fuck off.

537
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:51,561
(Police)

538
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,769
What brings you here?

539
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,104
You know Lee Seung Tae, right?

540
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:03,172
Police raid, we have a warrant,

541
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,807
for violating the telecommunications law.

542
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,610
We need access to the building.

543
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:09,345
Yes, understood. Please, this way.

544
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:13,116
What about the movie?

545
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:14,651
It's already been completely stopped.

546
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:16,019
The filming crew's all disbanded.

547
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:18,321
What happens to us now?

548
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,890
Maybe it's for the best.

549
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,259
This place was going nowhere anyway.

550
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:37,373
(Jugang-ro 38)

551
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:44,781
What the hell is this?

552
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:48,918
Why are the police there?

553
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:51,387
Fuck, we're screwed.

554
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:53,990
(Mr. Kim)

555
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:56,759
Kim, hey man.

556
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:58,795
Can you help me out?

557
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:02,098
I need to get to the airport in a hurry,

558
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:03,366
but my money's tied up.

559
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,402
What? Where exactly are you going?

560
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:10,506
Look at the mess in the office.

561
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,008
How did you...

562
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:14,243
know what's going on in the office?

563
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,211
It's me,

564
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:17,480
cloud1.

565
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:20,950
You're cloud1?

566
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,756
Why would you do that to me?

567
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,157
Why?

568
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:30,360
It's because of you.

569
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:33,129
I'm just...

570
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,200
screwing you before you screw me.

571
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:40,603
No way.

572
00:30:40,603 --> 00:30:41,504
You're just...

573
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:44,674
a fat rat caught in a trap.

574
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:48,444
There's no way out of this mess.

575
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:51,014
There's no use wriggling to survive.

576
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:52,181
Even if...

577
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:53,416
you struggle to stay alive,

578
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,952
it won't matter.

579
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:57,587
You're bound to be done for anyway.

580
00:30:57,954 --> 00:30:59,922
Wait, that's not it.

581
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:01,658
Just hear me out, for fuck's sake!

582
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,429
So,

583
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,065
what's your plan?

584
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:15,939
Use this crisis...

585
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,742
to improve your own image.

586
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:23,713
Take the heat for Ma.

587
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:26,716
And even on the run,
you send talent to China.

588
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:31,154
That's the new image Ma will see of you.

589
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,692
It's the day before the Yongshin festival.

590
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:40,430
When else could be a better day
to make a move?

591
00:31:42,198 --> 00:31:44,033
To kill Park Gye Soon,

592
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,169
I can't do it without you.

593
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:48,871
You seem way more reliable...

594
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:51,240
than the police.

595
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:52,875
So?

596
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:55,612
Tell me.

597
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:58,147
What do you want...

598
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,183
from me?

599
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:03,086
Get me in with your guys...

600
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:05,421
and send me to China.

601
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:09,892
I'm willing to go to China...

602
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:12,362
as a capable talent.

603
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:15,531
It'll save face for you too.

604
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,036
If you do that for me,

605
00:32:21,404 --> 00:32:23,273
I'll protect you from Mr. Ma.

606
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:27,277
Very...

607
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:28,845
nice.

608
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,513
Yo.

609
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:35,318
(Police)

610
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,714
Detective.

611
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:07,350
Something's off.

612
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,152
Why's nobody here?

613
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:26,936
Help me!

614
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:28,671
Help me, please.

615
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:34,043
Ha So Min.

616
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:49,158
Hey, we're going to make bank
thanks to you.

617
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:50,560
I'm so freaking pumped.

618
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,794
Me too.

619
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:56,099
I got to the final round at
Seungryul Electronics but didn't make it.

620
00:33:56,699 --> 00:33:57,967
A friend of mine reached out to me.

621
00:33:58,568 --> 00:34:00,770
she said this place was usually exclusive,

622
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,106
but they were adding
a new department and hiring,

623
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,874
- Whoa.
- and she'd personally put me in.

624
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,309
- That's awesome.
- I know.

625
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:07,644
Apparently,

626
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,912
this place's been making crazy money.

627
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:11,714
Screw it, I'm not jealous of
a big company.

628
00:34:11,714 --> 00:34:13,650
Hey, so what's the base pay?

629
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:15,652
- It's per deal.
- Per deal.

630
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:18,421
I heard the boss here is really generous.

631
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:19,289
Damn it.

632
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,324
They say the base salary itself
is higher than other places.

633
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:24,060
Seriously, if I rake in cash here,
what should I do first?

634
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,994
Should I buy a car first?

635
00:34:24,994 --> 00:34:27,664
You jerk, start by treating your folks.

636
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,399
You jerk.

637
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,500
Just look ahead.

638
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:32,602
How did you get here?

639
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:38,641
Don't mess around.

640
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:39,909
Okay?

641
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:42,211
Yes, sir.

642
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:47,617
It's going to take a while to get there.

643
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:50,320
Take a sip, one by one. Pass it along.

644
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:56,125
Once you've downed it, give it to me.

645
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:57,226
Yes, sir.

646
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:59,295
Drink every drop.

647
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:00,396
Don't leave any.

648
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:09,572
- Give it to me.
- Yeah.

649
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,541
Thanks, sir.

650
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:36,799
Your soup's here.

651
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:38,835
Here you go.

652
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:41,137
Mom.

653
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:42,572
Hey, you're here?

654
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:54,384
Are you hungry? What would you like?

655
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:56,252
Sit down for a second.

656
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:57,387
What?

657
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:02,558
What is it?

658
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:06,796
Ta-da.

659
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:09,999
What is this?

660
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:20,543
(Acceptance Letter -
Korea National Police University)

661
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:28,318
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

662
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:31,788
I thought I'd ruined the fitness test,

663
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:33,122
so I didn't think I'd make it.

664
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,857
But I made it.

665
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:37,260
I knew it.

666
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:39,495
I know how hard you worked.

667
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:41,998
Whether you passed or failed,
you've done well.

668
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:45,568
You're a tough cookie.

669
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:47,470
Whatever you do, you can do anything.

670
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:49,872
I'm not worried about you anymore.

671
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:55,511
I know I haven't done much to support you.

672
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:56,913
I feel bad.

673
00:36:57,146 --> 00:36:58,648
What are you talking about?

674
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:00,583
We both do fine on our own.

675
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,651
Jeez.

676
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:02,719
My goodness.

677
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,887
You'll get it...

678
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:07,256
when you have kids someday.

679
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:08,558
My goodness.

680
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:10,994
What do you want to eat?

681
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:13,563
I'll just have soup.

682
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,832
Let's head out and have steak tonight.

683
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:16,866
- For real?
- Yeah.

684
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:46,062
Gather up!

685
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:56,205
Newbies.

686
00:37:57,473 --> 00:37:59,776
Grab your suitcase
and put it in front of you.

687
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,311
You've got ten seconds.

688
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:06,349
Go.

689
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:19,729
Two seconds,

690
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:21,197
one second.

691
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:22,398
Freeze.

692
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:28,204
Why couldn't you get back in 10 seconds?

693
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:29,372
Well...

694
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,207
my bag...

695
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:33,409
was buried at the bottom.

696
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:37,647
In this age of competition,

697
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:39,515
results are everything.

698
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:41,684
So what do you do?

699
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:45,355
You've got to crush the competition.

700
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:52,428
No.

701
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:58,568
Take your passports and electronics
out of your suitcases right now.

702
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:00,403
Even passports?

703
00:39:00,403 --> 00:39:02,639
If you want to go home, it's not too late.

704
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,040
You can leave now.

705
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:06,075
One,

706
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:07,677
two,

707
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:11,381
three.

708
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:14,150
You applied for a government loan.

709
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,919
We're calling about approval.

710
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:19,656
Since you're using Money Cash service,

711
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:23,159
there's a new refinancing loan
with under ten percent interest.

712
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,827
That's why we reached out.

713
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:27,630
Just press the verification button.

714
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,632
It'll ask you if you want to
download something.

715
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,768
The team you just saw is
the first call team.

716
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:34,470
Our job is simple.

717
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,306
Once they lock down a bank account,

718
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:37,974
we use it...

719
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:40,276
to get people to deposit money here.

720
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,612
Depending on the situation,
we might do the first call ourselves.

721
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:43,780
Any questions?

722
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,315
So...

723
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:48,051
what's our base pay?

724
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:49,619
How much are you expecting?

725
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:52,956
About $2,000?

726
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:54,190
That's it?

727
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:57,126
You came all the way here
thinking you'd get $2,000 as base pay?

728
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:59,395
Then get your ass back on the boat, punk.

729
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:01,631
Listen carefully, everyone.

730
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:03,099
This is professional work.

731
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,568
Each of you uses your expertise...

732
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:07,604
to win clients' trust.

733
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:10,607
Of course, you earn
according to your performance,

734
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:13,076
but the base pay starts at $5,000.

735
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:13,776
Okay?

736
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:15,345
Yes, sir.

737
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:27,223
Oh dear.

738
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,192
Did you skip breakfast?

739
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:35,131
Why do you sound so dull?

740
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:42,272
What's the key to telemarketing?

741
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,373
Voice.

742
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:46,309
Get him out of here.

743
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:54,917
I'm sorry.

744
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,488
Hello, Mr. Park Seon Woo.

745
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:01,958
I'd like to tell you about a loan
for artists' living expenses.

746
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:03,826
Do you have a moment?

747
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:07,430
Hello, is this Yoon Seo Bin?

748
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:10,433
I'm calling from
the Seoul Artist Association.

749
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,336
This project is supported by
the Lottery Committee...

750
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:15,038
of the Ministry of Finance,

751
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:16,739
under the Lottery Fund Act.

752
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:23,846
(Saetbyeol Theater Troupe)

753
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:26,916
(Ryu Hye Dam, Lim So Yeon, Jeong Min Seo)

754
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:32,021
(Ryu Hye Dam)

755
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:53,076
Hello?

756
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,112
Hi, this is
the Korea Artists' Welfare Center.

757
00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:57,580
Yes, what's this about?

758
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,284
This call is for members of
our foundation.

759
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:04,854
There's emergency money available
for artists.

760
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:09,225
You, Ms. Ryu Hye Dam, are eligible.

761
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:10,960
Really?

762
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:13,963
If you want to apply, you'll need to
prepare proof of artistic activity...

763
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:16,466
and loan documents.

764
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,201
Any other documents needed?

765
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:21,571
For online submissions,
the original IDs are used for fraud.

766
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:24,140
Why would you doubt
a perfectly legit person?

767
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,977
Hello?

768
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:30,546
Please go ahead.

769
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:32,915
Sorry about that.

770
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:35,184
That's all you need.

771
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:39,455
Just prepare a copy of your ID.

772
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:42,392
- I see.
- We don't require the original ID,

773
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:45,028
unlike other lenders,

774
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:46,796
to avoid misuse or fraud...

775
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:48,798
like identity theft.

776
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:49,866
Really?

777
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,002
I'll send it your way now.

778
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:56,072
I'll send you a link to an app.

779
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:57,173
Just attach...

780
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:01,044
a copy of your ID
in the verification section.

781
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:04,447
Then we'll guide you through the process.

782
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:07,884
Wait.

783
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:09,786
You're Ha So Min, aren't you?

784
00:43:12,388 --> 00:43:13,256
Well...

785
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:15,458
I don't know what you're talking about.

786
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:19,429
I'm calling from
the Korea Artists' Welfare Center.

787
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:20,463
Where are you?

788
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:22,732
What are you doing there?

789
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:24,834
No, that's not it.

790
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:32,942
You psycho bitch, just send it
when I say so.

791
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:03,373
(Scanning ID)

792
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:04,707
(Remote verification screen)

793
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:06,009
(ID verification is complete.)

794
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:06,909
(Loan application has been submitted.)

795
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:10,079
This works with only the copy,

796
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,581
no hacking app, no password needed.

797
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:17,854
Not a single online bank
or major financial firm in Korea...

798
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:20,890
has a proper system...

799
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,525
to tell real IDs from copies.

800
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:24,894
This is how you do it, idiots!

801
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:28,665
Look for loopholes in the system.

802
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:31,000
She's already earned $36,000.

803
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:36,039
Move up.

804
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,707
Keep going straight up.

805
00:44:38,441 --> 00:44:41,678
That way, you'll be working
in a flexible environment...

806
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:45,114
even ordering takeout,
just like your seniors.

807
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:46,516
Isn't that right?

808
00:44:48,851 --> 00:44:51,254
In that sense,
let's give a round of applause...

809
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:52,388
to today's MVP.

810
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:13,309
What's your name?

811
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,912
It's Wei Chang Yu.

812
00:45:16,145 --> 00:45:17,013
Wei Chang Yu.

813
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:20,950
He's calling for you.

814
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:05,228
That's not how you treat a VIP.

815
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:17,607
It must've been rough
coming all the way here.

816
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,545
Nice to meet you, I'm Ma Seok Gu.

817
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,950
That mom you're looking for?

818
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,752
She's right there with you. Look around.

819
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,567
Son of a bitch.

820
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:19,202
(No Mercy)

821
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:22,472
Prove you're not a double agent yourself.

822
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,674
That's where I'll begin trusting you.

823
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:28,111
We have to act before Chairman Kim.

824
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:30,713
I’m talking about a project...

825
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,348
that CEO Ma would find irresistible.

826
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,652
The boss needs someone
watching his back.

827
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:37,754
Otherwise, they crumble
under any pressure.

828
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,088
I'll be your support.

829
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:40,823
This is Kim Mi Yang.

830
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:43,593
Who?

831
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,895
Some horribly unlucky lady.

832
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:48,097
I killed her myself.

833
00:47:48,097 --> 00:47:49,799
Isn't it a bit strange?

834
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:51,734
The day she joined the call center,

835
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:53,403
Mr. Kim disappeared too.

836
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:54,671
Tell me straight.

837
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:56,205
Who sent you?
