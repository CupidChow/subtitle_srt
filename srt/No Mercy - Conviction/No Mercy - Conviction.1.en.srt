1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,040
(Lee Joo Young)

2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,760
(Ji Seung Hyun)

3
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,830
(Koo Jun Hoe)

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,710
(Mom)

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,950
(No Mercy)

6
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,950
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

7
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,950
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,990
(No Mercy)

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,260
You're nothing but a parasite
leaching off Koreans.

10
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,870
And you think they'd let me in?

11
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,570
Do I look like a joke to you?

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,340
You think it's funny
that I'm desperate to survive?

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,980
Is it funny to you, seeing me
fighting for my life in the gutter?

14
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,680
You psycho jerk!

15
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,920
(Director jerk)

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,860
You psycho jerk.

17
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,190
Hello?

18
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,130
Hey.

19
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,560
Run a quick errand for me
on your way here.

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
What?

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,900
What now?

22
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,670
You know where Olim Telecom is, right?

23
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,040
Go there and pick up some stuff.

24
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,310
What stuff?

25
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,770
Just filming props.

26
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,710
We'll load it straight into the car,
so head out now.

27
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,950
I'll pay you when you're here.

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,750
You're really going to pay me today,
right?

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,260
Son of a bitch.

30
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,560
Son of a bitch.

31
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,100
You psycho jerk.

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,670
You psycho jerk.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
You psycho jerk!

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Let's go.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,380
(The Woman from Yanbian)

36
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,420
Dad, enjoy the show.

37
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,290
Mom.

38
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,730
You scared me.

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,300
(Notice of electric service termination)

40
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,070
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,010
My phone had no signal,
so I couldn't call.

42
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,280
Why isn't your phone getting a signal?

43
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,910
Give me your phone.

44
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,850
Please, don't bother
and worry about yourself.

45
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,650
Why are you going in?
I have to head out.

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,460
My goodness, look at this mess.

47
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,590
Jeez.

48
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,630
You've been messing around
with this acting stuff.

49
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,730
Unbelievable.

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,100
Are you still on sleeping pills?

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,970
Wait.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,740
These are just vitamins. I stopped.

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,870
Like hell you stopped.

54
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,640
You think I'm a fool?

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,410
Good grief.

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,910
I was out of my mind to let you
drop out of a perfectly good college...

57
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,780
just because you complained
it wasn't for you. Who else can I blame?

58
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,090
If you keep living like this
with those sleeping pills,

59
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,720
your life is going to go down the drain
before you know it, understand?

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,890
Mom.

61
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,290
Did I ever ask you
to approve of my acting?

62
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,860
Besides,

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,000
I've got a show tonight.

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,400
Have you ever come to see
your daughter perform, even once?

65
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,870
You threw away that bright future
ahead of you...

66
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,070
and now live like this.
That's why I'm telling you this.

67
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,680
Bright future? Don't make me laugh.

68
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,680
And what kind of life are you living, Mom?

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,650
Your life
without ever having a dream is...

70
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,420
more pathetic than mine.

71
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,890
You know that?

72
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,830
(Director jerk)

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,530
The costume team will drop the clothes off
in Dongmyo.

74
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,230
Bring a bag with you, something sturdy.

75
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,200
You're really going to pay me
this time, right?

76
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,600
Today's tough.

77
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,240
I just paid rent,
and I've got nothing left.

78
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,410
I'll pay you
when the money comes in later.

79
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,140
I got fooled again.

80
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,690
Then I can't just hand it over to you
for free.

81
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,090
(Phone repair, used phones)

82
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,590
What kind of phone do you want?

83
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,200
- Anything's fine.
- Anything?

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,730
All right then.

85
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,570
Excuse me.

86
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,740
I left it there. Just take it.

87
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,440
Ta-da.

88
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,610
It's a prepaid plan, okay?

89
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,450
Look, let me explain.

90
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,480
Here's prepaid 350,

91
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,320
and prepaid 450.
If you use it on H or G network...

92
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,290
A criminal ring
running a voice phishing scam...

93
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,220
based in a Shandong apartment
has been caught by police.

94
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,390
According to the voice phishing crime unit
at the Seongan Police Agency,

95
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,500
they were mostly people in their 20s
and 30s struggling to find job,

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,600
who fell for job ads about easy money...

97
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,470
and ended up joining the scheme.

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,870
Let's verify
your personal information.

99
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,770
Names?

100
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,480
Ye Won Joo.

101
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
Park Dae Hee.

102
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,810
Kang Han Gu.

103
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,880
Min Sang Gi.

104
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,310
You all sound amazing.

105
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,220
Did you all take vocal lessons
together somewhere?

106
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,550
If so, tell me.
I might have to check it out too.

107
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,120
What's so funny? I'm serious.

108
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm actually almost perfect,

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,330
except for one flaw.

110
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,230
What is it?

111
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,500
Maybe it's my voice,

112
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,230
but no matter how many times
I tell them to stop,

113
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,470
they just won't listen.

114
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,610
So that's on me, right?

115
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,250
I see.

116
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,350
Nice to see you again, Detective.

117
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,060
It's not like you're performing
at some annual idol group event.

118
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,460
So, is this a year-end greeting?

119
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,430
It's a New Year's greeting.

120
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,700
Detective. Happy New Year.

121
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,830
May you live a long life with illness,

122
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,100
no, I mean, a long life in good health.

123
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,610
Detective Park.

124
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,680
I just got some intel.

125
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,050
The Ilseong clan are in Korea.

126
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,620
You mean Team Leader Park Min Su
from Daehwan Loan Services?

127
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,690
Exactly.

128
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,620
Looks like the ringleader...

129
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,430
has sneaked in himself
because of the drug deal.

130
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,330
Wait, he came himself,
without sending his underlings?

131
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,000
So they must have some connection.

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,070
For some reason, the Chinese police...

133
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,410
won't cooperate much regarding them.

134
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,810
No matter how much we bribe
and sweet-talk them.

135
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,110
And yet,

136
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,750
they just decided to come to Korea?

137
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,220
What did the higher-ups say?

138
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,890
They say leave them alone.

139
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,420
What?

140
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,890
Apparently, stirring the hornet's nest
won't do any good.

141
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,860
They're tied to some political big shot.

142
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,860
That's not how it should be.

143
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,530
If they have political connections,

144
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,600
their crimes get erased?

145
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,070
Just leave them alone.

146
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,100
This isn't a request.
It's an order from above.

147
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,070
Still...

148
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,840
Fine.

149
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,110
What good comes from
getting on the higher-ups' bad side?

150
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,610
They've never liked me anyway.

151
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,450
Hey.

152
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,550
You graduated from the police academy.

153
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,750
Why are you always acting out?

154
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,190
I'll just...

155
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,020
step out for a smoke.

156
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,590
Anyway, you need to stay put this time.
Got it?

157
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,590
Of course.

158
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,700
It's an order from above.

159
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,880
Hey, Jong Chan.

160
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,650
Contact the traffic investigation unit
for me.

161
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,650
Ma'am.

162
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,650
It's so annoying.

163
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,490
Just think about it.

164
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,490
Can't you do the math?

165
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,630
No, I just need a SIM card.

166
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,730
Give me the cheapest one.

167
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,100
Listen up, ma'am.

168
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,800
You said you have a daughter in China.
Don't you call her?

169
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,340
Well...

170
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,840
Exactly. If you activate the device
and use the G network,

171
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
it's perfect.

172
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,910
My goodness.

173
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,650
Come on, ma'am.

174
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,280
Technically, giving more than
the official subsidy is illegal,

175
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,750
but I'll do it on the side for you.

176
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm even knocking $130 off the device...

177
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,420
by $130 myself.

178
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,790
I'll take care of it all, okay?

179
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,160
Paying in full, okay?

180
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,100
Mom.

181
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,070
I looked everywhere, but you weren't home.

182
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,240
I asked the uncle at the restaurant,
and he didn't know either.

183
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,710
And here you are,
getting played by this low-level punk?

184
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,510
What?

185
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,750
Weren't you here
to pick up some movie props earlier?

186
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,680
Ma'am.

187
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
Is she really your daughter?

188
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Just because someone picks up props
doesn't mean they're Korean.

189
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Mom.

190
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,660
I didn't tell you so I could surprise you.
Surprised?

191
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,030
Gosh, Mom.

192
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,600
I've missed you so much.

193
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,240
Hong Hwa. You came to see me.

194
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,740
Look at you.

195
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,640
With that grumpy face of yours,

196
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,410
how's anyone supposed to like you?

197
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,820
Stop lying.
Just give her the cheapest SIM card.

198
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Chop-chop.

199
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,260
Chop-chop.

200
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,000
Well then.

201
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,430
Thank you so much.

202
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,410
I never thought I'd get help
from another Chinese-Korean.

203
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,970
Where are you from?

204
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm from Longjing.

205
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,750
I'm from Gyeongsang-do.

206
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,310
Gyeongsang-do?

207
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,600
You scared me.

208
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,840
Thank you.

209
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,980
Tell your daughter to treat her mom well.

210
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,020
Seongsu Vocational High School.

211
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,790
Hong Hwa is my son.

212
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,430
I'm living with my son.

213
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,810
(Olim Telecom)

214
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,190
(The Woman from Yanbian)

215
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,120
(So Min Soup and Rice)

216
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,760
Can I spend this Christmas...

217
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,860
with a beautiful lady from Yanbian?

218
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,360
Dad.

219
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,960
Wait, the show is at 6 p.m.
It's coming up soon.

220
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,740
Come and have a hearty soup
before you go.

221
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,040
I can't, I have rehearsal,
I have to go.

222
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,710
I guess there's nothing I can do.

223
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,870
I was going to host an actor
for a meal after a long time...

224
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,110
and get a signature to display
at the restaurant.

225
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,450
Well then,

226
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,720
Break a leg, superstar.

227
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,920
Stop it.

228
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,920
- Bye.
- All right.

229
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,190
Dad, you don't have to come
if you're busy.

230
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,060
Hey.

231
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,660
You can just ask your mom and dad
to come to your show.

232
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,930
See you later, sweetie.

233
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,170
- You got this!
- I got this!

234
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,430
I'm off now.

235
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,070
For the stabbing scene,

236
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,210
should we adjust the timing again?

237
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,480
The director is looking for you,
like, right now.

238
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,580
Is something going on?

239
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,520
Not really.

240
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,420
Then why's he freaking out again?

241
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,990
Hye Dam, you know what they say?

242
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,520
Even a nobleman's servant won't work...

243
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,760
if they won't get paid.

244
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,000
Lee Seung Tae is always like that,
nothing new.

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,960
Really now?

246
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,730
Look over there, buddy.

247
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,640
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,070
Let me know what you'd like to eat,
I'll bring it right to you.

249
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,080
She's collecting what she's owed,
running errands for Lee Seung Tae's wife.

250
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,180
And look over there.

251
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,650
His situation is a bit better.

252
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,480
At least, he landed a small role...

253
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,750
in the crime film the director's making.

254
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,090
But guess what?

255
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,120
No pay whatsoever.

256
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,790
Everyone's scrambling to get
even a bit of the money he swindled.

257
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,430
I'm also collecting the money he owes me.

258
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,730
What?

259
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,660
I stole the bag today.

260
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,130
I'm going to sell everything in the bag.

261
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,500
What?

262
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,670
I wondered why you've been quiet
these days.

263
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,180
What are you going to do?
That's theft.

264
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,640
What do you mean?
Isn't what he did to us the same thing?

265
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,980
So Min.

266
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,980
Where's Ha So Min?

267
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,660
Where's this bitch?

268
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,360
Maybe she's rehearsing?

269
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,760
What's the matter?

270
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,330
I told that crazy bitch

271
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,200
to pick up something,
and she stashed them somewhere.

272
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,270
You're finished today.

273
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,900
Come back safely before the show.

274
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,510
No, what did I do wrong?

275
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,610
You should debut first.

276
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,510
Just thinking about you two going at it,
my head is shaking.

277
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,650
Grab it.

278
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,210
Then today,

279
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,780
- it's a solid magnitude eight.
- Come on, So Min.

280
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,720
Don't push me. Why do I have to go?

281
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,820
- Get out.
- I'm not going.

282
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,860
- Gyu Jong.
- Yes, sir.

283
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Do you know why this tiny thing
can be useful?

284
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,730
I don't know, sir.

285
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,940
It shows people at their lowest.

286
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,110
This tiny powder can make
the clever idiot,

287
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,240
and good people turn into scum,

288
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,880
right into criminals.

289
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,520
Jeez.

290
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,960
I can't stay away from Korea
because I miss this smell.

291
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,100
The 6 p.m. show is starting now.

292
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,230
Let me check your tickets on this side.

293
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,160
Hello?

294
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,070
When are you coming?
The show's starting now.

295
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,700
Why are you being so annoying?

296
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,110
Come on.

297
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,810
Who cares about the bouquet?
It's the show that matters.

298
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,140
It would've been great
if you bought it ahead of time.

299
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,250
Hello?

300
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,480
Once the show starts, you can’t get in.

301
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,920
So you need to hurry.

302
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,590
What are you saying?

303
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,820
It keeps acting up.

304
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,830
Let's see. Let's go.

305
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,900
(Price $70)

306
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,160
(Price $60)

307
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,730
Are you looking
for any particular flowers?

308
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,940
I'm just looking for something
for my daughter.

309
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,770
Is it for her birthday?

310
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,140
No, it's not.

311
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,510
Let me pick something for you.

312
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,440
What's the occasion?

313
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,010
My daughter's performing in a play.

314
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,280
She's playing the lead.

315
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,020
Your daughter's an actress?

316
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,360
If she takes after you,
no wonder she's got the lead role.

317
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,590
My goodness.

318
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,960
Wow.

319
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,030
Are these camilias?

320
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,600
So beautiful.

321
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,540
They're very popular in winter.

322
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,910
Want me to make this into a bouquet?

323
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,710
Yes, one please.

324
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,320
(Police checkpoint)

325
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,550
You idiot, can't you drive better?

326
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,750
- Well, sir.
- What?

327
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,090
There’s a police checkpoint ahead.

328
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,320
What?

329
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,890
Damn it.

330
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,730
What are you doing? Hit the gas.

331
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,370
Cops are everywhere.

332
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,150
Shit, then get out.

333
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,980
Sorry?

334
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,420
Go distract them. Move aside.

335
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,320
What about me?

336
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,790
Come over here.

337
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,060
You idiot, are you counting on me
to save you?

338
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,230
I said get out!

339
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,610
Stop the car.

340
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,550
Stand the car now!

341
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,550
Damn it.

342
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,290
Stupid bastards.

343
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,790
Doors close in one minute.

344
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,170
The show is starting.
Hurry and take your seats.

345
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,880
She's unbelievable.

346
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,920
I'm running late.

347
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,190
Hello?

348
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,860
Why's this acting up again?

349
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,330
I'm already late.

350
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,700
It's okay.

351
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,740
I'm right here.

352
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,510
Chang Ok, you got citizenship
thanks to me,

353
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,520
have a baby,

354
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,650
stay fed,

355
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,820
and even have a house.

356
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,720
But...

357
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,990
what's with all the complaints?

358
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,760
I give you money regularly,
yet you still act like a bitch!

359
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,900
Bitch?

360
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,510
I'm late.

361
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,840
My goodness.

362
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,050
What the heck?
This is unbelievable.

363
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,420
What's wrong with this?

364
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,790
Did I ever have something like that
to begin with?

365
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,920
A house,

366
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,830
family,

367
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,760
and country.

368
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,870
When did I ever have any of that?

369
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,270
What?

370
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,500
Let's see if that's true.

371
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,680
You psycho jerk!

372
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,580
That bastard, this thing is pricey.

373
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,300
What the hell? I have no time for this.

374
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,010
Hey.

375
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,480
Damn it.

376
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,720
I've got bad luck all over me.

377
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,330
Damn it.

378
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,340
Damn it.

379
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,050
That scared the hell out of me!

380
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,690
My daughter...

381
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,460
got her first lead role.

382
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,300
I...

383
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,440
I have to go.

384
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,240
I have to be there.

385
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,210
Crap.

386
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,480
What kind of bullshit is that?
What does that have to do with me?

387
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,080
Please.

388
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,090
Hold on.

389
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,360
Lady.

390
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,920
Your voice is quite convincing.

391
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,890
Right?

392
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,630
Awesome!

393
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,110
Perfect acting!

394
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,640
Damn, she's heavy.

395
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,020
Lady, get some rest.

396

(The Woman from Yanbian)

397
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,670
Ta-da.

398
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,640
What?

399
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,410
I'm officially a dad of an actress now.

400
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,450
I’m the dad
with the most gorgeous daughter.

401
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,850
- I'm embarrassed. Stop it.
- Why?

402
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,390
I came with your mom,

403
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,490
but in the middle...

404
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,260
Hang on. Let me call her.

405
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,660
How far has she gone?

406
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,870
Why isn't she picking up?

407
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,700
Answer the phone.

408
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,800
Never mind.

409
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,870
I'm telling you.
She went to buy some flowers.

410
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,140
She may sound cold,

411
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,580
but she's been dying to see you on stage.

412
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,950
She always talks about you to customers
at our shop.

413
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,820
She just can't stop talking about you,

414
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,890
so I have to stop her all the time.

415
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,790
Dad.

416
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,990
What?

417
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,720
Don't try so hard.

418
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,060
No, it's not that. It's true.

419
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,360
You aren't going? I'm hungry.

420
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Wait.

421
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,870
Mom will be here soon.
Let's just wait a bit.

422
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
- If you don't want to, I'll just go.
- Wait.

423
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,270
Seriously.

424
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,950
Take care of the car
and go fetch Gyu Jong.

425
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,960
If the cops catch him,
it's going to be a headache.

426
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,320
Yes, sir.

427
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,330
I almost forgot.

428
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,640
Lady, it's time to wake up.

429
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,680
Wake up.

00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,520

- Three times.

There we go.

440

- Let's see.
- That worked.

441
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,390
See, the SOS alert gets sent to me.

442
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,530
That's amazing.

443
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,800
Keep this in mind...

444
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,030
and in an emergency, press it
quickly three times.

445
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,370
Okay.

- No, thanks.
- Please take a look at this.

- Excuse me.

Hello?

00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,650
Go ahead, sir.

458
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,020
I saw the person you're looking for.

459
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,860
You saw my wife? Where?

460
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,990
It'd be no fun
if I just told you for free.

461
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,260
Come to where I am.

462
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,900
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.
Where is that?

464
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,170
Give it here.

Hello?

466
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,110
Why would you just hang up like that?
They might have really seen her.

467
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,310
It's already been a week
since she disappeared.

468
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,940
Yet...

469
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,310
why do you keep falling for it?

470
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,050
This one might actually be real.

471
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,620
Don't just believe it
unless you actually hear Mom's voice.

472
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,860
Are there any flyers left?

473
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,660

474
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,970

She was last seen
at the flower shop, right?

483
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,700
We checked the cars parked nearby,

484
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,170
but the dashcams were off.

485
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,370
What about location tracking?

486
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,470
Ms. Kim Mi Yang is listed as a runaway,

487
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,880
so there's no legal ground to track her.

488

489
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,250

490

And yet she's considered a runaway?

491

That's what the law says.

492
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,190
That's the law.

I told you to stay out of trouble,
and you did it anyway?

496
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,070
This time, you used a DUI checkpoint
as an excuse to head to the scene?

You crazy idiot!

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,070

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,910
I swear I genuinely went out to help.

500
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,210
How was I supposed to know...

501
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,250
the ringleader would pop up...

502
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,810

503
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,550
You think I don’t know you?

504
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,220
The commissioner’s going ballistic
about this.

505
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,020

Calm down
and tell me exactly what happened.

I'm sorry about that.

to take her to the hospital.

00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:47,980
Are you sure...

550
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,220
Are you sure she's my wife?

551
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,880
You can talk to her.

552
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,190
Honey.

553
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,520
Honey.

554
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:02,960
Honey.

555
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,030
Where exactly did you get hurt?

556
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,930
How did that happen?

557
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,040
I was buying flowers
near Seongnae intersection.

558
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,240
Mi Yang.

559
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,010
Right, just to be safe,

560
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,910
what happens if you call the police?

561
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,670
Please, sir.

562
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,080
I swear

563
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,880
I will never call the police, not ever.
Please...

564
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,980
just let my wife...

565
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,450
come home alive. I beg you, sir.

566
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,290
Okay, now we're talking.

567
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,990
So what's your offer?

568
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,670
We haven't seen each other
since college, right?

569
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,510
I still remember when we were training
at the Police Academy,

570
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,680
you were the best at the fitness test
among the freshmen.

571
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,650
When you suddenly dropped out,

572
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,120
I was disappointed.

573
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,990
Looks like you did become a cop.

574
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,160
Yeah.

575
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,190
Right, anyway,

576
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
did something happen to your family?

577
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,670
My mom disappeared.

578
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,700
She disappeared?

579
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,740
When?

580
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,180
A week ago, near
Seongnae Industrial Complex Intersection.

581
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,380
Seongnae Industrial Complex Intersection?

582
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,350
Seongnae Industrial Complex.

583
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,020
When exactly was that?

584
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,820
Around 6 p.m., she was caught on
the security camera...

585
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,320
leaving a flower shop.

586
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,360
A flower shop.

587
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,450
Yes, hello?

588
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,450
Yes, sir.

589
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,050
Yes, I'm almost there.

590
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,860
Right now? I'm out front of Saebit Bank.

591
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,190
Why isn't it coming down?

592
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,190
Yes, I'll come up right now.

593
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,500
(My wife)

594
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,040
Hold on, I'm almost there.s

595
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,100
Give me a moment.

596
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,040
Hold on!

597
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,410
Move as fast as you can...

598
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,910
and get the OTP card first.

599
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,020
If the money isn't in by 4:10 p.m.
like we agreed,

600
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,520
we'll take care of your wife.

601
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,760
Yes, understood.

602
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,890
If you set the OTP limit to the max,

603
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,600
you can send up to $100,000
per transaction and $500,000 a day.

604
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,770
You haven’t made
any big transactions recently.

605
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,270
Why do you want to raise the limit?

606
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,600
For my wife.

607
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
For my wife's surgery.

608
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,110
Have you ever gotten a call from someone
pretending to be the prosecutor’s office,

609
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,740
the police,
or the Financial Supervisory Service?

610
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,980
No, I haven't.

611
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,110
Did anyone ask you to withdraw money?

612
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,980
No, it's nothing like that.

613
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,150
I'm allowed to take out my own money!
I haven't done anything wrong.

614
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,660
Why are you holding up
when I’ve got no time?

615
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,630
I’m in a rush,
please process this quickly.

616
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,030
Please, I'm begging you.

617
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,130
(Saebit Bank)

618
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,230
($50,000 sent)

619
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,640
(Enter OTP code)

620
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,770
Hello?

621
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Yes, I just sent it.

622
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,880
What do I do next?

623
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,380
Wait at home until I call you back.

624
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,310
Wait a second.

625
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,850
What if you don't call me?

626
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,120
What if my wife just disappears?

627
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,850
Please promise me.

628
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,520
Promise me you'll bring her back safe.

629
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,490
Okay, I'll call you at 6 p.m. sharp.
Be ready to come out.

630
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,860
Hello?

631
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,240
(Missing Person)

632
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,180
This lady bought the flower that day.

633
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,080
Was it...

634
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,650
this one?

635
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,950
That's right, camellia leaves.

636
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,890
She really loved this flower.

637
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,190
You still haven't found her yet, right?

638
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,670
The car I was chasing...

639
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,270
passed the crash site...

640
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,040
and the time your mom walked there...

641
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,240
from the flower shop...

642
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,650
pretty much line up.

643
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,980
Then...

644
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,680
There’s still nothing certain yet.

645
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,960
(My wife)

646
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,100
Hello?

647
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,970
Honey.

648
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,730
Honey.

649
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,770
Are you almost here?

650
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,670
I'll come pick you up. Where are you?

651
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,440
No, I can't get out of here.

652
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,910
Forever.

653
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,340
What?

654
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,850
I had no idea you were this loaded.

655
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,720
This gentleman will put it to good use.

656
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,440
(Mom)

657
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,270
Looks like they switched the caller ID
using a manipulator device.

658
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,810
Tell your dad if you get him on the line.

659
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,110
Tell him never to pick up calls
coming from your mom's number.

660
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,880
Let's hurry home first.

661
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,590
I wanted to hear our daughter's voice
one last time.

662
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,650
I guess I can't.

663
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,920
Who are you?

664
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,820
Me.

665
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,260
It's me, honey.

666
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,360
This deep-voice thing is
pretty impressive.

667
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,130
Things are sure getting easier these days.

668
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,140
You fraud.

669
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,970
Where's my wife?

670
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,410
Beats me. Where would she be by now?

671
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,440
You bastard!

672
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,910
I'll have you thrown in jail, you bastard!

673
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,780
I think you're the one
who's going to hear that now.

674
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,820
From now on,

675
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,560
a flood of lawsuits is coming your way.

676
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,320
(Ha Hyun Jin's transaction history)

677
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,170
(Saebit Bank account activity)

678
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,800
What is this?

679
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,600
(Saebit Bank account activity)

680
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,510
And this is...

681
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,340
a little gift from me...

682
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,850
as thanks for spending
such a huge amount of money.

683
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,480
(Mr. Ha Hyun Jin, your loan application
has been successfully submitted.)

684

($50,000, 20.9 percent interest rate)

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,990

00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,350
from Daehwan Loan Services.

687
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,250
(Mr. Ha Hyun Jin, your loan application
has been approved.)

688
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,320
($50,000, 20.9 interest rate)

(My wife)

690
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,400
No.

691
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,950
No.

692
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,580
Dad!

693
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,750
Dad!

694
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,960
What are you doing?

695
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,430
So Min, I'm sorry.

696
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,600
I was so stupid.

697
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,400
No, Dad. Hold on.

698
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,570
Dad.

699
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,740
I love you, sweetheart.

700
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,650
Forgive me.

701
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,610
I'm sorry.

702
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,260
Dad.

703
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,140
Someone fell.

704
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,950
Call 911 now.

705
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,350
- Call 911.
- Hello?

706
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,850
Someone just fell.

707
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,080
Please come fast.

708
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,660
(No Mercy)

709
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,830
We're from the Seongan Police Agency,
voice phishing crime unit.

710
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,730
No, wait a minute.

711
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,030
They say you have connections
with a crime syndicate.

712
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,000
Every time I see her,
she's got the same outfit on.

713
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,200
Who are you?

714
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,800
Why are you pretending to be my mom?

715
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,940
Based on your dad's phone records,

716
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,270
we've confirmed
that your mom's missing is...

717
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,970
linked with the Ilseong clan.

718
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:24,140
What can I help you?

719
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,310
How...

720
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,180
Who are you?

721
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,480
I told you already...

722
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,810
that your mom's always by your side.

723
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,550
I borrowed your mom.

724
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,420
I'm going to kill you.

725
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,650
Where are they going?

726
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,050
It's orders from higher-ups.

727
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,990
Looks like they want to cover this up
as quietly as possible.

728
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,920
Who do I have to go through
to reach the ringleader?

729
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,360
Where's my mom?

730
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,660
Tell me where my mom is!

731
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,830
