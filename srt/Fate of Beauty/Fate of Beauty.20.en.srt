(Nanhu Tavern)

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,820
Everyone,

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,650
all of you are the remaining descendants

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,650
of the Xia'an clan.

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,970
Back then,

7
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,140
the Crown Prince falsely accused

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,730
Mr. Xia'an

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,730
of conspiring with the enemy country

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,540
through letters.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,690
I'll take the responsibility
to gather evidence

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,050
to clear Mr. Xia'an's name.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,970
I humbly request

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,250
your assistance.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,730
Yes!

(Truth)

17
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,069
Excuse me.

18
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,250
Coming through.

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,149
Thank you.

20
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,060
Fragrant sachets for sale!

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,730
Fragrant sachets for sale!

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,530
The Xia'an clan

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,450
is indeed meticulous and bold.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,300
They have been hiding

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,420
in this marketplace of the capital
over the years.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,069
This is a safe

27
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,300
hiding place.

28
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,170
I've been here since I was a kid.

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,010
They're like my family.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,559
Look,

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,239
Madam Liu makes the best sugarplums.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,119
Later,

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,730
I'll buy some for you.

34
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,770
Hurry.

35
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,160
Coming.

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,610
Look over there.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,210
There's a rouge store.

38
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,860
The seller is a man.

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,629
Mr. Zhao may have a strict face,

40
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,429
in fact,

41
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,170
he's whipped.

42
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,189
That store

43
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,860
is actually run by Mrs. Zhao.

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,380
I don't even

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,420
have a chance to be whipped.

46
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,799
Shall we try it?

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,990
Really? Let's go.

48
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,170

You want to break off the engagement?

79
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,900
I'm no longer the legitimate elder son
of the General's Residence.

80
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,980
I don't deserve Her Highness.

81
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,780

do you think I'll let you off?

84
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,860
I made this decision

85
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,340
after considering from your angle,
Your Highness.

86
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,170
If I were to marry Her Highness,

87
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,050

91
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,780
No, I'll break off the engagement.

92
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,130
I don't want you!

96
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,660
I've treated you like my own son.

97
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,039
I can't believe you would frame me

98
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,860
for your personal fame and gain.

99
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,919
Do you think

100
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,300
the Crown Prince will value you then?

101
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,170
You're a traitor!

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,100
Scoundrel!

103
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,220
Godfather,

104
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,420
concerning our deep bond,

105
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,900
I'll give you a quick death.

106
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,810
Xiao Yeting,

107
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,900
you failed my daughter.

108
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,980
Burn it down.

109
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,540

110
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,500
(over these years,)

111
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,749
(I've tried means and ways)

112
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,690
(to make myself stronger)

113
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,200
(so that I'm powerful enough
to fight against the Crown Prince)

114
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,780
(and demand justice
for the Xia'an clan.)

115
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,380
(I only found out
that Le was still alive.)

116
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,570
(For the rest of my life,)

117
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,319
(For the rest of my life,
I'll protect her)

118
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,540
(even at the cost of my safety.)

119
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,440
(Great Virtues Endure)

120
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:33,850
Yanping?

121
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,620
Are you surprised

122
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,050
why I'm here?

123
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,330
Because I know you well.

124
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,780
Whenever you feel down,

125
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,850
you'd come here
to pay your respects to these traitors

126
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,500
and mourn your Xia'an Le.

127
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,540
Don't call them traitors.

128
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,380
We both know

129
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,540
it was the Crown Prince
who framed Mr. Xia'an.

130
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,660
Don't think I don't know

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,170
you pledged your loyalty

132
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,500
to my brother

133
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,570
and betrayed Xia'an

134
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,090
because you realized

135
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,570
the Xia'an clan was past help.

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,210
Back then,

137
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,420
you planned

138
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,050
to secretly keep Xia'an Le alive

139
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,669
while you handled

140
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,210
the Xia'an Clan, didn't you?

141
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,660
How did you know about that?

142
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,780
Were you behind

143
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,810
Le's death?

144
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,050
Did you set
the Xia'an Residence on fire?

145
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,330
Yeting.

146
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,450
What are you trying to do?

147
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,660
Answer me.

148
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:07,008
You're the man I chose.

149
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,839
I couldn't allow

150
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,999
your fiancee to live

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,660
in this world.

152
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,970
You must hate me now.

153
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,140
I hate myself, too.

154
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,050
I was too young

155
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,789
to understand that the living

156
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,500
can never compete with the dead.

157
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,620
Even though we're engaged,

158
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,810
I know

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,170
you still remember Xia'an Le.

160
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,090
I learned my lesson this time.

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,850
I didn't plan to kill Ban Meng.

162
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,300
I only used a little trick

163
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,620
to let you fall out of love with her.

164
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,540
It's your fault.

165
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,140
You actually break off the engagement

166
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,090
because of Ban Meng.

167
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,500
Xiao Yeting, it's you
who brings harm upon her!

168
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,140
What's that supposed to mean, Yanping?

169
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,690
What did you do to Ban Meng?

170
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,450
What did you do to her?

171
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,330
Tell me!

172
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,620
As of now, she should be...

173
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,210
I want to completely remove her

174
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,260
from your heart.

175
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,690
I left something there.

176
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,210
I'll fetch it for you.

177
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,420
Hyah!

178
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,050
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

179
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,319
What's going on?

180
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,260
Hyah!

181
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,430
