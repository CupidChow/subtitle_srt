00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,500
(Yeting,)

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,900
(I can give you anything you want,)

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,940
(but)

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,450
(I only want Ban Meng.)

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,260
(Xiao Yeting,)

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,180
(I told you)

8
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,410
(I only want Ban Meng.)

9
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,410
(Why are you taking her away from me?)

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,260
Young Master,

11
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,820
we found it.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,500
Go on.

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,789
Miss Ban Meng isn't poisoned,

14
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,730
it's the Gu.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,380
=Episode 14=
(Trapped Beast)

16
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,140
It hurts, Grandmother.

17
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,980
My dear Ran.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,370
Xiao Yeting

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,250
is so cruel.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,349
How could he do this

21
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,140
to his blood brother?

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,220
Grandmother,

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,010
it may not

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,010
be Yeting.

25
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,340
Perhaps

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,949
there's a misunderstanding.

27
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,060
Misunderstanding?

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,810
There can't be any misunderstanding.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,349
If you're really crippled,

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,860
let alone being a general,

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,980
you wouldn't be able
to become an official.

32
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,759
Xiao Yeting

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,530
is indeed cunning.

34
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,610
Grandmother,

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,650
perhaps

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,980
Yeting did this for my own good.

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,839
He's trying to train me.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,370
Stop defending that scoundrel.

39
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,010
He wants to ruin your future.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,330
I must seek justice for you.

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,660
Grandmother.

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,749
Don't move.

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,770
Lie still.

44
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,980
Grandmother,

45
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,730
you can't make a scene out of this.

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,420
Father might find out about this.

47
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,210
Father cares about you very much.

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,839
If he finds out

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,100
you fall sick because of this,

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,490
he won't forgive Yeting.

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,420
Right.

52
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,429
I have to

53
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,170
make a scene

54
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,980
and let your father know.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,170
Chun Xiang,

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,820
inform General

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,380
that I'm sick.

58
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,279
Grandmother.

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,660
Grandmother, don't go.

60
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,050
Grandmother.

61
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,610
Grandmother...

62
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,519
As you predicted,

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,670
First Young Master will be driven out.

64
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,660
Did General go to his room

65
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,629
after he woke up?

66
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,610
No.

67
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,679
General didn't even ask
about his condition

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,100
and immediately drove him out?

69
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,309
Where is

70
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,469
First Young Master right now?

71
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,010
He has been kneeling
in the ancestral hall since he woke up.

72
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,010
Something's wrong.

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,930
According to our plan,

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,490
General should be confronting him

75
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,010
in his room right now.

76
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,170
Something happened.

77
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,100
Second Young Master is injured.

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,359
Second Young Master is injured?

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,490
Where?

80
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,309
His leg.

81
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,890
It bleeds a lot.

82
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,170
This is strange.

83
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,149
General was furious
and drove First Young Master out.

84
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,100
He said that he's an ungrateful son
and that he hurt his own brother.

85
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,839
(Old Mrs. Xiao also found out
about that)

86
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
(and scolded General.)

87
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
(She even hired three famous physicians
in the middle of the night)

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,930
(to treat Second Young Master.)

89
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,309
Faster.

90
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,050
All right.

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,010
I'm here.

92
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,239
The water is here.

93
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,540
Give it to her.

94
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,909
No.

95
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,730
Give it to me.

96
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,770
All right.

97
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,660
Hurry up.

98
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,780
Quick.

99
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,020
The water is here.

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,250
Bring this out.

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,799
Give it to me.

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,540
Why are you standing here? Go on.

103
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,690
Where's the medicine?

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,780
Coming.

105
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,309
I hate archery.

106
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,660
I don't want to practice anymore.

107
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,340
I want to quit.

108
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,900
Muran,

109
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,540
hate won't help.

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,020
It only frustrates you

111
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,420
and disrupts your mind.

112
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,370
I know

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,690
you hate me

114
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,159
and my mother.

115
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,570
Hate won't help.

116
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,810
It only frustrates you

117
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,250
and disrupts your mind.

118
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,340
(Tell someone to inform Mu Xiaoran)

119
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,780
(that Miss Ban Meng has been abducted.)

120
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,050
(Send two men to follow him)

121
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,810
(and find a chance)

122
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,460
to break his legs.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,580
(How could I have done that to Muran?)

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,810
I want only Ban Meng.

125
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,810
(Xiao Yeting,)

126
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,050
(when it comes to cruelty,)

127
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,370
(you don't stand a chance.)

128
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,652
Everyone in the residence

129
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,460
is avoiding me now.

130
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,860
What are you doing here?

131
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,020
Are you here to laugh at me?

132
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,020
I came to change the dressing for you.

133
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,170
Don't move.

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,500
Why are you helping me

135
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,330
after what I've done to you?

136
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,900
It's all in the past.

137
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,170
