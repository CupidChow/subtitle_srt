You're the last thing I want to see.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,860
What a way to ruin my day.

5
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,010
Bring a woman to me?

6
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,860
Do you think
I'll pretend nothing has happened

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,229
when you bring a woman here?

8
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,220
Your Highness,

9
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,010
you'll be interested

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,940
in this woman.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,090
Her name

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,700
is Xia'an Le.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,580
Didn't I tell you no survivors?

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,450
How dare you keep her alive?

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,370
Why?

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,610
You're trying to threaten me?

17
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,370
I just want to remind you

18
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,700
that back then,

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,730
I did you

20
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,530
a great favor.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,810
A great favor?

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,250
A great favor, you say?

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,370
Some random lackey can do that, too!

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,149
If it weren't

25
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,999
for my silly sister begging me,

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,940
I wouldn't have chosen you.

27
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,530
I was young and ignorant

28
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,700
to slander Mr. Xia'an.

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,010
But I did that

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,170
for your sake, Your Highness.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,490
If His Majesty finds out
that you formed your own clique,

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,700
I wonder

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,820
what he will think.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,730
You think

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,260
you can change anything or

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,010
her?

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,610
This is hilarious.

38
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,260
Why do you think you can bring me down?

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,399
Our people

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,380
have already presented the evidence
to His Majesty.

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,660
This is the evidence

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,170
that the Crown Prince slandered
General Xia'an.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,540
His Majesty?

44
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,330
Do you think His Majesty will believe me

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,279
or your so-called evidence?

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,610
You want to frame the Crown Prince?

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,100
If this is proven untrue,

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,540
you'll be executed.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,189
Do you think

50
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,820
I would tell my old man

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,860
that I set up

52
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,189
against General Xia'an

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,679
because I want to secure my position

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,140
and eliminate enemies?

55
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,210
You!

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,010
He's not only the Crown Prince

57
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,170
(Evidence)
but also my son.

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,700
If he really did this,

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,930
I

60
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,260
would not defend him.

61
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,050
Well,

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,610
I'll do you a favor.

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,820
I'll help you two

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
to become a pair of lovebirds

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,210
in hell.

66
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,890
Hold on.

67
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,269
If I hadn't heard this,

68
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,069
I would've still believed

69
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,610
you were loyal to His Majesty.

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,119
Miss Xia'an,

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,039
it's been tough for you

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,690
over these years.

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,559
Mr. Xiao Muran has already
reported everything

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,629
to His Majesty.

75
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,629
By decree of His Majesty,

76
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,860
from today onwards,

77
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,069
the Crown Prince is not allowed
to step out of his quarters

78
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,220
and must cooperate with the investigation
of General Xia'an's treason.

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Who has such audacity
to lay your finger on me?

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,420
I'm the Crown Prince.

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,980
If this is what you ask for,

82
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,570
I'll give it to you.

83
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,860
Muran.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,779
What's going on?

85
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,819
He's bleeding.

86
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,500
All right. Enough said.

87
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,370
It seems you truly love her.

88
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,490
If so,

89
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:35,023
I have no worries now.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,599
This is the evidence

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,780
that the Crown Prince
slandered Mr. Xia'an.

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,420
I give it to you as your wedding gift.

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,980
Yeting.

94
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,690
Are you afraid of death?

95
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,300
How about we have a round?

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,220
No matter who loses this time,

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,370
we all will die.

98
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,930
This time,

99
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,020
we must win.

100
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,690
You!

101
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,039
You!

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,420
Don't you dare touch me!

103
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,690
I'm the Crown Prince!

104
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,610
I want to see Father!

105
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,460
I want to see Father!

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,189
I want to see Father!

107
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,460
What do you think you're doing?

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,679
Let go of my brother.

109
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,119
Help...

110
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,269
- Brother!
- Help me, Yanping!

111
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,570
- Let go of him!
- Yanping!

112
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,570
Help me!

113
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,610
Xia'an Le,

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,730
you should've died long ago.

115
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,189
Yeting.

116
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,170
Yeting.

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,860
Yeting.

118
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,980
Yeting.

119
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,810
Yeting.

120
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,490
Let go of me.

121
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,540
Yeting!

122
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,980
Let go of me!

123
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,460
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,980
I didn't know

125
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,810
my Le

126
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,300
had grown

127
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,460
into a pretty lady.

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,540
I've given you

129
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,460
everything you want.

130
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,130
As for what I owed
Godfather and Godmother,

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,930
I'll repay them

132
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,380
when I see them

133
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,020
down there.

134
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,300
You can't die.

135
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,930
Xiao Yeting, I won't allow you to die.

136
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,930
If I meant to kill you,

137
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,040
I would've done it when we first met.

138
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,960
I can only make you suffer
as much as possible

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,780
if you stay alive.

140
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,260
Wear...

141
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,420
Wear it,

142
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,500
so

143
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,300
I

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,780
will

145
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,380
not
