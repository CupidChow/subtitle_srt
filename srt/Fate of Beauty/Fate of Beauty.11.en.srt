=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,110
I won't let you marry him.

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,780
=Episode 11=
(Out of Control)

4
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,509
First Young Master,

5
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,040
is this all you can do?

6
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,290
Have you not decided

7
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,930
what to do next?

8
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,250
Does this kiss feel familiar to you?

9
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,930
So this is what you're after.

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,120
To provoke me

11
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,330
and make me care about you.

12
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
You're overestimating yourself.

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,490
Who on earth are you?

14
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,309
Why can't I control myself

15
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,000
whenever I see you?

16
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,840
Did you cast some spell on me?

17
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
You're right.

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,560
I did cast a Gu on you.

19
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,760
Are you trying to make me
fall in love with you?

20
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,770
You're not worthy of me.

21
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,090
Does my brother deserve you then?

22
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,400
He's way better than you.

23
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,480
Don't force me.

24
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,280
First Young Master,

25
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,280
can't you go any further?

26
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,400
What do you expect from me?

27
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,359
The way you look at me

28
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,650
is full of hatred and contempt.

29
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,280
Have we met before?

30
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,799
Let me leave,
and I'll pretend nothing happened.

31
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,530
Stop telling me you want to leave!

32
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,149
There's a voice inside me telling me

33
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,440
that I can't let you leave.

34
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
Where do you want to go?

35
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,000
To marry Xiao Muran?

36
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,720
Can't I?

37
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,090
Since you've made your choice,

38
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,490
why did you mess with me?

39
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,320
First Young Master,

40
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,080
did you get the wrong idea?

41
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,000
Is this a wrong idea, too?

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
This bead

43
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,640
is a gift from
an old acquaintance of mine.

44
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,320
However,

45
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,440
I repaid what I owed to him

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,320
a few days ago.

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,080
First Young Master,

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
are you actually in love
with your future sister-in-law?

49
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,810
Who's there?

50
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,069
First Young Master,

51
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,200
it's urgent.

52
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,170
What's the matter?

53
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,320
This letter says there'll be an assassination
on General during tomorrow's hunt.

54
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,629
Should we

55
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,200
show this to General?

56
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,490
Burn it.

57
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,200
Do you think

58
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,880
this letter is fake?

59
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,170
Tomorrow,

60
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,730
in case there's an assassin attempt,

61
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,160
you set up an ambush
at the hunting ground in advance.

62
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,000
But I want you
to send a few more assassins.

63
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,320
By then,

64
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,350
I'll save my father.

65
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,640
Understood.

66
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
You'll do the assassination tomorrow.

67
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,320
Aim for my left shoulder.

68
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,200
It's close to the heart.

69
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
The closer, the better.

70
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,480
Don't worry, First Young Master.

71
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,170
By the way,

72
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,520
inform Xiao Muran

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,610
that Miss Ban Meng has been abducted.

74
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,520
Tell him to come to rescue her

75
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,170
tomorrow morning.

76
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,120
Yes.

77
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,000
Also,

78
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,560
send two people to follow him

79
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,320
and find a chance

80
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,730
to break his legs.

81
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,730
Yes.

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,250
You're planning

83
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,850
to hurt your blood brother?

84
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
Isn't that someone like me

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,610
using other lives

86
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,880
as my stepping stone?

87
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,680
You!

88
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,410
I wonder if my lovesick brother

89
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,000
will come to save you.

90
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,930
You're despicable.

91
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,120
Aren't you afraid
that I tell him your plan?

92
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,760
A crippled man

93
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,930
can't either be a general

94
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,410
or a civil official.

95
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,250
He can only spend all his life in despair

96
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,760
with no power or influence.

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,080
Even if you tell him about it,

98
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,250
he can't do anything to me.

99
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,970
Don't look at me like that.

100
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,850
I hate it.

101
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,040
You!

102
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,490
Should I change the order right now?

103
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,090
I don't want his legs

104
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
but his life.

105
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,120
Ban Meng.

106
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,239
Ban Meng,

107
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,359
I have good news.

108
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,490
My father agreed.

109
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,490
Ban Meng.

110
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,370
No!

111
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,950
(If you want to save Ban Meng,
come to redeem her alone tomorrow.)

112
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,450
(The entire plan)

113
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,490
(is still on track.)

114
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,800
(Xiao Yeting has fallen out
with his family as planned.)

115
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,570
(But)

116
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,610
(why do I feel)

117
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,280
(so restless?)

118
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,000
(If you get into trouble)

119
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,920
(in the future,)

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,970
(feel free to come to me.)

121
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,690
(I'll do)

122
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,619
(my best)

123
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,669
(General's Residence)

124
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,800
(to fulfill your request.)

125
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,549
(Why haven't you left yet?)

126
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,920
(I'll leave after you fall asleep.)

127
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,690
(This time,)

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,450
(I want to follow my heart.)

129
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,970
I want to marry you.

130
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,520
Xiao Muran,

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,210
