=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,670
(Have you ever noticed)

3
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,120
(Brother.)

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,200
(that the treasures you held
in your hands as a child)

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,030
(Where are you?)

6
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,710
(are now worthless?)

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,070
(Maybe one day,)

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,470
(you, who were once the apple
of someone's eye,)

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,390
(who were treated like a treasure...)

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,240
(I bought you a hairpin.)

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,430
(Put it on)

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,470
(so I won't lose you.)

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,150
(Will become)

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,230
(worthless someday.)

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,220
=Episode 2=
(Old Friend)

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,310
(This is a child-mother Gu.)

17
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,190
(The person who has been
planted with the Child Gu)

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,350
(will become infatuated with you.)

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
(Remember,)

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,680
(if you want to plant the Child Gu,)

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,120
(you have to plant it
on the neck of the person)

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,950
(when he's defenseless.)

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,200
I didn't know
you were Young Master Xiao.

24
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,776
I'm sorry for being disrespectful.

25
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,000
They say

26
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,240
flowers are like beauties.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,910
I wonder what kind

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,710
of flowers you like.

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,150
I don't know anything about flowers

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,680
or beauties.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
It seems

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,030
you

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,750
are a paranoid man.

34
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,590
A paranoid man

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,710
has little joy, I suppose.

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
For your grandma's birthday,

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,870
camellias

38
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,310
are the perfect choice.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Camellias are always in bloom.

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,240
Its roots and flowers

41
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,280
can be used as medicine.

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,360
It symbolizes happiness and well-being.

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,970
You don't know much about flowers,

44
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,120
but you have good taste.

45
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,280
My grandmother loves red camellia.

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,840
It's a filial act for me

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,120
to follow her preference.

48
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,870
It's not always wise

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,080
to follow others' preference.

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,470
What do you mean?

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,430
Following others' preference

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
means you have something to ask for.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,030
Isn't it like showing
your weakness to them?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,520
This flower arrangement is called
Sundance and Moonlight.

55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,080
I wish

56
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,430
your grandmother

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,840
longevity.

58
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,750
Young Master Xiao.

59
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,680
Young Master Xiao.

60
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you staring at

61
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,720
so intently?

62
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
Have you done what I asked?

63
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,120
Don't worry, Young Lady.

64
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,190
The flower pots are all set up

65
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,870
for tomorrow's birthday banquet.

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,190
Young Lady.

67
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,680
There's one thing I don't understand.

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
If the target is
First Young Master Xiao,

69
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,200
why did you bring in
Second Young Master Xiao into the trap?

70
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,600
Xiao Yeting is paranoid.

71
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,750
If I ask him to meet me directly,

72
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,510
I'm sure he'll be suspicious.

73
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,600
The only way we can achieve our goal

74
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,600
is if it looks like a chance encounter

75
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,430
without a trace to him.

76
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
(Besides,)

77
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,990
(he doesn't get close to women.)

78
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,430
(If I didn't do this,)

79
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,070
(how could I plant Gu on him?)

80
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
How dare you

81
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,310
put poison in the flowers?

82
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
Yeting wouldn't do that.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
There must be a misunderstanding.

84
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Grandmother, calm down.

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,510
Madam,

86
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,920
you must believe Ting.

87
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,360
He could never have

88
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
put poison in your flowers.

89
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,390
You want me to believe him?

90
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,800
Look how inferior you are.

91
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,870
What kind of good son can you raise?

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,000
Ever since he sent me these flowers,

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,560
I've been covered in rashes.

94
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,510
How dare you

95
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,430
defend him?

96
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,750
Madam, the flower arranger, Miss Ban Meng,
is seeking an audience.

97
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,600
Flower arranger?

98
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
I won't see anyone.

99
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,070
Grandmother,

100
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,750
I've met this flower arranger before.

101
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,240
When did you meet her?

102
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,070
What?

103
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,750
Are you afraid I'm going
to meet this flower arranger?

104
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,270
Let her in.

105
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,070
I'd like to see what you're up to.

106
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,160
Yes, Madam.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,120
Old Mrs. Xiao,

108
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,070
I'm here to apologise.

109
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,480
Did Xiao Yeting order you
to put the poison in the flowers?

110
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,890
It has nothing to do
with First Young Master.

111
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,910
I don't think

112
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,120
you're poisoned,

113
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
you're allergic.

114
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,630
I added yam skins

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,160
to the fertilizer to give the flowers
a brighter glow.

116
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,870
I guess

117
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,390
you're

118
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,150
allergic to yams.

119
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,000
It's true

120
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,910
that my grandmother can't eat yams.

121
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,150
I made

122
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,440
this ointment myself.

123
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,670
I keep it on me all the time.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,960
Once you apply it,

125
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,200
the rash will go away.

126
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,360
Please don't worry, Old Mrs. Xiao.

127
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,840
Grandmother, look.

128
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,630
I'll try it.

129
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,510
Grandmother,

130
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,030
the rash

131
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,390
is really gone.

132
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,030
Looks like

133
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,000
Miss Ban Meng's ointment

134
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,600
really works wonders.

135
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,790
Grandmother,

136
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,240
I'd like to...

137
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,150
Do as you like.

138
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,270
Yesterday,

139
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,910
Grandmother told me

140
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,390
that the General's residence

141
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,000
is in need
of a talented flower arranger.

142
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,630
So,

143
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
Miss Ban Meng,

144
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,120
would you like to work here?

145
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Yes.

146
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,670
Thank you,

147
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,840
Old Mrs. Xiao.
