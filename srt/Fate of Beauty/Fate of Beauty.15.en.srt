Ting,

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,959
I tried the medicine just now.

4
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,260
It's bitter.

5
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,669
Every time when I took medicine,

6
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,050
Mother would give me a sugarplum.

7
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,580
You can try this, too.

8
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,300
It's not bitter now.

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,700
Try one.

10
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,100
=Episode 15=
(In between True Emotions)

11
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,700
You're awake?

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,039
I was trying the medicine just now.

13
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,140
It's bitter.

14
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,839
Every time when I took medicine,

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,709
Mother

16
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,340
would give me a sugarplum,

17
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,399
and the medicine

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,789
wouldn't taste bitter.

19
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,090
You can try this, too.

20
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,050
Who are you?

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,010
I'm Ban Meng.

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,980
Here.

23
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,469
First Young Master,

24
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,100
rest well.

25
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,730
Don't go.

26
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,490
Stay here until I fall asleep.

27
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,050
Are you

28
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,660
very disappointed now?

29
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,020
Everything turns out differently

30
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,780
than you expected.

31
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,130
You didn't expect this, right?

32
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,610
In this residence,

33
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,340
I'm the powerful man now.

34
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,980
I have

35
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,130
all the power and influence.

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,130
Shouldn't you thank me?

37
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,900
If Xiao Yeting

38
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,980
hadn't ended up in this state,

39
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,500
you wouldn't have had a chance

40
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,860
to show him your sincerity.

41
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,490
By the way,

42
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,810
Princess Yanping

43
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,930
is engaged

44
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,860
to Xiao Yeting.

45
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,490
With her personality,

46
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,220
she wouldn't tolerate your existence.

47
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,690
What are you going to do

48
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,340
when that happens?

49
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,130
(Shouldn't you thank me?)

50
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,039
(If Xiao Yeting)

51
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,220
hadn't ended up in this state,

52
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,300
you wouldn't have had a chance

53
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,540
to show him your sincerity.

54
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,690
(If you get into trouble)

55
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,189
(in the future,)

56
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,660
(feel free to come to me.)

57
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,660
(I'll do)

58
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,900
(my best)

59
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,810
to fulfill your request.

60
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,570
(Love)

61
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,119
(is the most wonderful thing)

62
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,660
(in this world.)

63
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,570
(I want to give you
all wonderful things)

64
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,250
(in this world.)

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,679
(You can stay here)

66
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,780
(as long as you want.)

67
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,540
(I just hope)

68
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,719
(you can consider this place)

69
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,340
(as home.)

70
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,780
It's great that you're fine.

71
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,020
Let's go home.

72
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,810
I'm giving you this

73
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,210
to thank you.

74
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,140
Thank me

75
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,420
for not turning my back on you?

76
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,210
Thank you for treating me sincerely.

77
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,570
You must be feeling aggrieved

78
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,170
right now.

79
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
You can't come around

80
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,420
to why General could be so cruel.

81
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,980
At this point,

82
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,970
First Young Master,

83
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,079
you can tell General

84
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,570
what you're thinking.

85
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,450
What do you mean?

86
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,669
Something the sons

87
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,140
say to their father.

88
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,050
Words that come out naturally

89
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,450
without deep consideration.

90
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,570
I have made a grave mistake.

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,090
Apologizing to him now

92
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,850
won't help.

93
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,509
There are many ways

94
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,020
to apologize.

95
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,170
Admitting your fault

96
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,850
is one of them.

97
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,740
Admitting my fault?

98
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,780
He won't listen to
anything I tell him now.

99
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,380
Do you trust me, First Young Master?

100
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,660
I do.

101
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,540
You're injured

102
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,620
because you bet your life on it.

103
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,570
At the same time, you also planned for
the future of the General's Residence.

104
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,090
Right?

105
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,780
To achieve your goal,

106
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,090
first,

107
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,420
be honest with your desires.

108
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,450
Second,

109
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,170
don't compromise.

110
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,479
(General's Residence)

111
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,570
(Don't make excuses)

112
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,140
(when you're facing people in power.)

113
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,780
(What's done can't be undone.)

114
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,140
(You should let him know)

115
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,850
(what you went through
to reach this far.)

116
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,260
Why do you keep helping me?

117
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,740
You care for me,

118
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,930
