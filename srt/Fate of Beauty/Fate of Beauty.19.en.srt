00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,937
=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,860
From what I know about Xiao Yeting,

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,730
he now

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,860
cares deeply about you.

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,370
But to make him fall deeper,

6
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,140
there's someone

7
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,650
between you two.

8
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,010
Do you mean Princess Yanping?

9
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,370
No.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,170
It's you.

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,450
To be more precise,

12
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,980
it's Xia'an Le.

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,780
If Xia'an Le holds a place

14
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,170
in his heart,

15
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,730
he wouldn't

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,500
eliminate the entire Xia army

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,940
for his own gain.

18
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,940
Trust me.

19
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:02,996
=Episode 19=
(Le)

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,060
Trust me.

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,220
Let's go with the plan.

22
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,450
Ban Meng!

23
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,580
Ban Meng.

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,300
Ban Meng,

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,260
what has happened to you?

26
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,890
Why did you leave last night

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,170
without saying a word?

28
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,540
Xiao Muran!

29
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,420
Don't you dare mention last night.

30
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,079
Do you know
what Princess Yanping has done

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,730
to Ban Meng last night?

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,469
She lured Ban Meng into a room
and lit the aphrodisiac incense.

33
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,580
She then sent in a servant.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,730
If I hadn't followed her,

35
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,170
could you imagine

36
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,140
what would've happened?

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,490
I'll give you a surprise.

38
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,239
Your Highness,
what's the surprise you mentioned?

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,660
My maid made a mistake.

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,839
It should be

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,260
in the garden.

42
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,770
Take your medicine,

43
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,890
and rest well.

44
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,980
Everything will be all right.

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,140
If you can't protect her,

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,730
just stay in your place
as a prince consort

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,380
and stop messing with her.

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,170
For what you can't do,

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,540
I will.

50
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,540
It's my fault.

51
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,540
You almost got hurt.

52
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,860
It's not your fault.

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,280
If someone has to be blamed,
it'll be me.

54
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,490
Her Highness has found out

55
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,860
my feelings for you.

56
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,050
How do you feel now?

57
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,930
Do I look

58
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,980
very pale now?

59
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,690
I must get up and wash up.

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,130
I can't let you see this.

61
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,610
You're pretty no matter what.

62
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,730
Ting.

63
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,300
What did you just call me?

64
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,540
Can I call you that,

65
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,780
Ting?

66
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,020
Ting,

67
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,490
where did you go?

68
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,749
Ting,

69
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,050
what's on your mind?

70
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,300
Nothing.

71
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,930
It reminds me of a friend.

72
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,130
That girl

73
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,050
must be lucky.

74
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,460
Ban Meng, is there anything
you want to eat?

75
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,420
I'll buy it for you.

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,860
I want

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,900
red bean soup.

78
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,389
Ting,

79
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,780
I want red bean soup.

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,220
Maybe...

81
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,119
Maybe

82
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,749
we can go for a stroll

83
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,300
after you've done brushing my hair.

84
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,220
Sure.

85
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,719
Le,

86
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,189
there's a mole behind your ear.

87
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,039
Really?

88
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,239
I didn't know that.

89
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,220
Yes.

90
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,170
Feel it.

91
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,100
You're right.

92
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,050
This is your mark.

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,309
It's just a mole.

94
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,540
Why did you give it a fancy name?

95
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,610
It's your mark in my heart.

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,540
I discovered this mole,

97
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,919
so it means

98
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,119
from now on,

99
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,250
you're irreplaceable

100
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,420
in my heart.

101
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,300
Ting,

102
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,540
what's wrong?

103
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,540
(The bead)

104
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,420
(is a gift from an old acquaintance.)

105
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,260
(You can ask him)

106
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,780
(about where to get this bead.)

107
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,050

I only found this.

113
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,930
Where's she?

114
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,500
It's...

115
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,210
