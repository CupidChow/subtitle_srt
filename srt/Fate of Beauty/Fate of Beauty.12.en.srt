(Hesitant)

3
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,740
(General's Residence)

4
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,370
General,

5
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,309
Second Young Master
isn't in his quarters.

6
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,370
He's not there?

7
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,760
Where did he go?

8
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,589
I've searched the entire residence,

9
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,170
but I couldn't find him.

10
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,650
Father,

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,170
let's wait for a little longer.

12
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,250
Perhaps Muran went
to the music parlor last night,

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,450
so he...

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,890
What?

15
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,530
He went to the music parlor
the night before the hunt?

16
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,110
No need to wait for him.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,170
Let's set off now.

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,250
Hyah.

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,480
(Xiao Muran,)

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
(please be safe.)

21
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,040
(Stay alive.)

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,730
(I won't allow you to get hurt.)

23
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,600
(Xiao Muran,)

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,560
(wait for me.)

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,250
Ban Meng!

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,000
Ban Meng.

27
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,090
Ban Meng.

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,440
Where are you, Ban Meng?

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,530
You're surprisingly skilled, mister.

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,239
But unfortunately,

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,160
you'll soon

32
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,050
become a crippled man.

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,490
Muran!

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Run.

35
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,190
Why did you come to save me?

36
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you stupid?

37
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,400
Can't you tell this is a trap?

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,420
Why can't you see through these traps?

39
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,120
Your mother wanted you to be yourself.

40
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,799
Does that mean

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,560
being a fool to you?

42
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,760
It's great that you're fine.

43
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,320
Why are you worrying about me

44
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,000
when you're under attack?

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,850
Because I want to protect you.

46
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,970
I can't let anything happen to you.

47
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,810
Let's go home.

48
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,560
(Go home?)

49
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,970
How did your hand get hurt?

50
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,320
None of your business.

51
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,520
Why are you smiling?

52
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,159
If your legs

53
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,640
get broken,

54
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,930
your mother will be very upset.

55
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,680
You are

56
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,880
the best gift

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,370
my mother gave me.

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,610
Why are you still joking

59
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,490
even at a time like this?

60
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
You're angry

61
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,930
because you're worried about me?

62
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,680
Even if my legs get broken,

63
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,350
today would still be
the happiest day for me.

64
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,200
Stop talking nonsense.

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,410
It's raining heavily.

66
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,440
