=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,740
(Wedding)

3
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
It's bad.

4
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,840
The bride is missing.

5
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,400
Search!

6
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,350
Search through the garden.

7
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,400
I don't believe we can't find her.

8
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,000
Ting,

9
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,680
after tonight,

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,590
I'll be Xiao Muran's wife,

11
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,870
and your sister-in-law.

12
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,480
You shouldn't...

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,070
Don't forget

14
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,200
you're supposed to be mine.

15
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,150
Your body

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
and heart

17
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,310
are all mine.

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,870
My dear,

19
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,400
why did you come so late?

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
Xiao Yeting,

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,430
what are you trying to do?

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,430
She's your sister-in-law now.

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,190
You're so shameless.

24
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,500
=Episode 1=
(A Trap)

25
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,800
(Six months ago)
(What do people really live for?)

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,750
(For dignity,)

27
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,310
(responsibility)

28
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,360
(or love?)

29
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,910
(I live)

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,240
(to wake up from that nightmare.)

31
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,310
(The nightmare began
with this man's intrusion.)

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,800
(Xiao Yeting.)

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,190
What's the point

34
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,590
of keeping you alive?

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,150
(He was betrothed to me as a child,)

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,870
(but he wiped out my entire Xia'an clan
with his own hands.)

37
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,240
(He's paranoid)

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,470
(and ruthless,)

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,870
(but he's very close
to his half-brother,)

40
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,240
(Xiao Muran.)

41
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,710
(Although Xiao Muran is a philanderer,)

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,310
(his heart is soft and kind.)

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,280
(If I want to get close to Xiao Yeting,)

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
(his brother)

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,800
(will be the perfect bridge for me.)

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,150
Young Lady.

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,000
Is the man you're waiting for
really coming today?

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,520
Definitely.

49
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,150
Everything is going according to plan.

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,900
(Fleeting Dreamland)

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,680
Floral fabrics!

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,260
- Scented pouches!
- Floral fabrics are sold here!

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,600
(Fleeting Dreamland)
Scented pouches!

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,640
Is there something else?

55
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,190
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,160
I came to view the flowers,

57
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,590
but I got into your bathroom by mistake.

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,560
I'll be leaving now.

59
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:41,950
Xiao Muran!

60
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,310
(My brother is here.)

61
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,070
Where are you?

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,800
(Oh, no.)

63
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,560
(He asked me to practice my archery
at the shooting range.)

64
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,090
Xiao Muran.

65
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,270
(If he knew I was here...)

66
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,630
Miss,

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,480
can I hide here for a while?

68
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,800
If my brother finds out I'm here,

69
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,680
I'm dead.

70
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,560
Xiao Muran!

71
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,630
(You brat,)

72
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,270
(let's see how long you can hold it in.)

73
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,950
Mister,

74
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,720
have you lost your way?

75
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,240
If you want to look in the water,

76
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,920
I'll call for help.

77
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,120
If someone comes and sees this,

78
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,240
can I

79
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,950
make you

80
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,000
marry me, then?

81
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,680
You're the new flower arranger,
Ban Meng?

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
Looks like you're

83
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,160
looking for me.

84
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,950
I sent someone to order flowers
the day before yesterday.

85
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,390
Tomorrow is my grandmother's
birthday banquet.

86
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,610
So you're the eldest son
of the Xiao family.

87
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,310
Please wait in the anteroom.

88
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,680
You can

89
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
take the flowers today.

90
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,430
Turn around.

91
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,680
I have to get changed.

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,510
Well...

93
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,630
Just now,

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,870
we...

95
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,120
That guy

96
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,390
is my elder brother.

97
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,870
I'm

98
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,720
Xiao Muran.

99
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,240
Thank you

100
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,000
for helping me today.

101
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,680
Don't worry.

102
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
I'll be responsible

103
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,630
for what happened today.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Today,

105
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,870
nothing happened between me and you.

106
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,080
(In order to clear the name
of the Xia'an clan,)

107
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,960
(I'll pay any price.)

108
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,550
This is a child-mother Gu.

109
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,390
The Mother will help
you regain your looks,

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,370
and the Child needs to be planted
on the person you're going to avenge.

111
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,030
But within one year,

112
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,870
if the person who has the Child Gu

113
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,790
doesn't give you his heart,

114
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,240
you'll be poisoned
by the Mother Gu and die.

115
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,360
(Even if I can't reincarnate,)

116
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,360
(if my soul is shattered,)

117
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
(I'll do what I have to do.)

118
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,510
(Your face has been restored.)

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,030
(From now on,)

120
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,320
(your name is)

121
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,030
(Ban Meng.)

122
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,910
(Can't you remember who I am?)

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,960
(I'm your nightmare
for the rest of your life.)
