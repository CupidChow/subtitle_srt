(Aphrodisiac Incense)

3
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,300
Tonight,

4
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,999
I've invited Muran

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,980
and Miss Ban Meng over for dinner.

6
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,230
I'd like to thank you

7
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,749
for looking after Yeting

8
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,580
these days.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,070
I also heard

10
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,559
that Miss Ban Meng,

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,710
you not only helped change the dressing

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,660
for Yeting

13
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,630
but also went above and beyond
to take care of him.

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,150
I truly appreciate your help.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,940
You flatter me, Your Highness.

16
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,070
I was only doing something to help.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,460
As a thank you,

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,070
I'll arrange a marriage for you.

19
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,070
To give you a comfortable life,

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,350
how about marrying a vassal lord?

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,630
- No.
- No.

22
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,820
Why not?

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,740
Yeting?

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,810
They have different statuses.

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,700
It's not appropriate.

26
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,940
You're right, Yeting.

27
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,590
Muran,

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,790
how's your leg?

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,940
It has recovered.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,790
Well, I think

31
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,350
the elder brother has a duty
as a father.

32
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,909
It's natural for the elder brother

33
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,380
to discipline his brothers.

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,149
As his younger brother,

35
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,030
you can't blame him.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,190
Am I right?

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,700
Yes, Your Highness.

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,860
Are you all right?

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,380
How can you be so clumsy?

40
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,350
You might've hurt her.

41
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,660
It's my fault.

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,189
I'll take her

43
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,700
to get changed.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,420
This way, miss.

45
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,980
Please.

46
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,839
Please wait a moment, miss.

47
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,590
I'll bring you new clothes.

48
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,700
Thank you.

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,420
Your Highness,
you could just kill Ban Meng.

50
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,030
Why go through all this trouble?

51
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,660
Killing her is easy.

52
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,679
But to completely remove her

53
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,150
from Xiao Yeting's heart,

54
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,950
he must witness

55
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,100
her hooking up with another man.

56
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
That's the only way to make him
thoroughly disappointed.

57
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,119
I don't want

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,860
my husband

59
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,740
to be hung up on another woman.

60
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,830
You're wise, Your Highness.

61
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,590
This incense

62
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,500
has a strong effect.

63
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,500
Just a whiff of it will
make someone feel aroused.

64
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,590
Lit this at nighttime.

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,830
Yes, Your Highness.

66
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,100
Ban Meng.

67
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,030
Ban Meng.

68
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,710
Ban Meng.

69
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:05,427
Ban Meng.

70
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,030
Ban Meng.

71
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,180
Ban Meng.

72
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,300
Wake up, Ban Meng.

73
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,390
- Ban Meng.
- Muran?

74
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,950
Muran.

75
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
Muran.

76
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,660
Ban Meng.

77
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,500
Wake up.

78
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,540
Ban Meng.

79
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,440
Ban Meng.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,949
I miss you.

81
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,150
Ban Meng.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,710
Wake up, Ban Meng.

83
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,980
Ban Meng.

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,420
No.

85
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,420
Ban Meng.

86
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,500
Ban Meng,

87
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,790
sober up.

88
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,300
I want...

89
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,860
Hold me.

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,030
Hold me.

91
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,500
Hold me.

92
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,310
Hold me.

93
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,860
Yeting, please come with me.

94
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,900
The gift I've specially prepared for you

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,310
is ready.

96
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,780
It's getting late.

97
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,710
We should head back.

98
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,550
No rush, Yeting.

99
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,350
Later,

100
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,950
I'll give you a surprise.

101
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,670
Yeting,

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,980
right away.

103
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,190
