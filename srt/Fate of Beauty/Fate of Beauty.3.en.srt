00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,000
(Panic,)

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,960
(fright,)

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,070
(confusion.)

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,350
(Is that what you're feeling right now?)

6
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,750
(Can't you remember who I am?)

7
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,750
(I'm your nightmare
for the rest of your life.)

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,240
(From now on,)

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,560
(if I want you to be happy,)

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,120
(you'll be.)

11
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,590
(If I want you to be sad,)

12
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,790
(you'll be.)

13
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,870
(I want you)

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,710
(to never forget me.)

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,120
Young Master,

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
this is Miss Le's hairpin.

17
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,920
Where is she?

18
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,870
She's dead.

19
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,200
burnt to a crisp.

20
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,150
From now on,

21
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,120
you are irreplaceable

22
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,430
in my heart.

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,310
(Le,)

24
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,790
(you are irreplaceable)

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,910
(in my heart.)

26
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,780
=Episode 3=
(Get into A Trap)

27
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,240
Who are you?

28
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,470
Why did you try to harm me?

29
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,080
If I wanted to harm you,

30
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,800
why would I save you?

31
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,310
I don't care what you're up to,

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,080
stay away

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,150
from me,

34
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,310
from the General residence.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,240
If you think there's something wrong
with me,

36
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,240
you can just strangle me,

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,310
take my life,

38
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,800
and make trumped up charges.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,000
That's a piece of cake

40
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,590
for you,

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,590
isn't it?

42
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,710
What am I up to, you ask?

43
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,030
I'm thinking

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,960
about what you said to me yesterday.

45
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,590
You said

46
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,150
you don't know about flowers

47
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,960
or women.

48
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,280
If you really don't know,

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
I can teach you.

50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,400
No one has ever dared

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,560
to tell me what to do.

52
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,180
(General's Residence)

53
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,740
(General's Residence)

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,830
Second Young Master,

55
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,190
why are you here?

56
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,190
Warm up your hands.

57
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,560
Thank you.

58
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,040
It must be hard

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,630
to open a flower parlor

60
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,600
in the capital

61
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,670
without your family around.

62
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,720
From now on,

63
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,390
if you have any problems,

64
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,950
you can come to me.

65
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,510
Any problems,

66
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,310
you mean?

67
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
As long as I can do it,

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
I'll do it

69
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,480
if you ask me.

70
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,750
Okay.

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,800
Young Lady,

72
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,000
do we have to come to this so soon?

73
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,680
Just burn down

74
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,800
such a nice flower parlor?

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,920
Don't forget

76
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
what we're here for.

77
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,190
(Within a year,)

78
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,480
(if he falls in love with you,)

79
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,390
(Fleeting Dreamland)
(if he gives you his true love,)

80
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,270
(you'll be out of this mess.)

81
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,190
(Otherwise,)

82
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,876
(you'll die.)

83
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,870
(Fleeting Dreamland)

84
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,680
(Remember,)

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,800
(you've only got one year
to get your revenge.)

86
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Xiao Yeting!

87
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,360
Traitor!

88
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,240
Sinner!

89
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,270
You've failed my daughter!

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
At last,

91
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,560
it's all about to begin.

92
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,070
(General's Residence)

93
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,360
(I need to get into the General
residence as soon as possible)

94
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,000
(so that I can carry out my plan.)

95
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,870
(Xiao Yeting,)

96
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,190
(everything you've gained
by stepping on the corpses)

97
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,720
(of the Xia'an clan,)

98
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,720
(I'm going to take it all away.)

99
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,870
Did you really mean

100
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,830
what you said

101
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,680
about helping me?

102
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,700
(General's Residence)

103
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,910
(What's with the messy pulse?)

104
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,390
You're awake.

105
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,000
I've decorated this room

106
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,510
to look like your old room

107
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,630
with the help of Hai Tang.

108
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,200
I hope

109
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,360
it will comfort you for the destruction

110
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
of your flower parlor.

111
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,790
Thank you for your kindness.

112
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,270
I've already bothered you at your home.

113
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,360
You...

114
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,240
I was worried about you,

115
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,630
so I spent

116
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,720
the night here.

117
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,270
Lie down.

118
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,720
- You lie down first.
- Have I been asleep long?

119
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,360
Lie down.

120
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,630
Your pulse is messy.

121
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,360
You shouldn't get up in a hurry.

122
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,120
There's something unusual

123
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,440
about your pulse.

124
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,600
Something I've never seen before.

125
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,200
Maybe

126
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,000
I suffered a shock

127
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
in the fire.

128
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,630
Your pulse doesn't look like that.

129
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,440
It looks like...

130
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,880
I didn't expect you

131
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,370
to have medical skills.

132
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,030
I've been interested

133
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,630
in medicine since I was a kid.

134
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,770
I know a little bit about it.

135
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,550
This is

136
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,080
my private compound.

137
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,120
You can stay

138
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,200
as long as you want.

139
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,960
I hope

140
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,960
you'll make yourself at home here.

141
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,750
