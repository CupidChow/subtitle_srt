00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,240
(the reality you want to believe.)

(Dilemma,)

5
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,670
(a difficult situation
that ties you down.)

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,880
(When I know you deep enough)

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,790
(and use the reality you believe in)

8
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,590
(to create a dilemma,)

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,790
(can you)

10
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,400
(escape it?)

(Under Control)

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,520
Ban Meng.

13
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,120
What brings you here,
First Young Master?

14
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
If I'm not wrong,

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,150
there's an agate bead

16
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,000
hung at your fingernail, right?

17
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,590
Yes.

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,240
Did you come to me

19
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,840
just for a bead?

20
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
The bead has a unique design.

21
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,280
Where can I get it?

22
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,190
It's a gift

23
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,470
from my old acquaintance.

24
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,430
You can only

25
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,150
ask him about it.

26
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,960
Unfortunately,

27
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
he's dead.

28
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,520
Oh.

29
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,960
When did it fall off?

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,150
I didn't notice that at all.

31
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,560
First Young Master,

32
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,960
where did you find it?

33
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,630
In the hallway.

34
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
How strange.

35
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,680
I didn't go there

36
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,240
these two days.

37
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,590
Did you forget

38
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,800
what happened last night?

39
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,920
I don't understand.

40
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
First Young Master,

41
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
what are you talking about?

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,680
Who's the old acquaintance
you mentioned?

43
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,270
(Why do I always sense)

44
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,630
(hatred and contempt from her eyes?)

45
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
(Why do I feel a subtle pain)

46
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,920
(when I look at her eyes?)

47
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,580
(Xia'an's Residence)

48
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,220
(Xia'an's Residence)

49
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,120
Father,

50
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,430
Mother,

51
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,270
I'll definitely avenge you

52
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,870
and clear the name

53
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,000
of Xia'an's Residence.

54
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,820
(Xia'an's Residence)

55
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,580
(Beautiful and light tune)

56
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,140
(Beautiful and light tune)

57
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
You sacrifice yourself

58
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
to help me,

59
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,950
I'll never forget it.

60
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,390
I'm willing to do anything

61
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,630
to demand justice

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,270
for those aggrieved soldiers.

63
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,380
(Beautiful and light tune)

64
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,750
(Please make Xiao Yeting believe)

65
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,630
(it's me who spends the night with him.)

66
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,750
(This is crucial)

67
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
(for the plan.)

68
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,520
(It's a gift)

69
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,860
(from my old acquaintance.)

70
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,360
(Unfortunately,)

71
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,270
(he's dead.)

72
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,560
Young Lady,

73
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,950
General Xiao is returning tomorrow.

74
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,160
Where's the letter?

75
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,750
It's all set.

76
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,560
Can this letter

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,390
drive First Young Master

78
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,950
and General Xiao apart?

79
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,560
(Not just this letter,)

80
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,240
(the advisor beside General Xiao
is also our man.)

81
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,830
(Additionally, the set-up last night.)

82
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,070
General Xiao doesn't trust anyone.

83
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,040
He doesn't even trust his sons,

84
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,920
especially not Xiao Yeting.

85
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,310
But hasn't the Xiao's Residence

86
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,510
always been under the control

87
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,190
of First Young Master?

88
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,830
It may seem so.

89
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,630
But General Xiao

90
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,550
has always been wary of Xiao Yeting,

91
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,000
thinking he might get help
from the Crown Prince

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,150
to seize his title.

93
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,910
I don't understand.

94
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,240
Only brothers compete for the title.

95
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,090
Why would this happen

96
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,840
between father and son?

97
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Someone came to my room.

98
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
Who do you suspect, First Young Master?

99
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,910
My father is coming back.

100
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,630
Do you know that lions

101
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,510
kill their own cubs?

102
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
Lions

103
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,080
kill male cubs

104
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720
for two reasons.

105
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,630
First, to eliminate future competition

106
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,960
and prevent the cubs from replacing them
when they grow up.

107
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,000
Second,

108
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,720
to avoid the young cubs
from slowing the pride down

109
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
and bringing trouble to them.

110
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,120
And these two reasons

111
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,790
apply to Xiao Yeting.

112
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,200
So this time,

113
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,670
no matter what he does,

114
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,150
General Xiao

115
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,030
won't let him slide.

116
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,440
What if the letter

117
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,550
can't influence Xiao Yeting?

118
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,720
Xiao Yeting cares most

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,750
about General Xiao's opinion.

120
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,390
Now

121
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,600
that he's no longer the legitimate son,

122
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
he'll try to regain it

123
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,150
even if he has to risk himself.

124
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,840
I'm here.

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,000
You must've waited for long.

126
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
It's already evening.

127
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,150
I've waited for you all afternoon.

128
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,960
Father gave me

129
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,360
an imperial arrow,

130
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,960
so I specially brought it to show you.

131
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,510
Father tested me and Muran
on archery earlier today.

132
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,270
I've been practicing for three years

133
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
just to show Father my skills.

134
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,030
Did you hit the bull's eye?

135
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,270
Of course.

136
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,270
Not just that,

137
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,870
I also answered Father's question.

138
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,840
What question?

139
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,720
Father asked,

140
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,390
in "The Liezi",

141
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,200
what's the essence
of "Ji Chang Learns Archery"?

142
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,510
How did you answer?

143
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,080
See the small as big.

144
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,480
See the trivial as important.

145
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
Ji Chang hung a louse

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,480
on a strand of hair at the window

147
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,480
and stared at the louse everyday

148
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,790
until one day

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,390
the louse appeared

150
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
as huge as a mountain to him.

151
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,630
He then shot through the heart
of the louse.

152
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,960
I told Father

153
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,960
that I practiced archery

154
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,440
like Ji Chang did.

155
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,150
I wouldn't blink

156
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,870
even if the arrowhead
pierces into my eyes.

157
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,750
Did he praise you then?

158
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Of course.

159
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
You're amazing, Yeting.

160
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,480
I know.

161
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,960
Besides,

162
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,150
Xiao Yeting and General Xiao
have similar personalities.

163
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,270
For a man like him,

164
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
a small pebble

165
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,510
is enough to make waves.

166
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,030
You're brilliant, Young Lady.

167
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,510
Get back to your work.

168
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,630
Yes, Young Lady.

169
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,030
(At the end of the story,)

170
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,200
(Ji Chang believed himself
to be the best archer)

171
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,240
(and thought the only person
who could rival him)

172
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
(was his master, Wei Fei.)

173
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
(So Ji Chang killed Wei Fei)

174
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,870
(to truly become the best in the world.)

175
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,150
(I suppose the answer
General Xiao wanted)

176
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,030
(wasn't how hardworking Ji Chang was,)

177
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,080
(but something else.)

178
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,240
(Selfish people)

179
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,600
(can't recognize their own selfishness.)

180
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,320
(Someone who vies for power)

181
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,510
(wouldn't see through the story
of power struggles either.)

182
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,960
(Xiao Yeting,)

183
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,030
(I will take away everything)

184
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,670
(you care about.)

185
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,480
(Young Master, you have fine taste.)

186
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,790
(This bead is of the finest quality.)

187
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,060
(The size is just perfect
for a lady's little finger.)

188
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,670
Young Lady,

189
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
you've done so much
for Second Young Master Xiao.

190
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,960
This jasmine cake is hard to find.

191
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
I had to send someone

192
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,550
to find an old master
outside the capital.

193
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,550
It's said he's the only person

194
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,280
who has mastered the skills
of preserving jasmine flowers.

195
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,030
Given the season,

196
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,870
he's the only store
that sells jasmine cakes.

197
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,910
Second Young Master Xiao

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,480
has been through a lot lately.

199
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,720
I believe

200
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,440
only this jasmine cake can comfort him.

201
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,720
I heard

202
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
that after the former Madam's passing,

203
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,840
Madam Xiao forbade everyone
from growing jasmine flowers

204
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,960
and even making jasmine cakes.

205
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,670
Keep it down.

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,200
Don't cause any trouble.

207
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,150
