00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,940
=Episode 18=
(Out in the Open)

3
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,990
Your Highness.

4
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,600
Your Highness,
what's the surprise you mentioned?

5
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,630
The maid made a mistake.

6
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,960
It should be

7
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,270
in the garden.

8
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,680
Ban Meng, wake up.

9
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,790
Ban Meng.

10
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,120
Let's...

11
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,320
Let's go.

12
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,680
We're safe now.

13
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,110
Stop pretending.

14
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,280
I just saved you,

15
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,790
and you don't even thank me.

16
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,200
Why are you

17
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,110
so cold to me?

18
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,350
Thank you.

19
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,440
That's better.

20
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,790
You're a tough woman.

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,480
You tried to bear everything

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
on your own.

23
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How did you know

24
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,950
this knot?

25
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,150
You taught me.

26
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,950
Big sister.

27
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,760
Big sister?

28
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,950
Xia'an Le.

29
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Big sister.

30
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,800
The knot won't come undone this way.

31
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,440
How did you make this knot?

32
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,309
I can't do it.

33
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,150
I created this myself.

34
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,030
Thank you, Le.

35
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I know.

36
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,360
I know everything now.

37
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,470
Not only do I know

38
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,000
all your plans

39
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,560
but also

40
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,000
the hardships and sufferings

41
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,950
you've been through.

42
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,630
Young Master,

43
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,680
we found it.

44
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,950
Miss Ban Meng isn't poisoned,

45
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,030
it's the Gu.

46
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,749
(It seems)

47
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,239
(you've already found out)

48
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,950
(about the Gu, Mr. Xiao.)

49
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,070
(Please tell me)

50
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,920
(what I should do)

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,510
(to make her stay alive.)

52
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,760
(The Child Gu now lives inside
the body of Xiao Yeting.)

53
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,119
(If Xiao Yeting falls in love with her)

54
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,320
(and treats her with full sincerity,)

55
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,630
(the Mother Gu inside her survives.)

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,440
(And so,)

57
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,510
(she will survive.)

58
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,630
(After I learned of the truth,)

59
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
(I had no choice but to play along)

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,269
(and made Xiao Yeting)

61
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,240
(the isolated target in the residence.)

62
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,950
(Only then could you lower his guard)

63
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,270
(and make him fall in love with you.)

64
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,120
(Only if he falls for you,)

65
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,760
(you could survive.)

66
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,590
So what if you know about that?

67
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,270
I didn't want to drag you into this.

68
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,150
This doesn't concern you.

69
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,320
Oh, pity me.

70
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,030
If I'm not mistaken,

71
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,150
our first encounter

72
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,270
was one of your plots.

73
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,390
You wanted me to lure
Xiao Yeting to you.

74
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,800
After that,

75
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,590
you moved into the Xiao's Residence

76
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,320
through me

77
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,150
and also

78
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,359
used my hands

79
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
to deliver the incense to Madam

80
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,390
and...

81
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,630
Yet now you say it doesn't concern me.

82
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,920
Is it because you think

83
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
I hold no values

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
and want to abandon me?

85
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,000
Or have you developed feelings for me

86
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,560
and don't wish to implicate me?

87
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,440
I just want to abandon you.

88
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,630
Well, well.

89
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,390
You're a little liar.

90
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,640
Why can't you admit

91
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,280
that you have feelings for me?

92
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,040
A while ago,

93
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,520
I was cold to you.

94
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,070
Didn't you feel

95
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,470
a bit upset?

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,070
Of course

97
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,320
not.

98
00:08:58,107 --> 00:08:59,990
Not even a tad bit?

99
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,990
I'm too soft-hearted.

100
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I should've kept it up a little longer.

101
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,680
If you keep joking around with me,

102
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,830
I'm leaving.

103
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,230
Le.

104
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,750
I won't let you bear anything alone

105
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,800
in the following plans.

106
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,040
If you don't want to hurt me,

107
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,280
don't push me away.

108
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,070
Do you want to

109
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
hear my plan?

110
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,990
Your plan?

111
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,680
From now on,

112
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,230
we'll go with my plan.

113
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,560
No matter what,

114
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,590
I'll make sure you achieve
what you want.

115
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,350
Whatever happens,

116
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,920
I'll always be by your side.
