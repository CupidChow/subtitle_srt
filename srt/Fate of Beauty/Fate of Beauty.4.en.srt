1
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,860
=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,490
The first step
after entering the residence

3
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,280
is to bring down Xiao Yeting's mother,

4
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,110
the General's wife.

5
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,920
Why don't you just lay your hands
on First Young Master Xiao?

6
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,390
Xiao Yeting cares most

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,600
about his status as the first son.

8
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,560
If his mother's status is jeopardised,

9
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,240
he'll be

10
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,670
in a panic.

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,870
Then, our next move

12
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,310
will be a success.

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,140
=Episode 4=
(Nerve-calming Incense)

14
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,510
You usually hate practicing archery,

15
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,430
why are you so diligent today?

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,840
Yeting.

17
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,470
You don't even know the background
of that woman,

18
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,490
and you just let her into the residence?

19
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,680
Yeting,

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,910
you've misunderstood.

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,030
Miss Ban Meng...

22
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,990
Why didn't you talk to me

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,520
about such a big deal?

24
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,690
It's just to get a flower arranger
to work for the family.

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,030
It's a trifle.

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,330
I don't have to get your permission, do I?

27
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,680
Why don't

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,750
we have a match?

29
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,680
The loser will listen to the winner.

30
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,240
Yeting.

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
Let's make a bet.

32
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,080
The loser

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
will listen to the winner.

34
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,360
Okay.

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,680
Look.

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,000
She's Miss Ban Meng.

37
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,910
So it's her.

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
Miss Ban Meng is so lucky.

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,120
Yes.

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,590
Second Young Master.

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,590
You're not well enough

42
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,150
to go out yet.

43
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,910
It's all right.

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,310
I'm on my way to bring the General's
wife some nerve-calming incense.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,710
After all,

46
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,910
I'm here to disturb you,

47
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,680
so I must show the proper courtesies.

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,470
Well,

49
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,590
I'll go for you.

50
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,840
You can't

51
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,150
catch a cold again.

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Please

53
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,710
give it to Mrs. Xiao for me, then

54
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,190
and make sure my courtesy is fulfilled.

55
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,310
Don't worry.

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
I'll do

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,430
what you ask.

58
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,750
How many trips did you make?

59
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,720
It's the third time.

60
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,950
Second Young Master is really going
to move all the best things

61
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,700
in the residence
to Miss Ban Meng's chamber.

62
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,040
It's rumored

63
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,160
that Miss Ban Meng
is the future Young Mistress.

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,040
How can that be?

65
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,470
Second Young Master
has such high standards.

66
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
How could he choose
a flower arranger as his wife?

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,480
Have you ever seen Second Young Master
bring someone back to the residence?

68
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,600
It's

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,600
called love.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,120
You've been reading too many novels.

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,560
One is the handsome
first son of the general,

72
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,220
and the other
is a gorgeous flower arranger.

73
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,270
What a match made in heaven.

74
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,870
A perfect match.

75
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,830
What's going on?

76
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,870
What's all the fuss about?

77
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,800
Sir.

78
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,360
I'll fine you this month's wages.

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,950
No need.

80
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,950
First Young Master.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,870
Since First Young Master said
there's no need to punish you,

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,390
leave now.

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,240
Just sell them.

85
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
- First Young Master,
- First Young Master,

86
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,630
- I really didn't do it on purpose.
- please forgive me.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
First Young Master!

88
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,720
They just

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
broke a plate.

90
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,800
First Young Master.

91
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,430
I'm not afraid of you!

92
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,510
You

93
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,440
get out!

94
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm not afraid of you!

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,370
I'm not afraid of you!

96
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,240
You're just a dead man.

97
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,750
What can you do to me?

98
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,160
Get out!

99
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm not afraid of you.

100
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,430
You're a human in the daytime

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,430
and a ghost at night.

102
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,120
It seems that your purpose of entering
the residence has been revealed.

103
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,430
What is the purpose of me coming here?

104
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
Is it you?

105
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,600
How do you know

106
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,240
I'm here for you

107
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,480
and not Second Young Master Xiao?

108
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,080
So what is the purpose

109
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,630
of you entering the General residence?

110
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,270
You two brothers,

111
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,270
one of you takes pity on me

112
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,870
and takes me in,

113
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,270
while the other one

114
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
is always suspicious of me.

115
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm just a weak woman

116
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,840
without parents,

117
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,600
with no one to turn to,
no place to live.

118
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,510
First Young Master,

119
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,510
why do you always pick on me?

120
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Could it be

121
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,600
that you have a crush on me?

122
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,000
(Why can't I control myself)

123
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,550
(every time I see her?)

124
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,630
(What's wrong with me?)

125
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,960
(Is there something wrong
with this woman)

126
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
(or)

127
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,840
