00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,940
=Episode 16=
(Game of Wits)

3
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,240
Father,

4
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,430
I apologize to you.

5
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,200
You're too cruel.

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,750
Ran is your brother.

7
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,920
You were trying to cripple him.

8
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,280
You're not my son!

9
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,280
What should I do
to be worthy enough to be your son?

10
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,000
Ever since I was a kid,

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,950
I've been trying to be your son.

12
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,920
From Old Mrs. Xiao

13
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,480
to the maidservant in this residence,

14
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,590
everyone thinks lowly of me.

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,940
They all know

16
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm the son of a mistress.

17
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,000
I've gone through so much

18
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,640
just to get your recognition.

19
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,560
And you have to resort

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,510
to such despicable acts?

21
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,710
Do you have no conscience?

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,310
Conscience?

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
Just like your love for me,

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,870
they are

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,430
too much to ask.

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,000
Mother

27
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,400
wanted to send me to
the academy to study

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,910
like Muran did,

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,630
she endured the nanny's insults

30
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,150
or even beatings.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,870
As a general's son

32
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,960
without a proper identity,

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,120
I was bullied and humiliated

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,120
in the academy.

35
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,310
Every Mid-Autumn Festival,

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Mother would bring me to kneel
outside the residence

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,240
just so I could see you

38
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,030
and feel the warmth of family.

39
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,560
Why did I

40
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,750
never know this?

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,000
Because Mother never said a word to you.

42
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,710
She always taught me that,

43
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560
to achieve big,

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,960
I have to endure humiliation.

45
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,520
Only then would I be worthy
of being your son.

46
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,310
Father,

47
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,560
I may have resorted to gruesome ways,

48
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,680
but all I want is for you to see me

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,150
and acknowledge me,

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,430
even if it means kneeling here.

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,560
At least you can see me.

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,120
Ting,

53
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,360
what has happened to you?

54
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,430
A woman told me

55
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,150
that if I wanted to achieve something,

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,710
I needed to be honest with my desires

57
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,960
and do not compromise.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,630
Come,

59
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,240
stand up first, Ting.

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
Princess Yanping has arrived.

61
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,570
Your Highness, please forgive me
for not greeting you properly.

62
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,960
Please punish me.

63
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,680
Yes, I'll punish you.

64
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,360
I was only away
from the capital for a few days.

65
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,750
Who had such audacity

66
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,950
to hurt my future husband?

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
First Young Master!

68
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,950
First Young Master,
you need to apply your medicine.

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
I bid you farewell, Your Highness.

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
What are you laughing about,
Second Young Master?

71
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm enjoying a good show.

72
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,390
Besides,

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
it'll get

74
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,070
even more exciting.

75
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,070
Who's there?

76
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,360
It's me.

77
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,870
First Young Master?

78
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,950
First Young Master,

79
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,120
what's the matter?

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,240
I just came to see you.

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,870
It's too late.

82
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm resting now.

83
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,600
If so, I'll talk to you from outside.

84
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,750
What do you want to say?

85
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,920
To be honest, there are many things

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,160
I can't control.

87
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,430
I know what you're getting at.

88
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,000
First Young Master,

89
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,600
please stop coming to me.

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,120
I have feelings for you,

91
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,040
but I don't want to come between
you and Her Highness.

92
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,720
After all,

93
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,830
you're engaged to Her Highness first.

94
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
From now on,

95
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,830
stop coming to me.

96
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
I'll hide my feelings for you.

97
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,360
Ban Meng,

98
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,160
please hear me out.

99
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,480
On that day when you were injured,

100
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,040
you asked me

101
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,190
if I liked you.

102
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,360
I can tell you my answer.

103
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,120
First Young Master,

104
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,510
I do like you,

105
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,750
but

106
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,910
there's nothing I can do.

107
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,600
You're going to be the prince consort

108
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,630
and have a bright future

109
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,270
in the imperial court.

110
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,270
I don't want to hold you back.

111
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,630
Ban Meng...

112
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,390
It's snowing.

113
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,200
Please leave, First Young Master.

114
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,750
Yeting,

115
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,840
eat the dishes.

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,960
I came here today

117
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
for something...

118
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,270
I know.

119
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,150
You want to discuss

120
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,120
our wedding,

121
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,910
right?

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,390
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

123
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,600
We should move the date forward.

124
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,720
You're aware of my current situation

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
in the General's Residence.

126
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,320
I want to put my focus

127
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
on the imperial court

128
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,910
to assist the Crown Prince.

129
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,200
So

130
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,630
the wedding...

131
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,270
By the way,

132
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,670
it's almost time.

133
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,750
Yeting,

134
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,030
tonight,

135
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,750
I've also invited two guests over

136
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,910
