00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,860
=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,390
(When the Xia'an family was wiped out,)

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,750
(you survived the fire,)

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,000
(but your face was ruined.)

5
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,390
(This Gu will help you
restore your face,)

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,470
(but its poison is very strong.)

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,960
(On full moon nights,)

8
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,840
(you'll feel terrible pain
in your heart.)

9
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,820
=Episode 6=
(Full Moon)

10
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,400
Young Lady,

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,170
what's wrong with you?

12
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,480
My chest pains.

13
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,280
This is the first full moon night
when the Gu acts up.

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
I didn't expect it to start
before nightfall.

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,760
When the worship ceremony starts,

16
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,230
I'll find a chance

17
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,510
to sneak into Xiao Yeting's room.

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
To find the important evidence
of the past,

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,920
today

20
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,870
is the best time.

21
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,280
But can you really stand

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,590
the terrible pain?

23
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,640
Don't worry.

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,040
Hai Tang,

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,590
go back inside

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
and get some more flowers.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,590
But...

28
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,590
Just go.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,480
Yes.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,190
First Young Master, what are you doing?

31
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,890
Recently, the scent of jasmine
has appeared in the residence.

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,360
That's something
that shouldn't even exist.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
But these

34
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,150
are the flowers
for the worship ceremony.

35
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,750
First Young Master, nothing found.

36
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,450
Please finish the flower arrangement
as soon as possible.

37
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,900
I don't want anything
to go wrong with the ceremony.

38
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,030
By the way,

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,680
just do your job.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Don't move around.

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,030
First Young Master,

42
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,710
did you come here specifically
to say this to me?

43
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,830
You killed me.

44
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you happy now?

45
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,830
This is just the beginning.

46
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,630
I'll be with you every night
from now on.

47
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,600
You're going to end up miserable.

48
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,920
You know it yourself, don't you?

49
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
Who sent you here?

50
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,920
Hai Tang,

51
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,240
didn't you say last time

52
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,120
that there was an exorcist
who was very good?

53
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,720
Can you introduce him to me?

54
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,240
That master is often in seclusion

55
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,480
and it's very expensive
to get him to come out.

56
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,360
Hai Tang,

57
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
please help me.

58
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
I beg you.

59
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,360
What happened to me?

60
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,680
Still acting?

61
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,480
Believe it or not,
I'll kill you with my sword.

62
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,580
Young Master, please spare my life.

63
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,430
I really don't know anything.

64
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,680
Tell me.

65
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,000
Who the hell put you up
to this trickery?

66
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,040
Young Master,

67
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,510
I'm just an exorcist from
the temple in Taiping Mountain.

68
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,270
The General's wife asked me

69
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,720
to exorcise evil spirits today.

70
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,800
Exorcist?

71
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,870
Madam.

72
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,630
Today

73
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,240
is the day of worship ceremony
in the General residence.

74
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,270
Who told you

75
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,950
to perform an exorcism here?

76
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,680
My mother's been unwell lately.

77
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,800
Please forgive her, Grandmother.

78
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,830
Shut it!

79
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,390
I'd like to see
who are the evil spirits.

80
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,240
It's unfortunate enough

81
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,950
that the General residence

82
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,560
has you two profit-seekers,

83
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,040
but now,

84
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,510
you're trying to perform an exorcism
at the worship ceremony.

85
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,750
What a disgrace.

86
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,320
Guards,

87
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,440
send this concubine to the temple
at Taiping Mountain.

88
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,550
She's never

89
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,480
to enter the General residence again.

90
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

91
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,120
I dare you.

92
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,790
Don't think that just because
the General made your mother his wife,

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,870
you're really the first son.

94
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,320
You'll always

95
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,720
be a son of a concubine to me.

96
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,840
The monthly allowance for you

97
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,670
is only for pity's sake.

98
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,120
If you don't discipline him properly

99
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,360
and disgrace the General,

100
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,440
you won't be spared.

101
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
Why is it so much less than last month?

102
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,080
Who is this slut

103
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,550
who is so ignorant of the rules?

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm so old

105
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,150
that I even personally
came to send you money.

106
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,240
What?

107
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
Can't I get some money

108
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,200
to spend on water?

109
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,270
You're so arrogant for a servant.

110
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,510
I'll tell my father.

111
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,960
You think you're a legitimate son

112
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,910
of the General?

113
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
Take it or leave it.

114
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,960
You...

115
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,870
Ting,

116
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,240
don't do that.

117
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,790
I'll take my mother

118
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,000
to Taiping Mountain.

119
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,750
(The Gu's poison is very strong.)

120
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
(On full moon nights,)

121
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,360
(you'll feel terrible pain
in your heart.)

122
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,840
