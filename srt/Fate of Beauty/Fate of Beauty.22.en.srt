(Back then,)

(when you died,)

5
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,580
(I thought I had lost you forever.)

6
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,149
(It turns out)

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,739
Take it.

8
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,669
Have a look.

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,300
(that I truly lose you)

10
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,580
(is when you're right in front of me,)

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,690
(but you can't see me.)

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,300
Mother,

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,420
I came here to fetch you.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,530
Ting,

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,140
I've heard

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,610
about what happened to you.

17
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,730
Please forgive me, Mother.

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,919
I failed to keep

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,530
your title as the general's wife.

20
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,810
I've also ruined my future.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,810
I've disappointed you.

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,010
It's my fault, Mother.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,220
No,

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,700
it's my fault.

25
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,980
Status,

26
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,300
position,

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,450
or future

28
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,770
are what I demand.

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,170
I've imposed

30
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,420
all of this on you.

31
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,210
I used to think

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,559
that you'd be happy

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,490
if you had all of them.

34
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,540
But...

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,170
But seeing you being unhappy now,

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,210
I realized

37
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,749
I have never thought

38
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,140
about what my son

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,260
truly wanted.

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,170
My poor son,

41
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,580
you've suffered too much.

42
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,010
I'm not leaving you.

43
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,679
From now on,

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,050
go ahead and do what you want

45
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,260
without concerns.

46
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,679
Have you seen this person?

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,700
(A month later)
No.

48
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,279
No, I haven't.

49
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,519
A missing person notice?

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,709
Who has gone missing this time?

51
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,480
(Missing Person Notice)
They haven't found him yet.

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,450
Who is this man?

53
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,220
He's disappeared for a month.

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,170
Today is the full moon night.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,170
The Gu will flare up.

56
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,810
Do you really

57
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,130
feel no pain at all?

58
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,860
Does that mean

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,660
the Gu inside your body

60
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,540
won't hurt your life?

61
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,050
Even though it doesn't hurt,

62
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,810
the Gu

63
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,570
is still inside my body.

64
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,660
I've collected

65
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,540
the evidence of Mr. Xia'an's case.

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,020
It may not

67
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,130
bring down the Crown Prince,

68
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,340
but we could persuade His Majesty

69
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,660
to reopen the investigation.

70
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,250
If so,

71
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,269
should we

72
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,690
present the evidence?

73
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,900
No.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,220
Until the Gu inside you is removed,

75
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,660
I won't take the risk.

76
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,300
But

77
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,900
Xiao Yeting has gone missing.

78
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,930
If he doesn't show up,

79
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,660
we can't reopen the investigation.

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,460
I'm afraid we're running out of time.

81
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,100
Ban Meng,

82
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,610
let's

83
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,420
get married, yes?

84
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,240
(Wedding)

85
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,869
Too bad!

86
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,300
The bride is missing!

87
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,100
(Search for her!)

88
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,170
(Turn the whole place upside down.)

89
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,159
(I don't believe we can't find her.)

90
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,930
- Yes.
- Yes.

91
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,490
Let go.

92
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,810
You're hurting me.

93
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,220
(Le,)

94
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,020
(you didn't know I'd recognize you.)

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,020
(This time,)

96
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,660
(I won't let you leave me.)

97
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,220
I didn't expect

98
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,050
to see you again.

99
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,420
You've suffered a lot.

100
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,730
You can't marry Xiao Muran.

101
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,780
I can give him anything he wants,

102
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,050
but not you.

103
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,140
You're mine.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,620
You've always

105
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,500
been mine.

106
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,900
Will you give me

107
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,570
anything I want?

108
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,660
I will.

109
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,479
I want you to be deserted.

110
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,079
I want you to be deserted

111
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,269
and disgraced.

112
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,810
I want you to lose everything.

113
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,970
Let's

114
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,500
get married, yes?

115
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,420
This is the only way

116
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,850
to lure Xiao Yeting

117
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,570
out.

118
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,690
Muran.

119
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,050
Xiao Yeting,

120
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,660
what are you trying to do?

121
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,170
She's your sister-in-law.

122
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,620
Have you no shame?

123
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,119
Right.

124
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,450
How could First Young Master
take his own sister-in-law?

125
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,509
This is utterly

126
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,149
a shameless act.

127
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,280
I can't believe this is the true color
of First Young Master.

128
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,239
This is shameless.

129
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,669
Right.

130
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,389
I want you to be deserted.

131
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,959
(Send this mistress to the Taoist temple
in Taiping Mountain.)

132
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,210
(From now on,)

133
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,260
(she's not allowed to step foot
in the General's Residence.)

134
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,509
(Ran is your brother.)

135
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,789
(You actually wanted to hurt him.)

136
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,269
You're not my son!

137
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,269
(I want you to be disgraced)

138
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,239
(and lose everything.)

139
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,850
You want to break off the engagement?
No, I'll break off the engagement.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,620
I don't want you!

141
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,050
(Please forgive me, Mother.)

142
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,029
(I failed to keep)

143
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,690
(your title as the general's wife.)

144
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,960
Do you think I'll let you off?

145
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,570
(I also ruined my future.)

146
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,380
(I want you to be deserted,)

147
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,420
(disgraced,)

148
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,140
(and lose everything.)

149
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,180
How could he do that?

150
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,509
This is utterly shameless.

151
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,020
Tell me about it.

152
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,660
If this is what you ask for,

153
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,690
I'll give it to you.
