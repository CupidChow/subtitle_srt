00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,960
(I always miss the target.)

4
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,990
(I don't want to practice anymore.)

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,030
(Muran.)

6
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,710
(Shall we make a pact?)

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
(What's it?)

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,390
(Let's compete in archery.)

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,640
(Whoever hits the target)

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
(is the boss.)

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,070
I got it!

12
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,750
I got it this time!

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,960
(Yeting,)

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,110
(I won.)

Get out!

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,760
All out!

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Stay back!

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,150
First Young Master,

22
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,740
aren't you going to check it out?

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,200
Mother.

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,040
Mother.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,590
Mother.

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Mother.

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,120
It's me.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,800
It's me,

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,470
Ting.

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
I'm Ting.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,840
Mother,

32
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,430
what's wrong with you?

33
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,690
What's wrong with you, Mother?

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,190
Everyone outside can hear you.

35
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,680
She...

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,150
She's here again.

37
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,120
She comes to me

38
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,360
every year at this time.

39
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,910
I've told you many times

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,080
that the residence is haunted.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,520
Why don't you believe me?

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,280
Ting,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,910
help me.

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,560
I... You're all I have.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,590
Help me.

46
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,560
Mother,

47
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,960
you're the General's wife.

48
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,000
Everything we have today

49
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,280
has been exchanged with
the most precious thing I have ever had.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,840
That person couldn't beat you
when she was alive,

51
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,240
can she beat you now

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,470
that she's a ghost?

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,630
Yes.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,630
I'm not afraid.

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,430
I have you.

56
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,590
I'm not afraid.

58
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm not afraid.

59
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm not afraid.

60
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,900
(It won't freeze in winter.)

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,310
Why does her pulse

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,470
show that her qi and blood
are not circulating,

63
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,890
but her internal organs
are still functioning normally?

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240
It's really weird.

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,630
I've never seen that before.

66
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,270
Hai Tang.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Young Lady.

68
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,360
Did you send the mugwort leaves?

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,310
They were delivered
at the crack of dawn today.

70
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,070
Ever since the General's wife
lit the nerve-calming incense,

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,750
she's always felt her chamber's haunted,

72
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,680
so she asked her servants
to burn the mugwort leaves.

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,990
They said

74
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,440
they'd burned all the mugwort leaves
in the residence,

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,560
causing the servants
to vomit and have diarrhea.

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,680
Besides,

77
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,360
she said she saw
the former General's wife's back

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,360
and heard a woman crying.

79
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,120
It's true that mugwort
repels evil spirits.

80
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,950
But if it's used in excess,

81
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,560
it's bound to be poisonous.

82
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,630
Once she takes the bait,

83
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,480
Xiao Yeting's position as the first son

84
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,870
will be jeopardised.

85
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,190
But poisoning by mugwort leaves

86
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,970
doesn't mean
she can see the spirits, right?

87
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,870
Could it be that there really are ghosts
in this residence?

88
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,990
It's just
that she has a guilty conscience.

89
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,480
A person with a guilty conscience

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,380
is even more terrifying than a ghost.

91
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,390
What are you going

92
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,120
to do next?

93
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,920
In an hour,

94
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
tell Second Young Master

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,510
that I'm meeting him

96
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,800
in the back garden to view the flowers
at a quarter to the hour of Hai.

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,600
Let him see

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
the garden I've recently tended.

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,630
Are you really going to use
Second Young Master's parentage

100
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,040
to bring down the General's wife?

101
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,310
For now,

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,190
it's the best option.

103
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,830
Second Young Master is quite pitiful.

104
00:05:58,486 --> 00:05:59,956
His mother died when he was young,

105
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,870
and he is most attached
to his elder brother.

106
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,950
If he knew that his mother

107
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,390
was killed by the General's wife...

108
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,230
I wonder how he would take it

109
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,680
when he knew the truth today.

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Sorry for being nosy.

111
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,510
You're meticulous.

112
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,430
Only when Second Young Master
knows the truth

113
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,480
will he be able to help you
with the rest of the arrangements.

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
You go out first.

115
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,600
Yes.

116
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
(I'll do)

117
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,270
(what you ask.)

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,800
Ban Meng.

119
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,040
You need to smile more.

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,920
All the flowers in this garden

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
are not as good as your smile.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
Second Young Master,

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,390
do you know what the language
of this flower is?

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,920
What's it?

125
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,720
It represents

126
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,270
eternal love.

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,560
Is that so?

128
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,630
It looks like

129
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,120
I got the right one.

130
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,360
Love

131
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,270
is the best thing

132
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,600
in the world.

133
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,480
I just want to give you
all the best things

134
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,630

Don't go.

(Young Lady,)

163
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,080
(if he knew that his mother)

164
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
(was killed by the General's wife,)

165
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,550
(how could he take it?)

166
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,080
Don't come any closer!

167
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,270
I'm not afraid of you!

168
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,870
I'm going to check it out.

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,790
Can't you smell

170
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,440
the jasmine all over the house?

171
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,240
There's no jasmine tree,
how could there be a jasmine scent?

172
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,910
She's right here in this chamber.

173
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,550
Come on,

174
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,320
protect me.

175
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,030
I did all this for you.

176
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,720
Now Old Mrs. Xiao

177
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,390
has taken away my power
in charge of the household.

178
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,390
In the future...

179
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,870
Will she take away your position
as the first son in the future?

180
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,080
Mother,

181
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,510
stop imagining things.

182
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,550
You have to believe me.

183
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,240
I won't let you down.

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,840
My son won't let me down.

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,790
I can't let my son down either.

186
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,720
Yes, Mother.

187
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
You must pull yourself together.

188
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,840
Don't be afraid.

189
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,480
I'm here.

190
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,750
Don't be afraid.

191
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,240
Okay.

192
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,270
I'm not afraid.

193
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,720
I killed Lady Wei

194
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,150
to give my son

195
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,150
what he has today.

196
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,600
You're still lingering here.

197
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,630
Just come at me if you want to.

198
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,240
I'm not afraid of you!

199
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,670
Mother,

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,750
stop it.

201
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,550
Don't let it get out.

202
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,550
It's all right now.

203
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,910
I'm not afraid.

204
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,270
I'm not afraid

205
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,910
- It's all right now.
- I'm not afraid.

206
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,550
I'm not afraid.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,670
I'm not afraid.

208
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,030
I'm not afraid.

209
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm not afraid.

210
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,200
The jasmine infusion
you brew smells so good.

211
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,000
Have you done what you were told to do?

212
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,510
Don't worry, Young Lady.

213
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,840
I've dealt with Mrs. Xie's servants.

214
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,630
I'm sure Cai Zhu
will come to me in the next few days.

215
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,290
Since the General's wife
is already in such a state,

216
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,480
should the incense be kept on?

217
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,480
Yes.

218
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,360
Okay.

219
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,910
Take them away.

220
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Uncap them

221
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,150
and put them
in obscure corners of the house.

222
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Yes.

223
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,360
Don't forget to convey my gratitude

224
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,750
to Master Wu.

225
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,720
Young Lady,

226
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,870
Mr. Xia'an was a benefactor
to Master Wu.

227
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,270
He'll

228
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,000
do anything for you.

229
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,390
Though my father

230
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,240
is gone,

231
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,630
his kindness

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,320
is still everywhere.

233
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,960
Xiao Yeting,

234
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,670
I've treated you like my own son.

235
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,390
I can't believe you set me up

236
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,030
for fame and fortune.

237
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,720
Do you think the crown prince

238
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,670
will favour you
just because you did that?

239
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
You're a traitor!

240
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,480
Sinner!

241
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,550
I betrothed Le to you.

242
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,600
I was blind.

243
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Xiao Yeting,

244
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,150
you've failed my daughter.

245
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,480
Tomorrow,

246
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,670
news

247
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,240
of Mr. Xia'an's treason

248
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,240
will spread throughout the capital.

249
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,080
Godfather,

250
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,320
given our relationship,

251
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,720
I will give you a quick death.

252
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,240
You're an ingrate.

253
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
Not a single one of them
should be spared.

254
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,390
I mustn't let them down.
