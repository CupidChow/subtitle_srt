=Episode 8=
(Orchid Pavilion)

3
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,470
Long time no see,

4
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,080
mister.

5
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,330
Very well.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,250
Come, let's drink together.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,200
(Since when)

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
(did everything get out of my control?)

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,930
Let me fill your glass.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,350
Careful, mister.

11
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,120
I can walk just fine.

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,680
It's unbelievable

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,950
what has happened recently.

14
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,040
You don't know yet?

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,680
It's spread all around the capital.

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,510
General Xiao's wife

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,070
was sent to Taiping Mountain
by Old Mrs. Xiao.

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,640
It's said she was possessed

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,680
and confessed the truth
of murdering Lady Wei.

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,480
Was the previous wife of General Xiao

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,350
killed by his current wife?

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
Absolutely.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
If so, First Young Master Xiao
isn't the legitimate son.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,430
We should

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,590
steer clear of him from now on.

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,150
(Do these changes start)

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,400
(since that woman appears?)

28
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,320
Not bad.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
(Ban Meng?)

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,430
(Why is she here?)

31
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,180
Second Young Master Xiao.

32
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,890
Let me fill up your glass.

33
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,750
It's a delightful night.

34
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Come,

35
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
I'll give you a toast.

36
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,230
Cheers.

37
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,940
I'll bottom up, mister.

38
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,360
Well done.

39
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,250
Well...

40
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,960
Let me fill it up for you.

41
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,720
I need to go.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,830
Second Young Master Xiao.

43
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,510
Not bad.

44
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,430
We haven't been meeting for some days.

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,630
You haven't drunk much yet.

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,040
Why are you leaving so soon?

47
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't tell me

48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,430
your heart

49
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,920
is stolen by some lady.

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,950
Well,

51
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,070
I can't drink much now.

52
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,000
Misters, please enjoy yourself.

53
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,800
What a spoilsport.

54
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,820
- Let him be.
- All right.

55
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,720
- Let's meet again next time.
- Come.

56
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,400
Let's drink.

57
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,600
Take care, Second Young Master Xiao.

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,190
Let's drink.

59
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,240
- I'm leaving.
- Come.

60
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,120
Let me pour for you.

61
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,600
It's really you.

62
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,480
Why did you ask for me?

63
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,270
Why aren't you wearing the hairpin?

64
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,040
Is that why

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,240
you asked for me?

66
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,920
I knew it!

67
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,870
You never cared about my gift,

68
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,950
let alone me.

69
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,480
If there's nothing else,

70
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm leaving.

71
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
You're curious

72
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,160
about why I didn't react
after knowing the truth

73
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,690
behind my mother's death, aren't you?

74
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,190
If you were born into a noble family,

75
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,390
perhaps you would understand

76
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,510
that your fate

77
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,560
isn't something you can control.

78
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,160
Your father's position
in the imperial court

79
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,800
and your mother's status in the family

80
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
determine your fate.

81
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,270
You're under the prowl of coveting eyes

82
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,750
every single day.

83
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,870
The situation in the General's residence
is complicated.

84
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,510
Even if Madam Xiao
didn't kill my mother,

85
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,950
other women would still come

86
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,510
to vie for the title
of the General's wife.

87
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,120
Before my mother's passing,

88
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,390
she used to be trapped in the struggle.

89
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,270
So

90
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,270
this is your reason?

91
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,390
My mother told me

92
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
I was my own

93
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,750
before I was my parents' child.

94
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,510
If so, when will you be yourself?

95
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,360
Your mother has passed off
for a long time,

96
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,920
and you still hide
in the General's residence.

97
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,310
Do you think

98
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,190
you can secretly be yourself
by doing so?

99
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you still feel yourself

100
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,070
being your parents' child?

101
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,440
Do you think

102
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,720
the flask is heavy?

103
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,150
What's that supposed to mean?

104
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,000
It hardly weighs anything, right?

105
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,510
What if you're asked to keep holding it?

106
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,360
From morning till night.

107
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,910
Do you think you can continue?

108
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,080
If the time extends

109
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,550
to one month,

110
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,720
a year,

111
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,840
a decade, two decades,

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,390
or even until you die?

113
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
Can you still hold it with ease?

114
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,750
Why don't you let go of yourself?

115
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,080
My mother always told me this,

116
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,270
"Ran,

117
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,030
keep yourself safe.

118
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,840
Don't fall for their traps."

119
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,030
Like this.

120
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,440
- Higher, Mother.
- Is it nice?

121
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,870
Le,

122
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,320
I gave you the name Le

123
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,550
because I hope
you can be safe and happy.

124
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,600
My greatest wish

125
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,750
is for moments like this,

126
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,030
where I can stay by your side,

127
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,670
watching you grow up

128
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,120
and seeing your smiling face every day.

129
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,270
And when you grow up

130
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,480
and meet the right person,

131
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,960
you can tell me

132
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,600
about the troubles life brings you.

133
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,440
All right?

134
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
- All right?
- Yes.

135
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,360
All right, darling?

136
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,240
All right?

137
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,480
Do you miss your mother?

138
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,390
I do.

139
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,270
Every day.

140
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,870
Sometimes,

141
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,480
I think of her many times a day.

142
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you follow her advice?

143
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,550
Honestly,

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,240
not always.

145
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,320
This time,

146
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,200
I want to follow my heart.

147
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,510
I

148
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
want to marry you.
