(Farewell)

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,140
Has the assassin been captured?

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,260
Who was it?

5
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,180
Well...

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,429
The hunting ground was guarded

7
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,820
by elite soldiers,

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,650
but

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,480
the assassin still got away.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,730
Investigate this thoroughly.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,650
Yes, General.

12
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,580
Tell her

13
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,010
I want to see her.

14
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,610
Please leave, Second Young Master.

15
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,220
Please tell Ban Meng

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,530
that I'll be waiting at the rock garden.

17
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,940
If she doesn't come,

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,780
I won't leave.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,730
It's pouring.

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,730
Second Young Master is
still waiting at the rock garden.

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,959
I don't think he'll leave

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,450
until you show up.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,700
Let him be.

24
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,119
There's something

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,820
I'm not sure if I should say it.

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,580
Don't say it if you're not sure.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,469
Young Lady, have you ever considered

28
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,420
the life after the revenge is completed?

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,629
I can tell

30
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,930
that Second Young Master
sincerely likes you.

31
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,730
He's someone you could trust.

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,930
I'm riddled with despairs.

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,140
He'll meet someone better.

34
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,580
(I shouldn't have met with you.)

35
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,380
(I may have talents,)

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,050
(but you'll eventually grow out of me.)

37
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,050
(Being fought over by two noblemen
is frustrating.)

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,980
(The beloved can only be hidden away
and waved off as a stranger.)

39
00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,980
You didn't accept my proposal

40
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,260
because of Yeting?

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,100
Yes.

42
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,330
You want to marry him?

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,370
Yes.

44
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,610
You're lying.

45
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,730
I can feel

46
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,610
that you like me.

47
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,250
You have feelings for me.

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,370
Why haven't you seen through it yet?

49
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,370
Everyone in the residence

50
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,930
is worried about Yeting's condition.

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,130
Why?

52
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,900
Because as soon as he wakes up,

53
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,610
General

54
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,780
will give him everything he wants.

55
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,660
Why would I

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,540
not marry a man like him?

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,460
No.

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,780
You're not this kind of woman.

59
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,069
I know you didn't think that way.

60
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,420
Do you know me well?

61
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,780
Do you know

62
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,930
what kind of woman I am?

63
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,730
Now,

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,050
I'll make myself clear.

65
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,460
I'm this kind of woman.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,980
I want to be with the powerful man.

67
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,980
In this residence,

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,690
Yeting is the powerful man,

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,930
not you.

70
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,020
So I beg of you,

71
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,810
stop getting in my way.

72
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,660
Don't let Yeting misunderstand us.

73
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,170
Ban Meng,

74
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,100
Yeting will marry

75
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,730
the princess.

76
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,900
He can't make you happy.

77
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,860
You'd better

78
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,900
worry about your situation
in this residence.

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,050

Young Lady,

136
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,930
General was praying for First Young Master

that he's safe.

140
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,239
Once General realizes

141
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,749
First Young Master's wound isn't fatal,

142
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,500
he'll suspect this is a set-up.

143
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,810
That's not enough.

144
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,260
You must remind General

145
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,330
that assassins usually apply poison

146
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,500
to the arrowhead to make sure
the assassination attempt succeeds.

147
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,970
Emphasize

148
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,509
that the assassin didn't mean
to kill Xiao Yeting,

149
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,090
which is very suspicious.

150
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,020
Yes, Young Lady.

151
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,909
That way,

152
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,690
General will realize

153
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,839
that this is a scheme

154
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,780
Xiao Yeting plotted against him.

155
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,140
They're very likely

156
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,599
to fall out tonight.

157
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,629
Don't worry, Young Lady.

158
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,170
I'll do as you say.

159

163
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,210
Ancestors,

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,690
Ting

165
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,540
is in grave danger now.

166
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,780
I've never thought of

167
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,900
watching my son die before me.

168
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,170
General!

169
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,170
General!

170
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,319
General,

171
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,540
First Young Master is awake!

172
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,210
He's awake?

173
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,820
The physician said the wound wasn't fatal.

174
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,550
Even though the arrow
was an inch away from his heart.

175
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,090
Luckily, the arrowhead wasn't poisonous.

176
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,260
Father!

177
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,170
Wait.

178
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,540
Any assassin

179
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,620
wouldn't miss the shot at the heart.

180
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,269
They would also apply poison
to the arrowhead

181
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,930
to prevent the mission from failing.

182
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,149
That means

183
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,079
the assassin

184
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,740
didn't intend to kill you.

185
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,500
Perhaps

186
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,359
this assassin also
didn't intend to kill Ting.

187
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,919
General,

188
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,660
I didn't mean that.

189
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,420
Don't you find it strange?

190
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,199
I was protected by many elite soldiers.

191
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,420
Why was he the only one

192
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,509
to realize

193
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,549
there was an assassin

194
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,620
and

195
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,090
stand in front of me?

196
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,380
Go and report

197
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,780
to Grandmother

198
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,850
that someone tried to murder me.

199
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,210
Young Master,

200
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,570
did you get hurt?

201
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,930
Tell her

202
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,210
that Xiao Yeting

203
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,540
intended to break my leg

204
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,629
and deliberately

205
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,170
lured me away

206
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,500
so I would miss

207
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,330
the hunt.

208
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,500
Yes, Young Master.

209
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,020
Xiao Yeting,

210
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,780

211
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,380
