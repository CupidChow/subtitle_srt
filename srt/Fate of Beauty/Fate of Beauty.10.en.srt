=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,600
(The bead is a gift)

3
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,790
(from an old acquaintance.)

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,320
(First Young Master,)

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
(are you)

6
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,030
(interested in me?)

7
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,700
=Episode 10=
(Ripples)

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,680
(The Gu is fierce.)

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,950
(Every full moon night,)

10
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,840
(you'll suffer excruciating pain
in your heart.)

11
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,120
Do you feel better now, Young Lady?

12
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,590
If you can't bear the pain,

13
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,400
bite me.

14
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,640
The pain is less

15
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,350
compared to last time.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,650
I suppose First Young Master
has fallen for you,

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,840
which is why the Mother Gu's backlash
has weakened.

18
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,070
(If the Child Gu host develops feelings
for the Mother Gu host,)

19
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,710
(the Mother Gu will become milder.)

20
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,840
(The deeper the feelings,)

21
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,640
(the milder the effects
of the backlash.)

22
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,950
Hai Tang,

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
you may go.

24
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,950
Yes, Young Lady.

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,560
(Since Xiao Yeting has already
developed feelings for me,)

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
(I'll push forward)

27
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,560
(and make him submit to me.)

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,470
Who's there?

29
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,400
I...

30
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,190
I didn't mean to disturb you.

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,430
Why did I always come

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
at a bad time?

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,870
Turn around.

34
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,470
Why did you use the window

35
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,960
instead of the door?

36
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,280
I noticed Hai Tang

37
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,360
was guarding at the door

38
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,680
until she fell asleep.

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,310
I didn't want to

40
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,520
disrupt her rest.

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,840
You're worried
she wouldn't let you in, right?

42
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,430
You know me the best.

43
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,150
What brings you here

44
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
late at night?

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
I noticed

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,800
you always suffer from pain

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,150
on every full moon night.

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,200
I looked through all medical books,
but couldn't find a cure.

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,630
However,

50
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,840
I thought of a great idea.

51
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,000
What's it?

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,470
I concocted a sleeping potion for you.

53
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,560
You'll

54
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,560
have a peaceful sleep

55
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,150
after taking it.

56
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,080
That way,

57
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,590
you can avoid the pain

58
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,680
every month.

59
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,240
Second Young Master,

60
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,400
thank you so much.

61
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,920
What I do is trivial

62
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,600
compared to your jasmine cake.

63
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,120
Did you take the herbal bath at night
to alleviate the pain?

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,430
Trust me.

65
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,870
Drink the sleeping potion

66
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,120
and go to bed.

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,480
Let me

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
help you get to the bed.

69
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,600
Why aren't you leaving yet?

70
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,920
I'll leave after you fall asleep.

71
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,720
Sleep tight.

72
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,480
(No matter who you are)

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,430
(or what you've done,)

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
(I don't care.)

75
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,240
(Ban Meng,)

76
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,430
(I only wish to lead a peaceful
and happy life with you.)

to join me to welcome Father back.

86
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,240
Second Young Master
went out early this morning.

87
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,680
Where did he go?

88
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,480
He said he went to the city gate
to wait for General

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,240
and request a marriage.

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,270
Marriage?

91
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,120
What marriage?

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,190
With Miss Ban Meng.

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,160
What's wrong with him?

94
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,430
Are you all right?

95
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,310
I'm fine.

96
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,950
What's wrong with him?

97
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,310
Father,

98
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,830
don't agree to his request.

99
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,720
He's playful,
and isn't ready for marriage.

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,870
You came in a hurry.

101
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,190
I thought you were here to welcome me.

102
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,000
Father, congratulations
on your victorious return.

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
I'll think about

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,120
the marriage proposal.

105
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,800
Thank you, Father.

106
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,190
What did I instruct you before I left?

107
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,680
As of now,

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,160
you're the biggest problem
in this residence.

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,240
Look,

110
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
the residence is in a total mess now.

111
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm very disappointed

112
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,630
in you.

113
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:19,510
Ran,

114
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,560
come with me.

115
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,510
I didn't ask for you.

116
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,000
I think

117
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,760
you haven't thought it through
about the marriage.

118
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,240
Whether or not I've thought it through,

119
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,790
are you the one

120
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,440
to decide?

121
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,630
Mind your attitude.

122
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,480
I'm just doing what I want to do.

123
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,600
I don't understand

124
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,320
what you're trying to do.

125
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,510
Yeting,

126
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I can give you

127
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,510
anything you want.

128
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,390
But

129
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,200
I only want Ban Feng.

130
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,210
(Find your own pleasure)

131
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,750
Do you know

132
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
Muran wants to marry you?

133
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
What has this got to do with you,

134
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,870
First Young Master?

135
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,840
Do you really want to marry him?

136
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,510
I suppose

137
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,120
it doesn't concern you.

138
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,080
I don't understand.

139
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,790
Why didn't you admit

140
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,630
what happened that night?

141
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,600
Which night?

142
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,720
What happened?

143
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,910
Orchid Pavilion.

144
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,670
You and me.

145
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,480
Me

146
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,270
and you?

147
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,200
Drop your pretense.

148
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,080
You're my woman.

149
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,440
I didn't expect

150
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,440
the collected First Young Master

151
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
to have

152
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,030
such wild imaginations.

153
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,270
Don't agree to marry Xiao Muran.

154
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,670
Why?

155
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,360
Do you want to

156
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,720
marry me, too?

157
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,750
I won't let you marry him.
