=Fate of Beauty=

2
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,300
(Fleeting Dreamland)

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,280
(From the day
you inserted the Child Gu,)

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,110
(if he falls for you)

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,960
(wholeheartedly)

6
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,600
(within a year,)

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,920
(the Mother Gu will survive)

8
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,030
(and you won't get hurt.)

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,430
(If the Mother Gu explodes,)

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,600
(you'll end up dead.)

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,710
(Remember this.)

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,310
(You have only a year.)

13
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,180
=Episode 7=
(Nightmare)

14
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:40,710
First Young Master...

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,710
Was it you?

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,480
You left the jasmine water

17
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,790
to wreck my mother emotionally

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,950
and also told Hai Tang
to encourage Cai Zhu

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,390
to invite a Taoist priest
from Taiping Mountain

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,220
to humiliate her.

21
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,840
Why did you do that?

22
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,840
I've already killed

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,270
that priest.

24
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,960
Do you think

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,600
I won't kill you?

26
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,700
Why bother asking me

27
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,990
when you've already decided it was me?

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,870
If you have a grudge against me,
just come at me.

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Why did you make my mother suffer?

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,430
She went through a lot
to get where she is today,

31
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,080
do you know that?

32
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,590
Does it hurt?

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,590
Failing to protect
someone you love most,

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,430
do you feel the pain?

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,680
First Young Master,

36
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,030
you've come to my room at night

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,710
several times.

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,910
Are you

39
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,430
interested in me?

40
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Now,

41
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,590
Madam is driven out
because of her delirious state,

42
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,190
but her son

43
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,310
is still thinking of another woman.

44
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
I know

45
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,480
you won't kill me.

46
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,720
You're seducing me.

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,160
First Young Master,

48
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,630
are you feeling seduced?

49
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,510
Ban Meng?

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,680
Let's go inside.

51
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,480
The knot won't come undone this way.

52
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,510
How did you tie this knot?

53
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,580
I can't do it.

54
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,320
I created this knot myself.

55
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,680
(Did we meet before?)

56
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,870
Who are you?

57
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,270
(I can't remember the girl's face)

58
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
(or who she is.)

59
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,950
(But I'm sure)

60
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,430
(Ban Meng is the girl I met
when I was a kid.)

61
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,870
(What's her intention)

62
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,070
(in coming here?)

63
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:03,480
I haven't released a lotus lantern yet,

64
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,800
but my wish has already come true.

65
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,680
I was thinking about you just now,

66
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,920
and then you showed up.

67
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,190
Do you think

68
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,600
that's fate?

69
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,870
That explains why

70
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
all noble ladies in the capital

71
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,120
are happy whenever they mention
Second Young Master Xiao.

72
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,720
You can speak sweetly.

73
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm making

74
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,080
a serious wish.

75
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,360
Why don't you ask me what it is?

76
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,630
Ask me now.

77
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
What wish are you making?

78
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I hope

79
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
you'll accept my gift.

80
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,320
I bought you a hairpin.

81
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,670
Wear this,

82
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,720
and I won't lose you.

83
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,960
Why did you give me that hairpin?

84
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,960
My mother gave it to me

85
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,120
before she died.

86
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
She told me to give it

87
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,320
to the girl I like.

88
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,360
You actually believe that?

89
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
I was just kidding.

90
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,390
Everyone in the capital knows

91
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,600
I buy gifts for every pretty lady I meet.

92
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,720
Dear lady,

93
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
please don't embarrass me.

94
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,240
(Yeting is the person I trust most)

95
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,120
(in this world.)

96
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,870
(Ever since we were kids,)

97
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,720
(he always stays by my side)

98
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,320
(every time when I get upset.)

99
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,240
(He must know)

100
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,600
(how painful I am right now.)

101
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,200
I hate archery!

102
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,080
I don't want to practice anymore.

103
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,240
I want to quit.

104
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,960
Muran,

105
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,390
hate won't help.

106
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,840
It only frustrates you

107
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,240
and disrupts your mind.

108
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,360
I want to quit.

109
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,510
I want to quit.

110
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,150
I know

111
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,670
you hate me

112
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,600
and my mother.

113
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,270
Take it out on me.

114
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,720
Hate won't help.

115
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,440
It only frustrates you

116
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,080
and disrupts your mind.

117
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,880
The grudges of the older generations
shouldn't be endured by us.

118
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,800
Yeting,

119
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,200
you'll always be my brother.

120
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,820
Let's compete.

121
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,400
Sure.

122
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,670
Yeting,

123
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,150
let me tell you a secret.

124
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,480
I've realized

125
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,390
that I'm in love with Ban Meng.
