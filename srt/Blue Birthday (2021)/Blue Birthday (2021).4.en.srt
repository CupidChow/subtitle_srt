1
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,660
Here it is.

2
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,550
Now that we’re all here,
how about taking a photo?

3
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,510
Now?

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,030
What? You don’t want it?

5
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,620
Yes, I do. I want it a lot.

6
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,320
He was a quiet and sensible boy.

7
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,500
A couple lost their child
in the amusement park.

8
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,000
Upon seeing Seo Jun,
they decided to adopt him.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,760
Seo Jun, come.

10
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,660
They said Seo Jun looked like
their lost child.

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,560
You’re Seo Jun?

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,190
They’ll be your parents.

13
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,780
Glad to see you.

14
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,590
When he was a student,
he sometimes came back here.

15
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,940
He talked about you every time.

16
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,230
Me?

17
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,470
He said there was a friend
he liked and cherished.

18
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,580
By the way, how’s he doing lately?

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,770
After that, I received no news from him.

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,220
=Blue Birthday=

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,900
=Episode 4
Rule of Equivalent Exchange=

22
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,070
Long time no see.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,330
Thank you, Hye Min.

24
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,480
By the way,

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,480
what were you going to ask?

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,530
Ah.

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,080
What was that?

28
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,420
Seo Jun...

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,040
What was he used to be like at home?

30
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,750
Mm.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,400
He was an ordinary boy
just like other boys of his age.

32
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,420
As kind and outgoing
as he appeared to be.

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,500
Hye Min, in fact, I...

34
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,320
But Ha Rin...

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,740
I wonder if you know

36
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,350
Seo Jun was adopted by my parents.

37
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,670
It was my fault

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,390
that Seo Jun ended up dead.

39
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,040
What?

40
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,360
I don’t know when, but Seo Jun got
on bad terms with my parents,

41
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,930
especially with our mother.

42
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,690
Specifically, it started
in May of that year

43
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,710
when I came back home.

44
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,200
I was happy to find
my long-lost parents.

45
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,900
But to Seo Jun,

46
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,240
my sudden returning
may have hurt him.

47
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,440
About you.

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,280
I’m getting to know something about you.

49
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,050
I was your friend for ten years,

50
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,020
but I exactly knew nothing about you.

51
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,930
I hate myself for this more and more.

52
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,940
From this day on, I’ll get to know you.

53
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,480
But...

54
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,340
I haven’t finished reading the diary.

55
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,500
Ah.

56
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,550
Out of films?

57
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,450
The camera is broken.

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,900
Nothing is left now,

59
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,280
but these seven photos.

60
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,060
Anyway,

61
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,110
no matter what I have to do,

62
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,030
I must get you back to life
before using up the photos.

63
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,930
If there’s any change on the map,

64
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,550
then...

65
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,740
The time travel ends
with weird tinnitus.

66
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,670
I must hurry up before it happens.

67
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,570
What are you doing?

68
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,430
What?

69
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,670
What are you doing?
Where are you going again?

70
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,950
I’m a bit...

71
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,150
Come on, Ha Rin.

72
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,540
What?

73
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,480
What are you doing?
Why are you talking loudly with Su Jin?

74
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,300
Aren’t you disturbing other students?

75
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,830
Sir, I...

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,260
I want to go to the toilet.

77
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,250
Urgently?

78
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,240
Yes.

79
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,850
But what did I say last time?

80
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,730
You don’t remember?

81
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,730
Come on. What did I say last time?

82
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,960
Look at my hand. Does it remind you?

83
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,860
Pig’s feet.

84
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,900
Who said that?

85
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,900
I asked you not to say that.

86
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,810
I told you to raise your hand
and request permission to the toilet in a low voice.

87
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,840
But Ha Rin, did you raise your hand?

88
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,380
No.

89
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,950
Everybody, if any one of you
raises your hand,

90
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,320
Ha Rin can go to the toilet.

91
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,520
Raise your hand if you support her.

92
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,690
Well, what’s going on here?

93
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,930
You don’t have even one ally.

94
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,380
Isn’t Su Jin your friend?

95
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,020
Sir, I’m really urgent.

96
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,350
All right. I see. I see.

97
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,780
Work out this problem, then.
After you work it out,

98
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,520
I’ll let you go.

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,920
It’s a very simple problem.

100
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,570
Is it a promise?

101
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,880
Sure. I’m a man of my word.

102
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,820
You sometimes go back on it.

103
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,760
Who said that? I’ll get you!

104
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,120
The one who just said pig’s feet, right?

105
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,850
It’s simply a high school problem.

106
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,060
I’ll just go to the toilet
during the break.

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,740
Come and help Ha Rin.

108
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,730
Help her.

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,200
She can go to the toilet
after she solves the problem.

110
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,410
I’m so tortured
to be a high school student at this age.

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,880
It was not a very difficult problem.

112
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,940
I was good at solving it, you know?

113
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,930
Was?

114
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,320
Nothing. Forget it.

115
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,680
Come on!

116
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
You’ll help me later.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,820
Don’t be weak already.

118
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,310
Help you with what?

119
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,340
Didn’t you say you would help me?

120
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
Come on!

121
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,340
Did you forget it again?

122
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,040
I didn’t.

123
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,900
Actually, I did.

124
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,320
I only have time today.

125
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,120
So, don’t ever forget it again.

126
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
What exactly is it?

127
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,490
Ui Yeong Kim.

128
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,300
What are you doing?

129
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,220
Looking at the poster
of the Photo Contest.

130
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,240
Oh.

131
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,560
You want to sign up for it?

132
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,130
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,090
Didn’t we agree that
we would all sign up for it?

134
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,970
Did you forget it again?

135
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,910
Why don’t you go to the hospital
and have a check-up?

136
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,340
Yeah. You’ve been weird lately.

137
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,230
Haw-haw.

138
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,520
Come on!

139
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,620
I’m not weird.

140
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,520
I’m doing all right.

141
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,500
Are you sure?

142
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,670
Yes.

143
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,890
That’s good.

144
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,090
Anyway, don’t be late.

145
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,350
Or I’ll break with you.

146
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,300
I won’t be late.

147
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,420
But what am I supposed to...?

148
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,450
Feels like I’m having low blood sugar.
Let’s just go.

149
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,600
(Instructions)

150
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,960
Nothing goes right.

151
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,360
Ah!

152
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,120
So…

153
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,530
What photos are you going to take?

154
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,610
What do you mean?

155
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,480
Ah, the Photo Contest?

156
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,440
We must at least take the photo tomorrow
so that we can revise and submit it.

157
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,890
You’re right.

158
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,670
The theme is family.

159
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,280
Why not just take a photo
of our parents?

160
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,790
- You can take a photo of your parents.
- No.

161
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,750
I’ll pick another family member.

162
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,710
Another family member?

163
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,560
- Cloud.
- Cloud?

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
My dog Cloud is super lovely.

165
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,050
Do you have a dog that barks fiercely
when your mother grumbles?

166
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,570
You don’t, do you?

167
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,060
I kind of envy you for that.

168
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,220
What about you, Ha Rin Oh?

169
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,620
Oh?

170
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,160
I...

171
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,510
I...

172
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,020
Haven’t you finished yet?

173
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,240
I’ve got something else. I’m going up.

174
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,970
Where are you going?

175
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,520
I’m off, too.

176
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,340
What…?

177
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,690
When did you finish eating it?

178
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,490
How can I become a real family?

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,260
Can I get close to them?

180
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,440
Even thinking about it frustrates me.
I’m exhausted.

181
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,190
It was my bad last time.

182
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,990
Ah!

183
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,060
Mom, tonight,

184
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,970
are you available?

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,130
Other people would think
you’re texting your ex-girlfriend.

186
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,980
What?

187
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,310
You freaked me out.

188
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,050
What makes you hesitate
when texting your mother?

189
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,330
I’m not hesitating.

190
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,580
You are, all right?

191
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,930
Will you text her or not?
You typed and deleted it by turns.

192
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,000
What text is it?

193
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,780
An apology text.

194
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,500
Apology?

195
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
I did something wrong.

196
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,680
Give it to me.

197
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,220
Give me your phone.

198
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,550
What for?

199
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,070
I’m experienced in quarreling
with my mother. Watch and learn.

200
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,750
No need.

201
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,890
It’s always the hardest
to make up with families.

202
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,420
Let me help you.

203
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,860
All you need to do is trust me.

204
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,580
I must handle it

205
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,160
so that you won’t get hurt again.

206
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,060
How will you help me, then?

207
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,860
Give me your phone.

208
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,000
You just sent it!

209
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,130
The first step to inviting someone

210
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,630
is to be brave. Be brave.

211
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,640
But what if she doesn’t reply?

212
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,380
(Mom, tonight, are you available?)
(Yes, Seo Jun. Why?)

213
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,440
Ah…

214
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,720
Oh…

215
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,700
Ha Rin Oh, you...

216
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,220
(Answer questions with a smile.)

217
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,620
Shall I not go meet her?

218
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,140
Don’t say that.

219
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,900
You’re good at studying anyway.
Just recite it.

220
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,800
What’s this?

221
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,300
The secret to making up with families.

222
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,100
Secret?

223
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,310
First, ease the tension.

224
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,880
- Let me get you some water.
- All right.

225
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,870
Thank you.

226
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,650
How was your day at school?

227
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,900
When your mother asks a question,
answer her with a smile.

228
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,680
I...

229
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,050
No one pulls a long face
to a smiling person.

230
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,080
I had a happy day.

231
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,380
Very happy. Haw-haw.

232
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,430
Very happy?

233
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,440
What made you so happy?

234
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,460
Ah...

235
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,360
In the end, tell her
your everyday life willingly.

236
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,020
I...

237
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,280
If you have nothing to tell her,
talk about me.

238
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,390
Tell her my embarrassing things.

239
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,150
You have a special offer today.
Say anything you want.

240
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,330
Because of my friend.

241
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,930
Friend?

242
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,370
I have a friend, Ha Rin Oh.

243
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,030
She’s quite dumb and also forgetful.

244
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,770
We’ve been friends since we were eight.

245
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,920
So far, she hasn’t changed at all.

246
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,660
Enjoy your food.

247
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,320
You really told her
my embarrassing things?

248
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,380
- Tastes great.
- Yes.

249
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,350
Have you decided what to order?

250
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,200
Ah…

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,800
- Let’s go.
- All right.

252
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,010
I’ll come next time.

253
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,340
(Answer questions with a smile.)

254
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,420
I knew it.

255
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,290
He couldn’t keep it properly
and he dropped it.

256
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,980
(Su Jin Do)

257
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,900
(Su Jin Do, 4 Missed Calls)

258
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,880
Seo Jun,

259
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,280
may I ask you a question?

260
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,260
Why did you suddenly
invite me to dinner?

261
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,150
I just wanted it.

262
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,160
Before you called,
Hye Min had called, too.

263
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,460
She invited me to dinner, too.

264
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,050
She did?

265
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,360
Yes.

266
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,480
Then why did you choose me,
instead of her?

267
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,180
Because it was the first time.

268
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,500
Seo Jun,

269
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,150
you invited me to dinner
for the first time ever.

270
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,880
Seo Jun.

271
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,810
I’m sorry.

272
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,340
What you said

273
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,790
isn’t wrong.

274
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,460
Stop wasting your time
forcing yourself to be nice to me!

275
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,360
Anyway, I’m a substitute for my sister.

276
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,010
What did you say?

277
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,120
Without me, you would adopt
another child, right?

278
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,600
We did adopt you
because we couldn’t forget Hye Min.

279
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,530
Your eyes, nose and mouth

280
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,120
look exactly like hers.

281
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,290
You’re even a left-hander
just like her.

282
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,680
At first, we did regard you
as her substitute.

283
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:07,130
But after raising you for one year
and then two years,

284
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,350
suddenly I wondered something.

285
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,290
If you disappeared like Hye Min,

286
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,150
what would I do?

287
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,370
I would die.

288
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,800
Seo Jun,

289
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,980
I did adopt you for selfish motives.

290
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,910
But I’ve never stopped loving you.

291
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,590
Nor has your father.

292
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,380
I’m sorry.

293
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,960
I got you wrong.

294
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:40,880
Never mind.

295
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,300
I’m sorry to make you think like that.

296
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,020
It’s my fault.

297
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,830
I’m not a good mother.

298
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,570
I’m sorry, Seo Jun.

299
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,060
If you don’t end your life,

300
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,810
everything will be solved naturally

301
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,900
as time goes on, right?

302
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:09,800
Oh?

303
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,620
Where’s my phone?

304
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,110
How many of you?

305
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,480
I left my phone here.

306
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,910
This one?

307
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,940
Yes, yes. Thank you.

308
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,980
(Su Jin Do, 4 Missed Calls)

309
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,270
I only have time today.

310
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,900
So, don’t ever forget it again.

311
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:38,940
(Su Jin Do)

312
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,840
I only focused on
getting Seo Jun back to life

313
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,200
and I forgot about Su Jin.

314
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,340
The subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected.

315
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,370
Ah!

316
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,010
It’s driving me crazy.

317
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,450
Hello, Su Jin Do?

318
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,420
It’s me.

319
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,940
Seo Jun.

320
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,860
Where are you?

321
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,160
May I meet you? Are you available?

322
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,940
Now?

323
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,400
Will Su Jin be all right?

324
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,770
Hello?

325
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,390
Ha Rin Oh?

326
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,910
Yeah, it’s more important
to save Seo Jun.

327
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,010
All right.

328
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,100
Where are you now?

329
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,320
Ah…

330
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,110
The sky isn’t falling.

331
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:30,960
Is there anything bothering you?

332
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,660
What? Nothing.

333
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,310
Nothing is bothering me.

334
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,510
How was your dinner with your mother?

335
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,780
Not bad.

336
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,170
The weird note you gave me
really helped a lot.

337
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,820
It helped you, but you dropped it.

338
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,060
What did you say?

339
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,850
Nothing.

340
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,080
I’m glad it helped.

341
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,590
Ha Rin Oh.

342
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,510
Mm?

343
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:06,950
Thank you.

344
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,650
You indeed helped a lot.

345
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,930
Without your help,

346
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,510
I wouldn’t dare to expect
such a conversation with my mother.

347
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,550
Come on. I just sent a text for you.

348
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,790
It was really hard
to text her like that.

349
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,000
But after I talked to her,

350
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,010
I realized that I needn’t have worried.

351
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,610
Anyway, thank you.

352
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,680
I mean it.

353
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,350
Is he all right now?

354
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,460
Don’t die.

355
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,200
Seo Jun Ji,

356
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,850
please don’t die.

357
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,250
I should find Seo Jun first.

358
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,660
Seo Jun.

359
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,340
Seo Jun Ji.

360
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,240
Oh?

361
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,240
Shouldn’t there be photos
of Su Jin and me?

362
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:28,770
Disappeared?

363
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,660
Su Jin.

364
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,600
Hello, Ha Rin Oh?

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,540
Ui Yeong Kim,

366
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,790
are you with Su Jin now?

367
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,070
Why are you suddenly asking about her?

368
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,040
I’m walking to her home now. Is she...?

369
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,300
Why are you going to see her?

370
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,180
What?

371
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,510
You’re back on speaking terms?

372
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Didn’t you break with each other
when you were in Grade 2?

373
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,820
Su Jin,

374
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,540
yesterday I...

375
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,200
Wait a second.

376
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,350
- Go without me.
- All right.

377
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,960
I really had an emergency yesterday.

378
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,260
I’m sorry.

379
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,580
What emergency?

380
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Seo Jun Ji was...

381
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,150
It’s him again! It’s always about him!

382
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,540
You care most about Seo Jun Ji!
What about me?

383
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,400
It was all right
when you always broke your promise!

384
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,370
But this time I requested you.
I thought it would be different.

385
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,040
I had thought you would
keep our promise.

386
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,530
But what did you do?

387
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,640
I had thought I could get everything
back to normal.

388
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,150
Our friendship is so fragile
when only I take you as my friend.

389
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,400
But that is...

390
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,590
I’m too tired.

391
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,920
Simply my illusion.

392
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,850
Su Jin!

393
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,500
Shall we go to the shop?

394
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,840
- Enjoy it.
- Come on!

395
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,500
This is not the change I want.

396
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,210
Maybe changing nothing
is the best thing.

397
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,380

406
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Yeah!

407
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,240
Su Jin, this is yours. And this is mine.

408
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,940
Right? Su Jin, enjoy more.

409
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,350
Why doesn’t she just have two?

410
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,840
You don’t understand.

411
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,340
It’s love that we want to
give everything to the other half.

412
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,740
Ah?

413
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,450
Must I understand?

414
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,340
Will you take a photo of your parents
for the Photo Contest?

415
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,830
Or what?

416
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,210
Why? You want something else?

417
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,370
No. I just wonder if you will do that
like Ui Yeong Kim.

418
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,900
Is it okay that we take the same photos?

419
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,310
Our parents are different, anyway.

420
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,810
Yeah.

421
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,760
The theme is family.
I guess the photos will be similar.

422
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,100
Seo Jun Ji, will you also...?

423
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,560
Now that we’re all here,
how about taking a photo?

424
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,670
Now?

425
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,060
What? You don’t want it?

426
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,690
Yes, I do. I want it a lot.

427
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,540
One, two, three.
