I told you not to run in the corridor!

I’m sorry.

Today, I’ll confess to a friend
I’ve known for nearly ten years.

I fell in love with him long ago.

I think only Ha Rin could do that.

To be honest,

38

that I was freaked out?

Could you tell me
before you act next time?

You’re welcome.
The birthday is only once a year.

49

It’s no big deal.

No. I guessed.

you had a mixed expression.

Because you like him.

128
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,170
Yeah, just because I like him,

129
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,570
I should talk nicely.

130
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,320
I should pretend to be a nice girl.

131

I may feel sick.

are in a relationship, aren’t we?

Why can’t you be in a relationship too?

139
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,220
No. No.

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,940
I’d better give up.

141
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,020
If he rejects me, I’ll be humiliated.

142
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,140
Don’t regret in the future.

143
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,490
Just have a try.

144

Ha Rin Oh!

145
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,060

What do you think?

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
How many times must I teach you
before you understand?

149
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,980
Drop it if you don’t want to teach me.

150
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,650
Give it to me.

151
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:49,710
Look.

152
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,170
According to how you rolled it,

153
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,850
you’ll get different numbers of photos.

154
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,810
But we can only take 24 photos.

155
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,740
But if you clamp the ending part well,

156
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,690
you can take 25 photos.

157
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,580
Oh.

158
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,850
I taught you. You should go home now.

159
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,580
I’ll keep on working.

160
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,640
Why do you always
print the photos alone?

161
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,830
Others never come.

162
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,790
Because I said
I would like to do it alone.

163
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:16,990
What?

164
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,520
Want to help me?

165
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,370
I’m...

166
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,120
I’m just trying to help.

167
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,730
Anyway,

168
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,960
I never expected Su Jin Do
or Ui Yeong Kim.

169
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,650
But I thought Eun Seong Cha
would come and help you.

171
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,890
He’s just like them.

172
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,000
He isn’t!

173
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,090
He’s the most normal person among us.

What?

180
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,670
You really think he’s better than me?

181
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,570
Of course.

182
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,480

Oh, friend...

You were off work early.

Yeah. I haven’t done this
for a long time.

Why are animals deserted every day?

I’m disillusioned with humanity.

Yeah.

I shouldn’t have...

271
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,780
Why did you say sorry?

272
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,120
Yeah.

273
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,060
You didn’t smile on every birthday
in the past ten years.

So far, I still can’t believe that.

Yeah, why did he do that?

277
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,080
Why did he?

278
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,410
He didn’t always lose control
of his emotions.

279
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,150
Maybe it was just too late to...

280
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,180
Don’t talk nonsense!

281
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,920

I’m not the only one who is confused.

283
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:53,780
Right?

284
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,470
Why did he kill himself?

285
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,360
Why on earth did he?

286
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,450
It was my fault.

287
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,860
It was because of me.

288
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,170
I’ll leave you alone.

289
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,890

I’m fine.

Thank you.

297
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,690
Thinking about the past,

298
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,130
it seems that I never noticed

299
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,120
your annoyance or sadness.

300
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,580
I never cared for that.

301
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,930
If I had taken more notice of you

302
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,140
or cared more about you,

303
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,570
would you

304
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,320
still be alive?

305
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,640
I thought I forgot about the past.

306
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,890
In fact, I didn’t.

307
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,920
Whenever I think of you,

308
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,500
I can’t help weeping.

You may find it disgusting
to read a letter from me.

313
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,640
But I have a reason to write it.

314

Because I’m not brave enough
to tell you in the face.

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,260
What? You don’t like my film camera?

339
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,050
Ha Rin Oh,

340
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,150
shall I lend mine to you?

341
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,130
You’ve got a film camera, too?

342
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,660
Don’t.

343
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,720
She’s a wrecker. She wrecks everything.

344
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,700
It doesn’t matter. I don’t often use it.

345
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,820
Indeed,

346
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,930
you’re far better than this stingy guy.

347
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,410
Oh.

348
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,130
I’ll take it to your class tomorrow.

349
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,280
I see.

350
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,470
Satisfied?

351
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,980
What? Didn’t you refuse to do that?

352
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,650
You kept urging me
so that I had to take one photo.

353
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,280
Anyway,

354
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,690
I’ve taken a photo of you.

355
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,500
Let’s go.

356
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,090
I didn’t smile just now.

357
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,860
Would you like to take another one?
