00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,260
(Did I give him any drink?)
(Special points.)

167
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,700
(No hesitation scars were found
that often appeared in a suicide.)

168
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,020
(I want to see you after class.)
See you at the photo studio.

169
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,950
He texted that to me.

170
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,310
But why did Eun Seong Cha say

171
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,650
this part wasn’t important?

172
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Oh, this part isn’t important.
Move to the next page.

173
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,710
It’s weird, anyway.

174
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,090
I can’t rashly believe
the preserved information.

175
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,690
I must confirm it with my eyes.

176
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,140
From start to end.

177
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:46,960
Sir.

178
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,420
- What?
- She put down her arm.

179
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,830
What? Don’t move.

180
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,630
Ha Rin Oh, make the pose again.

181
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,020
What pose?

182
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,060
(Statue of Liberty)

183
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,560
Yeah. Because you forgot
to bring the statue.

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,220
Stop laughing.

185
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,800
- Come on!
- Ha Rin Oh!

186
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,180
Where are we going?
Shouldn’t we go to the shop?

187
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,750
To Seo Jun Ji...

188
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,900
To your boyfriend’s class.

189
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,890
Why?

190
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,450
I have something to do.

191
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,130
Then go alone. Why must you take me?

192
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,570
If I leave you alone,
you’ll be sad again.

193
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,390
I will? Come on!

194
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,640
Excuse me.

195
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,730
Seo Jun Ji...

196
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,740
We’re having a PE class.
He must be on the basketball court.

197
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,400
Basketball court?

198
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,710
Let’s go.

199
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,030
But the class begins momentarily.

200
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,210
It doesn’t matter now.

201
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,260
Then what matters?

202
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,030
I’m not saying this
because he’s my boyfriend.

203
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,950
Even from afar,
Ui Yeong Kim is the coolest guy, right?

204
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,480
Hope you still think so in ten years.

205
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,030
What?

206
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,370
Nothing.

207
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,450
Hey,

208
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,960
look at him.

209
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,960
The student standing beside Seo Jun Ji.

210
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,150
Which one?

211
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,070
Sin U Kim?

212
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,780
Sin U Kim?

213
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,610
Someone in our class named Sin U Kim.

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,000
He hates Seo Jun Ji.

215
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,200
He’s Sin U Kim?

216
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,020
Mm.

217
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,000
Ui Yeong Kim says

218
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,680
he’s a weird boy.

219
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,380
- What?
- Are you all right?

220
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,210
Seo Jun Ji!

221
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,500
Is your arm hurt?

222
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,610
Ah!

223
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,090
Gosh! Looks like he’s hurt.

224
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,020
Sin U Kim, what’s wrong with you?

225
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,510
What?

226
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,300
You pushed Seo Jun Ji deliberately.

227
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,000
I didn’t. That was an accident.

228
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,020
What accident? I saw that.

229
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,600
Forget it. It doesn’t matter.
No more argument.

230
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,210
I don’t need you to apologize.

231
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,400
But I want you to be more careful.

232
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,650
You’re so obnoxious.

233
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,020
What?

234
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,640
I asked you to play basketball.
But what are you doing?

235
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,640
What happened to you?

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
I sprained my wrist in the game.

237
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,990
I have to go to the clinic.

238
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:51,850
Go ahead.

239
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,900
Seo Jun Ji!

240
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,620
What?

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,820
Why are you here?

242
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,880
Are you all right? Is it serious?

243
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,640
No. Just a little sprain.

244
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,250
Let me have a look.

245
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,380
It doesn’t matter.

246
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,980
It does matter!

247
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,580
Just because you don’t care
for your body,

248
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,770
he dared to push you, didn’t he?

249
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,240
Why are you so angry?

250
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,270
You’re scaring me.

251
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,810
Let’s go. To the clinic.

252
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,080
Ah!

253
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,010
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

254
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,290
Let’s get to the clinic
before it swells up.

255
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,970
Don’t bother. I’m not a kid.

256
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,980
I can go alone.

257
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,960
You can?

258
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,800
Then I’m leaving.

259
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,290
I...

260
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,130
I can go alone.

261
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,550
But if we go together,

262
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,970
it’ll be better.

263
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,360
Let’s go.

264
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,510
Try moving your wrist.

265
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,070
- Does it hurt?
- A little bit.

266
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,830
Is it serious?

267
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,800
Not really.

268
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,700
I told you.

269
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,810
The throbbing will last
for about two weeks

270
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,330
and it’ll be hard for you to use it.

271
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,270
Don’t move your wrist at all.

272
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,080
I won’t.

273
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,670
Luckily, you hurt your left hand.

274
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,690
It’s not lucky. He’s a left-hander.

275
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,690
Wait.

276
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,060
Yeah. Isn’t he a left-hander?

277
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,200
But his left wrist was hurt.

278
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,980
(The artery of his right hand was cut.)
(His parents rejected the autopsy.)

279
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,330
How did he cut his right wrist
with a wounded left hand?

280
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,980
(2. The case may be closed as a suicide.)
And he even...

281
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,180
(3. No “hesitation scars” were found
that often appeared in a suicide.)

282
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,940
Cut it quickly
without any hesitation scars.

283
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,340
(Special points.
No hesitation scars were found.)

284
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,160
What are you thinking about?

285
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,640
I’m thinking about that day.

286
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,460
(Morning of his suicide, June 10, 2011)

287
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,900
(Morning of his suicide, June 10, 2011)
You know what day it is today, right?

288
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,570
What day is it today?

289
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,740
Gift. My birthday gift.

290
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,390
It’s a birthday gift for me?

291
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,990
Yes.

292
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,220
I can’t ride the bike. So you ride it.

293
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,380
I’m hurt, aren’t I?

294
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,560
Right.

295
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,470
On the morning of my birthday,
you couldn’t use your left hand.

296
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,000
You didn’t kill yourself.

297
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,510
What?

298
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,900
Seo Jun Ji!

299
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,140
You didn’t kill yourself!

300
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,100
(Photos for time travel
can’t be copied.)

301
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,910
Who does Seo Jun Ji think he is?

302
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,620
He’s way too annoying, isn’t he?
