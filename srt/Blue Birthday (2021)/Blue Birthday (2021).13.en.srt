Lost contact with your mother?

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,600
You must be very scared.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,650
What’s your name?

00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,940
- I’m Hye Min Ji.
- Hye Min?

- You will?
- of course, I will.

We were rebuked all because of you.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,450
Just steal as you were told.
Why bother to argue?

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,310
We were all abandoned, anyway.

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,760
I wasn’t abandoned.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,630
What, then?

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,310
I just got lost.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,680
Who would believe that?
You’re just lying.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,020
I’m not lying.

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,900

Look, you indeed stole them!

What the hell!

32

How can I sell them?
Will you be responsible?

33
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,990
I’m sorry, my girl.

34
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,960
I didn’t know you were so close to me.

But,

36
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,200

Su Jin Do!

71

I’m sorry.

73

I’m sorry for having suspected you.

- Sleep.

77

What do you mean?

78
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,700
When we were in Grade 11,
you were taken to the police station.

79
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,300
Why did you suddenly bring it up?

80
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,370
You knelt and begged me
for pardon, didn’t you?

81
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,610
I should have trusted you.

82
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,810
You must have been sad.

83
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,320
I was, of course.

84
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,560
But if I were you,
I would suspect that, too.

85

- Eun Seong called you, too?
- What?

88
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,720
He said Seo Jun Ji was drunk, then I...

89
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,230
Seo Jun Ji is drunk?

90
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,390
He doesn’t look drunk at all.

91
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,460
There you are.

92
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,790
- Feed it to him.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,770
Seo Jun Ji, aren’t you drunk?

94
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,550
Me?

95
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,530
He was kidding.
Or how could he get you here?

96
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,160
I’m glad you’re all right.

97
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,440
Yeah, right.

98
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,830
- If he were drunk, he’d be embarrassed.
- Yeah.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,030
What are you doing?

100
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
- I want a hug.
- No. Are you nuts? We’re in a pub.

101
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,990
How dare you say that to your boyfriend?

102
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,020
What?!

103
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,580
(This is a life
I’ve been longing for.)

104
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,070
I want a kiss.

105
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,430
(I’m no longer uneasy
because of the fear of losing him.)

106
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,720
- What’s wrong?
- Did you lose your mind?

107
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,880
How dare you!
Eun Seong Cha, you’re dead meat.

108
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,820
He’s not drunk. He’s not!

109
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,040
(This is the life)

110

(where I feel the original happiness.)

111
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,810
Did you come
because you thought I was drunk?

112
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,230
Yeah, I don’t want anyone else
to take you away.

113
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,750
What do we do this weekend?

114
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,240
This weekend?

115
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,710
We can have a drink, too.

116
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,680
Have a drink?

117
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,410
- The two of us.
- The two of us?

118
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,610
What? You don’t want it?

119
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,710
No, I want it a lot.

120
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,770
Let’s have a drink this weekend.

121
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,270
- Oh, no.
- What? You’ve got an appointment?

122
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,430
My sister got out of prison last week.

123
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,670
We’re going to celebrate it
this weekend.

124
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,700
- We may have a drink another day.
- Hye Min?

125
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,790
- She was out of prison so quickly?
- Yes.

126
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,530
Mom asked me to be with them
this weekend.

127
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,020
(Hye Min came out so quickly?)

128
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,280
Shall I cancel that?

129
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,360
No. Stay with your family.

130
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
- Let’s have a drink next weekend.
- Thank you.

131
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,210
Are you okay?

132
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:04,570
What?

133
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,360
Are you okay with that now?

134
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,210
I’m not sure.

135
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,620
Everyone is just trying hard to live.

136
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,260
Mom, Dad, Hye Min, and me.

137
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,190
What are you doing?

138
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,500
Sorry, you woke up.

139
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,510
Which one looks better?

140
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,580
- This one.
- This? Thank you.

141
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,000
It smells good.

142
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,920
Breakfast is ready. Have it
before you go to work. Got it?

143
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,850
What for breakfast?

144
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,480
Bean sprout soup.

145
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,420
How do I look?

146
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,460
Whose boyfriend are you? So cool.

147
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,660
You must be still sleepy.

148
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,720
I had meant to drive you to work.
But I have a meeting this morning. Sorry.

149
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,250
It’s okay. See you later.

150
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,780
I’ll call you after work. Bye.

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,620
There will? I get it.

166
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,390
Everybody, please come this way.

167
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,400
Please confirm your names here.

168
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,190
Excuse me, your name, please.

169
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,070
I’m Hyeon Seok I.

171
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,050
Hello.

172
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,400
(List of volunteers for the first half of 2021.)
- I’m Jong Ha Bak. - All right.

173
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,210
Hello.

174
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,510
- I’m Heon Jae Mun.
- All right.

175
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,740
Hello.

176
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,270
- I’m Jin A Bak.
- All right.

177
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,820
(12 Jin A Bak)

178
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,770
An extra volunteer. Next.

179
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,660
Long time no see.

180
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,910
Hye Min, why are you here?

181
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,260
To be a volunteer, obviously.

182
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,450
We haven’t met for years.
Ha Rin, it’s nice to meet you.

183
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,760
Ha Rin, you know her?

184
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,130
Hello, I’m kind of Ha Rin’s sister.
We’re close.

185
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,190
Nice to meet you.

186
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,690
Hello.

187
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,330
I didn’t know Ha Rin knew you.

188
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,180
- Did you know she would come?
- I didn’t.

189
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,080
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

190
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,020
Ha Rin, have a talk with her.

191
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,190
We’ll go guide the volunteers.

192
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,490
Don’t bother.

193
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,440
- It’s okay.
- It’s okay. Don’t worry.

194
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,160
Let’s go.

195
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,280
Hye Min, let’s get in, too.

196
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,460
Embarrassed to see me, aren’t you?

197
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,440
What?

198
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,440
You must be embarrassed.

199
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:47,810
Ha Rin,

200
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,930
I spent ten years in prison
and thought a lot.

201
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,720
You may not believe me,
but I indeed reflected on myself.

202
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,190
I regretted it, too.

203
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,950
I shouldn’t have done that,
even for my parents’ sake.

204
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,080
I’m here as a volunteer.
I’ll finish my work first.

205
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,220
We can have a talk later.

206
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,130
All right. Come with me.

207
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,820
(Clinic)

208
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,050
What a busy day we have!

209
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,610
Yeah.

210
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,570
Luckily, we have many volunteers
and they’re efficient.

211
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,290
Indeed. We don’t usually have
more than 10 volunteers like today.

212
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:51,760
Right.

213
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,070
Oh, Ha Rin,

214
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,440
the girl who said she was close to you
was very hard-working.

215
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,860
Even during the break,
she asked to do more work.

216
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:02,870
She did?

217
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,020
I don’t know
if she can really handle so much work.

218
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,360
But I hope she can often come, right?

219
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,000
I agree.

220
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,950
I’m starving.

221
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,730
Thanks for the day.

222
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,670
- Thanks for your day.
- Thanks for the day.

223
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,850
Thanks for your work.

224
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,220
Hye Min, wait!

225
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,480
You didn’t leave a number.

226
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,240
May I use my mother’s?

227
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,000
I was just out of prison
and haven’t bought a phone yet.

228
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,480
Yes. It doesn’t matter.

229
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,060
Here.

230
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,760
See you, Hye Min.

231
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,020
Ha Rin!

232
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,420
What?

233
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,320
May I have your number?

234
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,210
Is it not convenient
because I use my mother’s number?

235
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,810
No. Give me your phone.

(Animal Rescue Center)

238
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,820
Here.

239
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,210
Thank you.

240
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,530
I’ll call you when I’m free.

242
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,910
What? Hye Min?

243
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,390
She served as a volunteer?

244
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,260
Yeah. I was freaked out.

245
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,100
Awesome! Volunteered so soon?
What was she thinking of?

246
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,960
Can she be up to something?

247
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,920
It’s very possible,
considering her temper.

248
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,310
Whenever I think of
how she framed me up, I’m super annoyed!

249
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,470
She didn’t seem to be up to anything.

250
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:02,290
Even my colleagues praised her
for her good work.

251
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,530
She killed... She had
a criminal record, anyway.

252
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,210
Even if she calls you,
don’t answer it. Got it?

253
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,450
Yes.

254
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Ui Yeong Kim has come.
I’ll text you later.

255
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,180
I’m exhausted.

256
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,090
I’m energetic again.

257
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,830
I’m so tired.

258
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,860
Why are you late today?

259
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,860
I didn’t mean to. I was given some work
just before I was off work.

260
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,950
The new director I told you about.

261
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,920
He only assigned work to me.

262
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,160
I’m sorry.

263
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,040
I taught you how to apologize, didn’t I?

264
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,310
We were supposed to meet at 7:00 PM.
But I’m half an hour late.

265
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,460
It was because of the annoying director!
But it’s my fault.

266
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,740
I won’t be late again.
Please forgive me.

267
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,340
You won’t be late again?

268
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,960
All right,
for the sake of your cuteness.

269
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,860
Let’s go. I’m starving.

270
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,890
Starving?

271
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,160
What would you like to eat?

272
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,460
Tteokbokki?

273
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,570
Tteokbokki.

274
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,800
- How about tteokbokki?
- All right.

275
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,650
Let’s go. Go, go.

276
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,560
Wu Ji, come and have some food.

277
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,780
(Seo Jun Ji: Are you at work?)
(Yes, just arrived. The soup tastes good!)

278
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,740
(Seo Jun Ji: Of course. I made it.)
(Everybody can make bean sprout soup!)

279
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,620
(Seo Jun Ji: Some can’t! Have a nice day.
Love you! Contact later. - Still at work?)

280
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,240
Hello?

281
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,070
This is the Hospital
of Seo Ri University.

282
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,650
What are you calling for?

283
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,830
Do you know Seo Jun Ji?

284
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,350
- He’s dying, but we failed to reach his guardian.
- Taxi!

285
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,980
(It’s not over?)

286
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,740
(Seo Jun Ji)

287
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,000
Seo Jun Ji!

288
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,210
You freaked me out.

289
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,120
What’s wrong? What happened to you?

290
00:19:59,520 --> 00:19:59,920
What?

291
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,590
What are you talking about?

292
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,810
Who told you that? Was it a scam call?

293
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,920
But she told me you were dying.

294
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,580
Don’t believe that.

295
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,850
If she asked for hospitalization expenses,
you would be fooled.

296
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,000
You’re really all right?

297
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,500
I get it now.

298
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,350
I called you
because I couldn’t text you now.

299
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,150
If I didn’t call,
there would be trouble.

300
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,240
I’m all right. Go back home.

301
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,440
Okay. See you at home.

302
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,830
Wu Ji,

303
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,850
have you finished dinner?

304
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,310
Wu Ji?

305
00:20:59,290 --> 00:20:59,960
What’s wrong?

306
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,880
Wu Ji.

307
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,280
What’s wrong?

308
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,000
Darn it!

309
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,650
Hye Min?

310
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,020
Where’s the photo?

311
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,860
Where is it?

312
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,850
Give it to me!

313
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,090
This is the photo, isn’t it?

314
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,740
(More than one person can have
a time travel at the same time.)

315
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,340
Happy birthday!

316
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,710
What?

317
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,900
Today is your birthday.

318
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,610
Blow out the candle.
Or it’s running out.

319
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,410
Is this why you got me out
at half past twelve?

320
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,600
Yes. It’s my best friend’s birthday.

321
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,320
It’s too late now.
It’s dangerous for you to come alone.

322
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,830
Don’t complain
when I’m celebrating your birthday.

323
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,760
Also, I didn’t come alone. All right?

324
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,170
What? Then whom did you come with?

325
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,430
The real party will be at school.

326
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,990
Let’s celebrate it first.

327
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,840
Su Jin Do urged me to come.

328
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,250
Come on! You proposed this.

329
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,500
Today,

330
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,890
thank you for all this.

331
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,310
Give it to me.

332
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
Let me take a photo of you.

333
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,210
Say no more and make a pose.

334
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,580
Here I go!

335
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,860
One, two, three.
