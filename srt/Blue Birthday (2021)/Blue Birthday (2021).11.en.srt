00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,130
Are you all right?

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,710
Seo Jun.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,330
Seo Jun Ji!

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,960
Seo Jun Ji!

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,430
He broke his rib, but luckily,
his internal organs weren’t hurt.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,350
There’s a problem, though.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,130
Maybe his head was hit
so he lost consciousness.

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,510
He’s got a bit concussion.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,080
It may take a while before he wakes up.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,230
How long will it take?

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,900
Well,

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,120
it depends. I can hardly
give a precise time.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,830
It takes time, just like a fracture.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,630
I don’t have much time.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,560
Hello?

19
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,240
Is that the student
who gave us the evidence?

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,160
What’s wrong?

21
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,110
Wait a minute, please.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,240
Such evidence is insufficient.

23
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,870
Why is it insufficient?

24
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,110
Follenir can’t be identified.

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,080
It’s sold without restrain, too.

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,610
We can’t get further confirmation
without the autopsy.

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,760
Then why don’t you just do the autopsy?

28
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,350
It needs the approval of his family.
But they objected.

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,670
Anyway,

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,200
let me remind you.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,640
Don’t spread weird news at school.

32
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,410
(Just as I expected.)

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,330
All right. I see.

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,400
Thanks for calling.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,670
(The police won’t take action
without clearer proof.)

36
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,910
Video recorder.

37
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,760
Will it be enough?

38
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,700
(He must have bought the Follenir
in the nearest pharmacy.)

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,200
Hey, where’s Ha Rin Oh?

40
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,330
What am I? Her mother?

41
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,020
Why did you ask me for her?

42
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,510
You’re her best friend.

43
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,510
No idea. Maybe she’s up to something.

44
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,960
What about Seo Jun Ji?

45
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,720
What am I? His father?

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,090
He didn’t call you?

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,670
No.

48
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,610
Maybe he’s gone somewhere
with Ha Rin Oh.

49
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,080
Why don’t they just be
in a relationship?

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,250
Yeah. No one will object to that.

51
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,980
Right. We’ll totally support them.

52
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,950
- Won’t we?
- Yes. We won’t.

53
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,320
I didn’t hear clearly. What was that?

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,330
Ha Rin Oh and Seo Jun Ji
in a relationship.

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,220
(Ha Rin)

56
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,190
What?

57
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,150
Hello?

58
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:33,810
Ha Rin Oh?

59
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,560
I’m in the studio with the other two.

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,190
Wait.

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,130
Excuse me for a minute.

62
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,960
Does she need to answer the phone alone?

63
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,260
(Ha Rin)

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,310
We’ll be right there.

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,590
Which hospital?

66
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,830
Come after he’s back to the ward.

67
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,230
Anyway, only one family is allowed in.

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,670
He hurt his rib? It must be serious.

69
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,090
Don’t bother about that.

70
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,820
May I ask you for a favor?

71
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,860
Sure. What is it?

72
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,070
I put a video recorder
on the cabinet opposite the studio.

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,140
Video recorder? Why?

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,730
I put it up there for some shooting.

75
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,910
But this morning, I found it missing.

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
Have you ever seen it?

77
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,060
No, I haven’t.

78
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,850
What were you going to shoot?

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,310
Su Jin, listen to me carefully.

80
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,360
You’re back.

81
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,170
Who saw the video recorder?

82
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,530
What video recorder?

83
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,030
The one on the top of the cabinet
opposite the studio.

84
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,280
Neither of you saw it?

85
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,290
I didn’t see it.

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,050
Whose is the video recorder? Why?

87
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,830
It’s Seo Jun Ji’s.

88
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,480
Come and look for it with me.

89
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,780
Let Seo Jun Ji look for it himself.

90
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,980
Why must we do it?

91
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,190
- Because we must find it.
- Why?

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
What... what?

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,460
Be sensitive, will you?

94
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,420
We’re holding hands for the first time.

95
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,310
We just hold hands. What’s the big deal?

96
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,270
(Again, you protected me
from misfortune.)

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,750
This time, I’ll protect you instead.

98
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,780
(Eun Seong Cha)

99
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,670
(She said Sin U Kim was killed)

100
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,110
(and the murderer might be recorded.
She asked us to look for the recorder.)

101
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,910
Could Sin U Kim really be murdered?

102
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,670
I guess so.

103
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,480
After all, Ha Rin Oh never makes fun
of such serious things.

104
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,520
The police knew it, didn’t they?

105
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,590
Perhaps.

106
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,010
Oh, where has Eun Seong Cha gone?

107
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,150
He said he would come this way.

108
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,930
- Su Jin.
- What?

109
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,320
Nothing.

110
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,520
Let’s look for it separately.

111
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,760
All right.

112
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,730
Welcome.

113
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,660
How can I help you?

114
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,210
Excuse me,

115
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,550
has anyone bought Follenir lately?

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,600
About two days ago.

117
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,920
Follenir?

118
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,730
- Anesthetic?
- Yes.

119
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,260
He was wearing the same uniform as mine.

120
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,880
I’m not sure. Mostly old people came.

121
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,650
May I check the CCTV camera?

122
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,810
You can’t, without a legal reason.

123
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,020
Anything happened?

124
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,120
Well...

125
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,070
When can I get in?

126
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,560
Come this way, please.

127
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,560
I’ll come later.

128
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,750
- Not in the broadcasting room?
- No.

129
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,580
- Are you sure?
- I’m sure.

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,460
Hey, Ui Yeong Kim!

131
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:12,900
(Eun Seong Cha)

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,840
I think so.

133
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,430
Really? When?

134
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,080
About two days ago. A tall man.

135
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,970
Man?

136
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,100
A student?

137
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,040
I’m not sure.

138
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,850
Many customers came.

139
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,670
May I check the CCTV camera?

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,190
- Sorry, but it’s fake.
- What?

141
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,890
It’s not a CCTV camera,
but only an idle threat.

142
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,920
It’s lately used in many places.

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,930
(If I were in 2021,)

144
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,080
(I could immediately check
the CCTV camera in rescue centers.)

145
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,790
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

146
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,580
(Warehouse)
What? You freaked me out.

147
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,300
(Eun Seong Cha)

148
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,150
When did you come?

149
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,760
Did you find it?

150
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,380
Can’t you see? No, no, no.

151
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,250
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,060
- I’ll go have a look.
- It’s not there.

153
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,200
- Let’s go. Su Jin is...
- Ui Yeong Kim,

154
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,300
did you really not find it?

155
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,950
What are you talking about?

156
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,180
Why would I lie about that?

157
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,450
I’m asking you again.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,980
Did you really not find it?

159
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,680
No. Why did you ask like that?

160
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,220
(Adult injection and vaccination)

161
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,120
(What if I was sent back to the future
before finding anything?)

162
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,850
Ha Rin Oh.

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,320
What?

164
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,830
Why... why did you wake up?

165
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,910
What are you talking about?
You don’t want that?

166
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,670
I... I didn’t mean that.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
You should have called me
when you woke up.

168
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,560
(To be taken)
I just needed to get the painkiller.

169
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,810
I was bandaged, too.

170
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,130
Do you...?

171
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,950
Do you know how worried I was?

172
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,870
I can take care of myself.
I wasn’t born yesterday.

173
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,650
Are you out of mind? You broke your rib.

174
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,620
Come on, I just think you’re gonna cry.

175
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
I have no time for tears.

176
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,900
Let’s get out and have a talk somewhere.

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,600
I can sit down without your help.

178
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
No. You must be very careful.

179
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,870
Though I want to walk you home...

180
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,700
Though?

181
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,650
But maybe later.
I may not see you again.

182
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,500
So, I don’t want you to go back home.

183
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
I asked our friends to look
for the video recorder at school.

184
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,230
There’s no result yet.

185
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440
- If they find it...
- Ha Rin Oh.

186
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,340
...I’ll go get it.

187
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,350
I tried to check the CCTV camera
in medical centers.

188
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,890
Ha Rin Oh!

189
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,150
What?

190
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,110
I can’t tell
which of us is 28 years old.

191
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,150
What are you talking about,
the high school student?

192
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,070
Now you’re a high school student, too.

193
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,520
Who wears a uniform at the age of 28?

194
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:22,730
No one, right?

195
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,740
No one. So, you’re lucky.

196
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,820
I am?

197
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,020
Think about it.

198
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,730
No one else can travel
through time as we do.

199
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,420
Not really. The murderer can come, too.

200
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,150
Right?

201
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,650
Come on, I mean...

202
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,770
We have chances to try.

203
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,920
If you hadn’t found my photos
or come to see me,

204
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,960
I would be dead without trying anything.

205
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,320
You make sense.

206
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,860
By the way, do you remember that?

207
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,890
What?

208
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,020
In Grade 8, I fell off a bike
and was in hospital for the first time.

209
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,700
I remember.

210
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,930
In fact,

211
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,820
it was the price I had to pay

212
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,610
from stopping you
from being hit by a car.

213
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,650
Hey, Seo Jun Ji!

214
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
What are you doing here?

215
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,820
Come on. How were you riding the bike?

216
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,550
With one foot?

217
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,540
Did you skip the cram school again
by saying you needed to visit a patient?

218
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,570
You’re right.

219
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,940
Guess what I thought of
when I saw you in the ward.

220
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,270
You shouldn’t have saved me?

221
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,470
Then I couldn’t be talking now.

222
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,830
Come on, girl.

223
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,900
You’re good at spoiling the romance.

224
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,980
What? Then what were you thinking of?

225
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,240
I felt glad that I saved you

226
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,940
and luckily, you were still alive.

227
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,310
I paid the price.

228
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,110
But I had a chance to save you.

229
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,170
I was also afraid.

230
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,040
Because I didn’t know

231
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,630
what price I had to pay

232
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,710
or what misfortune I might have.

233
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,740
But now, I feel different.

234
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,380
To save me, you came all the way here.

235
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,430
I have no reason to be afraid anymore.

236
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,640
I don’t know what misfortune we’ll have.

237
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,930
But no matter what happens,
I will save you.

238
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,180
The same to you.

239
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,070
Don’t be afraid of anything.

240
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,550
You’re not alone now.

241
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,490
(I’m not alone.)

242
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,590
(I have you.)

243
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,950
(You have me, too.)

244
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,300
All right. I won’t be afraid.

245
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,260
(Because we’re fighting for each other.)

246
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,570
Ha Rin Oh, where are you now?

247
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,780
(Eun Seong Cha)

248
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,000
What do you think you’re doing?

249
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,300
(Warehouse)

250
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,720
Come on. I said no. What are you doing?

251
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,650
What’s this?

252
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,610
Well, it’s...

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,280
Let me explain. It’s...

254
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,320
You stole it?

255
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,520
Don’t say that.

256
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,470
I didn’t steal it. I...

(Welcome to the Photography Club)
(A couple of hours ago)

258
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,800
I can’t believe they left this.

259
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,840
It’s so expensive.

260
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,510
Now that you saw the recorder,
why did you steal it?

261
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,340
I mean, why did you hide it?

262
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,140
You found it, didn’t you? Where is it?

263
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,340
(Eun Seong Cha)

264
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,330
What? You look weird.

(Seo Jun Ji)

266
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,050
Where’s Su Jin?

267
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,400
She...

268
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,240
Are you all right?
Didn’t you break your rib?

269
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,200
Can you walk like this?

270
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,980
I’m fine.
Let’s check the video recorder.

What are you doing? Give it to me.

One, two, three!

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,850
What’s this?

279
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,470
May I open it and look?

280
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,240
Sure. Open it and look.

281
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,190
What is it?

282
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,830
How did you know I wanted the perfume?

283
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,980
Oh, dear. It smells so good.

284
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,300
- It does?
- Yes.

285

Do you like the gift or me?

286

You. I really like you a lot.

I can’t breathe.

288
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,800
Your turn. Close your eyes.

289
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,190
What? I have to close my eyes, too?

290
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,750
Come on. Be quick. Be quick.

291
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:17,390
Open your eyes now.

Beautiful, isn’t it?
