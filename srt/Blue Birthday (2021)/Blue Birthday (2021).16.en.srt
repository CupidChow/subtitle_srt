1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,790
Hello, may I take this swing?

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,980
- How old are you?
- I’m eight.

3
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,300
We’re of the same age. I’m eight, too.

4
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,750
- Which school are you in?
- Seo Ri Primary School.

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,420
You are? Which class?

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,430
I don’t know yet.

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,020
Why? Why don’t you know?

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,940
I moved here today.
I’m not going to school until tomorrow.

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,590
- What?
- What’s your name?

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,640
Seo Jun. Seo Jun Ji.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,860
- What about you?
- Ha Rin Oh, come over!

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,130
Be right there!

13
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,350
I’m Ha Rin Oh. See you next time.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,400
(See you next time.
That’s the first promise we made.)

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,080
(Now, I don’t think
I can keep the promise.)

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,880
Seo Jun Ji!

17
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,360
(I’m sorry, Ha Rin Oh.)

18
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,540

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,460

=My Blue Birthday=

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,900
(7:30, June 11, (Saturday))

21
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,610
(Even after one day,
I still don’t have tinnitus.)

22
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
Hye Min is back to the past.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,380
Ha Rin, listen carefully.
Leave the school immediately.

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,740
What? Why?

25
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,860
The police called me
and said Hye Min ran away.

26
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,480
I guess she’ll get back to school soon.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,310
What? But I haven’t found
the evidence yet.

28
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,220
I’ll find it. Don’t worry. Leave first.

29
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,180
The back gate is closed.
Take the front gate. Got it?

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,270
(You changed it, right?)

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,560
(Why? Why did you do that?)

32
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,760
(Why?)

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,380
Ha Rin, you got up so early.

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,330
You must be tired.
Sleep for a bit longer.

35
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,090
It’s okay.

36
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,420
Madam, you should have some sleep.

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,700
You haven’t slept since yesterday.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,390
- Hello, Madam.
- What are you coming for?

39
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,620
- We...
- Are you Ha Rin Oh?

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,030
Yes.

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,190
Ha Rin, could you have a word with us?

42
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,500
The suspect...

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,280
She doesn’t say anything
unless you’re there.

44
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,270
Hye Min?

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,840
We don’t think she’ll confess
until you're there.

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,780
We’ll be in the investigation room, too.
Don’t worry.

47
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,160
If you don’t want to go, it’s okay.

48
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,990
Do I have to go now?

49
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,930
Behave yourself. Don’t talk nonsense.

50
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,480
There you are.

51
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,670
Ha Rin, you've really got balls.

52
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,530
You can do nothing here, right?

53
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,410
Except for talking to me.

54
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,560
Are you sure? Let’s wait and see.

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,850
So, why did you ask to see me?

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,020
Why?

57
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,970
I’m just curious.

58
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,620
I wonder if Seo Jun Ji is dead.

59
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,780
You antisocial psychopath!

60
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,910
I just found it funny.

61
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,620
He persuaded me to surrender myself.

62
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,310
Who did he think he was?

63
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,070
I’m gonna kill you!

64
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,010
- Go to hell!
- Hye Min, enough!

65
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:45,870
Hye Min.

66
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,740
Hye Min, are you all right?

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,520
Hye Min.

68
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,780
He had a chance.

69
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,300
But it wouldn’t help.
He didn’t want to kill me, anyway.

70
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,870
Idiot.

71
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,170
Mercy makes you fail.

72
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,580
I should have stabbed his neck,
instead of his belly.

73
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,730
But that scene was still worth watching.

74
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,750
The only regret is that
the police came too soon.

75
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,560
However,

76
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,630
he didn't care about himself.

77
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,690
To him, you’re the most important.

78
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,610
Ha Rin Oh.

79
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,350
It matters most when you’re alive.

80
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,370
So?

81
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,000
So...

82
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,800
I’ll keep torturing you until I die.

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,410
It’s the only way
to make Seo Jun Ji miserable, isn’t it?

84
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,220
I’m stuck here, but it isn’t over.

85
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,650
I’ll go to you after I’m released,
as I did last time.

86
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,190
You can expect that.

87
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,040
You can’t avoid it, either.

88
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,580
- What?
- The price for changing the past.

89
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,320
You and he both mentioned the price.

90
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,780
You’ll pay the most terrible price.

91
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,240
Even if you’re lucky enough to avoid it,

92
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,880
I’ll still make you
pay the price you deserve.

93
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,760
You can also expect that.

94
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,560
All right. I’ll be waiting.

95
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,490
Hello?

96
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,550
Ha Rin.

97
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,290
Madam.

98
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,600
Seo Jun...

99
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,300
What happened to him?

100
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,020
To Seo Ri Hospital, please.

101
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,880
(I threatened
to make her pay the price,)

102
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,170
(but I’m the scared one.)

103
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,510
(Because none of us knows)

104
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,330
(what other misfortune we will face.)

105
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,630
(That you’re no longer alive)

106
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,720
(is the greatest misfortune to me.)

107
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,410
- Come here. Where are you running?
- Get her!

108
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,260
(So, Seo Jun, be alive!)

109
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,080
Miss Hye Min Ji, wake up!

110
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,460
There’s a car accident at the crossing
in front of the police station.

111
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,620
Call for vehicle restraint and support.
Repeat that.

112
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:39,820
(Hye Min Ji)

113
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,640
Seo Jun Ji!

114
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,500
There you are.

115
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
What are you listening to?

116
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,580
(A few months later)

117
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,830
What? How childish you are!

118
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
You look like a tiptoeing meerkat.
Who are you waiting for?

119
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,890
Who else can it be?

120
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,730
Seo Jun Ji.

121
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,750
Why aren’t you in a relationship yet?

122
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,320
Why not confess your love to him first?

123
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,160
Don’t bother. I’ll handle it, all right?

124
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,020
She said she would handle it.

125
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,560
This is how you handled it?

126
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,500
You want a fight?

127
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,280
Come on.

128
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,210
I’m so scared. Scared.

129
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,170
When can they be mature?

130
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,310
It’s hard to say. In ten years, maybe.

131
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,270
- They won’t be.
- What?

132
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,390
Nothing.

133
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,850
Why hasn’t he come out yet?

134
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,850
Ha Rin...

135
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,470
What? What’s wrong?

136
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,470
I...

137
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,790
Hey, Ha Rin Oh!

138
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,480
Come quickly!

139
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,040
He always asks me not to be late.
But he’s late.

140
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,460
What were you going to say?

141
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,540
- Nothing. I’ll leave you alone.
- Mm.

142
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,300
Ha Rin.

143
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,570
I heard your conversation
with Seo Jun Ji in the Photography Club.

144
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,210
- Are you really from the future?
- Mm.

145
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,910
Are we still good friends in the future?

146
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,620
Of course. You’re my best friend.

147
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,220
I get it.

148
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,480
I’ll leave you alone.

149
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,700
Confess your love to Seo Jun Ji today.
Don’t leave any regret.

150
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,030
What are you looking at?

151
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
What took you so long?

152
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,330
I’m not late. I’m just in time.

153
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,020
Where are they?

154
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,610
I asked them to leave first.

155
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,530
- I have something to tell you.
- What?

156
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,250
You know I like you, don’t you?

157
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,880
- Yes.
- Be my boyfriend!

158
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,980
- What makes you laugh?
- See?

159
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,780
See what?

160
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,830
I said you would confess first,
didn’t I?

161
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,160
So, will you be my boyfriend?

162
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,210
Yes!

163
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,890
Thank you.
