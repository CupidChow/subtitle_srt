(Welcome to the Photography Club)

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,480
Hey, Ui Yeong Kim!
Why didn’t you answer the phone?

12
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,680
What? Seo Jun Ji?

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,760
You left the hospital so soon?

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,690
Yes.

15
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,390
You should have told me.

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,190
I didn’t go visit you because I had to
look for the video recorder.

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,120
What? Why are you all staring at me?

18
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,140
Well...

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,260
- Su Jin.
- Hey, Su Jin Do,

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,560
let’s have a talk.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,590
Are you...?

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,110
It’s not me! I swear!

23
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,290
They’re the same.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,300
The hairpin she wore
and the one you usually wear.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,580
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,550
Didn’t you say

27
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,810
you made the hairpin in a studio?

28
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,140
I wasn’t there alone.

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,700
There were a dozen girls in the studio.

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,260
What about the coat?

31
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,170
You’ve been wearing it since last year.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,180
Many other girls wear
this type of coat, all right?

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,290
Yesterday, I was with you all day.
How could I...?

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,280
Not all day.

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,360
What?

(Seo Jun Ji)

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,640
You didn’t have lunch with us.

38
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,760
Right.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,540
Where were you?

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
In... in the shop.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,740
The shop owner was sick
and it wasn’t open yesterday.

42
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,900
What are you talking about? It was open.

43
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,920
- I went there before...
- Wait.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,860
Didn’t you ask for a leave
and went home yesterday?

45
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,620
I went back home
after going to the shop.

46
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,780
Why did you go back home?

47
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,300
When did you arrive home
and when did you come back?

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,520
Enough!

49
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,360
She said it wasn’t her!

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,400
Are you pushing her for a video
where you couldn’t see a face?

51
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,600
We’re not pushing her, but asking her.

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,840
The girl in the video was dressed
just like Su Jin Do.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,450
It doesn’t mean that was her.

54
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,980
You also suspected her, didn’t you?

55
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,720
Then you hid the video recorder, right?

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,360
What?

57
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,770
Stop it.

58
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,020
Are you really my friends?

59
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,110
How could you suspect me
of killing someone?

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,240
You decide if we can still be friends.

61
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,510
I’m not the murderer, anyway.

62
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,970
Su Jin. Su Jin Do!

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,890
But could it really be Su Jin?

64
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,980
She didn’t have a reason for that.

65
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,090
You make sense.

66
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,000
Su Jin Do isn’t that kind of girl.
But she and the murderer are so alike.

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,760
Are you Su Jin Do?

68
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,500
Yes. And you are...?

69
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,540
Please come to the police station
and have a talk with us.

70
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,280
About what?

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,420
Sin U Kim died yesterday at your school.
You know him, don’t you?

72
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,120
Let’s go.

73
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,100
But where are you going?

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,970
- Su Jin!
- Su Jin Do.

75
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,500
(Investigation Room)

76
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,820
Don’t be afraid.

77
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,430
Just answer my questions honestly.

78
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,360
Then will you let me go?

79
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,240
We still need to confirm your alibi.

80
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,010
I can’t leave until you confirm that?

81
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,820
Are these yours?

82
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,360
Yes.

83
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,440
This girl is also you, isn’t it?

84
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,280
I said it wasn’t me!

85
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,010
Lots of students wear this kind of coat.
You can have an ask.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,590
And this...

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,970
You made it, didn’t you?

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,260
I did make it.

89
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,830
But I wasn’t the only one who made this.

90
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,440
If you confirm it in the studio...

91
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,480
We just did.

92
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,200
Among those who made the hairpin,
only you’re from Seo Ri High School.

93
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,330
Other students and teachers also said

94
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,960
the girl in the video
looked like you, Su Jin Do.

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,820
It wasn’t me. Please trust me. Please.

96
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:42,760
All right.

97
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,550
Where were you and what were you doing
from 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM yesterday?

98
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,460
According to your friends,
you didn’t have lunch with them.

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,630
I’m asking you the last time.

100
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,640
What were you doing alone?

101
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,090
Actually, I...

102
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,790
- Constipation?
- Yes, constipation.

103
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,090
You mean she was absent
because of constipation?

104
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,430
She suffered from it for four days
and had a bellyache yesterday.

105
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,100
You were the last person she met
before she asked for a leave.

106
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,540
Did you find anything weird?

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,610
No.

108
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,800
Why didn’t she use the school bathroom?
Why did she have to go home?

109
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,390
She said she couldn’t do it out of home.

110
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,750
You’re her boyfriend.
Don’t you know that?

111
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,200
Of course, I don’t.

112
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,570
Right. Maybe she didn’t want
her boyfriend to know it.

113
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,230
But this isn’t the problem.

114
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,240
According to her, she fainted
on her way back home.

115
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,480
Fainted?

116
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,530
So,

117
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,540
after you fainted
because of a bellyache,

118
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,470
- a passing deliveryman saved you, right?
- Right.

119
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,090
Then he rode you home?

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,610
Tell me more about the deliveryman.

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,050
He’s from a Chinese restaurant, I guess.

122
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,090
- What’s the name of the restaurant?
- Name?

123
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,360
- Go back home. Go.
- Thank you.

124
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,540
(Eatery)

125
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,950
- An eatery.
- Eatery?

126
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,580
I’m not very sure.

127
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,630
But there’re so many
Chinese restaurants in Korea.

128
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,670
Are you lying?

129
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,290
I’m not!

130
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,990
Why didn’t she confess
she had constipation?

131
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,990
Maybe she felt too ashamed.

132
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,810
Even if she was ashamed,
she shouldn’t have...

133
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,520
Can it be a lie?

134
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,150
What do you think?
She’s in the police station.

135
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,740
But it doesn’t make sense.

136
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,910
She could have used the bathroom.

137
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,040
She said she had no time for that.

138
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,860
Why did she have no time for that?

139
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,240
Because it was so great to be with me.

140
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,560
- What the...!
- Darn it!

141
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,700
Let’s go find him.

142
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,780
Whom?

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,190
The deliveryman. Isn’t he the witness?

144
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,110
Why do we have to look for him?

145
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,590
Isn’t it what the police should do?

146
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,690
I feel sorry for Su Jin.
We must do something.

147
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,500
She said it wasn’t her,
but we kept pushing her.

148
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,980
(Eun Seong Cha)

149
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,780
Let’s go. Together, we’ll find him soon.

150
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,580
Deliveryman of a Chinese restaurant?

151
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,810
Shall we start from somewhere
near our school?

00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,830
Thank you.

(I’m running out of time.)

(If it wasn’t Su Jin in the video,)

been disguised as her.)

- Have you found him?
- No. Not yet.

164
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,690
I have something to ask you.

165

What is it?

166
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,320
When you first found the recorder,

167
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,720
how did you find it so quickly?

168
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,560
Recorder?

169
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,240
Yesterday, I left the MP3
in the photo studio.

170
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,490
Oh, my!

171
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,170
I can’t believe I left it here.

172
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,020
It’s so expensive.

173
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,740
(Welcome to the Photography Club)

174
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,060
I heard the sound and looked around.

175
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,540
Then I found the video recorder.

176
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,150
It’s new and should be put
in the cabinet.

177
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,120
(Eun Seong Cha)
But I saw Eun Seong Cha’s watch, too.

178
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,480
- Eun Seong’s watch?
- Yes, his watch.

179
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,090
It was broken and kept in the classroom.
When it was missing, we looked for it.

180
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,220
I see. I’ll contact you later.

181
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,540
Hey, Ha Rin Oh!

182
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,680
(Seo Jun Ji)
Who took you so long on the phone?

183
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,590
Ui Yeong Kim.

184
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,970
- We found the deliveryman.
- You did?

185
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,230
Yes. Eun Seong just called.

186
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,410
That’s great.

187
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,240
They went to the police station.
Let’s go there, too.

188
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,960
Wait!

189
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,030
- Let me confirm something.
- What?

190
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,210
Hey!

191
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,170
What on earth do you want to do?

192
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,870
If it’s not Su Jin in the video,

193
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,760
it means the murderer
disguised herself as Su Jin.

194
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,630
That’s right.

195
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,400
It means she knew

196
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,120
there was a video recorder
opposite the photo studio.

197
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,850
So, when Su Jin went back home
because of a bellyache,

198
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,770
she stole her hairpin and coat.

199
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,520
She stole Eun Seong’s watch, too.

200
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,640
Watch?

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,880
Hey, Ha Rin Oh!

202
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,080
(The murderer’s route)

203
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,310
(is becoming clear.)

204
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,820
(June 8 of 2011,
the day Sin U Kim was killed.)

205
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,310
(Yesterday, the murderer
had a time travel to the past.)

206
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,860
(Before she killed Sin U Kim,)

207
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,360
(she disguised herself as Su Jin.)

208
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,820
(20224 Eun Seong Cha)
(After that,)

209
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,060
(she stole Eun Seong’s watch.)

210
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,510
Hey, Sin U Kim.

211
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,850
Someone asked to see you
in the Art Room.

212
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,980
Who?

213
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,770
No idea. Go and you’ll know.

214
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,580
You’re in a club?

215
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,050
It’s not your style.

216
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,590
(She lured Sin U Kim
to the Art Room as planned.)

217
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,400
(Then she walked there,
in the disguise of Su Jin.)

218
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,020
(Sin U Kim)

219
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,450
(Then she killed Sin U Kim.)

220
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,800
(At last, she put Eun Seong’s watch
in the photo studio...)

221
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,820
(Eun Seong Cha)

222
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,110
(Eun Seong Cha)
(...so that he would find the recorder.)

223
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,220
(Then the sudden tinnitus
must have made her panic.)

224
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,790
(And today...)

225
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,210
Wait.

226
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,840
So, we’re looking for evidence
besides Follenir?

227
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,440
She must have left some traces
when she panicked.

228
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,260
For example,

229
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,970
the tool she used.

230
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,540
(Searching)

231
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,160
But why did she steal Eun Seong’s watch?

232
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,550
Why not something from us?

233
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,830
You’re right.

234
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,870
Did she pick someone
who could call the police

235
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,710
after he saw Su Jin in the video?

236
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,140
Right.

237
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,450
If Eun Seong saw it,
he would call the police,

238
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,190
because it was the right thing to do.

239
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,180
We’re not pushing her, but asking her.

240
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,530
The girl in the video was dressed
just like Su Jin Do.

241
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,370
What?

242
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,920
Yes.

243
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,540
Something unexpected happened.

244
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,370
Ui Yeong found the video recorder
before Eun Seong.

245
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,910
But was this the only accident?

246
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,820
If the murderer killed Sin U Kim
in the disguise of Su Jin,

247
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,780
she wouldn’t pass the photo studio
with a recorder opposite to it.

248
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,130
So...

249
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,420
- The window!
- What?

250
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,660
(Do not enter.)

251
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,540
Here. Here. Magnify it.

252
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,280
Wait.

253
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,290
It’s...

254
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,560
Sis... sister?

255
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,230
Hye Min?

256
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,210
No way. They just look alike.

257
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,470
Let’s watch it again.

258
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,700
(Art Room)

259
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,210
So,

260
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,880
the stolen photo...

261
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,390
It was my sister

262
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,890
who killed me?

263
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,180
Seo Jun!

264
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,070
(Ha Rin,)

265
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,470
Who’s that?

266
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,970
(if it’s the truth, what will I do?)

267
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,880
Is this Hye Min Ji’s home?

268
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes. Who are you?

269
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:39,020
(What about my mother
and other families?)

270
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,120
Wait. What happened?

271
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,710
- Calm down. Calm down!
- Hye Min!

272
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,770
Hye Min!

273
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,520
We’ll contact you later.

274
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,140
Hye Min! Hye Min!

275
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,920
Will we have bigger misfortune?

276
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,000
I guess we won’t.

277
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,700
No.

278
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,170
We certainly won’t.

279
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,860
(Changed memories come back
when they’re activated.)

280
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,740
At last, we’re going.

281
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,690
Why are they taking a suitcase?
For immigration?

282
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,770
How lovely!

283
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,710
Guess we’ll have nowhere to sit.

284
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,470
- You’ve brought your camera?
- Yes.

285
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,130
I urged him to bring it.

286
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,060
Take a photo of me now.

287
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,720
How do you expect me to reply?

288
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,160
You’ll certainly say, “I won’t.”

289
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,490
Don’t. Take a photo of me.

290
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,930
- One photo. Just one.
- No.

291
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,230
You’ve brought the camera, anyway.

292
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,220
It’s a waste of films.

293
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,550
One photo. Just one. Please.

294
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,770
Look, I’ve brought this, too.

295
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:34,870
All right, then.

296
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,490
Awesome. Let’s go together.

297
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,470
- No. Do it yourself.
- Come on.

298
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,310
One, two.
