1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,140
Listen carefully.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,330
No matter what happens, don’t die.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,900
What?

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,780
Don’t die!

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,130
I won’t watch you die.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,520
I won’t.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,230
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,180
You think you’re a detective?

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,890
Stop laughing.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,460
I’m very serious.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,740
That’s what makes me laugh.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,840
Whatever.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,160
Is there anything bothering you lately?

14
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,240
Bothering me?

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,780
Nothing.

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,630
Any trouble?

17
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,050
With study, friend, or...?

18
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,490
Love?

19
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:37,510
Or...?

20
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,770
Are you having any trouble lately?

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,420
What happened to you?

22
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,690
No matter what you think of me,

23
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,390
I don’t care.

24
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,560
All I care about is keeping you alive.

25
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,540
=Blue Birthday=

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,220
=Episode 3 Lively Ordinary Days=

27
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,090
In fact, I’m pessimistic and jealous.

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,020
I’m also not as calm
as you all think I am.

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,800
What’s on earth bothering you?

30
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,250
Yeah!

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,540
There she is again.

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,770
To cheer, I guess.

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,200
Cheer? For whom?

34
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,460
Our class, I suppose.

35
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,660
Does she look like
she will cheer for someone?

36
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,050
She doesn’t.

37
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,300
Since she fell,
she’s been behaving weirdly.

38
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,540
She often gets lost in thought
and talks nonsense.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
Su Jin said...

40
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,390
Hey!

41
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,630
(Su Jin)
Where have you gone again?

42
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,540
(Su Jin)

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,720
Aren’t we supposed to go to the shop?

44
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,140
Are you infuriating me again?

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,370
What are you doing here?

46
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,930
Su Jin Do is looking for you.

47
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,800
I just got her text.

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,090
Thank you.

49
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,810
Don’t you play basketball?

50
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,920
No. I’m a bit tired.

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
If I knew you had come, I would play it.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,380
Mm?

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,490
No... nothing.

54
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,310
By the way,

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,580
I have a question.

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,660
What is it?

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,020
You’ve known Seo Jun Ji
for a longer time than me, right?

58
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,230
Yes. So?

59
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,340
Lately,

60
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,330
has he said anything weird?

61
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,800
Weird?

62
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,840
Something like he’s tired or depressed.

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,790
He never complains.

64
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,290
You’re right.

65
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,950
He hasn’t complained?
Not even about one thing?

66
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,720
Think more carefully about it.

67
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,170
He’s the best student in our school

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,230
and he gets on well
with all his classmates.

69
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,890
What problem can he have?

70
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,070
You make sense.

71
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,120
Oh.

72
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,220
Not with all his classmates.

73
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,550
What does that mean?

74
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,620
Someone in our class named Sin U Kim.

75
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,870
Didn’t we agree to surprise Su Jin?

76
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,680
- Ui Yeong had a big plan.
- Mm.

77
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,760
That’s really funny.

78
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,100
- In fact, when we...
- Move over.

79
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,140
(Sin U Kim)

80
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,010
Oh, I’m sorry.

81
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,020
Darn it! Where is it?

82
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,540
What are you looking for?

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,660
May I help you?

84
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,360
- Who do you think you are?
- What?

85
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,310
Who do you think you are? Help me?

86
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,620
Sin U Kim, what did you just say?

87
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,340
Don’t bring bad luck to me.

88
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,360
Mm?

89
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,030
What’s wrong with him?

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,410
He hates Seo Jun Ji.

91
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,520
Sin U Kim?

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,750
He hates Seo Jun Ji, right?

93
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,310
Yes.

94
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,170
But he doesn’t make Seo Jun Ji
feel stressed out

95
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,370
or have any trouble.

96
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,360
Oh.

97
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,800
Is there any other problem?

98
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,740
Mm.

99
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,120
If you’re really curious,
check the books he’s been reading.

100
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:08,680
Books?

101
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,980
In his spare time

102
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,480
or in the photo studio,

103
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,270
he’s been reading books all day long.

104
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,410
He has?

105
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,500
Thank you, Eun Seong Cha.

106
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,500
See you later.

107
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,330
Where are you going?

108
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,470
- Ah.
- Ah.

109
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,630
- I’m exhausted.
- Yeah.

110
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,130
Ui Yeong Kim!

111
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,700
Su Jin!

112
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,280
Can’t you smell the stink of my sweat?

113
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,690
I can smell yours, but not his.

114
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,670
Oh.

115
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,910
Why didn’t you come to watch the game?

116
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,040
I had meant to go watch it
after going to the shop with Ha Rin Oh.

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,000
But she stood me up.

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,420
What?

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
But she came to the basketball court.

120
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,850
She did?

121
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,970
I wish I could strangle her!

122
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,000
Ha Rin just left.

123
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,200
She didn’t go to see you?

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,440
No.

125
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,840
I don’t know where she’s gone.
I can’t find her at all.

126
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,210
She didn’t even come to morning classes.

127
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,990
She didn’t?

128
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,660
The class adviser asked angrily
where she was.

129
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,350
I lied that she was in the toilet.

130
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,190
I don’t understand what she’s up to.

131
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,830
Sounds suspicious. Really suspicious.

132
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,170
Are you having any trouble lately?

133
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,300
What happened to you?

134
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,570
Nothing.

135
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,440
Just take good care of yourself.

136
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,940
Take care of myself?

137
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,650
I’ll be a listener for you.

138
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,270
Tell me whatever bothers you, got it?

139
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,910
Answer my question!

140
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,880
Got it.

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,740
Don’t find me annoying.

142
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,680
I won’t. I swear.

143
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:39,820
Let’s go.

144
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,160
She’s weird, isn’t she?

145
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,320
Hey.

146
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,940
Has she done anything weird to you?

147
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,990
No.

148
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,390
And you?

149
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,340
No, either.

150
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,900
She’s behaving as usual.

151
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,020
She’s not!

152
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,990
She upset Su Jin.

153
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,510
When I see her, I’ll complain to her.

154
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,820
Forget it. I’ll handle her personally.

155
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,470
But she’s not in our class or yours.

156
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,360
Where has she gone, then?

157
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,410
To avoid the same mistake,

158
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,580
I must strain every nerve to find out

159
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,480
what made Seo Jun Ji

160
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,860
kill himself.

161
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,850
Excuse me, I want to check
the borrowing record.

162
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,630
Class and name.

163
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,660
Class 2, Grade 2. Seo Jun Ji.

164
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,790
I’m his friend.

165
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,940
He didn’t come to school today. So I...

166
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,520
He has come to school.

167
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,490
Just now,

168
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,650
I saw him.

169
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,950
Hye Min?

170
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,660
You are?

171
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,040
It’s me, Ha Rin.

172
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,440
I first met Hye Min

173
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,700
at Seo Jun’s funeral.

174
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,070
Who are you?

175
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,380
Seo Jun...

176
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,930
He must have gone to the heaven.

177
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,270
I knew for the first time

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,120
that Seo Jun had a sister.

179
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,070
Oh.

180
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,520
I’m... I’m Seo Jun’s friend.

181
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,220
He just left early.

182
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,710
- He did?
- Yes.

183
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
But he wondered if he kept any book
beyond the time limit.

184
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,320
Then he asked me to confirm it.

185
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,540
In principle, only the borrower
can check the record.

186
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,150
I see. Thank you, Hye Min.

187
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,900
I can make friends with her later.

188
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,200
Her brother is the emergency, after all.

189
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,400
What?

190
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,500
No special books.

191
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,560
Are you all right?

192
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,250
You asked me not to die,
but you nearly did.

193
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,270
Did you get hurt?

194
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,440
Seo Jun Ji,

195
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,660
you’re asked to the dean’s office.

196
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,760
All right.

197
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,310
Be careful with yourself.

198
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,020
Don’t keep me worried.

For whatever reason,

203
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,320
it’s an interview for a higher grade.
Your parents have to come.

204
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,420
You study well and get on well
with your classmates.

205
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,980
You’re a perfect student.

206
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,630
What makes you so nervous
whenever you have an interview?

207
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,820
My parents are quite busy.

208
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,090
But it’s not the reason for not coming.

209
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,000
It’s simply an annual interview.

210
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,540

You’re the best student in our school,

for the Medical specialty of Seo Ri University.

You know it, right?

215
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,500
I do.

216
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,180
If they’re really too busy to come,
shall I call them?

217
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:04,710
Don’t!

218
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,960
Please don’t call them.

219
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,700
I’ll tell them about it.

220
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,800
All right, then.

221
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,260

- Hey, Ha Rin Oh!

222
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,660
Oh?

223
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,570
Where did you go and what did you do?
Tell me all about it.

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,110
You got a class-skipping record
this afternoon. You know?

225
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,650
You think you can skip classes
as you wish?

226
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,300
You skipped classes,
but still came to the club?

227
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,040
You came to the club.

228
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,690
So, you don’t want to break with us yet?

229
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,420
You don’t want that yet.

230
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,860
Where’s Seo Jun Ji?

231
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,260
He hasn’t come yet?

232
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,100
Is it a good time to worry about him?

233
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,950
I forgot about him.

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,470
At that time, I didn’t realize

235
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,530
my friends could be so cute.

236
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,560
Come on.

237
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,640
I’m sorry. Calm down, please.

238
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,110
I’ve got some emergency lately.

239
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,500
Forgive me, will you?

240
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,620
Just for this once.

241
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,540
If you stand me up again

242
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,430
or skip one more class,
I won’t let you go.

243
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,630
I swear it won’t ever happen again.

244
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,530
Humph.

245
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,700
What were you doing?

246
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,940
Talking about whether we should

247
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,160
transfer the data of the Club

248
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,210
to Facebook.

249
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,120
We paused when we heard your footsteps.

250
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,580
Students have abandoned the Club
for Facebook.

251
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,820
I hear Facebook is quite popular lately.

252
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,480
It’s not. INS is.

253
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,130
What?

254
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,120
Nothing.

255
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,510
But Seo Jun Ji is the head of the club.

256
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,300
Is it okay to discuss without him?

257
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,760
He said he had an important appointment.

258
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,300
He gave us this and then left.

259
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,560
Appointment?

262
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,150
But it’s Seo Jun Ji’s email address.

263
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,540
He said he didn’t need it
because he didn’t use Facebook.

264
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,040
He’s still using the virtual community.

265
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,410
He is?

266
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,520
When we’re in the cyber-cafe,
he doesn’t play games.

267
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,480
He always sighs at his diary.

268
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,280
But there’s nothing in his diary.

269
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,080
Maybe he has made it private to himself.

270
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,490
- Let’s check it out.

I’m starving.

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,600
Starving? Would you like
some Fried Rice Cake?

275
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,850
Will you go?

276
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,490
Oops.

277
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,140
I left my cosmetic bag
in the photo studio.

278
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,290
Go without me.

279
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,360
I’ll catch up after I fetch it.

280
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,070
Shall I go with you?

281
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,260
No. Don’t bother.

282
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,400
You’re going to the snack bar
at the crossing, right?

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,320
What? Oh, yes.

284
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,340
You may go first.

285
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,810

Come on. It’s just one photo.

That’s why we must be well prepared.

311
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,030
Also, it’s not a photo
with an ordinary senior.

312
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,460
Then what kind of senior?

313
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,730
The guide for their class

314
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,000
is a senior who graduated
from our school.

315
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,100
He’s now studying at Seo Ri University.

316

What’s more, he’s at Seo Ri University.

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,160
Could you take a photo with us, too?

326
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,550
- A photo?
- Yes.

327
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,480
Sure.

328
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,990

329
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,380

333
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,200
when we visit Seo Ri University,
will you treat us to nice food?

334
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,900
I will, of course.

335
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,020
How about today?

336
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,320
Let me buy you something to eat
right after class.

337
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,840
- You will?
- Sure.

338
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,080
How about this?

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,060
- Let’s go to the shop now.
- Oh, my God!

340
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,300
You’re so cool!

341
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,110
We have quite good taste.

342
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,430
Let’s take the photo first.

343
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,080
I really don’t understand them.

344
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,640
You’d better not.

345
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,620
Let’s do it.

346
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,540
Hey!

347
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,560
Look at the camera.

348
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,170
I’ll do it now.
