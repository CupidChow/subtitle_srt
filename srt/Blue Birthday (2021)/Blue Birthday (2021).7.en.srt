1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,390
You didn’t kill yourself.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:03,950
What?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,030
(Seo Jun Ji!)

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,450
(You didn’t kill yourself!)

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,760
Ha Rin Oh?

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,130
Seo Jun Ji,

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,790
listen carefully.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,880
It hurts.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,160
In a couple of days,

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,220
you will die.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,720
What?

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,920
I said, you will die.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,000
On my birthday, June 10.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,370
I’m not kidding!

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,610
Other students are in class.
Why did you yell?

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,460
I know it sounds unbelievable.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,660
At first, I found it unbelievable too.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,650
I thought a million times
that you wouldn’t kill yourself, but...

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,430
Wait.

20
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,150
Kill myself?

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,370
I’ll kill myself, right?

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,980
But now I don’t think it was the case.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,080
When you’re injured,
how could you cut your wrist later?

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,990
- And you died with only one cutting.
- But Ha Rin Oh...

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,450
Seo Jun Ji, you didn’t kill yourself.

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,520
Someone else killed you!

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,180
On my birthday.

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,100
=Blue Birthday=

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,790
=Episode 7 It’s You, Isn’t It?=
Come on. Where are you going?

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,220
I’m serious.

31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,140
I told you not to watch
too many soap operas.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,330
I’m not kidding.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,460
- Actually, I’m from ten...
- By the way,

34
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,750
how about watching the show that day?

35
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,150
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,940
Didn’t you want to have fun together
on holiday?

37
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,960
I heard the show would be on
when we had the holiday ceremony.

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,670
There would be singers you like.

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,020
It would be fun, wouldn’t it?

40
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,780
(Looking at such an energetic you,)

41
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,760
(I wonder why I believed
that you killed yourself.)

42
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,270
I’m speechless.

43
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,070
What?

44
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,940
You won’t watch it, anyway.

45
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,450
Does such a show really matter?

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,240
Didn’t I just tell you?

47
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,380
You’ll die on my birthday.

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,420
Why do you keep joking?

49
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,950
I saw it!

50
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,550
I saw it with my own eyes that you died!

51
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,950
All right. The suicidal. I know it now.

52
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,320
Why don’t you calm down
and go back to your class first?

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,650
- Wait. I’m not finished…
- Ha Rin Oh.

54
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,810
See? I’ll leave you alone.

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,840
No. Wait.

56
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,210
We were supposed to go to the class,
but you ran away alone.

57
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,150
Were you tricking me?

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,850
No.

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,110
He was injured.
Then I went to the clinic with him.

60
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,540
Right. What did the doctor say?
Was he badly injured?

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,230
Not really.

62
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,600
He sprained his left wrist.
He can’t use his left hand for now.

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,550
He’s a left-hander. What would he do?

64
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,940
Yeah.

65
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,010
(If he was killed,
instead of killing himself,)

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,340
(who was the murderer?)

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,810
Sin U Kim.

68
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,960
I can’t stand him
after Ui Yeong told me about him.

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,450
He’s quite self-abased or something.
Just a coward.

70
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,350
(Sin U Kim?)

71
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,730
Forget about him. Let’s go.

72
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,400
Even if you didn’t take classes,
you should attend the class meeting.

73
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,950
(I’ll investigate him first.)

74
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,970
Ha Rin Oh.

75
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,740
Let’s go attend the class meeting.

76
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,790
Having a class meeting so soon?

77
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,200
There’s a campus activity today.
The class will be over earlier.

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,880
Don’t hang around outside the school.

79
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,140
Go home and do your homework. Got it?

80
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,820
Yes!

81
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,650
You sound obedient.

82
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,920
(Where shall I start and how can I
find out the truth in the next ten days?)

83
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,970
You should know better.

84
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,320
What are we going to eat?

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,900
(I’ll tell Seo Jun Ji the truth first.)

86
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,520
- I asked what we were going to eat.
- Where?

87
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,080
Didn’t we agree to have fun
when class was over earlier?

88
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,990
I’ve got a headache today.

89
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,970
Ui Yeong Kim advised
riding bikes in Hangang.

90
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,490
Seo Jun Ji is injured. Can he still go?

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,610
Seo Jun Ji will go?

92
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,130
Of course. Didn’t we agree
to have fun together?

93
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,780
Ha Rin Oh, Su Jin Do,

94
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,630
do you want to stay for more classes?

95
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,950
No.

96
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,730
Be quiet, then.

97
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,720
Class is over.

98
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,900
Off you go.

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,120
Let’s order the fried chicken first.

100
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,620
- Chicken?
- Yes. One for each.

101
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,900
Who still wants fried chicken
in Hangang?

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,220
I do.

103
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,280
He said he did.

104
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,290
All right. Enjoy it alone.

105
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,420
We’ll eat instant noodles. Of all kinds.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,630
All kinds of instant noodles?

107
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,190
Come on. Are you mocking me?

108
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,950
Are you mocking my girlfriend?

109
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,120
Me?

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,440
Not at all.

111
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,230
Are you provoking me, Eun Seong Cha?

112
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,020
Are you provoking her, Eun Seong Cha?
You sound quite arrogant.

113
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,320
(It’s not a perfect time
for a leisure trip to Hangang.)

114
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,970
Su Jin, what did you use?
Your lips are glittering.

115
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,050
You look more beautiful
than you did yesterday.

116
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,520
I never miss any new lipstick.

117
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,290
Doesn’t Ha Rin Oh look better too?

118
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,600
I rouged her lips just now.

119
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,880
She looks the same.

120
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,550
Shall we go somewhere quiet,
instead of Hangang?

121
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,040
Somewhere quiet?

122
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,560
Yes. I have something to tell you.

123
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,750
Somewhere quiet with no one else around.

124
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,910
Somewhere quiet with no one else around?

125
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,880
Just the two of us.

126
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,930
You and I go somewhere quiet alone
with no one else around?

127
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,120
Where are you two going?

128
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,570
Somewhere quiet with no one else around?

129
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,350
What?

130
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,640
No, no. I don’t mean that.

131
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,560
Ha Rin Oh, what a nasty thought!

132
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,020
Come on. Walk ahead of us.

133
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,110
If you still want to slip away,
you’ll be dead meat.

134
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,680
Ha Rin Oh looks really... Come over.

135
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,490
But,

136
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,660
I have something to tell Seo Jun Ji.

137
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,700
Forget it.

138
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,390
Don’t try to slip away.
We’re going to Hangang together.

139
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,810
Pick three of us to buy instant noodles
in the convenience store.

140
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,530
Whoever loses picks the other two.

141
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,980
- You must play, or you’ll lose!
- Paper!

142
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,550
Rock-paper-scissors.
Rock-paper-scissors.

143
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,200
You all look happy.

144
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,560
I guess you all want to go with me.

145
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,610
You were the happiest.

146
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,440
I wasn’t. I think you were.

147
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,450
The ones who will go with me are...

148
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,840
- Eun Seong Cha.
- Why?

149
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,980
And Seo Jun Ji.

150
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,130
- Me? Why?
- I just want it.

151
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,610
- Right.
- Let’s go.

152
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,790
Why not go with your boyfriend?

153
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,880
- Just go. I...
- What are you talking about?

154
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,930
When I have to go,
Ui Yeong Kim will certainly go with me.

155
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,510
I certainly will.

156
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,480
Come on. Stand up. I’m starving.

157
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Yeah. Stand up.

158
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,360
Get some leaflets
and see what to order.

159
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,330
Ha Rin, I want some fried chicken.

160
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,980
I don’t want that.

161
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,610
I see. Come back early.

162
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,320
(I have only four photos)

163
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,730
(for the time travel.)

164
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,080
(They’re not enough for me
to get to know everything.)

165
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,230
(What if I burn the photo now?)

166
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,250
(Will I)

167
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,510
(go back to an earlier time?)

168
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,710
What? Where has she gone?

169
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,420
Oh, no! What if our bags were stolen?

170
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,620
Who would steal them?

171
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,980
There’re only books in them.

172
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,930
You’re right.

173
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,000
She’s gone to the toilet, I guess.

174
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,680
It’s hot. So hot.

175
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,920
What?

176
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,380
I’m going to the toilet.

177
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,160
Toilet?

178
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,090
- No.
- What?

179
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,910
- I can’t sell it to you.
- Why?

180
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,020
(No cigarette, liquor, lighter for minors)

181
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,300
(No cigarette, liquor, lighter for minors)
Oh, but…

182
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,630
But I don’t buy it for smoking.

183
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,470
For fireworks, right?

184
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,120
Not for fireworks, either.

185
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,060
For my friend’s birthday.

186
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,090
I still can’t sell it to you.

187
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,550
She’s my only friend.
But on her birthday,

188
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,490
I can’t even light a candle for her.

189
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,900
What’s the point of living, then?

190
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,560
Wait.

191
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,250
I can’t sell a lighter to you.

192
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,550
But you can have this.

193
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,840
(If I burn this photo
and go back to the past,)

194
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,720
(I’ll have more chances
to save Seo Jun Ji.)

195
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,840
Why doesn’t it work?

196
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,370
What are you doing here?

197
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,130
You didn’t even take your phone.

198
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,950
Well, it’s...

199
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,760
It’s a sunny day. Then I took a walk.

200
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,390
(This is a perfect chance.)

201
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,160
Seo Jun Ji.

202
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,850
- Just now, I told you...
- Just now?

203
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,330
Are you going to say that again?

204
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,850
(When you think
it’s a perfect chance...)

205
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,770
What are you doing here?

206
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,840
(There’ll always be
an unexpected visitor.)

207
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,650
Nothing.

208
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,490
Let’s get back.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,850
Or the noodles will stick together.

210
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
- Isn’t it great to stay alone?
- Right.

211
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,890
- We shouldn’t have come with them.
- Right.

212
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,170
Shall we

213
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,460
slip away later?

214
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,960
Good idea.

215
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,240
I’ll first tell them I’m going home…

216
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,950
Why did you disappear one by one?

217
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,990
You didn’t even tell us.

218
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,840
Did you have something delicious
without telling us?

219
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,650
Why did you leave?

220
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,990
- To look for her.
- To look for her.

221
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,740
Ha Rin Oh isn’t something missing.
Why did you need to look for her?

222
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,060
Yeah.

223
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,320
Where did you go, then?

224
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,240
I went to the toilet.

225
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,590
Everybody, I’m leaving for...

226
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,600
My mother called. I have to go home.

227
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,430
Enjoy yourselves.

228
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,670
Now? You’re going back alone?

229
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,520
No. He’s going, too.

230
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,050
Me?

231
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,480
Don’t you remember?

232
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,530
Your mother asked you to go home early.

233
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,730
I’m leaving then.

234
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,870
- Okay.
- You’re leaving, too?

235
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,830
Let’s all leave, then.

236
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,560
Are you finished?

237
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,880
- Yes, we...
- No.

238
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,870
We’re not finished yet.

239
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,780
- We won’t go until we’re finished.
- All right. We’re leaving first.

240
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,500
You three can stay and enjoy the food.

241
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,130
- No.
- No.

242
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,810
I’m going home, too.

243
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,790
He said he would leave, too.

244
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,120
All right, then.

245
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,690
(Seo Jun Ji and I take the same bus.)

246
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,730
(Pedestrian crossing)
(Eun Seong goes in the other direction.)

247
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,650
(I can tell Seo Jun Ji on the bus.)

248
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,380
Ha Rin.

249
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,550
When will you come to school tomorrow?

250
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,730
Tomorrow?

251
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,660
I don’t know yet.

252
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,010
Why?

253
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,810
Nothing.

254
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,880
See you tomorrow, Eun Seong.

255
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,520
I take this bus, too.

256
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,910
But why?

257
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,180
Don’t you live
in the reverse direction?

258
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,040
- Going to the cram school today?
- Yes.

259
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,850
I go this way to the cram school.

260
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,990
(My god! When can I have
the chance to tell him?)

261
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,810
Ha Rin,

262
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,000
you get off at this stop, right?

263
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,470
Yes.

264
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,080
(When I have tinnitus,)

265
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,320
(this chance will be wasted.)

266
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,780
(300 New West District Hall)

267
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,010
I’ll have tinnitus soon.

268
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,300
(Right. I’m running out of time.)

269
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,020
(Let me try burning the photo first.)

270
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,380
(Show Information)

271
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,310
She was eager to watch the show.

272
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,630
You won’t watch it, anyway.

273
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,010
Does such a show really matter?

274
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,460
Didn’t I just tell you?

275
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,710
You’ll die on my birthday.

276
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,610
Why do you keep joking?

277
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,140
I saw it!

278
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,860
I saw it with my own eyes that you died!

279
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,540
Why doesn’t it work?

280
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,900
What are you doing here?

281
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,400
Could it be...?

282
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,530
(Why is one photo missing?)

283
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,360
(Is she...?)

284
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,170
(If I can go back
to an earlier time,)

285
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,380
(I will obtain enough time.)

286
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,750
(Please work. Please. Please!)

287
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,730
Looks like it doesn’t work.

288
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,280
Ha Rin Oh.

289
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,440
When did you come?

290
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,670
Don’t get me wrong. Let me explain.

291
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,110
I didn’t mean to burn your photo.

292
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,430
- I just...
- Ha Rin Oh.

293
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:52,830
You...

294
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,720
You’re from the future, aren’t you?

295
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,100
(Only photos taken with old films and cameras
with young Seo Jun enabled time travel.)

296
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:39,740
(The next video
will be played automatically.)

297
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,140
You’re doing the right pose.

298
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,980
I can do better.

299
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,020
- As if I had learned ten times…
- Not as if.

300
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,120
I did teach you ten times.

301
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,020
What are you talking about?

302
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,270
Not ten times.

303
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,730
No, but almost.

304
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,910
Come and have a look.

305
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,570
When we use a film camera,
the light is very important.

306
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,840
Look. Here. The lens.

307
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,730
Are you listening?

308
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,140
You were absent-minded again,
weren’t you?

309
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,450
Take a photo.

310
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,640
Of what?

311
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,850
Whatever. Anything you like.

312
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,540
Don’t hold it like that.
