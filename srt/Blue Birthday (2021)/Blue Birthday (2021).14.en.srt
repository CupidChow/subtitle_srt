8
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,530
Miss Hye Min Ji,

9
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,560
your testimony will
influence the follow-up.

10
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,840
It will?

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,450
In what way?

12
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,370
Are you really the murderer?

13
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,170
Or...

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,770
“Are you only a suspect?”

15
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,650
Just tell me the truth.

16
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,450
You think I’m the murderer, don’t you?

17
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,510
What’s the point of answering you?

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,130
What?

19
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,490
Come on!

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,520
You look like

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,200
you think I’m the murderer.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,430
Miss...

23
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,090
You haven’t started to think so, right?

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,240
Because you haven’t found it yet.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,770
Bad girl, where do you think you are?
Stop kidding!

26
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,500
Bad girl?

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,130
Who do you think you are?
How dare you say that!

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,880
You want to lose your job?

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,750
Officer,

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,860
I want to go to the bathroom.

31
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,930
May I?

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,850
(Where are you?)

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,580
Ha Rin Oh?

34
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,580
Where’s Seo Jun Ji?

35
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,530
- Seo Jun Ji, he...
- He left school early today.

36
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,160
Early? Why?

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,220
He went to the hospital.

38
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,580
Why did he go there?

39
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,900
Because his mother fainted
after his sister was arrested.

40
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,150
What? You look like you didn’t know it.

41
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
Which hospital?

42
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,400
The one Seo Jun Ji was in last time.

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,190
After school, let’s visit his mother...

44
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,500
Hey!

45
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,630
What’s she doing?

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
She always has a neurological disorder.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,050
It’s normal that she fainted
after a great blow.

48
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,990
When she wakes up,
let her rest for recuperation.

49
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,860
(Ha Rin Oh)

50
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,510
Be quick.

51
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,460
(A general ward)

52
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,720
Hello, Seo Jun Ji?

53
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,790
Why did you keep calling me?

54
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,270
Hye Min came back to the past!

55
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,360
What? What are you talking about?

56
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,490
In 2021, Hye Min burned a photo
after she was out of prison.

57
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,240
I didn’t know how she knew
I still had a photo and came to my home.

58
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,250
But isn’t she arrested now?

59
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,400
It won’t help even if she’s back.

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,780
The police haven’t found
the decisive evidence yet.

61
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,850
We must find it before Hye Min does.

62
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,670
What evidence?
Haven’t we found it already?

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
There’s some other evidence.

64
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,920
(Suspected crime tool was found.)
The prosecution claimed they found a decisive clue.

65
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,722
(Suspect Ji of Seo Ri High murder case)
It was a carving knife stored in the Art Room.

66
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,430
(was declared guilty.)
It was a carving knife stored in the Art Room.

67
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,980
The knife Hye Min used
is still in the school.

68
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,980
She’ll try her best to destroy it.

69
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,880
We must find it before her.

70
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,570
Why is she using so much water?

71
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,940
Miss, are you done?

72
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,520
If you don’t answer, I’ll come in.

73
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:48,640
Have you found it?

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,920
No. I don’t think it’s here.

75
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,200
- Let’s search the Art Room.
- All right.

76
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,380
(Welcome to the Photography Club)

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,660
Oh, no!

78
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,770
What do I do?

79
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,050
I’m sorry. Is it broken?

80
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,600
Let me check.

81
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,640
It’s not broken, I guess.

82
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,780
Never mind.

83
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,580
Come on! Why this one?

84
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:33,970
Let’s go.

85
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,820
(Do not enter.)

86
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,380
Why is there no knife?

87
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,130
No tools are there, of course.

88
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,510
So...

89
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,990
I have the tools.

90
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,850
- You have them?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,450
Because the Art Room can’t be used
in a short time.

92
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,130
Do you keep the carving knives, either?

93
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,690
Why are you looking for knives?

94
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,810
We’re interested
in carving lately. Right?

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,750
What?

96
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,150
Yes, yes! We’re very interested.

97
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,500
You are?

98
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,860
Students of the Photography Club
are interested in carving?

99
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,720
But students often
use the knives carelessly.

100
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,460
So, we only lend them
to our club members.

101
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,700
We’ll be very careful.
Can we borrow them once?

102
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,030
We’ll return them perfectly.

103
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,800
All right, then.

104
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,240
But the club members have borrowed them.

105
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,500
Where is the club activity held?

106
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,620
What? You want to borrow from them?

107
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,710
We should at least try.

108
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,690
Now that the Art Room can’t be used,

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,620
I guess students of your grade
are using the empty classroom.

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,440
To Seo Ri High, please.

113
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,760
Excuse me, may I look at your knife?

114

Thank you.

117
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,000

Hey, Seo Jun Ji!

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,330
- Are you Seo Jun Ji?
- Yes, what’s wrong?

Ha Rin Oh...

She said she found something
and would see you on the rooftop.

125

Now?

126
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,290
Thank you.

127
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,040
Senior, your phone is ringing.

128
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,430
- My phone?
- Yes.

129
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,870
I picked this up in the library.

130
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,910

Come on. What’s the rush?

141
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,660
Hye Min, don’t do this. Talk to me.

142
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,460
Shouldn’t you give me something
before we talk?

143
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,550
Give it to me first.

144
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,530
What?

145
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,190

I understand. I’ll give it to you.

148
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,960
I will. Put the knife down, first.

149
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,710
Put it on the ground.

150
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,590
Kick it to me.

151
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,640
Is it okay? Please let Seo Jun...

152
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,960
Sorry,

153
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,900
but I never mean to let him go.

00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,740
Why?

Are you crying?

166
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,060
Why? Ha Rin, I’ll feel sorry for you.

00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,820
Are you crying because of him?

169
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,780
Disgusting.

170
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,610
What the hell is he?

171
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,570
Mom, Dad, and you...

172
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,100
Everybody is worried about him!

173
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,620
Ha Rin,

174
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,890
he’s only my substitute.

175
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,710
I’m back already.

176
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,680
He should disappear.

177
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,700
Pathetic.

178
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,660
What did you say?

179
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,820
You’re pathetic.

180
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,160
Why is Seo Jun Ji your substitute?

181
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,110
He’s Seo Jun Ji and you’re Hye Min Ji!

182
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,940
Stay away. Or I’ll kill him!

183
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,390
You hate it so much
when Seo Jun Ji lives a happy life?

184
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,690
That’s why you’ve done all this.

185
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,160
I’m gonna kill him!

186
