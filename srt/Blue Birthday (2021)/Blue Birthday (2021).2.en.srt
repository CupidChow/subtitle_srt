1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,300
I’m having a dream.

2
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,510
Since you died,

3
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,060
it’s my first time dreaming about you.

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,480
I’ll get off!

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,060

Ah!

(Welcome to the Photography Club
of Seo Ri High)

9
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,210
If I could dream about you,

10
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,490
I always wanted to do one thing.

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,710
Ha Rin Oh, you’re late again.

♪You’re the same as before♪

15
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,690
What took you so long to appear?

16
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,360
Do you know how much I miss you?

17
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,720
Hey.

18
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,680
What... what’s going on?

19
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,230
What are you doing?

20
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,270
What?

21
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,700
You’re in a relationship?

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,950
Is this true? You’re in a relationship?

23
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,400
What did I say?
They would be in a relationship, right?

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,290
You’re bleeding.

25
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,920
Ha Rin Oh, you’re bleeding.

26
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,220
Mm, blood.

27
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,600
Never mind. I’m in a dream, anyway.

28
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,880
But you’re bleeding a lot.

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,530
The healthcare teacher always
can’t be found.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,530
He must be smoking somewhere.

31
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,930
He doesn’t care about his health
or fear he would die early.

32
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,650
So far, he’s been healthy.

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,510
He is now. What about 10 years later?

34
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:47,960
By then...

35
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,920
Doesn’t it hurt?

36
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,660
No. It doesn’t hurt at all.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,640
I’m in the dream, anyway.

38
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,520
Did you hit your head?

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,050
Are you alright?

40
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,650
Yes, I told you.

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,540
That’s great.

42
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,140
You brought her here.

43
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,470
I’ll walk her back.

44
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,640
It doesn’t matter.

45
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,190
- I can go alone.
- All right, then.

46
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,260
Don’t be late when you come to the club.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,260
Let’s go.

48
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,760
All right.

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,510
You’re back?

50
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,650
Mm.

51
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,000
Is your wound dealt with?

52
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,490
Yes.

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,380
What’s your look? It hurts?

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,530
No. I’m super happy.

55
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,250
Super!

56
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,250
You must be crazy.

57
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,130
What makes me so happy?

58
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,420
Who knows?

59
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,930
There’s terrible bean sprouts soup
for today’s lunch.

60
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,320
Shall we buy some bread in the shop?

61
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,190
What?

62
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,330
What has she gone?

63
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,540
We can draw lessons from the past,
but we cannot live in it.

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,250
We can draw lessons from the past,
but we cannot live in it.

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,440
Next...

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,170
Seo Jun Ji, stand up.

67
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,700
Stand up. Do it.

68
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,060
I don’t think about the past.

69
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,970
The only thing that matters
is the endless present.

71

After my instruction,
you pronounce better.

72
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,720
What?

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,700
- What happened?
- What’s she doing?

74
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,430
What’s wrong?

75
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,140
What’s the noise?

76
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,180
Come on!

77
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,690
Seo Jun Ji.

78
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,800
- What’s wrong with her?
- What?

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,970
She’s been acting weirdly.

80
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,250
Did she hit her head?

81
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,250
Who knows?

82
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,300
You!

83
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,610
Just leave!

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,670
Which class are you in?

85
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,740
What…!

86
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,570
Let’s continue.

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,780
I’m not finished yet.

88
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,290
Let’s continue in the next class.

89
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,580
All right. Wish you a nice lunch.

90
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,810
The same to you, sir.

91
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,970
Let’s go.

92
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,870
Let’s go for lunch.

93
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,870
You don’t see us?

94
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,140
You and I can meet whenever we want.

95
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,750
What about him?

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,100
If I don’t have lunch with him now,
I don’t know when I can see him again.

97
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,860
Yes.

98
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,110
Sounds like she’s crazy.

99
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,110
Go for lunch without me.

100
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,650
Why?

101
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,180
I’ve got something else to do.
I’ll leave you alone.

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,460
Where are you going?

103
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,800
I’ll go with you.

104
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,400
What?

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,750
Where on earth are you going?

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,580
Will you skip classes?

107
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,620
You think I’m you?

108
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,130
I’ll go with you.

109
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,450
I insist!

110
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,370
All right.

111
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,190
Catch up if you can.

112
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,390
You…

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,860
Come on, let’s go.

114
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,870
Mm.

115
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,060
(Black and White Photo Shop)

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
It’s...

117
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,860
Even if I don’t let you in,

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,620
you’ll follow me up, right?

119
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,100
Humph.

120
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,260
Who do you think I am?

121
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,410
I will certainly

122
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,280
follow you up.

123
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,000
Let’s get in.

124
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,310
Welcome.

125
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,640
Dream and reality look…

126
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,740
The same, right?

127
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,430
What?

128
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,690
Sir, the films.

129
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,250
You ordered three rolls of films

130
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,490
and had some photos printed, right?

131
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:44,800
Yes.

132
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,840
What’s your name?

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Seo Jun Ji.

134
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,480
Seo Jun Ji, Seo Jun Ji.

135
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,860
Where’s your name? Seo Jun Ji.

136
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,090
Oh, it’s here. Here it is.

137
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,540
What? What photos?

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,880
Some simple photos. You’re not involved.

139
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,130
What? Let me have a look.

140
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,870
No.

141
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,890
The films are in the second draw
over there.

142
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,290
All right.

143
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,930
Nice to meet the real you.

144
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,330
What?

145
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,630
Haw-haw.

146
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,720
When I printed photos, I often saw you.

147
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,250
You did?

148
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,200
Mm.

149
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,060
How much?

150
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,310
Three rolls of films and printed photos.

151
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,210
270 million Won.

152
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,860
Here it is.

153
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,360
Here’s the change. 30 million Won.

154
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,260
- Welcome back again.
- All right.

155
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,460
Be careful.

156
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,000
What did you say?

157
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,290
When you touch the past carelessly,
there’ll be big trouble

158
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,370
and misfortune.

159
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,970
We’re getting late. Come on!

160
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,470
Thank you.

161
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,510
Let’s get back to school.

162
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,120
You came out without a note.
You’ll be scolded.

163
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,000
You lied about not wasting films
on me, right?

164
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,620
What?

165
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,780
No... nothing.

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,270
Don’t you get on?

167
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,560
Wait a second.

168
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,450
What are you doing?

169
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,410
I just want to take a photo of you.

170
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,860
You’ve been weird the whole day.

171
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,300
Let’s go. Didn’t you say
I would be scolded?

172
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,200
Hold tight.

173
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,650

I have to wake up.

188
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
What’s this?

189
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,920
Ah!

190
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,400
Did I have it before?

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,640
Oh, no!

192
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,560
I’m getting late.

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,370
It’s today.

196
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,180
Mr. Reporter!

197
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,800
Eun Seong Cha.

198
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,330
There you are.

199
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,420
You’re in a relationship, aren’t you?

200
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,850
Look, you spat out.

201
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,240
Why do you think so?

202
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,380
What’s wrong with me?

203
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,970
You look quite handsome today.

204
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,360
Looks like you often get dressed up
when you have interviews.

205
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,290
I didn’t get dressed up.

206
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,450
Considering the filming,

207
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,470
I adorned myself.

208
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Was the interview going smoothly?

209
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,180
Yes.

210
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,570
Thanks to Bit Na and Se Jun.
They’re talkative.

211
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,480
So, the interview was smooth.

212
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,910
I’d like to thank you, too.
Or I would have nothing to interview.

213
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,770
Thank you.

214
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,860
Then treat me a big dinner.

215
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,620
You won’t just say it, will you?

216
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,180
I won’t, of course.

217
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,160
What would you like to eat?

218
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,980
I have no idea.

219
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,490
How about tonight?

220
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,810
You’re getting off work, anyway.

221
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,570
Eun Seong.

222
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,420
What?

223
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,800
Did I...?

224
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,090
Did I have it before?

225
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,140
What?

226
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,730
The scar?

227
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,800
Mm.

228
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,970
I think...

229
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,800
I think you had it at that time.

230
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,160
In Grade 2 when we were
in the Photography Club.

231
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,160
Grade 2?

232
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,100
You hurt your knee
and went to the clinic.

233
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,610
But wait...

234
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,190
I didn’t have the scare before.

235
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,010
It was

236
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,000
what happened in my dream.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,660
I went to the clinic to get you back.

238
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,570
You don’t remember?

239
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,060
Are you sure?

240
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,480
What?

241
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,660
What you just said.

242
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,990
Are you sure your memories are real?

243
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,530
Sure.

244
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,080
That noon, you and Seo Jun Ji
suddenly disappeared.

245
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,820
Ui Yeong Kim and Su Jin Do lied that
you went to the hospital.

246
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,130
When they were seen through,
they were scolded.

247
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,060
New memories are emerging in my mind.

248
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,080
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

249
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,130
Be quick.

250
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,340
Don’t you work?

251
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,550
My knee hurts. It hurts.

252
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,980
Clean here. Here. Here.

253
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,380
Oops.

254
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,270
Haw-haw.

255
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,500
It hurts a lot.

256
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,610
Why?

257
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,310
Why do I...?

258
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,780
Any problem?

259
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,740
You can’t recall it?

260
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,850
I can. I remember now.

261
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,490
So?

262
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,240
Just something wrong
with my old memories.

263
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,800
When will you get off work?

264
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,310
Let’s go to the Italian Restaurant
we went together last time.

265
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,700
Next time.

266
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,130
Let’s go there next time.

267
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,070
Ha Rin Oh!

268
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,790
Hello?

269
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,340
(Su Jin Do)

270
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Are you busy?

271
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,230
No. Why?

272
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,040
I have something to ask you.

273
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,540
Do you remember

274
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,210
I hurt my knee?

275
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,050
What do you mean?

276
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,180
When...

277
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,690
In high school, I fell and bled.

278
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,240
That noon, Seo Jun Ji and I disappeared.

279
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,610
You told teachers that
I went to the hospital.

280
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,970
I remember.

281
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,400
I squatted for many laps.

282
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,400
- I think I’m hurt.
- I can’t walk anymore.

283
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,160
It hurts, doesn’t it?

284
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,110
Go.

285
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,910
You also

286
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,290
remember it?

287
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,730
We agreed to go to the shop after lunch.
But you disappeared.

288
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,000
I thought you went to the hospital.

289
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,500
You also had me do the cleaning work.

290
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,920
I hurt my knee in my dream.

291
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,700
But it became real.

292
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,690
Hello?

293
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,210
Ha Rin Oh?

294
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,950
There may be...

295
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,070
What?

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,480
What are you doing?

297
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,780
I just want to take a photo of you.

298
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,950
What may there be?

299
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,880
I just...

300
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,750
I just had a dream yesterday.

301
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,060
But was that really a dream?

302
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,220
Su Jin, thank you.

303
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,850
Does it mean

304
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
I can go back to the past? Is that so?

305
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,640
When I change the past,

306
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,900
the present will...

307
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,260
(I want to see you after class.)
(See you at the photo studio.)

308
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,830
Also change, right?

309
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,000
Maybe he would not die.

310
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,290
Ha Rin Oh.

311
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,510
What?

312
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,200
What do you think of me?

313
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,910
I’ll have a chance

314
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,720
to tell him my feelings for him.

315
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,250
When I change the past,

316
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,020
the present will also change.

317
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,890
I must find a way
to go back to the past.

318
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,600
The way to go back to the past.

319
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,820
Can it be...?

320
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,100
Let me make it.

321
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,550
Please.

322
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,560
Please!

323
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,500
Please!

324
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,550
- Hey, come out.
- No.

325
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,650
- Come on.
- Just come out.

326
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,470
Let’s go.

327
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,050
But why?

328
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,710
I made it!

329
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,200
Ha Rin Oh.

330
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,470
Where’s Seo Jun Ji?

331
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,130
Seo Jun Ji!

332
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,950
When did you come?

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,430
Listen carefully.

334
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,460
No matter what happens, don’t die.

335
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,280
What?

336
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,720
Don’t die.

337
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,020
I won’t watch you die.

338
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,650
I won’t.
