00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
(In 2009)

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,180
(Actually, I knew)

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,680
(how to get back to the past.)

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,590
(When we were in middle school,)

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,190
(didn’t you find it weird?)

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,040
(You were always
careless and befuddled.)

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,620
(But during the three years
in middle school,)

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,710
(why did you)

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,060
(never get hurt?)

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,480
Come on. Watch your steps.

11
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,340
=Blue Birthday=

12
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,260
=Episode 8 Crisis=

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,300
So, you...

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,420
- So far...
- Yes.

15
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,670
Every time you got hurt,
I burned a photo and went to the past.

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,860
It was my own secret.

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,540
But since a few days ago,
you’ve been acting weirdly.

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,110
Possibly...

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,180
...from that day. You hurt your knee
and then hugged me.

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,950
What took you so long to appear?

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,050
(Welcome to the Photography Club)
Ha Rin Oh, you’re bleeding.

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,050
- Blood.
- Never mind.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,940
No matter what happens, don’t die.

24
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:40,570
What?

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,670
Don’t die.

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,000
I won’t watch you die.

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,460
Listen.

28
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,370
I can’t follow you today.

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,120
So, just tell your mother
whatever you want to say.

30
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,240
Got it?

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,280
Just now, you took away my photo.

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,450
And I smelt the burning photo.

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,710
Right.

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,610
- I came from the future to save you...
- Don’t.

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,090
What?

36
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,700
Don’t come back again.

37
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,560
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,080
I know.

39
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,370
Someone killed me, right?

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,100
I still don’t want you to come back.

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,660
Don’t try coming back again.

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,710
What?

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,360
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,240
Don’t you understand?

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,070
You didn’t kill yourself.

46
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,560
Don’t care about my life! Please!

47
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,950
Seo Jun Ji!

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,990
Do you know what a hard life
I lived for ten years without you?

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Every second was painful.

50
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,830
I lived in regret every day.

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,490
To get you back to life,
I’ve been trying everything.

52
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,200
But how could you

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
say something like that?

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,180
Silly, it’s for your own good.

55
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,530
(Is everything)

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,500
Ha Rin?

57
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,750
(my own obsession?)

58
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,270
Ha Rin Oh.

59
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,040
Ha Rin Oh.

60
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,920
(I thought you felt the same as me.)

61
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,820
(Su Jin Do)

62
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,500
Why did you ask to see me
at this time?

63
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,830
Where’s Hye Min?

64
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,450
She’s out to throw rubbish.

65
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,330
Shall we have a drink
after she gets off work?

66
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,160
How about next time?

67
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,250
I could only stay for a moment.

68
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,000
Why did you buy two cups?

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,430
One for me?

70
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,840
No.

71
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,650
Ui Yeong Kim was here. He has gone.

72
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,450
Gone?

73
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:14,850
Why?

74
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,130
He said he was too busy.

75
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,890
Absurd.

76
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,390
I...

77
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,930
- I...
- Shall I break up with him?

78
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,410
What?

79
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,800
You’ve been in love for 10 years.
Why will you break up?

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,720
What happened?

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,460
Nothing happened.

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,750
I don’t know why, but it happens a lot.

83
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,760
We quarreled every time we met lately.

84
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,420
A couple always quarrel.

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,980
Isn’t it what a couple does?

86
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,870
Every couple does the same thing.

87
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,110
After I experienced that, I realized...

88
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,770
Wait. What did you experience?

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,960
No, I didn’t mean that.

90
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
You’ve got a man?

91
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,060
Ha Rin Oh, at last...

92
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,740
You said you would love no one,
but Seo Jun Ji.

93
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:58,930
What did I say?

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,010
I’m sorry.

95
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,700
Never mind. What’s done is done.

96
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,520
Seo Jun Ji became a doctor.

97
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
What do you mean?

98
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,300
Seo Jun Ji!

99
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,090
What? I said I would pick you up.

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,390
I saw Seo Jun Ji.

101
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,600
What? In your dream?

102
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,990
No.

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,800
I...

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,360
I burned the photos Seo Jun Ji left
and went back to the past.

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,210
You did?

106
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,740
What did you do, then?

107
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,470
Got him back to life.

108
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,620
I did get him back to life.

109
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,640
But he died again.

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,510
To save him again,
I went back to the past one more time.

111
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,100
Don’t care about my life! Please!

112
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,080
He said no.

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,820
He asked me not to care about his life.

114
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,950
He wanted you to let it go.

115
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,850
If he did,

116
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,050
he shouldn’t have said that!

117
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,250
How...

118
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,780
How I regret leaving him alone!

119
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,980
You should have saved him
even if you had to grab his collar!

120
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,430
What? What do you mean?

121
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,460
You regretted it, didn’t you?

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,640
Then do everything you want
in your dream.

123
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,800
Anyway, don’t regret it again.

124
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,490
You’ve never been obedient.

125
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,190
When did you ever listen to him?

126
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,780
Where are you going?

127
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,370
To the toilet.

128
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,140
I’ll be right back.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,480
Why did she take her bag to the toilet?

130
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,920
(Su Jin is right.)

131
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,020
(I don’t want to regret it anymore.)

132
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,020
(So, I can’t give up.)

133
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,410
(I’ll do everything I can.)

134
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,130
(Because I don’t want)

135
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,590
(to lose you again.)

136
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,050
Turn to Page 92.

137
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,950
A world in contact.

138
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,700
Just a minute of over law
from the contact...

139
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,280
What are you doing?

140
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,790
If the adviser takes away your phone,
you can’t get it back.

141
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,290
I still feel uneasy.

142
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,040
What?

143
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,270
Nothing. Nothing.

144
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,000
(The window of the low...)

145
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,890
(There are good generations...)

146
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,030
(If the murderer wants
to kill Seo Jun Ji here,)

147
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,670
(he must be familiar with this place.)

148
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,960
(He must have stalked Seo Jun Ji.)

149
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,070
I told you not to come again.

150
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,550
Why don’t you allow me to come?

151
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,320
Because it always happens!

152
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,000
It?

153
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,520
Why do you think this suddenly fell?

154
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,300
Wasn’t it

155
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,430
a coincidence?

156
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,750
No. It was the price.

157
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,340
Price?

158
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,130
I told you, didn’t I?

159
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,080
Every time you got hurt in middle school,
I traveled back to the past.

160
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,070
But why am I not going back again?

161
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,270
The more times I go back to the past,

162
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,000
the bigger price I have to pay.

163
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,470
First, I got hurt.
Then I lost love. Next...

164
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,030
I may lose someone.

165
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,080
I experienced all that stuff.

166
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,960
(I hurt my knee,)

167
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,210
(broke off with Su Jin,)

168
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,390
(and Hye Min died.)

169
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,200
If you keep doing this,

170
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,750
you may be in danger too.

171
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,970
What are you doing here?

172
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,810
Where’s Ha Rin Oh?

173
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,700
Ha Rin Oh?

174
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,930
She’s gone to the Photography Club.

175
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,090
Why did she suddenly go there?

176
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,860
I don’t know.

177
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,950
She ran there when the break began.

178
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,510
Thanks. See you later.

179
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,610
So, please don’t come ever again.

180
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,720
I insist.

181
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,290
Please. Listen to me. I beg you!

182
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,380
I’ll come!

183
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,350
If I lose you now, I can’t survive!

184
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,720
I will do everything I can
to get you back to life.

185
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,960
I won’t let you die.

186
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,120
So, please.

187
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,040
Stop asking me not to come again.

188
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,250
You never listen.

189
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,450
I never.

190
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,220
I won’t change
even if you don’t like it.

191
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,830
Cooperate with me.

192
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,400
Then we’ll both feel better.

193
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,780
Do you still not listen
even in ten years?

194
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,420
I don’t, obviously.

195
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,730
I’m in big trouble, then.

196
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,230
Why do you always come
to the photo studio?

197
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,390
This is where

198
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,050
you would die.

199
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,770
I want to investigate this place

200
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,330
and see if I can find any clue.

201
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,150
What?

202
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,510
Here.

203
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,290
I think someone cut it.

204
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,300
But why?

205
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,510
What are they talking about?

206
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,110
You...

207
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,540
You’re from the future, right?

208
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,060
Right.

209
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,900
I came from the future to save you...

210
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,190
So, what they said is true.

211
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,770
I can’t believe it.

212
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,900
Will the murderer notice it?

213
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,310
I don’t think he’ll notice it
among so many cameras,

214
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,510
unless he often comes here.

215
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,030
What if it’s someone who often comes?

216
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,150
You mean one of us five would kill me?

217
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,700
No, no.

218
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,770
Ha Rin Oh,

219
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,650
are you even suspecting your friends?

220
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,810
We can’t rule out anyone, can we?

221
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,220
I’ll confiscate this.

222
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,810
I’ll keep it from now on.

223
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,340
You asked me not to come.
Why do you keep it?

224
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,130
You have a time limit.

225
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,540
Don’t worry.

226
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,930
When it takes a photo of the murderer,
I’ll email it to you.

227
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,380
To me in the future?

228
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,340
The email is still used
in ten years, isn’t it?

229
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,340
It can’t be gone, can it?

230
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,020
Yes. It’s still being used.

231
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,270
Glad to hear that.

232
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,380
When the photo is taken,
we’ll know who it is.

233
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,460
(There’re nine days to go
before my birthday.)

234
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,630
Are you all right?

235
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,260
Aren’t you scared?

236
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,240
Why am I scared? You’re here to help me.

237
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,020
I’m all right.

238
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,740
The bell is about to ring. Let’s go.

239
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,750
Can I skip the class?

240
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,450
(Honestly, I’m very scared)

241
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,760
(that I would be killed.)

242
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,290
(There’s nothing special
in the photo studio.)

243
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,090
(Now I have to check...)

244
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,500
(Record.)

245
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,940
(Welcome to the Photography Club)

246
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,010
Sin U Kim?

247
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,840
Sin U Kim.

248
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,440
He hates Seo Jun Ji.

249
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,200
Who do you think you are? Help me?

250
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,370
Don’t bring bad luck to me.

251
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,840
The student standing beside Seo Jun Ji.

252
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,410
Which one?

253
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,630
Sin U Kim?

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,580
Sin U Kim?

255
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,540
Ui Yeong says he’s a weird boy.

256
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,620
(Sin U Kim...)

257
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,680
(He’s the murderer!)

258
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,120
I’ll file it up
and send it to you this Sunday.

259
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,290
All right. Let’s do it.

260
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,590
- Okay. Thanks for coming.
- You too.

261
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,740
(Ha Rin Oh)

262
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,280
What? Your girlfriend?

263
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,730
No, no. Just a friend.

264
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,650
- Let’s go.
- All right.

265
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,330
- Off you go.
- All right.

266
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,550
- Thanks for coming.
- You too.

267
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,560
Hello?

268
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,830
Why are you calling at this time?

269
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,750
Eun Seong, do you remember Sin U Kim
from our high school?

270
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,440
Sin U Kim?

271
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,970
The student in your class

272
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,170
who hated Seo Jun a lot.

273
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,680
I remember.

274
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,330
But why?

275
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,400
For the last time,

276
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,930
do me a favor, Eun Seong.

277
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
(Se Jun Bak)

278
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,240
Sin U Kim is now working
at an express company.

279
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,680
Ha Rin, the report
you submitted last month...

280
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,820
What are you looking for?

281
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,430
Where’s the number of the express company
taking care of our delivery?

282
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,440
Delivery for animal fodder?

283
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,400
No. Medical products.

284
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,720
The number is
in the check-up folder, I guess.

285
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,740
But why are you looking for it?

286
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,770
His company cooperates with companies
near Seo Ri High School.

287
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,480
Including the Rescue Center
you work at, I suppose.

288
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,790
Wait a minute.

289
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,380
(Check-up)

290
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,540
(Animal medical products)

291
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,030
Hello?

292
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,590
Hello, this is Ha Rin Oh
from Revan Animal Medical Center.

293
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,840
Hello. What can I help you?

294
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,950
May I ask for the contact
of your expressman Sin U Kim

295
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,940
who delivers medical products?

296
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,750
Hold on, please.

297
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,440
- He’s at your center now, I guess.
- What?

298
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,800
There’re extra packages for your center.

299
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,450
All right. Thank you.

300
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,740
(Revan Animal Medical Center
Animal Rescue Center)

301
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,200
Excuse me. Please wait.

302
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,040
What?

303
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,200
Sorry, I got the wrong person.

304
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,580
(Eun Seong Cha)

305
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,840
Hello, Eun Seong?

306
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,100
I didn’t mean to ask you.

307
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,350
But I should ask just in case.

308
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,730
What?

309
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,220
Are you looking for Sin U Kim

310
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,030
because of Seo Jun Ji?

311
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,020
What if it’s someone who often comes?

312
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,050
You mean one of us five would kill me?

313
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,670
No, no.

314
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,590
Ha Rin Oh, are you even
suspecting your friends?

315
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,810
We can’t rule out anyone, can we?

316
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,660
Yes.

317
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,810
Because of Seo Jun Ji.

318
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,360
Ha Rin, what on earth are you doing?

319
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,670
What are you thinking of?

320
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,960
Eun Seong.

321
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,830
(Can I trust you?)

322
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,600
Seo Jun Ji...

323
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,370
He didn’t kill himself.

324
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,820
He was killed.

325
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,680
What?

326
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
What did you say?

327
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,290
Sin U Kim.

328
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,560
(It’s an unexpected chance.)

329
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,840
(Eun Seong Cha)
(Only someone)

330
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,660
(who can overcome the crisis
will seize the chance.)

331
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,260
(A damaged photo can’t activate
any time travel.)

332
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,130
I’m not saying this
because she’s my girlfriend.

333
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,450
But even seen from afar,
Su Jin is the most beautiful girl.

334
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,340
Isn’t she?

335
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,760
Yes. Right.

336
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,200
Come on. It’s the perfect moment.

337
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,430
Su Jin looks so beautiful now.
Take a photo of her. Be quick.

338
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,160
Just do it.

339
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,340
Don’t waste the films.

340
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,520
Why do you keep the camera unused?

341
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,180
Take a photo of her. Quickly.

342
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,690
Do it. Do it.

343
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,450
Be quick. Be quick.

344
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,440
You said you didn’t want a waste of films.
But you still took photos of her.

345
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,010
I was just kidding.

346
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,410
It’s never a waste of films
when I take photos of friends.

347
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,510
Friends?

348
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,920
Including me?

349
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,770
What?

350
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,360
No. Nothing.

351
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,570
What are you waiting for?
You’ll miss the best moment.

352
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,920
All right. I’ll do it.
