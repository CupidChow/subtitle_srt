Hello?

169
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,980
What are you doing? Busy?

170
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,080
No. Just chatting with colleagues. Why?

171
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,900
Nothing.

172
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
I missed you and then I called.
Because I have a bit of free time now.

173
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,570
- Where are you?
- In the hospital, of course.

174
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,060
Oh, yeah. Hospital.

175
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,900
(Seo Jun Ji, Seo Ri Hospital)

176
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,940
Why do you have a bit of free time?

177
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,120
There was an accident in the meeting.

178
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,260
Accident? What accident?

179
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,340
No big deal.

180
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,000
Something was loose and it dropped.

181
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,320
I just had a scratch.

182
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,640
You’re hurt?

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,620
I’m all right.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,470
Doctor.

185
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,030
I’m going back to the meeting.
I’ll go pick you up after work.

186
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:18,820
Ha Rin Oh?

187
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,670
Are you really all right?

188
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,610
Sorry to keep you worried.

189
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,950
But it’s no big deal. Don’t worry.

190
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,390
See you later.

191
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,190
- I gotta go.
- Yes.

192
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,280
- You had a long day.
- See you.

193
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,480
Seo Jun Ji!

194
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,980
What? I said I would pick you up.

195
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,880
- Let me check it. Be quick.
- What?

196
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,340
Let me check your wound.

197
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,940
You just came for this?

198
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,620
Come on. Check it out.

199
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,970
Come on. I’m not a kid.

200
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,040
Did you really need to rush here?

201
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,100
Also, I’m a doctor.

202
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,750
I should worry about you, instead.

203
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,240
- I’m back.
- All right.

204
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,180
Ui Yeong Kim?

205
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,510
What are you doing here?

206
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,100
What else can I do?

207
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,240
This is where your boyfriend works,
but I work here, too.

208
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,700
(Ui Yeong Kim, Seo Ri Hospital)

209
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,440
If I knew you were coming,
I would have bought three cups.

210
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,060
Come on. I told you to buy
sparkling water instead of coffee.

211
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,300
Just drink it. Don’t be picky.

212
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,740
But we’re having
the third cup of coffee today.

213
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,540
Have the fourth cup, then.
It makes no difference.

214
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,120
It makes difference.

215
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,080
What makes you laugh?

216
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,900
Nothing. You look lovely.

217
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,000
- What’s wrong with her?
- I don’t know, either.

218
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,540
Su Jin...

219
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,560
How’s she doing?

220
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,480
Very well, I guess.

221
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,850
She’s busy looking for a job.
I’m quite busy, too.

222
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,770
We haven't seen much of each other
lately.

223
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,110
That’s just an excuse.

224
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,460
Aren’t we busy?

225
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,250
I know. Being busy is just an excuse.

226
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,390
I think we’re in the burnout period.

227
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,000
I don’t know how it started, though.

228
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,280
(They’re in the burnout period?)

229
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,200
Su Jin mentioned you sometimes.

230
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,540
She did?

231
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,410
Not very obviously,

232
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,430
but she seems to miss the old days
we spent together.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,980
The coffee tastes great.

234
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,270
Yeah. Good coffee beans were used.

235
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,460
(Amazing Grace)

236
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,500
(Amazing Grace)

237
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,940
- Long time no see.
- Thank you, Hye Min.

238
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,100
(Amazing Grace)

239
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,640
You bought them from Hye Min’s cafe,
didn’t you?

240
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,760
Hye Min?

241
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,240
Who’s that?

242
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,630
Who else can she be? Seo Jun’s sister.

243
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,800
(When I felt something wrong
from your expression...)

244
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,740
I didn’t buy them from her cafe.

245
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:26,890
What?

246
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,370
Didn’t she die in an accident
when she was in high school?

247
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,570
(The uneasy sense I tried to ignore)

248
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,920
(came true.)

249
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,400
Hye Min died?

250
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,660
But...

251
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,740
Why?

252
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,170
- Why was she dead?
- Because of me.

253
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,440
That day...

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,620
Then why did you choose me,
instead of her?

255
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,430
Because it was the first time.

256
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,730
Seo Jun,

257
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,560
you invited me to dinner
for the first time ever.

258
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,140
If Mother hadn’t had dinner with me,
but Hye Min...

259
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,860
(Get off and walk)

260
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,810
(Left-turning signal, Turn left)
She might

261
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,010
be alive now.

262
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,660
(Get off and walk)

263
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,200
(Because I changed the past,
Su Jin left me.)

264
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,380
(And Hye Min died.)

265
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,260
(A high school girl was killed
by a motorcycle when crossing the road.)

266
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,680
(A high school girl was killed
by a motorcycle when crossing the road.)

267
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,320
(Signal light failure
led to an accident.)

268
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,000
(A high school girl died
at around 8:00 PM of May 27.)

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,520
(Signal lights at Seo Ri Crossroad,
Seo Ri City)

270
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,160
(had some failure for unknown reasons,
causing traffic chaos.)

271
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,950
(And a female student, 19,
was killed by a motorcycle)

272
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,660
(when she was crossing
Seo Ri Crossroad.)

273
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,460
(When I realized that
everything went wrong...)

274
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,600
(It was the same day.)

275
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,180
(Another chance.)

276
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,580
It’s my chance

277
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,060
to return to the past, get back Su Jin,

278
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,420
save Hye Min and also Seo Jun.

279
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,470
(But if I fail...)

280
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,500
(No. I can do it.)

281
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,580
(Because I made it once.
I’ll do better.)

282
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,760
Ha Rin, if you want
to go to the toilet...

283
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,690
I don’t want that.

284
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,170
I’ll make no mistake
and seize the chance.

285
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,440
Su Jin, there you are.

286
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,420
Stop looking at it.
Let’s go have some bread.

287
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,300
- Bread?
- Why?

288
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,610
Let’s go. Go get some bread.

289
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,750
What’s going on?

290
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,210
But your photos...

291
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,790
Have some more. Enjoy it.

292
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,130
What’s wrong with her?

293
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,620
(Mom, tonight, are you available?)

294
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,550
What? You...

295
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,050
Listen. I can’t follow you today.

296
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,690
So, just tell your mother
whatever you want to say.

297
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,140
- Got it?
- What are you talking about?

298
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,130
Don’t worry. She’ll reply immediately.

299
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,680
But you... you...

300
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,220
(Mom, tonight, are you available?)
(Yes, Seo Jun. Why?)

301
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,780
Smell it.

302
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,630
Which shall I choose?

303
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,780
Is this one okay?

304
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,970
Will your mother like it?

305
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,190
She certainly will.

306
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,350
You picked it for me, didn’t you?
You have quite good taste.

307
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,640
Don’t be dramatic.

308
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,130
Thank you for picking the gift
for my mother.

309
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,420
You’re welcome.
I wanted to do some shopping, too.

310
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,540
I’d like to thank you.

311
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,120
Thank you for always being there for me

312
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,920
and being friends with me
who is full of flaws.

313
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,960
I’m very grateful.

314
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,570
Why did you suddenly say this?
So cheesy.

315
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,650
Are you sick?

316
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,770
Having lost you

317
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,920
made me realize how important you were.

318
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,510
Having lost me?

319
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,960
Something like that.

320
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,740
Anyway, now you know
how important I am.

321
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,770
You’ll always be my friend, won’t you?

322
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,730
It depends.

323
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,450
Let’s go.

324
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,080
The weird note you gave me
really helped a lot.

325
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,610
(Seo Jun Ji)

326
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,310
Thank you. I couldn’t do it without you.

327
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,290
- Seo Ri Crossroad, please.
- All right.

328
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,210
How long will it take?

329
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,280
30 minutes, more or less.

330
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,920
It’ll be too late.

331
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,850
Sir, please turn right
at the intersection ahead of us.

332
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,220
- There’s a traffic jam there every day.
- Not today.

333
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,620
If there is, I won’t take
any responsibility.

334
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,320
It’s weird. There used to be
a traffic jam every day.

335
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,170
(I have one last thing to do.)

336
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,140
(Seoul)

337
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,450
(But as always...)

338
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,940
Hye Min!

339
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,120
(Danger comes)

340
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,860
(at the last second.)

341
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,540
(Time travel is only available on the day
of the photo-taking before midnight.)

342
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,640
Seo Jun? What? Do you need anything?

343
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,600
I...

344
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,660
Nothing. Never mind.
