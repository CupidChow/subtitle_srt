1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,660
Hello?

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,380
This is Seong Hun Bak
from the criminal squad of Mapo PD.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,350
Is that Hye Min Ji?

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,790
Yes. What’s up?

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,270
I’m calling for Seo Jun Ji’s case.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,920
When Seo Jun Ji died,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,040
someone witnessed the suspect.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,990
Who’s the witness?

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,700
Photo?

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,610
I burned the photos Seo Jun Ji left
and went back to the past.

11
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,360
Where are you going?

12
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,270
To the restroom.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,990
I’ll be right back.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,180
Why did she take her bag
to the restroom?

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,710
(Restroom)

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,550
(Restroom)

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,710
How can you go back to the past?

18
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,810
With the photo.

19
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,210
Photo?

20
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,410
I keep some photos Seo Jun Ji took
with his film camera.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,730
When I burn a photo, I can go back
to the day the photo was taken.

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,950
Photo?

23
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,590
Where are we going?

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,630
To his company.

25
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,850
He said he was going back there.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,880
Ha Rin, your...

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,670
(ID Card)

28
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,090
(ID Card Ha Rin Oh)

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,690
Sorry, I’m late.

30
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,350
Please open the door for me.

31
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,480
Please show me your ID card first.

32
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,470
(ID Card Ha Rin Oh)

33
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,530
What? It’s you?

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,900
Or what?

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,710
Who else can it be?

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,190
But you look quite different.

37
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,520
I had a plastic operation.

38
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,720
You did?

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,850
How long will it take?

40
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,740
Immediately. I’ll open it immediately.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,490
What kind of photos?

42
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,450
=Blue Birthday=

43
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,330
=Episode 10 If We Have
Such A Big Misfortune=

44
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,730
- Officer, what have you got?
- What?

45
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,580
Sin U Kim. Did he admit his crime?

46
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,830
- Who’s Sin U Kim?
- No idea.

47
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,830
You can’t stay here. Please leave.

48
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,050
Wasn’t he taken here?

49
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,570
You just caught the man
who stole Follenir, didn’t you?

50
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,480
We didn’t.

51
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,720
Did you report the case here?

52
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,070
No.

53
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,910
Eun Seong and I just...

54
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,350
We didn’t receive any report.

55
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,060
Go out and report the case.

56
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,850
- Sang Su.
- Yes.

57
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,040
- Show this lady the way.
- All right. Got it.

58
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,610
Officer. Officer!

59
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,260
Come with me, please.

60
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,590
Eun Seong,

61
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,560
Officer Choe suddenly behaved weirdly.

62
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,270
He said something odd.

63
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,630
Never mind. Are you in your office?

64
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,900
Could you come over?

65
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,680
What are you talking about? I’m home.

66
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,220
Home?

67
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,130
Didn’t you just leave for some business?

68
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,190
What’s going on?

69
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,110
You went to the police station?

70
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Didn’t we come together?
Because of Sin U Kim.

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,460
Sin U Kim? Who’s that?

72
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,710
My classmate who died in high school?

73
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,710
What?

74
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,830
Do you mean him?

75
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,420
The classmate of Seo Jun Ji and me.

76
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,940
Wait, wait.

77
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,240
You mean he died?

78
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,730
Yeah, when he was in Grade 11.
Don’t you remember?

79
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,890
(Rescue Team)

80
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,320
What happened? Who’s that?

81
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,800
He cut his wrist.

82
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,080
- Who?
- Sin U Kim.

83
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,230
(Sin U Kim died. What about Seo Jun Ji?)

84
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,290
(Seo Jun Ji)

85
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,810
(Not found)

86
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,520
(Still no contact number.)

87
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,900
(It means someone else
murdered Seo Jun Ji.)

88
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,790
(And the past was changed
when I didn’t know.)

89
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,380
(Can it be...?)

90
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,460
(There’re three photos left.)

91
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,500
(The first one is in the notebook.)

92
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,300
(The second one is in the photo frame.)

93
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,530
(The last one)

94
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,180
(was put in the bag.)

95
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,210
Why is it missing?

96
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,210
(One photo is missing.)

97
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,800
(Someone stole the photo and burned it.)

98
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,910
(Who was it?)

99
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,590
(After telling Eun Seong everything,
I feel light-hearted now.)

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,670
How can you go back to the past?

101
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,430
With the photo.

102
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,360
I keep some photos Seo Jun Ji took
with his film camera.

103
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,760
When I burn a photo, I can go back
to the day the photo was taken.

104
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,860
(No, it can’t be Eun Seong.)

105
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,240
(Who else can it be?)

106
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,820
(I met Su Jin in Hye Min’s café.)

107
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,140
I went back to the past
with the photo Seo Jun Ji left.

108
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,210
(I’ll start from the last place
I visited.)

109
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,430
Hye Min!

110
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,570
(Restroom)

111
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,130
Sorry, Hye Min.

112
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,380
You’re closed already.

113
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,480
It’s okay. Take your time.

114
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,830
It seems to be important to you.

115
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,960
Yes, it is.

116
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,750
Did you see any burning trace
in the restroom?

117
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,710
Burning trace?

118
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,400
Nothing.

119
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,470
Take your time.
Come out when you finish.

120
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,720
I’ll wait for you out there.

121
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,210
It’s not here.

122
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,390
Wait.

123
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,100
Here it is.

124
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,000
You just left it.

125
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,690
(ID Card)

126
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,070
Thank you, Hye Min.

127
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,300
I was too busy and didn’t notice it.

128
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,980
I totally understand.

129
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,340
Ha Rin, if I found something tomorrow,
I would contact you immediately.

130
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,340
Thank you, Hye Min.

131
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,230
Go back home early.

132
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,850
- Be careful on your way back home.
- I will.

133
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,470
(Hye Min?)

134
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,500
(No, I can’t draw a conclusion
without evidence.)

135
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,330
(2011 suicidal case
in Seo Ri High School)

136
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,650
(“Famous high school” collapsed?
It may be a murder, but no suspect was found.)

137
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,010
(“Famous high school” collapsed?
It may be a murder, but no suspect was found.)

138
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,750
So, he might not kill himself.

139
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,570
(Special points: No “hesitation scars” were found
that often appeared in a suicide.)

140
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,510
He also cut his wrist.

141
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,180
(If the one who killed Seo Jun Ji
murdered Sin U Kim,)

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,780
(there must have been some traces.)

143
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,700
(And...)

144
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,020
(June 9.)

145
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,220
(The day after Sin U Kim died.)

146
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,140
Ha Rin Oh!

147
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,280
(The day...)

148
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,740
We agreed to go together.
Why did you slip away?

149
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,560
(...before you died.)

150
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Not Sin U Kim.

151
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,070
What does that mean?

152
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,630
It wasn’t Sin U Kim who killed you.

153
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,910
When I sent Sin U Kim to the police

154
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,580
with the evidence you gave me,

155
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,690
someone broke into my home,
stole the photo,

156
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,530
and came back here to kill Sin U Kim.

157
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,450
What are you talking about?

158
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,460
I think the one who murdered you
killed him.

159
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,590
In the way he killed you.

160
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,690
It was investigated as a murder case,
instead of a suicide.

161
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,060
But the suspect was released
due to lack of evidence.

162
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,630
Wait. Why must he kill Sin U Kim?

163
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,490
If he hadn’t,
Sin U Kim would take the blame.

164
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,160
I guess

165
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,950
he regarded Sin U Kim as a time bomb.

166
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,410
Without Sin U Kim,

167
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,310
the police wouldn’t
investigate the case 10 years ago.

168
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,140
No one knows what statement
Sin U Kim would make.

169
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,640
Then why are you coming back again?

170
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,340
If the murderer came back to the past
and killed Sin U Kim,

171
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,960
he must have left some traces
somewhere at school.

172
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,840
Tinnitus.

173
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,780
He may not know about tinnitus.

174
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,320
So, he was very likely to leave
some evidence of his crime.

175
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,520
(Seo Jun Ji)
Did anyone behave weirdly yesterday?

176
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,380
Weirdly?

177
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,220
If he was back in the past
for the first time,

178
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,200
he would do some odd things

179
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,400
like I did before.

180
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,040
I’m not sure.
I don’t think there was one.

181
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,990
Let’s go confirm the video first.

182
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,710
He died in the art room...

183
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,000
What’s wrong?

184
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,140
- It’s gone.
- Gone?

185
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,050
I put it here.

186
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:21,790
Was it

187
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,230
taken away?

188
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,990
By the murderer?

189
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,670
But in this case,

190
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,780
only the two of us…

191
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,240
Did you see it?

192
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,780
It’s a long story. So, I...

193
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,510
To catch the murderer,
I went back to the past

194
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,630
and hid a video recorder
in the photo studio.

195
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,030
Seo Jun Ji confirmed the video

196
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,530
and sent it to 10 years later,
I mean, the present me.

197
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,280
(Can it be Eun Seong?)

198
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,700
Let’s look for some other evidence.

199
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,830
Like a knife or something.

200
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,700
(5. There may be Follenir in the opened drink.)
(There may be Follenir in the opened drink.)

201
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,940
The bottle of Follenir!

202
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,210
It’s an animal anesthetic.

203
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,510
It was used when you died.

204
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,790
Anesthetic?

205
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,220
I thought I was a kind boy.

206
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,770
Turns out I am not.

207
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,660
It’s not because you were a bad boy.

208
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,560
Let’s go. Go get the murderer.

209
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,830
What? What’s he doing?

210
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:16,910
What are you doing?

211
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,090
- I lost something.
- Oh.

212
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,150
Seo Jun Ji!

213
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,820
- You found it?
- Yes.

214
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,690
Go report to the police.

215
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,150
- Wait.
- Why?

216
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,570
What’s wrong?

217
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,630
No... nothing.

218
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,250
Ha Rin Oh.

219
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,730
(Was it really Hye Min?)

220
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,740
Ha Rin Oh.

221
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:46,970
What?

222
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,900
We’ve done what we can do.

223
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,800
Let’s go find the video recorder.

224
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,730
Maybe someone put it away accidentally.

225
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:56,920
All right.

226
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,600
What... what?

227
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,750
Be sensitive, will you?

228
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,940
We’re holding hands for the first time.

229
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,630
We just hold hands. What’s the big deal?

230
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,470
- We just hold hands?
- Yeah.

231
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,350
We’ve been in a relationship
for ten years. It’s no big deal.

232
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,150
10 years?

233
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,070
I can’t believe
we’re in love for 10 years.

234
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,670
I really can’t believe it.

235
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,070
What does that mean?

236
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,590
You really like me a lot.

237
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,230
I think you like me a lot.

238
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,000
(Why do I think of that at this moment?)

239
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,910
Be careful.

240
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,140
When you change the past casually,
there’ll be big trouble...

241
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,040
You’re right…

242
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,930
...and misfortune.

243
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,890
(Ae Do Agency)

244
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,290
(We may avoid small misfortune.)

245
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,710
Are you all right?

246
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,170
(But if we have such a big misfortune)

247
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,200
(that we can’t bear,)

248
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,030
(what do I do?)

249
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,330
Seo Jun.

250
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,840
Seo Jun Ji!

251
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,600
Seo Jun Ji!

252
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,250
(Misfortune comes with time travel.)

253
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,660
Hey.

254
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,680
- Tomorrow...
- I know. It’s your birthday.

255
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,520
Aren’t you tired
of saying it all the time?

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,600
I’m not tired at all.
I’ll keep saying it till tomorrow.

257
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,130
Impressive. Impressive.

258
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,240
So, what’s your plan for tomorrow?

259
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,330
Shall we have something to eat
after school?

260
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,960
It’s my birthday. It’s on me.

261
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,680
What a surprise!

262
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,790
There are five of us.
Can you afford the food?

263
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,050
I’m not like someone

264
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,190
who doesn’t even want to use his films.

265
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,260
Do you know how many photos
I’ve taken of you since that day?

266
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,300
What?

267
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,670
Forget it. Don’t bother.

268
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,110
Go stand there.
I’ll take a photo of you.

269
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,560
Why are you so generous today?

270
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,280
I’ll no longer call you Miser.

271
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,060
Never mind.

272
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,180
I’ll have you buy
a lot of food for me tomorrow.

273
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,770
All right. Go stand there.

274
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,760
One, two.
