1
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,490
Sin U Kim.

2
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,940
=Blue Birthday=

3
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,620
=Episode 9=
=Witness=

4
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,420
Sin U, I’m leaving.

5
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,300
I have some items to confirm.

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,630
OK, off you go.

7
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,040
Be quick and get back
to the company directly.

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,710
Do... do you know me?

9
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,170
What?

10
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,390
Excuse me, are you driving back
to your company?

11
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,540
Yes. What’s wrong?

12
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,520
I’m going to the neighborhood.
If it’s convenient,

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,260
may I take a lift?

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,950
You want a lift?

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,460
(Does Sin U Kim
not recognize me at all?)

16
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,940
Sin U.

17
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,310
My... my van is messy, isn’t it?

18
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,630
No. The van of our center is worse.

19
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you for giving me a lift.

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,700
You’re welcome. You’re welcome.

21
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,360
If you need any help, let me know.

22
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,660
I’ve worked here for a long time,
but I’ve never seen you before.

23
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,710
How long have you been working?

24
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,590
I... I haven’t worked for a long time.

25
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,950
How long have you worked there?

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,040
Me?

27
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,710
For five years.

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,660
Five years?

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,370
You must know a lot about the center,
including trifles?

30
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,680
Not really.

31
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,920
Sir, where do you usually
deliver things to?

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
Our center, Suwon, and where else?

33
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,470
Interesting.

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,250
What?

35
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,170
I can’t remember unless I only deliver
to one or two centers, can I?

36
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,590
You have a very good memory?

37
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,680
Looks like I asked a boring question.

38
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,400
You look very busy.

39
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,160
You may be doing a good job,
but I’m not.

40
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,310
(Where are you?)

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,440
(In Hye Min’s café.
Do you need me to pick you up?)

42
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,160
(No. I’m on my way.)

43
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,860
(How?)

44
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,980
(Eun Seong Cha)

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,280
(In Sin U Kim’s van...)

46
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,130
Darn it! I wanna kill them.

47
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,650
I’m sorry. A car suddenly cut off.

48
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,620
Yeah.

49
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,620
(In Hye Min’s café.)
(Do you need me to pick you up?)

50
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,660
(No. I’m on my way.)
(How?)

51
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,230
Ha Rin hasn’t arrived yet?

52
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,030
No. I think she’s in a traffic jam.

53
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,060
I offered to pick her up,
but she didn’t text back.

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,780
You often meet lately?

55
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,160
Yes.

56
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,280
Are you in a...?

57
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,670
No. She just needed me for some help.

58
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,440
You said you came in Sin U Kim’s van?

59
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,450
He just went to my workplace.
What good luck I had!

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,130
That wasn’t good luck.

61
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,390
Anyway, what do you mean
Seo Jun Ji was murdered?

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,870
Eun Seong, don’t be scared.
Now, listen carefully.

63
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,810
What’s wrong? Why are you so serious?

64
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,160
Sin U Kim killed Seo Jun.

65
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,610
What? Come on. What does it mean?
How did you know that?

66
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,160
- I...
- Did you see it?

67
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,740
It’s a long story. So, I...

68
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,750
To catch the murderer,
I went back to the past

69
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,650
and hid a video recorder
in the photo studio.

70
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,090
Seo Jun Ji confirmed the video

71
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,410
and sent it to 10 years later,
I mean, the present me.

72
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,330
Wait, wait.

73
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,040
You mean you hid a video recorder
in the photo studio

74
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,160
and Seo Jun Ji sent it to you
after watching the video?

75
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,040
Seo Jun Ji who died 10 years ago?

76
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,230
Yes. You don’t understand, do you?
Actually, I didn’t...

77
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,620
No way. You must be kidding.

78
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,510
I’m not kidding.

79
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,300
Ha Rin Oh, you’re from the future,
aren’t you?

80
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,450
I thought it was impossible.
But it was true.

81
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,590
What?

82
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:30,140
I knew the present you
went back to us 10 years ago.

83
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,440
I had thought there couldn’t be
any time travel.

84
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,540
Do you still not listen
even in ten years?

85
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,860
I don’t, obviously.

86
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,350
Why do you always come
to the photo studio?

87
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,050
This is where you would die.

88
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,900
In a couple of days, Seo Jun Ji died.

89
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,060
Exactly the photo studio.

90
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,500
So, you knew...?

91
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,840
Anyway, Sin U Kim killed Seo Jun Ji.

92
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,980
To get Seo Jun back to life,
we must catch Sin U Kim first.

93
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,740
He’ll get back to life
when Sin U Kim is caught?

94
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,890
To catch him,

95
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,360
we must figure out when he planned
to kill Seo Jun Ji.

96
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,630
Then you’ll go back to save Seo Jun Ji
with the evidence we find now?

97
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,970
Yes.

98
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,370
All right.

99
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,370
You never joke about Seo Jun Ji.

100
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,290
I don’t know anything,
but I keep something from you.

101
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,940
What are you keeping from me?

102
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,290
When you asked me
for the files about Seo Jun Ji...

103
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,560
Oh, this part isn’t important.

104
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Move to the next page.

105
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,110
So, the testimony...

106
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,830
I didn’t want you to read too much

107
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,120
in case you suspected something
and got more shocked.

108
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,600
Help me, Eun Seong.

109
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,320
I want to get Seo Jun back to life.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,070
I’ve been hesitating
if I should show you this.

111
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,540
I should, shouldn’t I?

112
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,570
The number is wrong again.

113
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,540
What?

114
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,770
Follenir.

115
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,220
- One box is missing.
- Again?

116
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,740
- It happened last month, didn’t it?
- Yes.

117
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,830
I called their company at that time.

118
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,550
But one box is missing again.

119
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,600
It’s weird.

120
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,860
Did the driver forget
to bring it out of the van?

121
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,380
It’s weird.

122
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,270
(An empty bottle of Follenir was found.)

123
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,500
Follenir?

124
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,210
You know what Follenir is, don’t you?

125
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,760
Yes. It’s an animal anesthetic.

126
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:00,700
Right.

127
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,350
Follenir is different now.

128
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,880
But 10 years ago, it was narcotic

129
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,580
and could easily be bought.

130
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,190
When someone used Follenir,
he would hallucinate.

131
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,700
And his ears would be drained of color
and turn bruised.

132
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,930
So, Seo Jun Ji...?

133
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,600
Such symptoms were found on his body.

134
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,540
(4. An empty bottle of Follenir was found
in the bathroom across the crime scene.)

135
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,980
He cut his wrist without hesitation
with his injured left hand.

136
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,340
(I have something to tell you.
See you after class.)

137
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,490
(See you at the photo studio.)
The text I never sent.

138
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,500
(Wait for me and enjoy the drink I gave you.)
And Follenir.

139
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,460
There were many unreasonable points
if it was a suicide case.

140
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,100
Even though,
this case wasn’t investigated.

141
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,770
Not only because his parents refused
to do the autopsy,

142
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,760
but also because the police believed
that it was a suicide

143
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,460
and wanted to close the case quickly.

144
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,330
(5. There may be Follenir
in the opened drink.)

145
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,660
(There may be Follenir
in the opened drink.)

146
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,100
It was a message from my senior.

147
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,650
It’s about Sin U Kim.

148
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,150
It’s easy to check up on him
because he has a criminal record.

149
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,880
(Theft and violence)
Looks like he still lives near our school.

150
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,860
(Se Jun)

151
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,830
Hello?

152
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,800
Hello, Ha Rin.

153
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,650
(Revan Animal Medical Center)
I want to confirm something with you.

154
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,080
Where’s the registration file
of last month?

155
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,940
In the drugs we just received,

156
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,280
some bottles of Follenir are missing.

157
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,080
I want to call and confirm.

158
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,320
Do you know who delivered drugs to us?

159
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,460
Bottles of Follenir are missing?

160
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,200
All right, then.

161
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,300
Where are we going?

162
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,410
To his company.

163
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,840
He said he was going back there.

(What does he want to do with it?)

169
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,250
Sin U, are you tired?

170
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,870
Every time I see you, you look pale.

171
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,660
No, no.

172
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,860
No?

173
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,240
Let’s finish it soon and get back.

Yes, I’m sure.

No. I’m going to the van.

Sin U Kim,

190
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,760
you’re under arrest for the violation
of the administration of antipsychotics.

191

You can find yourself a lawyer.

From now on, anything you say may
be used against you in a court of law.

193
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:13,970
You!

Yangpyeong, Daejeon...

195
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,310
You know it’s a drug, don’t you?

196
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,520
It is?

197
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,050
It is?

198
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,840
Take a drug test and we’ll know.

199
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,410
Let’s make a long story short.

200
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,080
How did you deal
with the Follenir you stole?

201
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,310
I’m asking you!

202
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,780
Did you sell it?

203
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,200
How can I sell so few drugs?

204
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,910
You mean you used all the Follenir?

205
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,590
I wondered where I saw them.

206
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,590
What are you talking about?

207
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,100
Yeah.

208
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,750
Those annoying guys.

209
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,630
What?

210
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,200
Nothing. There was a guy I hated most.

211
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,930
I wondered where I saw them.
So, they’re his friends.

212
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,110
Sin U Kim,

213
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,890
stop talking nonsense.

214
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,570
I wondered why they suddenly came to me.

215
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,530
Officer,

216
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,410
they’re not interested
in my drug-taking,

217
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,320
but something else.

218
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,670
What are you talking about?

219
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,530
He deserved it.

220
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,440
Officer, what have you got?

221
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,710
Didn’t I tell you not to stay here?

222
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,030
Didn’t Reporter Cha tell you
before he left?

223
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,170
Sin U Kim has something to do
with the murder.

224
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,650
Didn’t you see the video I offered?

225
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,870
How many times have I told you?
It can’t be used as evidence.

226
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,420
It’s not the surveillance video
of the crime scene.

227
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,830
The victim wasn’t in it, either.

228
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,110
What about Follenir?

229
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,110
He drank something with Follenir in it.

230
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,230
Any evidence against Sin U Kim?

231
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,630
If he was caught using Follenir
10 years ago, it might mean something.

232
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,100
Do we have that kind of evidence now?

233
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,830
Off you go.

234
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,190
I’m pretty sure!

235
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,780
Don’t let him go. Please trust me.

236
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,040
Let’s talk about it later. Off you go.

237
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,830
He deserved it!

238
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,310
Sin U Kim! What are you doing?

239
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,970
He deserved it.

240
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,330
What does that mean?

241
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,690
Officer, you know it, don’t you?

242
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,130
Some guys pretend to be kind and nice.

243
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,810
When we get to know them,
we realize they’re the most disgusting.

244
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,400
Is it only me

245
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,110
who hate such guys?

246
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,230
Officer,

247
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,160
I... I...

248
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,840
I’m very important.

249
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,220
You don’t know that, do you?

250
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,450
What?

251
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,840
Did Seo Jun Ji

252
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,670
really kill himself?

253
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,440
What?

254
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,420
What do you mean?

255
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,510
You mean you killed him?

256
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,130
No. What the hell!

257
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,950
Everybody thinks I’m a murderer.

258
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,580
But I’m sorry to tell you that.

259
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,150
Actually,

260
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,280
I’m not a murderer,

261
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,340
but a witness.

262
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,020
This time...

263
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,430
This time, I’ll cut something else.

264
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,760
What?

265
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,500
You said you were the witness.

266
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,640
Why didn’t you tell anyone before?

267
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,030
Anyway, people think I’m a murderer.

268
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,420
What difference would it make
if I told someone?

269
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,210
Are you sure you saw the murderer?

270
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,150
Yes.

271
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,660
How could I ever forget that?

272
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,000
(Seo Jun Ji)

273
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,030
Who’s that?

274
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,680
Tell me!

275
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,050
It was her.

276
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,670
The librarian.

00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,680
(Sin U Kim)

278
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,000
(Anyone can have a time travel.)

279
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,590
Why do you want to see me
at this time of day?

280
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,440
Your lips...

281
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:07,570
Here.

282
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,980
I said you didn’t need
to have it repaired.

283
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,630
But you insisted and brought it back
two days later.

284
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,040
You broke it because of me.

285
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,410
I didn’t know
the repair would take two days.

286
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,410
I had it repaired,
but you complained about me.

287
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
All right, then. Thank you.

288
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,930
The repairman said
he was good at repairing cameras.

289
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,750
He must have perfectly repaired it.

290
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,630
- He did a good job.
- He did?

291
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,030
He was good at repairing cameras.

292
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,050
He must have perfectly repaired it.
