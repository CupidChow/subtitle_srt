- Stop him!

Ha Rin Oh! Ha Rin Oh!

- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Calm down.

Let’s pray. May she rest in peace.

I believe she’ll leave in peace.

Thank you for always being my friend,

regardless of my defects.

17
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,760
I’m sorry. Don’t get angry.
Just for this once.

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,280
If you stand me up again
or skip one more class,

19
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,000
I won’t let you go.

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,020
When Ha Rin Oh asked us
to take this photo,

26
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,030
I didn’t want it
and I lost my temper on her.

27
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,020
If I knew this,
I should have obeyed her.

28
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,370
No matter how hard I recall,

29
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,290
all I remember is how I was impatient
with her and how I teased her.

30
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,330
If I knew this, I should have apologized
instead of being impatient.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,550
I should have told her,
“I enjoy having fun with you.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,040
And thank you for being my friend.”

33

Doctors said my daughter had
a brain death. Brain death.

Even if she still breathes,
she’s not exactly alive.

Madam, we understand your feelings.

- But...
- But what?

43
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,690
How can you call her suspect?

44
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,690
She might never wake up again!

45

- It’s a total mess.
- Yeah.

90
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,480
Am I right?

91
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,440
Give it to me.

92
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,820
Look.

93
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,230
According to how you roll it,

94
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,870
you’ll get different numbers of photos.

95
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,820
Can’t we just have 24 photos?

96
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,620
But if you clamp the ending part well,

97
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,660
you can take 25 photos.

Hello?

101
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,030
Seo Jun Ji, the suspect just ran away.

102
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,660
What? She ran away?

103
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,230
If she goes to you, contact me.

104
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,630
Not that way. The other way around!

105
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,000
The knife Hye Min used
is still in the school.

106
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,740
She’ll try her best to destroy it.

107
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,780
We must find it before her.

108

Hye Min is back to the past.

109
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,690
Ha Rin, listen carefully.
Leave the school immediately.

110
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,690
What? Why?

111
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,150
The police called me
and said Hye Min ran away.

112
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,080
I guess she’ll get back to school soon.

113
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,110
What? But I haven’t found
the evidence yet.

114
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,910
I’ll find it. Don’t worry. Leave first.

115
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,020
The back gate is closed.
Take the front gate. Got it?

116
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,710
Stay with crowds

117
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,090
so that Hye Min can’t reach you.

118
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,900
If we search together,
won’t there be more hope?

119
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,720
What is he thinking about?

120
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,130
No!

121
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,270
What?

122
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,530
Do you know where In Yeong Lee is?

123
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,750
- On the bench at the gate.
- Thank you.

124
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,140
Do you have a carving knife?

125
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,750
- What?
- May I have a look?

126
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,880
- This?
- Yes.

127
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,790
What are you doing?
Trying to kill yourself?

128
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,040
Sorry. I’m sorry.

129

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,980
What? It’s you.

134
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,510
I thought it was Ha Rin Oh.

135
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,370
What a surprise!

136
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,110
Hye Min, let’s talk.

137
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,430
Talk? About what?

138
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,960
For the sake of Mom and Dad,
stop doing this.

139
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,240
You sound so boring.

140
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,560
Let’s have some fun, shall we?

141
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,600
Hye Min, must you do this?

142
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,270
Cut the crap.

143
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,170
Do you have the knife I’m looking for?

144
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,100
I’m asking you!

145
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,650
You won’t change your mind, will you?

146
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,470
What?

147
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,440
You still want to kill me, don’t you?

148
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,650
What if I say yes?

149
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,040
Will you surrender yourself?

150
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,370
Surrender? Me?

151
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,990
Go surrender yourself.
It’s the best choice for you!

152
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,690
It’s the best choice for me?

153
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,620
Why can you choose for me?
Who do you think you are?

154
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,920
Because I burned a photo, as you did.

155
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,350
There’s something you don’t know.

156
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,480
You have to pay the price
for changing the past.

157
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,850
Price?

158
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,360
Will I die?

159
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,960
Yes. I saw it before I came here.

160
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,980
I saw what price you paid.

161
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,510
It doesn’t matter.

162
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,370
After killing you and your friend,

163
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,830
I’ll kill myself, anyway.

164
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,690
What about Mom?

165
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,460
What?

166
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,160
What do I do? It’s all my fault.

167
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:48,530
When you have a brain death,
Mom is devastated.

168
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,380
I get it now.

169
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,860
Anyway, she abandoned me
when I was little!

170
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,000
- She never abandoned you.
- Shut up!

171
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,680
Dad and Mom love you.
Don’t you even know?

172
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,280
Shut up!

173
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,010
I said, shut up.

174
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,170
If you surrender now,

175
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,320
you won’t suffer or pay the price.

176
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,290
You can make a fresh start.

177
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,210
I’m gonna kill you!

178
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,360
- Go to hell!
- Hye Min, enough!

179
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,010
Hye Min.

180
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,270
Hye Min, are you all right?

181
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,110
Hye Min.

182
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,090
(At that time,)

183
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,870
(we felt)

184
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,230
(our abilities to save each other)

185
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,520
(and the chances to change
the regrettable past)

186
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,950
(were disappearing.)

187
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,780
(According to how you roll it,
you’ll get different numbers of photos.)

188
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,350
You know what day it is today, right?

189
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,020
What day is it today?

190
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,270
Gift. My birthday gift.

191
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,820
It’s a birthday gift for me?

192
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,340
Certainly, it is.

193
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,640
I can’t ride the bike. Ride it yourself.

194
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,790
I’m hurt, aren’t I?

195
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,530
- You’re giving me your bike?
- Yeah.

196
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,690
You know I can’t ride it, right?

197
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,430
Yes. I know it very well.

198
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,510
Are you kidding me?

199
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,860
No, I’m very serious.

200
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,220
Fine, just kidding.

201
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,570
I’ll give you the gift later.
Now let me take this back.

202
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,330
Let’s go. The bell is going to ring.

203
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,220
Hey, Seo Jun Ji!

204
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,200
I...

205
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,870
Nothing. Never mind.

206
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,340
See you later.

207
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,610
Hey, Ha Rin Oh!
