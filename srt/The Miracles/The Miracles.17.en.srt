1
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,620
Where is this?

2
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:21,659
A-Hai?

3
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,180
You're awake.

4
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,620
Who are you?

5
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,939
You don't recognize me?

6
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,299
I'm Chang'an.

7
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,700
Jia Chang'an.

8
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,620
Why do you look so old?

9
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,540
His current memory

10
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,420
is stuck at age twenty-six.

11
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,299
Did you find the person I'm looking for?

12
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,299
Yes, we found her.

13
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,379
You need to meet her first.

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,540
Okay.

15
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,900
My name is Jia Chang'an.

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,859
I'm Gao Haitian's good friend.

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,819
Haitian was in a car accident abroad.

18
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,260
He lost part of his memory.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,219
He keeps thinking

20
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,020
that it's currently 1999.

21
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,099
The doctor said

22
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,180
if we can find a way

23
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,699
to make him truly

24
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,939
return to 1999

25
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,819
and meet some people

26
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,300
who are very important to him,

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,939
it might help him

28
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:21,740
recover his memory.

29
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,620
That's

30
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,460
why I came to find your mother.

31
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,500
Was my mother important to him?

32
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,340
This photo

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,379
A-Hai always carried with him.

34
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,379
A-Hai.

35
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,860
Do you remember this place?

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,860
This...

37
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,180
is the night school.

38
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:48,819
Right.

39
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:50,979
Our night school.

40
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:22,539
Excuse me,

41
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,060
do you know

42
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:28,819
where the English class is?

43
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:30,620
Follow me.

44
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,900
Are you here to learn English too?

45
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:35,659
Yes.

46
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,379
What's your name?

47
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,419
My name is...

48
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,379
You'll find out in a moment.

49
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,219
Hurry, hurry!

50
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:44,819
Chang'an!

51
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:47,780
There's a spot here!

52
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,620
The teacher is here.

53
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,900
Hello everyone, my name is Wu Xueqing.

54
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,460
I'm a student at Shenzhen University.

55
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,139
I'm also Teacher Wang's teaching assistant.

56
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,860
Welcome, everyone,

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,539
to Xinghui Night School to learn English.

58
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,219
Before we start class,

59
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,939
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

60
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:05,539
This way, everyone can

61
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:06,580
get to know each other.

62
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,379
Why do you want to learn English?

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm in the clothing business.

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,419
Many foreigners come to buy clothes.

65
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,699
If I learn English well,

66
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:14,979
business will be better.

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,980
I'm a tour guide.

68
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,139
I lead tours for Hong Kong, China groups.

69
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,860
I usually

70
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,420
deal with many overseas tourists.

71
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,779
They give good tips.

72
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,379
You earn money faster.

73
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:23,740
I, uh...

74
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,259
I sell mobile phones at Huaqiangbei.

75
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:27,139
And pagers.

76
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
I source goods directly from foreigners,

77
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,500
to avoid middlemen taking a cut.

78
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,459
I'm from Macau, China.

79
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,819
The handover is coming soon.

80
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:36,980
The Macau, China Tourism Office

81
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,100
is recruiting English-speaking volunteers.

82
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,620
I want to contribute to the handover too.

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,300
How about you?

84
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,939
I... I haven't really thought about it.

85
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,100
It seems everyone's motivation for learning English

86
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,980
is quite different.

87
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,019
You all have your notebooks, right?

88
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,660
Let's do a quick in-class test.

89
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,540
It'll help me gauge your level.

90
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,620
Use this as the topic

91
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,500
to write a short essay.

92
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,379
No word limit.

93
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,819
Time limit: fifteen minutes.

94
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,100
Time starts now.

95
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:19,339
Mister.

96
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,579
You're Gao Haitian, right?

97
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:23,779
Do you know who I am?

98
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,980
You remind me a lot of someone.

99
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,259
But...

100
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,540
I just can't remember who.

101
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,139
So you're really playing the amnesia card.

102
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,699
It's okay. You'll remember.

103
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,779
Let me take you out for a walk.

104
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:41,339
Mister.

105
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,259
Do you know

106
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,500
what I'm riding?

107
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:45,779
It's also a bicycle.

108
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,060
It's not like your old-fashioned one.

109
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,420
How can it be different?

110
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,740
Mine is a shared bike.

111
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,500
How does that "sharing" work?

112
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,500
Now in Shenzhen, everything is shared.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,899
There are shared bikes,

114
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,220
power banks,

115
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:00,459
karaoke...

116
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,339
Anything you can think of.

117
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,620
I've never heard of that.

118
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,620
It's not that you don't understand.

119
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,699
It's that the world is changing too fast.

120
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,980
That's true.

121
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,259
It really is too fast.

122
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:13,500
Hold on.

123
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,180
What's wrong?

124
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,540
The chain came off.

125
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,300
I know.

126
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,620
There's a bike repair shop nearby.

127
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,019
I'll go with you to get it fixed.

128
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,500
I know.

129
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,740
There's a bike repair shop nearby.

130
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:29,980
Let me go with you to get it fixed.

131
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,100
Your bike's broken.

132
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,379
I know.

133
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,459
There's a repair shop nearby.

134
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,579
I'll go with you to get it fixed.

135
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,379
Okay, thanks.

136
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,379
Go in this direction.

137
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,139
Cross the mountains and then the sea.

138
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,139
That's where my home is.

139
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,139
I've never been to Macau, China.

140
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:02,779
Macau, China welcomes you.

141
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,259
You still haven't told me.

142
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,459
Where's your hometown?

143
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,459
My hometown is in Hunan.

144
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,579
Why did you come to night school?

145
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,259
People back in my hometown all say,

146
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:17,939
if you want to change your fate,

147
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:18,819
come to Shenzhen.

148
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,220
After I graduated,

149
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,220
I went to work for an electronics company.

150
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,100
I worked there for four years.

151
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:24,899
There was no progress at all in my job.

152
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:26,779
So I wanted to come here and try.

153
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,339
So you came to night school

154
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,139
to restart your life?

155
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:32,699
Restart.

156
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:35,379
Let me teach you a saying.

157
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,139
It's never too old to learn.

158
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,259
Repeat after me.

159
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,699
It's never too old to learn.

160
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:43,899
Let me teach you another one.

161
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,379
Courage can change everything.

162
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,259
We come to night school

163
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,579
isn't it precisely to learn?

164
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,660
And the purpose of learning

165
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
isn't it precisely

166
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,139
to become better and better?

167
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,699
Can I really do it?

168
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,220
Of course.

169
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,220
Hello?

170
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,019
Hello?

171
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,420
Xueqing?

172
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
The rain's getting heavier.

173
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:16,459
Is anyone in your dorm?

174
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:17,459
No.

175
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:18,819
They all went home for the holiday.

176
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,660
Well, be careful.

177
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,699
It's fine, I'm okay.

178
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:25,339
Wait a second.

179
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,699
Hello? Hello, what's wrong?

180
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,339
Hello?

181
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,779
Are you tying up a prisoner?

182
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,460
Look at it yourself.

183
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,019
Is this how you tie up a prisoner?

184
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,460
It's raining so hard outside.

185
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,259
Doesn't it feel like the end of the world?

186
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:52,700
Not just like it, it *is*.

187
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,259
Nineteen ninety-nine.

188
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,019
The end of the world, don't you know?

189
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:57,779
Tell me,

190
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,019
if it really is the end of the world,

191
00:08:59,019 --> 00:08:59,700
what would we do?

192
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,460
I still have so many things I haven't done.

193
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:02,580
What about you?

194
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,019
If it's the end of the world,

195
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,259
do you have any regrets?

196
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,580
You have to promise me.

197
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,139
You will survive.

198
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,580
No matter what happens,

199
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:20,779
you will never give up.

200
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:22,779
I promise.

201
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,980
Never give up.

202
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,139
I'll never let go, Jack.

203
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,500
I'll never let go.

204
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,539
Even if we really face the end of the world,

205
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,019
I would have no regrets.

206
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,139
Because at this moment,

207
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:44,779
I am with you.

208
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,419
I promise.

209
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,899
I'll never let go.

210
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,779
I'll never let go, Jack.

211
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:16,659
I'll never let go.

212
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,899
I figure life is a gift.

213
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,539
I don't intend on wasting it.

214
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:27,779
You never know

215
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,899
what hand you're gonna get dealt next.

216
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,259
You learn to take life

217
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,500
and make every day meaningful.

218
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,899
Your spoken English has improved by leaps and bounds.

219
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,379
The teacher is good.

220
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,899
It's a pity this teacher of yours

221
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:47,899
won't be teaching for much longer.

222
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,139
Why?

223
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:50,899
Being a teaching assistant here

224
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,259
was just a part-time job anyway.

225
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,139
I applied to New York University

226
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,379
for a master's in anthropology.

227
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,139
Haitian.

228
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:04,659
Have you ever thought about

229
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,659
going out into the wider world,

230
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,620
to take a look?

231
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,899
The world out there is vast.

232
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,379
I think while we're young,

233
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,179
we can bravely go out and explore.

234
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:23,179
During my time at the night school,

235
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,019
I've met many friends.

236
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,139
What moved me most is that,

237
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,379
no matter their profession,

238
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,259
their age, or their background,

239
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,659
they all want to work hard to change themselves.

240
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,379
Actually, each one of us,

241
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,620
as long as we have the desire to change,

242
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,019
this world

243
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,500
will be bigger than we imagine.

244
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:43,779
And the road beneath our feet

245
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,620
will be longer than we imagine.

246
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,299
Make every day meaningful.

247
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,740
Studying abroad.

248
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm thinking of quitting my job

249
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:05,899
to focus on the TOEFL exam.

250
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,500
Then later apply to New York University.

251
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:10,740
You're even applying

252
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,059
to the same university as her.

253
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:12,779
And you still dare say

254
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,059
you haven't fallen for her?

255
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,899
I just feel that after meeting her,

256
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,179
my life seems to have

257
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,980
become full of infinite possibilities.

258
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,059
Let me ask you,

259
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,860
does she know about this?

260
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,259
I wanted to wait

261
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,539
until I actually got in before telling her.

262
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:29,659
Alright.

263
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,659
You, this is just scheming.

264
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,379
Brother, I wish your little plot succeeds.

265
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,460
Uncle.

266
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,940
There are so many mosquitoes here.

267
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,220
What were you guys thinking back then,

268
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,580
coming here to practice speaking?

269
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,820
You two had too much free time.

270
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,580
I'm going to recite it now, listen.

271
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,220
I figure life is a gift.

272
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,700
I don't intend on wasting it.

273
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,820
You never know

274
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,740
what hand you're gonna get dealt next.

275
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,700
You learn to take life

276
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,580
and make every day meaningful.

277
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,059
Make every day meaningful.

278
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,700
Gao Haitian

279
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,179
I've decided to stay in Shenzhen.

280
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,059
Why?

281
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,059
Didn't you always say going abroad

282
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,620
was your lifelong dream?

283
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,340
I think it's better to stay here.

284
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,820
Macau, China will return at the end of the year.

285
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,100
Our university and the University of Macau

286
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,220
have started a joint program.

287
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,820
My advisor also suggested I stay.

288
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,620
Look at this.

289
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,820
See?

290
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,259
I've already been accepted into

291
00:13:58,259 --> 00:13:59,419
Shenzhen University's graduate school.

292
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,820
But didn't you say

293
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,220
you were going to apply to NYU?

294
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,700
What's wrong?

295
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,419
Nothing. Congratulations.

296
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,340
I also have some news

297
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,340
I was going to share with you.

298
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,059
When did you apply?

299
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:37,740
Why didn't you tell me?

300
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,100
I wasn't sure I'd get in.

301
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,940
I thought I'd tell you

302
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,980
after the results came out.

303
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,700
What are you thinking?

304
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,779
You're not really going to stay

305
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,659
for her, are you?

306
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,899
Do you know how competitive

307
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:58,779
this program is?

308
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,179
Everyone's fighting for a spot.

309
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,220
And you want to give it up now?

310
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
I never said I'd give up.

311
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,220
I can see right through you.

312
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:04,580
I know what you're thinking.

313
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,419
You said it yourself.

314
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,220
You're the first college student

315
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,419
from your village in ten years.

316
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,980
Your parents are counting on you

317
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,220
to bring honor to the family.

318
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,740
If I just leave like this,

319
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:19,419
what about Xueqing?

320
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
What can you even promise her?

321
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,580
Besides,

322
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,179
have you two

323
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,700
even officially gotten together?

324
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,220
You didn't even have the guts to confess.

325
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,820
Xueqing doesn't need you to worry.

326
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,460
She has her own life

327
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,179
and future.

328
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:33,620
Haitian.

329
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,059
Let me ask you.

330
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,860
Why did we come to Shenzhen?

331
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,820
Why did we come to night school?

332
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
Wasn't it to challenge ourselves,

333
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
to improve,

334
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,580
to achieve our dreams,

335
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,100
to make something of ourselves?

336
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,460
Even just a little bit.

337
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,820
Putting all that aside,

338
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,620
who was it that told you

339
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,539
the world outside is vast?

340
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,860
Who told you to go out and see it,

341
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,700
to explore it

342
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,820
while you're still young?

343
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,299
A tangible future you can grasp,

344
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,700
or a maybe-love that might not be?

345
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,620
Which one do you choose?

346
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,580
You decide.

347
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,220
Do you know that Macau

348
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,460
is not my real name?

349
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:35,259
I've been away from you too long, Mother.

350
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,740
But they only took my body,

351
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,220
you still keep my soul within.

352
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,340
Twenty-five years.

353
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,940
Macau's return

354
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,100
was twenty-five years ago.

355
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,820
Uncle.

356
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,179
It's 2024 now.

357
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,460
I went to all this trouble,

358
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,059
how come you

359
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,820
still haven't remembered anything?

360
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,500
I've been away from you too long, Mother.

361
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,460
But they only took my body,

362
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,460
When are you leaving?

363
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
The day after tomorrow.

364
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,579
I have a gift for you.

365
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,579
Make every day meaningful.

366
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,099
Meaningful.

367
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,420
Thank you, Xueqing.

368
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,900
Okay, get ready, get ready.

369
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,700
Here we go, three, two, one.

370
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,819
Smile!

371
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,660
Uncle?

372
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,259
You remembered?

373
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,299
I know you wanted to see my mom,

374
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
but she's away on a research trip

375
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,740
in the northwest right now.

376
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,259
So she sent me instead,

377
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,339
to see if I could help.

378
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,099
Your mother...

379
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,539
is she well?

380
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,619
Uncle.

381
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Look at this.

382
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:23,420
This...

383
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,619
This is my old notebook.

384
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,900
My dreams.

385
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,980
Look.

386
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,460
Here.

387
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,420
This line.

388
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,619
Your mother wrote it for me.

389
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,460
"May your dreams come true."

390
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,900
This notebook...

391
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,420
My mom kept it for over twenty years.

392
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,259
And about your story,

393
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,180
she recently told me

394
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,619
another version.

395
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,660
Want to hear it?

396
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,500
Of course.

397
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,740
In 1999,

398
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,819
there was a girl

399
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,819
who worked as a teaching assistant

400
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,380
at Xinghui Night School.

401
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,500
In her class,

402
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:05,579
she met a boy

403
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,420
she really liked.

404
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,420
They helped each other

405
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,940
and spent

406
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,500
a wonderful time together.

407
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,099
Haitian.

408
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,299
Whenever I stand by your side,

409
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,099
the world grows quiet.

410
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,180
But by a twist of fate,

411
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,140
the girl never imagined

412
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,420
the boy would work so hard

413
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,500
to apply to the foreign university

414
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,619
she wanted to attend.

415
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,740
And what the boy never expected

416
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,980
was that the girl, for his sake,

417
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,579
chose to stay in Shenzhen.

418
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,259
And it was here

419
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:45,420
that she began

420
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,180
her own career and dreams.

421
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,259
By the way

422
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:56,420
She also told me

423
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,140
If you really regain your memory

424
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,940
She asked me to pass on a message for her.

425
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,259
What does she want to say?

426
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:02,740
She said

427
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,619
She kept every promise she made to you.

428
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,380
Every single day all these years

429
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,579
she has lived meaningfully.

430
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:11,779
She hopes you have too.

431
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,579
Make every day meaningful.

432
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,859
Make every day meaningful.

433
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,380
Make every day meaningful.

434
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:38,819
Haitian

435
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,460
Our story

436
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:42,700
stopped on its most beautiful page.

437
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,619
May your journey ahead be filled with sunshine.

438
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,859
Go chase your dreams.

439
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:48,740
I look forward to meeting you again.

440
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,059
Xueqing

441
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,420
Do you believe

442
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:13,700
that many years from now

443
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,940
we'll meet again right here?
