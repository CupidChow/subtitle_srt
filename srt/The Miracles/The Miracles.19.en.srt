1
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,799
A Day in the Life of Shenzhen

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,920
These nineteen

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,039
bronze statues

4
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,359
were created based on

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
November 29th, 1999.

6
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,719
They depict the

7
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,119
ordinary people living

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,079
in the streets and alleys

9
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,439
of Shenzhen.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
Among them are

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,159
retirees,

12
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,239
cleaners,

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,120
students, designers,

14
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,560
and an honest

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,000
job seeker from out of town.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,000
We believe

17
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,359
that a city's public art

18
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,159
should feature its citizens as the protagonists,

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,319
truly letting them

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,159
become the masters of Shenzhen.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,200
Why are you uncovering my statue?

22
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,879
Uncover your own!

23
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,359
Look at them over there.

24
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,959
Hurry up and cover it back!

25
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,760
Mine can't see the light.

26
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,159
No, I need to consecrate it myself.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,560
You...

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,239
You're driving me crazy.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Sir.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,560
Sir, look over here.

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,400
Look here, here.

32
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,319
Friend,

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,919
you should park your car

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
where it's supposed to be parked.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,919
You're a traffic warden, right?

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,520
No.

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,400
Are you a

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,159
bike-sharing attendant?

39
00:02:59,199 --> 00:02:59,639
No.

40
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,599
You are...

41
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,479
the master of this city.

42
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,439
I think you're a mental patient.

43
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,639
"Master," my foot.

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
I shouldn't have even asked.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,479
Rude.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,319
Someone like you

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,759
will never get a statue.

48
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,919
Old Li!

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Old Zhou!

50
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,919
Is it your birthday today?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,639
Yes, yes, yes.

52
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,639
What a coincidence!

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
It's your birthday too?

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,159
My son's birthday is today.

55
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,039
Son,

56
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,919
this is your Uncle Li.

57
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,439
Happy birthday, Uncle Li.

58
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,080
Happy birthday.

59
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,919
I heard before

60
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,240
that every year on your birthday,

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,599
you come here to celebrate with the statues.

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,080
Yes.

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Today I finally saw it for myself.

64
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,960
You can't park here.

65
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,800
Really?

66
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,120
Bye, bye.

67
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,879
Turn signal.

68
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,639
Okay.

69
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,000
Sister Mei.

70
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,280
Doctor Zhang.

71
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,360
Old Zhou.

72
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,120
You've been unluckier than me since the day we were built.

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,439
Look at me.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,719
Dashing and handsome,

75
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,280
not a hint of a belly.

76
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,759
Where's my head?

77
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,199
Bro, it's pouring rain.

78
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,319
Just don't drive.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,759
Stop following.

80
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,480
Bro, bro!

81
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,480
Are you a cop?

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,000
No.

83
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,000
Then why are you doing this?

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,680
Give me the head.

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,879
What head?

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,959
The sculpture's head.

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,439
That head's not with me.

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,240
What's in your bag?

89
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,600
There's nothing in my bag.

90
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,240
Look, I'll give you the hand.

91
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Let me go, okay?

92
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,879
Give me the head.

93
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,800
Or I'll call the police.

94
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,560
I said I only have the hand,

95
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,120
not the head.

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,519
I'll say it again, give me the head.

97
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,319
Or I'll call the police.

98
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,480
I said I only have the hand,

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360
not the head.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,680
Help!

101
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:48,839
Help!

102
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,560
Help!

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,680
Help!

104
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,360
Help!

105
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,240
Help!

106
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,560
Help!

107
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,439
I give up.

108
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
Mister, here's your arm back.

109
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,079
The head's not with me.

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,560
We're even now, right?

111
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,879
Witness.

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,360
Stolen goods.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Go ask the police.

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,360
See if we can call it even.

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,680
Mister, what are you doing?

116
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,319
What are you doing?

117
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,040
Calling the police.

118
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,439
No.

119
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,680
Do you have any conscience?

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
I just saved your life!

121
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,959
That was attempted murder.

122
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,199
Was it you who threw the arm in?

123
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,639
You just had to play the hero today.

124
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,000
Really?

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,759
That was self-defense.

126
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
This bronze statue is mine.

127
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,360
You sculpted that statue?

128
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,319
That statue is a sculpture of me.

129
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,120
You're a celebrity?

130
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,959
Master of the City.

131
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,360
You're insane.

132
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,319
Give me your phone.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,560
What are you doing?

134
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,000
Calling the police.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
My phone's broken. It got wet.

136
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,399
M-Mister.

137
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:45,959
Let's talk this over.

138
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,519
What will it take for you not to call the police?

139
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,360
Give me the head.

140
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,720
Why can't I get through to you?

141
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,000
I...

142
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,439
Here.

143
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on, look.

144
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,839
Which one in here looks like your head?

145
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,920
Take it, okay?

146
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,399
You were the only one at the scene.

147
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,439
If not you, then who?

148
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,279
Last time I said I came to Shenzhen to rob a bank...

149
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,519
That was a joke.

150
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,319
Don't worry, I've been doing fine lately.

151
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm at the new place.

152
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,319
The renovation is nice.

153
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,439
The layout is good too.

154
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,079
It's well-ventilated, north-south, east-west.

155
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,759
Mom, just don't worry about it.

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,560
It's good anyway.

157
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,920
Once that project payment comes through...

158
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,360
We'll have all the money we need.

159
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,439
So...

160
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,000
You weren't there to steal a statue.

161
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,000
You were there to rob a bank.

162
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,759
What did you just hear? That's all wrong!

163
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,759
(Project Manager Li)

164
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,439
Sorry.

165
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,879
The number you have dialed is...

166
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,360
Darn it.

167
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,720
Who wants to hear about mosquito repellent?

168
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,959
Can you have a little patience?

169
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,319
Can you get to the point?

170
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,199
Settled now?

171
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,319
Who is it?

172
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,519
Didn't we agree?

173
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,960
Copper is currently...

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Seventy-nine per kilo.

175
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,879
No bargaining.

176
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:40,960
Bro.

177
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,759
You have it tough, but so do I.

178
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,279
I'm taking the risk here.

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,200
If you don't want it...

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll sell it to someone else.

181
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,919
Copper is that valuable?

182
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,440
Sister Mei.

183
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,840
Doctor Zhang.

184
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,080
So, what did that person look like?

185
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,399
I didn't get a good look.

186
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,519
Then how can I believe you?

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,919
There are security cameras in the park.

188
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,240
Call the police.

189
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,759
Don't you have any other words?

190
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,320
Give me the head.

191
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,080
I don't have the head.

192
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Then I'm calling the police.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,039
What will it take for you not to call the police?

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,879
Give me the head.

195
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't have it, I don't have the head!

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,039
Then I'm calling, calling the police!

197
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,480
This...

198
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
If this goes on, we'll really get nowhere.

199
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,639
Mister.

200
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,399
I'm begging you.

201
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,799
I... I really can't have the police involved.

202
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,480
My whole family is counting on me now.

203
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
If something happens to me, it's all over.

204
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,799
Then what do you suggest we do?

205
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,720
I'll help you look for it.

206
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,200
Let's search for it together, okay?

207
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,759
Boss.

208
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,200
Excuse me, did you receive...

209
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,600
...a bronze head here tonight?

210
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,159
Looks like this.

211
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,919
No.

212
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,600
No.

213
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,759
No.

214
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,399
Well, if...

215
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,559
If... if someone...

216
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,519
Comes...

217
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,159
I haven't been in Shenzhen long enough.

218
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,799
Maybe you should say it.

219
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,320
If someone comes to sell a bronze head...

220
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,080
Just call this number.

221
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,759
Contact us.

222
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,279
Thanks.

223
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,639
Okay, okay.

224
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Everyone in Shenzhen speaks Mandarin.

225
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,399
Really?

226
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,200
Call this number.

227
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,000
Got it, got it.

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,600
I can understand.

229
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,519
How does this tell you where it is?

230
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,120
Wouldn't you still have to

231
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,000
search door to door?

232
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,639
Do you have any other ideas?

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,039
Don't even mention calling the police.

234
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,039
Even if the police come,

235
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,159
they'd search door to door too.

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,000
So what do we do?

237
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,679
First, stop acting like a

238
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,559
headless chicken.

239
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,559
Don't even mention "headless."

240
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,039
Here's what you do.

241
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:56,679
Like this.

242
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,679
Next place.

243
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,639
Let's go.

244
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,000
Highest point.

245
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,600
Boss.

246
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,759
Leave the stuff outside for now.

247
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,519
I'll weigh it in a bit.

248
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,679
We're not here to sell anything.

249
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,879
We're here to look for something.

250
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,480
Looking for what?

251
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,120
Looking for a head.

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What's with your attitude?

253
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,000
No, no, boss.

254
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:13,919
We're here to

255
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,279
find a bronze statue's head.

256
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:17,879
Police.

257
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:19,639
Here's the thing.

258
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,639
Actually, we...

259
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,279
Do you know why we're looking for you?

260
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,679
Th-this... I don't know.

261
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,480
Tonight at the sculpture park,

262
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,679
a bronze statue lost its head.

263
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,919
Have you seen it?

264
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,039
I...

265
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,240
Good thing I was suspicious.

266
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,399
Luckily, I didn't take it.

267
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,600
Exactly.

268
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,039
I didn't take it.

269
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,159
Does this have anything to do with me?

270
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,080
No, no.

271
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,039
Then, you... you keep talking.

272
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,080
Yes, yes, keep talking.

273
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,840
It was tonight.

274
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,759
A young guy

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,159
came pulling about half a cartload of copper.

276
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,679
I looked and I said,

277
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,879
there's a head in there.

278
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,120
Really ugly.

279
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
No idea where he dug it up.

280
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,279
Such an ugly head.

281
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,840
Then I asked the kid,

282
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
"You look a bit familiar."

283
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,759
"Not familiar."

284
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,240
Go on.

285
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,399
Then he mumbled to me,

286
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,120
"It's scrap."

287
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,679
I had my doubts.

288
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,559
So I told him, "Sixteen at most."

289
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,519
And I sent him on his way.

290
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,159
This has nothing to do with me, right?

291
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,080
What did the guy look like?

292
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,879
The guy looked... just

293
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,399
like... like that.

294
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,679
"Like that" is what exactly?

295
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,039
Just an ordinary person.

296
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,279
I can't describe it, just...

297
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,320
Give us a description!

298
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,399
Alright.

299
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,399
I'll have my son

300
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,240
draw it for you.

301
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,639
Okay?

302
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,519
My son is a painting prodigy.

303
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,519
Especially good at portraits.

304
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,480
Come here.

305
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,399
So what should I draw?

306
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
I'll describe, you draw.

307
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,279
Come on, come on. Good.

308
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,440
This kid is a true natural genius.

309
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:38,919
Abstract school.

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
Kid, what you drew is...

311
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,240
a band-aid with facial features?

312
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,840
You've practiced for so long,

313
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,639
and this is what you draw?

314
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,240
I think you're asking for a spanking, I really do.

315
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,000
Hey, hey, hey.

316
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,799
Don't take it out on the kid.

317
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,159
Boss.

318
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,159
Didn't you just say

319
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,519
that guy came with a cart

320
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,320
pulling the copper?

321
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,679
What did the cart look like?

322
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,279
Like this.

323
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,559
Don't have your son draw it.

324
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,600
No need.

325
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,759
This time, I'll draw it myself.

326
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,879
It's just that my family was poor back then,

327
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,519
otherwise I would've gone to CAFA.

328
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,159
How is it?

329
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,480
Not good at all.

330
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,000
What does this "Si Zi Da Fei Dang"

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,960
mean?

332
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,279
That's exactly what's written on it.

333
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,639
How is that possible? What is this...

334
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,559
I know. Follow me.

335
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,399
Boss.

336
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,759
See if you want to add any more dishes?

337
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,840
No, that's all, thanks.

338
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,360
We're good.
