1
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,820
It's fine if you want to make a name for yourself,

2
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,939
but you can't stake the entire Third Bureau on it.

3
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,219
It's not just that we're unsure.

4
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,179
The workers out there

5
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,140
are unsure too.

6
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,060
If I were just concerned about political achievements

7
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,060
or my career path,

8
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:08,780
I wouldn't need to gamble like this.

9
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,939
I know they're unsure.

10
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,060
But do you remember

11
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,540
why they came here in the first place?

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,459
They heard

13
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,299
our Third Bureau was pushing new technology,

14
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:18,620
aiming to set a national record.

15
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,180
Now other construction teams

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,140
are laughing at them.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,780
Do you think they're just fine with that?

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,780
Aren't they frustrated?

19
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,180
I'm not afraid of working with the Third Bureau,

20
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,620
but failing every single attempt...

21
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,099
Who wouldn't have doubts?

22
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,379
Using slipform for high-rises

23
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,500
is a first for the whole country.

24
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,980
Who gets it right on the first try?

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,260
If we quit now,

26
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,859
the first three attempts were for nothing.

27
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,739
Remember when we went abroad

28
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,739
to study the German research?

29
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,540
Concrete from pouring to forming,

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,459
done in one seamless process.

31
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,140
That is

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,579
truly modern construction.

33
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:54,819
In our country,

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,140
if Shenzhen doesn't try it,

35
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,019
if our Third Bureau doesn't try it,

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,019
then who will?

37
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,180
On our first day in Shenzhen,

38
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,300
those words written above us,

39
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,860
do you remember them?

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,020
If we back down now,

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,620
are we worthy of those five words?

42
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,740
Do you really think I don't want to?

43
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,180
The problem is, will the leadership

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,939
still stand with us on this?

45
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:28,979
What's all the arguing about?

46
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,219
Director Liu! Director Liu!

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,659
Chief Fu! Chief Fu!

48
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,900
We've failed three times,

49
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,939
yet you all still have the energy

50
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:38,939
to waste time squabbling.

51
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:40,900
Sit down.

52
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,580
Sit, sit, sit.

53
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,539
Keep eating.

54
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,620
I just got back from a meeting at the city.

55
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,460
This slipform project...

56
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,979
We keep going.

57
00:02:59,139 --> 00:02:59,780
Good!

58
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,580
Good! Good! Good!

59
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,379
Good! Good! Good!

60
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,539
Director,

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,180
I just have one question.

62
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,740
If the slipform fails a fourth time,

63
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:11,939
what do we do?

64
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,740
As the chief technical officer,

65
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,699
it's more fitting for me to say this.

66
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,139
During this period,

67
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,939
we've been running experiments

68
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:24,860
and collecting data.

69
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,500
Through these three

70
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,300
very real failures,

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,419
this time we've basically

72
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,979
identified the core problem.

73
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,060
For this fourth attempt,

74
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,699
this old man

75
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
pledges to the organization:

76
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,259
If we fail again,

77
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,979
I'll accept any punishment.

78
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,020
Good!

79
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,099
I'll make this military pledge too.

80
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,099
If something goes wrong, we're punished together.

81
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,099
Good!

82
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:50,860
It's no big deal!

83
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,139
If we bear it, we bear it together.

84
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,020
Good!

85
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,180
Keep going! If we only pick easy jobs,

86
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,740
what will we have to boast about when we're old?

87
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Look at you.

88
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,740
We'll all boast with you then.

89
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,099
Let's do it! Do it! Do it!

90
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,539
Comrades!

91
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,539
Today

92
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,180
is our fourth Pledge Rally.

93
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
We persevere

94
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,180
because we have faith.

95
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,620
We are not just building a tower.

96
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,420
We are creating architectural history.

97
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,899
What others dare not imagine,

98
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,740
we dare.

99
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,579
What others dare not do,

100
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,019
we also dare.

101
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:26,620
Do it! Do it! Do it!

102
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,699
Do it! Do it! Do it!

103
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,660
Do it! Do it! Do it!

104
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:48,620
Slow down! Slow down!

105
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,819
Watch your step!

106
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:56,420
Okay!

107
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,100
Come on.

108
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:00,899
Three... two...

109
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,339
It's still better to be a guy.

110
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,459
We women can't strip even if we're dying of heat.

111
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,579
Save your breath and save some energy.

112
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,860
There's still so much to move.

113
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:12,620
Come on.

114
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,500
One, two, three, lift!

115
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:17,779
What's wrong?

116
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,019
Nothing. Let's go.

117
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,819
In all my years as a worker,

118
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,699
I've never seen

119
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,139
a construction site this busy.

120
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,259
Aren't we trying to achieve

121
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,500
China's top speed?

122
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,180
If we pull it off, we win.

123
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,379
Here.

124
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,420
Can you look at my shoulder?

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,060
What's wrong?

126
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,459
Just take a look.

127
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:38,379
It's raw.

128
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,740
Raw.

129
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,579
That's so bad.

130
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,779
Here, sit down. I'll put some ointment on it.

131
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:48,620
I won't. It hurts.

132
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
In this heat,

133
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
if it gets infected, it'll be trouble.

134
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,819
The pain's making me regret coming.

135
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,100
Our old worksite

136
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,180
wasn't this busy.

137
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:01,939
Why did we run off to Shenzhen

138
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,180
to suffer like this?

139
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:16,899
You still have that?

140
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,939
Here's an idea.

141
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,420
Listen to me.

142
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:24,699
Take this.

143
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:26,860
Just play any tune.

144
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,019
Distract yourself a bit.

145
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,579
What kind of solution is this?

146
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:31,819
Just try it.

147
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,379
Play that song we heard

148
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:34,379
outside the shop last time.

149
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,100
That one.

150
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,019
Yeah, yeah, that one.

151
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,180
Sister Su, I don't get it.

152
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:42,620
We're steel fixers.

153
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,540
What's the point of learning this thing?

154
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,779
No matter how tough or tiring it gets,

155
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,060
we still have to make our lives

156
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
meaningful.

157
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,259
But this is just a cardboard keyboard.

158
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Who can hear it?

159
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
He can hear it.

160
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,459
Does it sound good?

161
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:22,379
It sounds good.

162
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,139
You just asked me

163
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:30,500
why we

164
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,579
had to come all the way to Shenzhen.

165
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,059
Isn't it to give it our all?

166
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,379
I've also been gathering my strength,

167
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
wanting to give it a shot,

168
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:39,419
to see if we can

169
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,580
run towards a better life.

170
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,139
Even if we hadn't come,

171
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:44,700
I'd still hope

172
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,820
that our future children

173
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:47,620
won't have to use

174
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,899
hands caked in mud

175
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
to play the piano.

176
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,259
Each generation should be better than the last.

177
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,899
It's just that it hurts too much.

178
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:57,460
Just complaining a bit.

179
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,019
Alright then.

180
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,899
I'll ask the site for two days off.

181
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,019
You rest up properly.

182
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:02,779
No, that won't do.

183
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,460
I can't hold everyone back.

184
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,019
This side's hurt, this side's fine.

185
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,899
I can just add a couple more towels for padding.

186
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,460
Brothers, put your backs into it!

187
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:30,340
Pick up the pace!

188
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,700
Can't let those guys laugh at us.

189
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,059
Brother Lu.

190
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,419
Can you tell your wife

191
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:36,460
and the others to slow down?

192
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,460
My hands are practically on fire here.

193
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,980
No way.

194
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,820
We finally got the slipform working.

195
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,580
We have to make up for

196
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,539
all the time we lost before.

197
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,580
We have to catch up.

198
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,220
We finished this floor

199
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
in just seven days.

200
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,100
Isn't that fast enough?

201
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:51,340
Brothers!

202
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,059
It's piecework pay, more work more pay.

203
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,419
Every piece you handle is money.

204
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,419
Keep at it!

205
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,179
I heard it's one floor in five days in Hong Kong, China,

206
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,980
four days in the US.

207
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,460
Our seven days per floor

208
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,220
isn't bad either.

209
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,860
Right?

210
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,860
Chief Engineer Fu said

211
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,220
this slipform fears slowness, not speed.

212
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,100
The formwork will stick if it stops too long.

213
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,179
Let's give it our all,

214
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,419
push for one floor in three days,

215
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,700
and break a record!

216
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
Don't let the team down!

217
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,059
One floor in three days!

218
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,179
Set a record!

219
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,179
Alright! Keep at it! Go!

220
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,059
Finally, almost at the topping-out.

221
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:00,700
So sweet.

222
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,340
You promised me, remember?

223
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:11,659
Promised you what?

224
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,779
Sister Su! Sister Su!

225
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:51,179
What's wrong?

226
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,460
You need to go check!

227
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,419
They say the wall on the seventh floor...

228
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:56,980
What about the wall?

229
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,220
They say it's deformed.

230
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,179
No,

231
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,539
the rebar is deformed.

232
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,539
But we did the anchorage properly.

233
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,659
I don't know either.

234
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,899
Let's go check quickly!

235
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:05,659
Go, go, go!

236
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,259
This building is about to be topped out.

237
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,460
We can't have this kind of problem.

238
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,100
I'll go get the Supervisor.

239
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,740
You go up first.

240
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
You're something else.

241
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,940
The building is about to be topped out.

242
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,179
You haven't forgotten what you promised me, right?

243
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,460
Marry me.

244
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:03,940
Who taught you this?

245
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,580
Get up, quick.

246
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,220
Wait a second.

247
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,580
This is this year's wages

248
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,220
and subsidies.

249
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,580
Apart from what was sent home,

250
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,460
it's all here.

251
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,820
Once the topping-out bonus comes in,

252
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:15,820
we'll pool it together.

253
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,740
We can definitely buy a real piano.

254
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,980
And then,

255
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,100
we'll come back to the revolving restaurant here

256
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,899
and have a proper meal.

257
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,419
Right now,

258
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,220
standing on the tallest building in all of China,

259
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:42,059
I swear

260
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,220
I will marry you, Su Mingshu.

261
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,460
Be my wife.

262
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,940
In the future, if there's harsh sun,

263
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,899
I'll shield you from it.

264
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,899
If there's wind and rain, I'll shelter you.

265
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:53,500
I won't let you suffer any wrongs.

266
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:55,379
I know you're someone

267
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,179
who cries easily and laughs easily.

268
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
I'll make you laugh more

269
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,179
and cry less.

270
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,460
For this lifetime,

271
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,299
I'm sticking with you.

272
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
Brother Lu! Sister Su!

273
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,820
A harmonious union for a hundred years!

274
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:31,740
May you have a precious child soon!

275
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,899
May you grow old together!

276
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,379
Wishing you prosperity!

277
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,259
Many children, much happiness!

278
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,700
This is the under-construction

279
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,980
Shenzhen International Trade Centre Building.

280
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,620
This morning,

281
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,539
with the final cubic meter of concrete

282
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
poured and completed,

283
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,779
this 160-meter-tall

284
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,820
behemoth

285
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,419
now stands on the shore of the South China Sea.

286
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,419
This 50-story

287
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:29,659
super high-rise building

288
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:32,059
was independently constructed by the China Construction Third Engineering Bureau

289
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,139
and built independently.

290
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,179
It employed, for the first time, the integrated synchronous slipform construction technology

291
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:37,299
for both the inner and outer tubes.

292
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,419
Ultimately achieving the astonishing speed

293
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:40,419
of one floor in three days,

294
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,340
it vividly illustrates the principle that

295
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,940
time is money,

296
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,220
efficiency is life.

297
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,940
It has been successfully topped out.
