1
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,560
Editor-in-Chief

2
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,039
Coffee's ready.

3
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,840
The First Reunion

4
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,200
Editor-in-Chief

5
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,000
What do you think?

6
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,560
What do you think?

7
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,120
I think it's well written.

8
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:15,799
Okay?

9
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,719
That's not good.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,319
You've been a book editor

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,599
for so many years.

12
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,480
Can't you be a bit more confident?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,799
It's well written.

14
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,599
Well written, my...

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,640
It's not good.

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,480
Du Xiaoxi

17
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,519
Why did we come to Shenzhen?

18
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,040
For our dreams?

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
No.

20
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,239
Why are we in publishing?

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,640
For art?

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,760
No.

23
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,959
Why do we publish

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,879
books like this?

25
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,159
To make money.

26
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,640
For dreams and art.

27
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,920
Editor-in-Chief, what do you want?

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
Just tell me directly.

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,560
I...

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,280
I'm really a bit

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,560
lost with your train of thought.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,480
Sit.

33
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,680
Literature is in decline.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,959
No one wants to read books anymore.

35
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,719
They only want to read

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
"Get rich in three days"

37
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,800
"Cure mental burnout in five days"

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,599
"Seven days to

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,479
save you from midlife crisis."

40
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,879
If I don't publish this trash,

41
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,360
how can I support those

42
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,719
that aren't trash?

43
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,840
Editor-in-Chief...

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
I understand what you mean.

45
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,479
You're saying

46
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,159
this book will be published later?

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,840
No.

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,960
It won't sell.

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,199
How could that be?

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,039
This Teacher Suan

51
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,319
has published two books before,

52
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,479
and they were well-received.

53
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,599
Times have changed.

54
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,680
She never goes out.

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,479
Unwilling to promote herself.

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,080
No online traffic.

57
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,400
She's a writer,

58
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,680
not an internet celebrity.

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,680
No traffic, no readers.

60
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,800
I think

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,759
the concept of this book

62
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,719
is very interesting.

63
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,800
It's about

64
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,840
how at certain points

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,120
in the world,

66
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,759
due to changes in gravitational fields,

67
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,319
causing differences in the flow of time

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,319
and spacetime curvature,

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
people from two different times

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,080
can communicate across time.

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
That's fascinating!

72
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,719
The male and female leads in this book,

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,560
these two people...

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
Xiaoxi, Xiaoxi!

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,639
This "Suan Tang" dumpling...

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,639
Editor-in-Chief?

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,120
It's just Suan Tang.

78
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,039
Right, no dumplings.

79
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,560
This Suan Tang,

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
is he a relative of yours?

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,039
No.

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Then why are you pushing so hard

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
to recommend it?

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
If you have the energy

85
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,159
and the time,

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,919
learn a thing or two from Pipi.

87
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,719
Learn to use AI like him,

88
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,439
or learn to flatter like him?

89
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,520
What?

90
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,120
What?

91
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,479
Going to the restroom.

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
There's paper in the restroom.

93
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,840
So funny.

94
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,639
Xiaoxi.

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,960
You know this book

96
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,159
means a lot to me.

97
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,719
Please help me think of a way.

98
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
A way...

99
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,639
Well, there might be one.

100
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,319
Right?

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,879
Great! Any way will do.

102
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,639
Tell me.

103
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,839
Are you willing to be an internet celebrity?

104
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,240
Right, you have to do live sales,

105
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,519
or post suggestive content?

106
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,399
I'm not really cut out for that suggestive stuff.

107
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,040
Sis, sis!

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,560
Sis!

109
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
Don't get me wrong.

110
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,920
What I mean is,

111
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,560
you could work with us

112
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,800
to build an online persona

113
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,240
as a talented woman.

114
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,680
Make up some tragic, beautiful stories.

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,839
Talk about the pen name "Suan Tang"

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
and the hardships behind it, and...

117
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,759
Or maybe you should find another job?

118
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,040
Who says literature is dead?

119
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,680
Who says no one reads?

120
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
Look at all these people!

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,360
One...

122
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,800
(Don't go to the hospital)

123
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,480
What is this?

124
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,160
This person...

125
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,279
One Hundred Years of Solitude

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,040
is also my favorite book.

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,240
You have many unique ideas.

128
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,040
Of course, the most imaginative one

129
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,519
is saying Shenzhen has snow.

130
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,839
Because since historical records began,

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,920
Shenzhen has never...

132
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,800
Boss?

133
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,040
I'd like another sticky note, please.

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,879
Thank you.

135
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,759
Page twenty-one.

136
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,720
Who is it?

137
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,920
So bored.

138
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,319
Stop hiding!

139
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,839
I see you.

140
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I'll catch you.

141
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,720
Wake up.

142
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,920
Wake up, wake up.

143
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,240
Why are you sleeping here?

144
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,240
The floor is so cold.

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,199
Get up.

146
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,120
Boss?

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
I fell asleep.

148
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah.

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,480
I was originally...

150
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
What are you doing?

151
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,879
Almost got it.

152
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,120
Lost track of it.

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,679
Twenty, twenty.

154
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,279
What on earth are you doing?

155
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,960
Boss.

156
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
Has anyone touched this copy of

157
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,399
*One Hundred Years of Solitude*?

158
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:01,679
Yes.

159
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,399
Who?

160
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,159
Isn't that you?

161
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,919
I'm obviously asking about

162
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,440
someone other than me.

163
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,360
Then no.

164
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,320
You're lying.

165
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,480
There's surveillance.

166
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,960
Right here.

167
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,279
There's no one.

168
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,960
Are you trying to say

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
your shop is haunted?

170
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,360
Don't scare me.

171
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,639
Who's scaring you?

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,039
How else do you explain

173
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,320
someone leaving me a note saying,

174
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
"Shenzhen is snowing."

175
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,279
When has Shenzhen ever

176
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,240
had snow?

177
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,559
Who says Shenzhen never had snow?

178
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,320
I remember it was

179
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,600
January of 2016.

180
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
It was even on the news.

181
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,919
2016?

182
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Let me search for it.

183
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,799
You still don't believe me?

184
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,679
Don't trick me.

185
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
January 24th.

186
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,879
Isn't that the day I started this job?

187
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,720
But you call *this* snow?

188
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,639
Where I'm from, we'd call it at most

189
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,480
graupel.

190
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,799
You're from the north.

191
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,679
You...

192
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:02,799
can't understand the feeling

193
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,720
we get from seeing snow.

194
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,200
That still doesn't make sense.

195
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,200
This note...

196
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,799
2016.

197
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
At certain coordinate points

198
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
in the world,

199
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,039
due to changes in gravitational fields,

200
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,559
the flow of time differs,

201
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,720
and spacetime bends,

202
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,279
enabling people from two different times

203
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,440
to communicate across time.

204
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,879
No way.

205
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,240
What year is it where you are?

206
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,360
What year is it where you are?

207
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,799
What kind of question is that?

208
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,320
Boss.

209
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
I've decided.

210
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm quitting.

211
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,840
To become a full-time writer.

212
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Don't try to keep me.

213
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,840
Who wants to keep you?

214
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,000
If you don't resign voluntarily,

215
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,440
I'll fire you directly.

216
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
You've been here for two years,

217
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,639
your performance is always last.

218
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,080
Then I won't resign.

219
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,639
You fire me.

220
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,840
That way,

221
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,559
do I get N+1 compensation?

222
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,600
Get out.

223
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,600
Bye-bye.

224
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,240
This is your workstation.

225
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Work hard with me.

226
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,320
I have high hopes for you.

227
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,399
Thank you, Teacher Wen.

228
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,600
I will definitely work hard.

229
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,720
Everyone.

230
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,519
This is our new colleague,

231
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,639
Du Xiaoxi.

232
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,480
Hello, everyone.

233
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Alright, back to work.

234
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,399
Hello.

235
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,039
Hi there.

236
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,480
What do you mean, be a writer?

237
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,759
Come back home properly

238
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,480
and be a civil servant for me.

239
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,480
Mom.

240
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,080
I'm an adult now.

241
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,240
Let me make my own decisions.

242
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,120
Is that so hard?

243
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,000
Nan.

244
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,240
Don't argue with me.

245
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:43,840
Gang.

246
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,080
Tomorrow, I'll have your sister

247
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
go to Shenzhen to bring you back.

248
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,519
I'm not coming back.

249
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
It's been days since I hit you.

250
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,960
If you don't come back, I'm afraid you'll starve.

251
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,320
Can a hobby put food on the table?

252
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,799
Can you eat properly or not?

253
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,879
Hurry up.

254
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
If you don't eat it, I'll feed it to the dog.

255
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,440
Mom.

256
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,759
Give me a little more time, okay?

257
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,320
"The time left for Team China

258
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,960
is running out."

259
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,840
Mom, believe me.

260
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,759
I will definitely write

261
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,360
a masterpiece known to every household.

262
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,399
Believe you?

263
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
Unless it snows in Shenzhen.

264
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,720
Lost again.

265
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,320
Let it snow.

266
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,720
Sorry, sorry.

267
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,960
It's snowing.

268
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,240
It's really snowing.

269
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Stop shushing.

270
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,600
Look quickly!

271
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
It's really snowing.

272
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,840
It's really snowing.

273
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,960
It's snowing! It's snowing!

274
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:11,480
Go take a look.

275
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,399
Great!

276
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,399
Aren't you from the northeast?

277
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,559
Why are you more excited about snow than I am?

278
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,480
2016.

279
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,480
Du Xiaoxi.

280
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,480
Book editor.

281
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,279
Female.

282
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,720
What a coincidence, me too.

283
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,960
You're a girl too?

284
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
I said I'm also a book editor.

285
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
But I quit.

286
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,240
My name is Chen Mo.

287
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
You can also call me the Great Literary Master.

288
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,159
Now I'm one hundred percent sure

289
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,240
you're a guy.

290
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,000
Your handwriting is pretty good.

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,600
Your handwriting...

292
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,679
needs practice.

293
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,360
So, where you are,

294
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,600
it's really 2016?

295
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,960
I, without hesitation,

296
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
believe you are in 2025.

297
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,440
Why don't you believe me?

298
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,720
If you put it that way,

299
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,279
in my world,

300
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,759
wouldn't you be an old man?

301
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,360
Big sister.

302
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,039
In 2025,

303
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,559
I'll only be thirty-five, okay?

304
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Calling a girl "big sister"

305
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,039
isn't polite, is it?

306
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,120
Then, little sister?

307
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,360
May I ask your age?

308
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,759
Asking a girl her age

309
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,639
is even less polite, right?

310
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,320
Alright, alright, I won't ask.

311
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,960
What's your zodiac sign?

312
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,559
Isn't that the same thing?

313
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I might as well tell you.

314
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,399
I'm thirty-one.

315
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,879
So that means,

316
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,440
right now you're the older sister,

317
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
but actually you're the younger one.

318
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,240
So from now on, I'll call you

319
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,240
"Sister."

320
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,039
Sister.

321
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
What's 2025

322
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,200
like now?

323
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,840
Are robots everywhere?

324
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,960
Your imagination is too rich.

325
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,200
Actually, 2025

326
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,120
isn't much different

327
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,000
from 2016.

328
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,559
Go on.

329
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,919
What else do you want to know?

330
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,360
Have I...

331
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,159
become famous?

332
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,360
Okay, okay.

333
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,080
Then I must have published at least two

334
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,000
bestsellers, right?

335
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
Okay, okay, okay.

336
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,359
Then I must have at least

337
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,720
published a book or two, right?

338
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:07,680
Let me check for you.

339
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,359
Okay.

340
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,240
What's your name?

341
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,119
Chen Mo.

342
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,240
Pen name?

343
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,839
Chen Mo.

344
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,559
Silent.

345
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,559
So sad.

346
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,519
Wanna cry.

347
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,000
This is really

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,359
a 2016 meme.

349
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,279
It's okay.

350
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,720
I believe there will be a miracle.

351
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,119
Just hang in there a bit longer.

352
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,680
What if it's right?

353
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,000
I believe it too.

354
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,480
Alright.

355
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,480
Get some rest early.

356
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,000
Good night.

357
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:50,559
Good night.

358
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,519
Sit down.

359
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,359
Sit down.

360
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,240
Hello, boss.

361
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,319
Boss, the usual, please.

362
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:46,880
You got it.

363
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,880
Americano, with ice.

364
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,039
After all our tests,

365
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,079
we found we can only connect

366
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,359
at this spot on the bookshelf,

367
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,440
using this copy of *One Hundred Years of Solitude*.

368
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,240
That's the only way.

369
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,720
And we can only pass notes.

370
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,720
Last time you tried to send a shoe,

371
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,079
sticking it in the book failed.

372
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,279
How did you even get a shoe in a book?

373
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,599
Maybe

374
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,960
it can only transmit words.

375
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,680
Tell me,

376
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,599
how do we

377
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,400
explain this scientifically?

378
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,200
I read a novel once.

379
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,559
It said that

380
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,680
at certain coordinate points

381
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,200
in the world,

382
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,160
due to changes in the gravitational field,

383
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,880
the flow of time and space varies,

384
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
and spacetime bends.

385
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,759
This allows people from two different times

386
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,799
to communicate across time.

387
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,200
Meeting adjourned.

388
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,400
What novel?

389
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,839
This one...

390
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,279
Just hearing it,

391
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,559
sounds very scientific.

392
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,119
What's up with Xiaoxi lately?

393
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,119
She's been giggling for ages.

394
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,799
Acting all mysterious.

395
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,319
Who? Who is it? Who?

396
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,319
The boss is here!

397
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,279
I've discovered

398
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,200
we have a lot in common.

399
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,279
Really?

400
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,359
Of course.

401
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,119
Look.

402
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,480
We both like Song Dynasty poetry.

403
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,519
I like Su Shi.

404
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
You like Wang Anshi.

405
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,119
We both like French literature.

406
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,880
I like Stendhal.

407
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,519
You like Flaubert.

408
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,160
And British drama.

409
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,920
I like Wilde.

410
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,240
You like Shaw.

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,359
You also like watching soccer.

412
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,640
I like

413
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,000
Ronaldo, Messi.

414
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:57,599
Alright.

415
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
We have nothing in common.

416
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,839
I'm just teasing you.

417
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,640
At least

418
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,519
we both like *One Hundred Years of Solitude*.

419
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,000
Thanks to Gabriel García Márquez

420
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:11,920
for letting us meet.

421
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,440
Xiaoxi,

422
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,400
let's meet.
