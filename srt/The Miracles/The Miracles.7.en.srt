1
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,640
Everyone, everyone

2
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,840
Good morning

3
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,119
You all should have seen

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,840
the notice at the village entrance

5
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,159
Shengliqiang Group

6
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,079
plans to develop one of our villages here

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,280
and they just happened to pick us

8
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,640
That's good news!

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,879
What does it say on there?

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Compensation of 2.5 times the area

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,040
Elevator apartments!

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,239
Don't talk nonsense

13
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,560
and brag here

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,560
Elder Brother

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,879
Didn't I come here

16
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,319
to ask for everyone's opinion?

17
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:20,840
Come on, everyone

18
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,480
I, Pengzai

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,439
grew up in this village

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,760
Everyone knows

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,400
how bad our living conditions are

22
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,319
Damp, leaking water, faulty wiring

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,879
Your house is built all haphazardly

24
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,560
Isn't it?

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,400
But if you trick us

26
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,079
and then sell us out to others

27
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,239
What then?

28
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,239
There are laws, you know

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
You think they'd just act recklessly?

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,640
Great-Uncle here has a higher understanding

31
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,879
This world has laws

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,760
This Shengliqiang Group

33
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,159
has built many

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,599
very famous buildings

35
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,640
Did you all watch

36
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,879
Hong Kong, China TV the other day?

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,519
Those curved ones

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
the houses with green glass

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
You mean

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,879
the kind as pretty as Wan Chai?

41
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,000
That kind of house, right?

42
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,200
Great-Uncle, not Wan Chai

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
It's Repulse Bay

44
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,719
High-end residences!

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,640
In the future, we'll have

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,840
our own Repulse Bay right here

47
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,800
Right?

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,400
If everyone in our village

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,719
votes and

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,159
all agrees to it

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
They said they'll build a

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,199
very large community

53
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,879
and give one building

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,240
to our village

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,840
A whole building!

56
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,479
For us to share!

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,439
No way, Pengzai

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,639
You think one building will settle us?

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,919
To be honest

60
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,560
how much are you really trying

61
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,479
to sell us for?

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Elder Brother

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,800
It's not us selling to others

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,800
It's others who want us

65
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,840
and are giving us a good deal!

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,560
Come on, everyone

67
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,199
On behalf of our village

68
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm first gauging your opinions

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,639
to see if you agree with this proposal

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,439
I'm the first to oppose it

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,400
Linlin

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,840
You're back

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,319
Dad

74
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,639
I'm going inside to do my homework

75
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,479
What did you say to Uncle Tao?

76
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you, Uncle Tao

77
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,199
Bite the hand that feeds you

78
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,120
Thanks a lot

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,919
The way you're doing this

80
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,240
isn't a long-term solution either

81
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,360
Linlin asked me today

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,879
when Mom is coming back

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,360
So I could only tell her

84
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:26,879
I don't know

85
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
Why did you two really divorce?

86
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,599
You should have listened to everyone's advice back then

87
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,159
and found a local girl

88
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,439
People from outside probably just can't get used

89
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,360
to life here

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
Just you wait

91
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,919
When the time comes and this whole area

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,800
has tall buildings built up

93
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,919
and we move into apartments

94
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,719
she'll be too envious for words

95
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,240
Get me into your company too

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,879
How about it?

97
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,199
I've asked for you several times

98
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,159
HR says the minimum education

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
is junior high school graduation

100
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,520
Better to just keep driving my motorcycle taxi

101
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,639
A Tao

102
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,400
Do me a favor

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,879
Several households in the village now

104
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,680
aren't signing

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
The most troublesome one is

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,199
that cousin of yours

107
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,879
Help me out

108
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,079
Don't drag me into this

109
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
He hits people

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,079
I know

111
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,240
He hit you

112
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,120
Close enough

113
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,360
Pengzai.

114
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,720
They're not here, I can't decide.

115
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,199
That's okay.

116
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,160
When they come back tonight,

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
you can discuss it with them.

118
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,399
A Peng.

119
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,000
You don't work at the factory anymore?

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,879
You're doing this now?

121
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,360
I quit that a long time ago.

122
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,279
No future in it.

123
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,040
I was just thinking

124
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,920
you could introduce me

125
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,399
to get a job at your factory.

126
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,079
Auntie Lan.

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,639
This is the way out.

128
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,879
The petition.

129
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,680
A Peng.

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
When will we

131
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,519
get to live in a tall building?

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,560
Soon, very soon.

133
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,560
Director Jia.

134
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,240
It's a shame you weren't at my village yesterday.

135
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,399
What a pity.

136
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,240
I stood up there,

137
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,040
said my piece, and everyone agreed.

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,079
Almost the whole village voted yes.

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,040
Right now,

140
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,319
aside from a few signatures

141
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,199
that are still

142
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,720
Don't worry.

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,600
I'll overcome any difficulties.

144
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,560
Good.

145
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
Take a look at this reclamation map.

146
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,000
Do you know how hard it was

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
for me to secure this opportunity for your village?

148
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,759
How difficult?

149
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,600
I know, I know.

150
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,879
You know your village's situation best.

151
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,639
You understand it the most.

152
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,639
Roofs leak.

153
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,519
Power cuts in the middle of the night.

154
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,199
With such a great opportunity,

155
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,879
some people still refuse?

156
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,040
They're just asking for trouble.

157
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,959
Honestly.

158
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,319
Those folks won't listen no matter what I say.

159
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,519
You're speaking Cantonese to me again.

160
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,560
I can't understand.

161
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,279
What I mean is,

162
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,920
I'll get the signatures

163
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,240
from the whole village

164
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,079
to the group as fast as possible.

165
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,399
The doctor said

166
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,879
your foot doesn't need medicine.

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,920
You just need to leave this bungalow

168
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
and move into a building.

169
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
That'll fix everything.

170
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
Modern buildings

171
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,439
don't need you to climb stairs.

172
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,560
They have elevators.

173
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,399
You get on,

174
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,720
*beep, beep, beep*

175
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,720
What's wrong?

176
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Go to other houses first.

177
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,439
My cousin might not

178
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,560
be back anytime soon.

179
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,279
I'll deal with him when he gets back.

180
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,879
Uncle Pan.

181
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Once you sign this,

182
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,800
from then on,

183
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,120
you won't have to farm so hard.

184
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,120
Hard work?

185
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,439
What's the damn use of hard work?

186
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,879
Look at this field.

187
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,199
I don't know what happened,

188
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,879
but the alkalization gets worse every year.

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Yeah.

190
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,839
Nothing grows well anymore.

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,199
You've already realized it.

192
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,399
While someone wants it now,

193
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,279
give up the land,

194
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,279
and you can still get some money.

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,839
The whole village has signed.

196
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,920
You're the only one left.

197
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,319
Director Wang.

198
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,319
Good morning.

199
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,240
Wang...

200
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,240
Director Wang's office is here, right?

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,639
He's not in.

202
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,879
Um...

203
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,560
Sir.

204
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,240
Do you know when Director Wang will be back?

205
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,879
How should I know?

206
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,000
Come back another day.

207
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,120
Sir.

208
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,319
Director Wang, this map...

209
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,680
Our company

210
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,879
has the exact same one

211
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,759
posted in our office.

212
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
Seems Director Wang and I are fated to meet.

213
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,560
Sir.

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,439
I heard Director Wang

215
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,639
is a very warm-hearted person.

216
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,079
He's willing to help with anything you ask.

217
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,639
Right?

218
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,720
That depends on what it is.

219
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,399
Thank you, sir.

220
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,000
How about this, sir.

221
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,160
I'll

222
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,000
take the trash down

223
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,079
and throw it out for you on my way.

224
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,839
Don't touch it! Don't!

225
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,319
Really, no need.

226
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,240
You're too eager.

227
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,000
I worked hard to collect these.

228
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,519
They're all samples.

229
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,920
You should head back now.

230
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:54,839
Come another day.

231
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
If you want this,

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,439
next time I come,

233
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:56,759
Director Wang!

234
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,199
Oh, there you are.

235
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,439
There's a document here for you to sign.

236
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,000
Director Wang

237
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,480
Um...

238
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,000
I... I just wanted

239
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,040
to come over

240
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,439
and ask for your advice

241
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,279
regarding the eco-reclamation project.

242
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,440
Our group,

243
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,480
is quite well-known in Shenzhen.

244
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,120
We've done several benchmark projects.

245
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,200
Please wait for me.

246
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,360
Thank you.

247
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,559
Development requires land.

248
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,840
So we thought about eco-reclamation.

249
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,200
This is also

250
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,000
all benefit and no harm.

251
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,279
Who told you that?

252
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,879
That it's all benefit and no harm?

253
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,279
Our company's Director Jia said so.

254
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,679
She said that nowadays, those

255
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,080
wealthy groups abroad,

256
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
when they develop,

257
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,799
they all develop towards the coast.

258
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,519
Reclaiming land from the sea,

259
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,240
expanding Earth's resources.

260
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,919
You're quite earnest.

261
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
Just thinking

262
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,840
if it really gets built,

263
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
it would be a good thing

264
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,919
for us villagers too.

265
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
You're from this village, right?

266
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,919
Yes, a local.

267
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:18,960
That makes it easier then.

268
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,039
Come back another day.

269
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,799
I have another meeting.

270
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Nowadays, everywhere

271
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,159
welcomes investment.

272
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,879
And besides, we

273
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,120
have policy support.

274
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,720
It's just that Environmental Bureau,

275
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
dragging its feet.

276
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,000
Exactly!

277
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,399
He wants you to go again.

278
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,519
What does that mean?

279
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,840
I don't get it either.

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,919
When you went,

281
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,759
what did you bring?

282
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,759
Today, I...

283
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,559
I went empty-handed.

284
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,759
My client manager,

285
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,879
you're using thin air

286
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,519
to serve a client?

287
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,399
I was just scouting the situation!

288
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,000
I see, I see.

289
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,799
Dad.

290
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,799
The teacher asked us to draw

291
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,960
a different kind of beneficial insect.

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,440
I don't know what to draw.

293
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,559
Beneficial insects...

294
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,320
Well, dragonflies,

295
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,519
ladybugs,

296
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,320
praying mantises,

297
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,919
they all count.

298
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,879
Those are all too common.

299
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,559
I want something different.

300
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,720
Something different.

301
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,080
Draw a mangrove frog.

302
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,279
They've definitely never seen one.

303
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,519
Is a mangrove frog a beneficial insect?

304
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,399
Yes, it is.

305
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,159
But I've never even seen a mangrove frog.

306
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,879
How could you not have seen one?

307
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:35,919
There are tons of them

308
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,360
under that mangrove forest outside.

309
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,360
When you were little and trying to sleep,

310
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,399
you always said,

311
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,799
"It's so noisy!"

312
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,600
That was the mangrove frogs.

313
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,480
Mom said they were toads.

314
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,360
What does she know?

315
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,200
Then I'll draw a mangrove frog.

316
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,759
Take me to see one.

317
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,360
Oh my god.

318
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,639
Who's so heartless?

319
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,879
Dumping so much trash here.

320
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,519
In the past,

321
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,039
under these trees,

322
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,279
these roots and leaves were full of mangrove frogs.

323
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,639
Dad.

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,039
It's been over an hour.

325
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,000
We haven't seen a single frog.

326
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,879
Don't worry.

327
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,879
I know this place well.

328
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,919
Maybe...

329
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
maybe they're hibernating.

330
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,720
Sleeping.

331
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,080
It's summer now.

332
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,039
Is it?

333
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,519
They're definitely here.

334
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,600
Linlin, here's what we'll do.

335
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Let's close our eyes.

336
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,840
Listen carefully.

337
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,039
See if you can hear

338
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,919
the sound of mangrove frogs.

339
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
Dad.

340
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,639
It stinks here.

341
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm scared.

342
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,480
I want to go home.

343
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,240
Okay.

344
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,480
Another day, I'll catch one and show you.

345
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,360
See it?

346
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,519
That's a mangrove frog.

347
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,919
A mangrove frog, that's a mangrove frog.

348
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,159
Sketch it, sketch it.

349
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,320
I'll catch it for you to see.

350
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,600
Got it.

351
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,039
It's dead.

352
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:20,960
Dad.

353
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,559
Could this be the last

354
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,120
mangrove frog here?

355
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,600
How could that be?

356
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,799
As long as the mangroves are here,

357
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,679
there will definitely be mangrove frogs.

358
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,639
But Grandpa said

359
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,799
when he was little,

360
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,320
there were even tigers in Shenzhen.

361
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,279
They're gone now too, aren't they?
