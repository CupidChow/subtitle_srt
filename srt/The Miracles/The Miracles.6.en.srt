1
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,019
Boss

2
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,579
What kind of noodles are these?

3
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,180
Who does business like this?

4
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,939
Bro, what's wrong with the noodles?

5
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,780
They're awful.

6
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,859
You're using noodle soup as the base.

7
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,060
You can't just mess around.

8
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,819
Right?

9
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,019
Bro, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,260
I'm from Shaanxi.

11
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,819
I made hand-pulled noodles in the factory canteen for eight years.

12
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,900
I just started out on my own.

13
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,859
I really am just learning to make rice noodles.

14
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:46,939
If it weren't for this...

15
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,019
This... this bowl is on the house.

16
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,379
I'll bring you two more bowls of noodles.

17
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,260
Just a moment, right away.

18
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,859
Alright, alright.

19
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,420
It'll be quick.

20
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,140
I'm from Hubei.

21
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,260
I know how rice noodles should be made.

22
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:19,419
This is the right flavor.

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,620
Miss.

24
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,900
These noodles are actually pretty good.

25
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:23,780
They're the real deal.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,500
I'll tell my buddies to come here.

27
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,780
They'll all come and try it.

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,620
You two enjoy your meal.

29
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,259
Bye, see you.

30
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,259
Here.

31
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,060
Thanks for having my back just now.

32
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,419
Go ahead and eat, eat up.

33
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,340
Thank you.

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,139
Did you just arrive, or are you leaving?

35
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,819
I borrowed money for the bus fare.

36
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,060
I came to Shenzhen to find work.

37
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,699
But when I got here, I found out...

38
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:50,900
the garment factory is full.

39
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,419
I'm desperate and have nowhere to go.

40
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,900
I don't know what to do now.

41
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,500
It's okay, don't worry, don't worry.

42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,500
You eat first, go ahead and eat.

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,780
Why don't you stay here with me?

44
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
I'll pay you a wage.

45
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,340
You can work for me.

46
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:09,020
How about it?

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,300
Or how about this...

48
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,060
Let's work together.

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,900
It's a small business, not to get rich.

50
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,180
But at least it can let you...

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
stay in Shenzhen.

52
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:21,740
But...

53
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,780
I can't make noodles, I only know rice noodles.

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,180
I'll make the noodles, you make the rice noodles.

55
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,620
Then we can have a...

56
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,860
great north-south fusion.

57
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,860
Then we just need to give it a name.

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,060
It has a nice name.

59
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,180
Flavor from Afar.

60
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,620
That night,

61
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,900
I got drunk.

62
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,939
But I also had an epiphany.

63
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,740
As long as the spirit doesn't die,

64
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,340
the stage can welcome you back.

65
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,060
Life can make a U-turn.

66
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,460
Fan Lihua.

67
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,340
Xue Dingshan.

68
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,020
I've heard people say,

69
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,500
nine somersaults...

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,939
can't outrun a step on the gas in Shenzhen.

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,899
I got my license and a car.

72
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,779
Planning to go and drive a taxi.

73
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,180
Isn't it a coincidence...

74
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,180
that *The Final Curtain* is the closing show again.

75
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,500
Just like fifteen years ago,

76
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,980
the first show you and I performed.

77
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,300
Master said,

78
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,939
if the red tassel isn't cut, the stage bond remains.

79
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,420
It's over now.

80
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,100
This opera...

81
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,180
I'll sing it for a lifetime.

82
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,939
You do as you please.

83
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,220
Go on, hurry.

84
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,620
Go.

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,699
I just want to...

86
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,100
fulfill myself one more time.

87
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,339
One second before the lightbulb shattered,

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,339
I was thinking...

89
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,779
if we could sign a permanent contract.

90
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,939
One second before the lightbulb shattered,

91
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,899
I was thinking...

92
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,980
Actually,

93
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,019
we've known each other for a long time.

94
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,540
Okay, okay, I know.

95
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,180
I know, boss.

96
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:08,220
Good.

97
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,420
Good, good.

98
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,500
Please page 4869.

99
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,980
Message: Pile foundation.

100
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,540
Re-inspect pile foundation per BS standard.

101
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,980
Hong Kong party arriving in Shenzhen tomorrow.

102
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,139
Leaving immediately.

103
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,860
If matter, please call back.

104
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,339
2756.

105
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,660
Hey, big shot.

106
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Headquarters is pushing for the order.

107
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,540
Give me some face, okay?

108
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,579
Please call back 2756.

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,660
Message:

110
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,980
Wrong number.

111
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:55,660
What BS?

112
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,699
Bullshit?

113
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,779
Please reply to 4869.

114
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,100
Sorry.

115
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,220
Don't know why sent to wrong person.

116
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,860
Please forgive my bullshit.

117
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,500
Please call back 2756.

118
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,180
Message:

119
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,819
I lost my temper for no reason.

120
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
I'm also bullshit.

121
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,740
I'm from a Hong Kong construction company.

122
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,019
A stationed engineer.

123
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,180
After the handover,

124
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,220
came to Shenzhen for commercial real estate.

125
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,100
I'm also from Hong Kong, China.

126
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,139
Came after the handover to do trade.

127
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,540
Want to sell jeans made in Shenzhen...

128
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,740
to the whole world.

129
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,819
Do you take the night shift...

130
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:40,899
cross-border bus?

131
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,819
Driver Master Chen...

132
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,379
loves to play *Di Nü Hua* the most.

133
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,860
I've taken the earliest bus,

134
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,339
the seven o'clock one.

135
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,060
It always plays *Wanderer's Autumn Lament*.

136
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,899
So you also went to St. Paul's Co-educational College.

137
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,060
Remember the cafeteria?

138
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,540
The most popular wonton noodles.

139
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,620
I think the best part...

140
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,459
was the pork cracklings.

141
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,740
The auntie always saved an extra plate for me.

142
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,339
Hello, your noodles.

143
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:08,540
Thank you.

144
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,740
Wait.

145
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,579
Do you have any pork cracklings?

146
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,220
Just a moment.

147
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,259
Isn't it strange?

148
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,980
We lived on neighboring streets.

149
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,339
And went to the same school.

150
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,220
How could we have kept missing each other?

151
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,139
Not strange at all.

152
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,139
Maybe it was fate.

153
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,899
That we'd meet in Shenzhen.

154
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,299
Please leave a message.

155
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,220
Heavy rain in Shenzhen. Remember to close your windows.

156
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,820
Please reply.

157
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,299
Let's meet when the rain stops.

158
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,539
I know, boss.

159
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,220
But the fax machine is jammed.

160
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,539
I'm already sending it.

161
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,220
I don't care if it's jammed or not.

162
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,340
Today's the last day.

163
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,419
Get it sent out right now.

164
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,259
Darn it, I need to see him today.

165
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,940
Hurry up, please!

166
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
Is there any food left?

167
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,259
Shenzhen.

168
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,059
Is the heroic world in my heart.

169
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,580
At this moment,

170
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,379
I think of many heroes.

171
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,860
I decide

172
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,460
To be like them.

173
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,740
And charge forward.

174
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,379
I'm a discharged soldier.

175
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,779
That fat guy,

176
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,179
He's a steel mill worker.

177
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Used to roll steel bars.

178
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:49,899
Now he escorts cash.

179
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,620
Carrying the real deal.

180
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,620
Cash.

181
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:53,659
Yes.

182
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,179
I, I just last month

183
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:57,940
Came from the bank security department.

184
00:10:59,139 --> 00:10:59,779
This

185
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,379
Is our business license.

186
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,779
Shenzhen Safe-Arrival Escort.

187
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,379
Right.

188
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,860
We're the first in the country.

189
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,419
Well, the few of us

190
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:14,299
Have no experience.

191
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,220
Don't even know if we should carry guns.

192
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,100
The city bureau told us to go

193
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,539
To the military district for a permit to find out.

194
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,860
Planning an escort route.

195
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,220
I've bought

196
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
Over thirty map books.

197
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,539
What's in your woven plastic bag?

198
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,500
What are you carrying?

199
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,340
Gold bars?

200
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,620
Open it, open it.

201
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,539
Our company just opened.

202
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:32,460
I wanted to save money,

203
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,980
But also make it lively.

204
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,059
So we

205
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:36,740
Made our own lion dance troupe.

206
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,659
It was a mix-up.

207
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,460
Actually,

208
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
I knew from the start

209
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,539
You didn't seem like bad guys.

210
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,860
What kind of brazen bandit

211
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,220
Chases a cop to ask about guns?

212
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,419
Not bad guys.

213
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,980
Look at your posture.

214
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,860
Straighter than the Shenzhen River.

215
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,659
Proves you're

216
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,940
Good men.

217
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,500
That's why I only used thirty percent of my strength.

218
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,700
Let's be friends.

219
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,100
Here, here, here.

220
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,659
Have a smoke.

221
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,820
You must be exhausted

222
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,539
After a night on the train.

223
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,259
Thanks.

224
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,740
Shaanxi-style minced pork.

225
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,980
Cantonese char siu.

226
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,740
Northern chili, southern rice noodles.

227
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,980
And this ladle of sizzling hot oil.

228
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,100
And this ladle of sizzling hot oil.

229
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,419
Flavor from Afar.

230
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,259
Order up.

231
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,980
It really is fragrant.

232
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,139
So good, so good.

233
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:28,860
Is your camera broken?

234
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,779
Does it still work?

235
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,860
I'm not sure either.

236
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:31,940
Let's give it a try.

237
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,700
Well then,

238
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,340
I'll take a photo for everyone.

239
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:37,500
I...

240
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,059
Sure, sure, great.

241
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,940
Take a photo.

242
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:10,820
Miaomiao.

243
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:14,259
Actually, I have something more to say.

244
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,740
I like you.

245
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,779
Let's be together.

246
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,220
Boss Hong manages six shops now.

247
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,899
But he still can't tie a tie.

248
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,100
Who wears this normally?

249
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
This is for normal days?

250
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,740
Isn't this our silver anniversary?

251
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,860
Aren't you here?

252
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,860
You can sort everything out for me.

253
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,620
Okay, ready to shoot.

254
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,419
How long has it been since our last photo together?

255
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,580
You two,

256
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,220
Could you be a bit more natural?

257
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,779
And this is your silver anniversary?

258
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,460
You're as stiff as strangers.

259
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,419
If you can't talk nicely, don't talk.

260
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:17,700
Come on, Brother Fu.

261
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:19,139
Look at the lens, hold it.

262
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,220
Three.

263
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,220
Two.

264
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,220
One.

265
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,019
Good, one more.

266
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:25,379
Move your heads closer.

267
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,139
Closer.

268
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,340
A bit too close.

269
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,820
A little apart, good.

270
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,220
Brother Fu, smile.

271
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,620
Good.
