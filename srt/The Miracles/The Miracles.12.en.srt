1
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,020
World-class technology

2
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,020
Not in Europe or America, not in Japan or Korea

3
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,939
It's precisely hidden right beside us

4
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,659
Our company, after going public

5
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,340
In the three years

6
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,060
Acquired five small and micro enterprises

7
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,420
These companies

8
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,819
Have all developed very well

9
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:19,980
Your product

10
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,459
We have conducted a rigorous evaluation

11
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,620
We look forward to cooperating with you

12
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,939
If the signing goes smoothly

13
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,019
You two directors

14
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,140
Next month

15
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,859
You can achieve financial freedom

16
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,500
I think, Director Chen

17
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:43,980
I feel this matter

18
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,140
Is a bit too sudden

19
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,379
Please give us a few days

20
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,780
To consider it carefully, okay?

21
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:49,939
That's right

22
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,260
It's a two-way selection

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,420
After all, there are many investors

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,620
Who are optimistic about us

25
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,420
Right

26
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,620
Alright then

27
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,260
Time will prove our sincerity

28
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,140
So

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,180
Later

30
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,980
I'll send the contract for you two to review

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,060
If you have any questions

32
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,219
Contact me anytime

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,340
In life

34
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,259
The most important thing is

35
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,180
To be happy

36
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:15,460
Money or no money

37
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,379
It doesn't matter

38
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,939
But if I sign the contract

39
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,939
And buy that place in Shenzhen Bay

40
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:21,500
Sir

41
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,219
Will you live there or not?

42
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,539
Of course

43
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:25,819
You get one unit, I get one

44
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,620
Right across the hall

45
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Then bring your daddy and mommy

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,419
Your brother and sister

47
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,979
And bring them all over

48
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,340
What's most important for a family?

49
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,340
To be all together

50
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,139
Yeah

51
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:40,979
Cheers, cheers

52
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,740
Jokes aside

53
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,139
Let me be blunt first

54
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,180
Acquiring the company is fine

55
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,539
But the product R&D direction

56
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,300
Must remain in

57
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,939
Our own hands

58
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:53,659
Otherwise

59
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,740
Everything is off the table

60
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:55,819
Of course

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
Don't forget our original aspiration

62
00:02:59,259 --> 00:02:59,979
Tell me

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,379
We two aren't

64
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
Really about to succeed, are we?

65
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,060
Yeah

66
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,740
You're speaking so softly

67
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,460
Boss, I can't hear you

68
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,340
I said

69
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,139
Yeah

70
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,259
Yeah

71
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,900
Yeah

72
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,379
Yeah

73
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,740
Party A holds dominant rights

74
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,659
Over future product R&D direction

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,020
What does this mean?

76
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:44,819
Simply put

77
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,699
We are acquiring you

78
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,139
To maximize profits

79
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,020
Xiaoyu

80
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,139
Boss

81
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,580
You knew they had

82
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,020
This additional clause, didn't you?

83
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,139
Although we are very grateful to you

84
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,180
For introducing this company

85
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,060
I think you still

86
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,860
Don't understand us

87
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,180
If we sell our ideals

88
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,659
For this bit of money

89
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,740
That would be utterly unworthy of

90
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,699
Our parents who raised us

91
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,259
And even more unworthy of ourselves

92
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,139
Jiawen's father has bone cancer

93
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,540
Acquiring the company is fine

94
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,860
But the product R&D direction

95
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,459
Must remain in our own hands

96
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,060
Otherwise, everything is off the table

97
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,060
Dad said you're starting a business

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,420
Told me not to bother you

99
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,860
But since you've succeeded now

100
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,259
I'll tell you

101
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:57,740
Dad, he

102
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,819
Has bone cancer

103
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:29,860
So frustrating

104
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,540
I've been down on my luck for three years

105
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,819
Just waiting for one chance

106
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,699
To prove myself

107
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:44,459
Not to prove to others

108
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,620
How amazing I am

109
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,060
Datou Wen

110
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,019
Brought you

111
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:07,939
Your favorite roast meats

112
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:09,980
Where are you?

113
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:16,740
Datou Wen

114
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,180
Xiaoyu

115
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,300
By the time you read this letter,

116
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,100
I will have already gone home to take care of Daddy.

117
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,819
I've transferred my share of the equity.

118
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,939
First, I want to say I'm sorry.

119
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,620
You treated me like a brother,

120
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,379
but I let you down.

121
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,459
I know

122
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,139
this time

123
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,699
we were truly about to succeed.

124
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,980
Yet I fell down

125
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,740
just before the dawn of victory.

126
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,620
Looking at it this way,

127
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,699
I really am a bit like Brother Ma.

128
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,259
Last night,

129
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,939
I kept lying to myself,

130
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,819
telling myself Xiaoyu would surely understand.

131
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,620
But when I woke up this morning

132
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,939
and looked at that contract,

133
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,500
I suddenly felt

134
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,500
I didn't even recognize myself anymore.

135
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,300
Our original aspiration

136
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,060
has been lost by me.

137
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,420
I have no face left to see you again.

138
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,060
You are my best brother,

139
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,100
the person in this life

140
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,939
I least wanted to owe.

141
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,740
This time, I owe you.

142
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,300
If there's a chance,

143
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,740
I would rather

144
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,980
spend my entire life

145
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,980
making it up to you.

146
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,459
All I have left now

147
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,620
is a single

148
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,139
"I'm sorry."

149
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,100
If you succeed in the future,

150
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,500
I will be proud of you.

151
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,180
If you face setbacks,

152
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,860
I will always support you.

153
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,339
That glimmer of light...

154
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,819
Don't let it go out.

155
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,019
To further improve surgical safety,

156
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:12,699
we must reduce the sensor's size

157
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:13,939
by another ten percent.

158
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,420
But if we do that,

159
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,180
the original structure and decoupling algorithm

160
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,939
will both become ineffective.

161
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,259
Previously, this part

162
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,100
was all handled by Brother Wen.

163
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,300
Director Hu,

164
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,420
someone is here to see you.

165
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,100
Reject the interview.

166
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,779
Didn't I already say?

167
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,740
It seems to be a delivery person.

168
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,819
He has a cup of milk tea.

169
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,019
He says if you don't sign for it personally,

170
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:32,980
he won't leave.

171
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,700
Awen,

172
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,460
I will wait for you forever.

173
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,980
The company's door is always open for you.

174
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,299
How is your father's health?

175
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,059
After he had an operation,

176
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,419
it's stable now.

177
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,340
I see. Stable is good.

178
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,500
How have you been?

179
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:40,980
Good.

180
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,620
What about you?

181
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:48,940
So free,

182
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,940
you have time to deliver milk tea?

183
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,620
Free? Yeah.

184
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,700
Free enough to grow mold.

185
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,460
So,

186
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,379
I thought I'd come work for you.

187
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,860
To pay you back.

188
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,980
Pay back what money?

189
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,740
That was the company's dividend.

190
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,779
This is for you.

191
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,539
Your favorite:

192
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:20,940
iced yuanyang.

193
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:25,779
Thanks.

194
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,500
I should be the one thanking you.

195
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,860
Also, my dad had surgery.

196
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,100
Actually, the one used

197
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,179
was your company's sensor.

198
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,580
I want to say

199
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,980
it's great, really impressive.

200
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,779
Yours, mine...

201
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,100
Did I ever kick you out back then?

202
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,059
Did I agree to your resignation?

203
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:03,860
Do you have any idea

204
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,139
I waited for you for three years?

205
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,460
What did you tell me before?

206
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,860
You said, "Brothers carry burdens together."

207
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,860
You said you needed to take care of your family,

208
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,059
needed money, had to sign the contract...

209
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,940
I didn't blame you.

210
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,340
Why didn't you tell me face to face?

211
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,059
It was you who said "brothers carry burdens together."

212
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,779
"Brothers carry burdens together."

213
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,460
You said it!

214
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:22,860
If we're brothers,

215
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:24,340
we carry it together.

216
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:29,580
In your letter, you said...

217
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,700
you said to guard that glimmer of light.

218
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,179
I guarded it. What about you?

219
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,379
Do you still believe in brotherhood?

220
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Do you still believe

221
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,580
we can pull off something big together?

222
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,139
The decoupling algorithm...

223
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,860
Can you still handle it?

224
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,580
My company needs a partner.

225
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
I... I think I can.

226
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,980
You're speaking so softly, I can't hear you.

227
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,940
Boss,

228
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,700
what I just said was,

229
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,700
"I can handle it!"

230
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:47,460
Good.

231
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,460
Welcome home.

232
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,340
Director Chen.

233
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,659
Thank you.

234
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,419
Thank you.

235
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,059
Welcome back.

236
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,779
Some say

237
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,659
Shenzhen is a city of miracles.

238
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,179
But I think

239
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,659
the real miracle

240
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:40,860
is glimmers of light like ours.

241
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,299
Countless glimmers,

242
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,700
no matter how faint,

243
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,220
as long as they gather together,

244
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:47,820
are enough to light up the entire city.
