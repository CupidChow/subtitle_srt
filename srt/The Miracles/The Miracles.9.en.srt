1
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,259
1990

2
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,539
As the world order was shifting,

3
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,420
in Shenzhen on the South China Sea coast,

4
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,780
undercurrents of change were quietly surging.

5
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,700
Stocks became the hot topic everywhere.

6
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,019
Long queues snaked outside securities firms.

7
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,659
Unofficial stock trading spots were packed.

8
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,060
In this near-feverish atmosphere,

9
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,700
people scrambled to catch

10
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,900
the "get-rich-quick" train.

11
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,459
Stay away from illegal trading.

12
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,780
Invest rationally.

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,340
Stay away from illegal trading.

14
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,980
Invest rationally.

15
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,299
Hurry, hurry!

16
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,180
Fifty yuan a share!

17
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,060
Any left?

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,939
Don't cut in line!

19
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:37,980
Yeah, first come, first served.

20
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,219
My friend works inside.

21
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,459
I'm here to see him on business.

22
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,420
Get in line.

23
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,579
Which one? Which one to buy?

24
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,459
There are no stocks for sale now.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,459
Everyone, stop pushing.

26
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:50,379
And stop shouting.

27
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:58,379
Manager Wang.

28
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,219
Sorry to keep you waiting.

29
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,540
No, no, I just arrived too.

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,579
It's just that so many people

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,819
have been queuing since midnight,

32
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,219
and still can't buy stocks.

33
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:04,659
You see.

34
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:06,900
Here.

35
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,379
Let's sit down first.

36
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,659
We can talk slowly.

37
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:11,300
Well then,

38
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:12,780
I'll get straight to the point.

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,379
Good.

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,780
This is Shenzhujian.

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,340
Yesterday's listed price at the firm:

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,419
Two yuan twenty per share.

43
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,939
This one is the black market's

44
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,580
actual transaction price yesterday:

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,300
Ten yuan eighty.

46
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,939
The black market is almost five times our firm's price.

47
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,939
It's an absolute mess.

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,020
It should have been cleaned up long ago.

49
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,860
I've heard

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,659
some people even bought fake stocks.

51
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,620
So the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's unified trading

52
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,180
is absolutely not optional.

53
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,300
If this chaos continues,

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,219
there will be trouble sooner or later.

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,099
Yes, yes, yes.

56
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:41,379
It's urgent.

57
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,500
Extremely urgent.

58
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,460
This is Director Yu,

59
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,020
who led our preparatory team,

60
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,099
working tirelessly for two years,

61
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,460
to draft these regulations.

62
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,659
You can take a look.

63
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,939
Please tell Director Yu,

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,580
unity is strength.

65
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,099
We will fully cooperate.

66
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:57,819
Thank you.

67
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,139
Wait a moment, please.

68
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:02,939
Sorry about that.

69
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,460
What are you doing?

70
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,939
Bringing you coffee.

71
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:09,900
Who drinks coffee?

72
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,099
Trying to be fancy.

73
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,379
Change it to tea.

74
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,259
In my place,

75
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,539
we follow my rules.

76
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,659
I can't find the tea leaves.

77
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,939
What are you good for?

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,780
Wait, I'll go find some.

79
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:25,659
What are you doing here?

80
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,060
Can't I come?

81
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,780
It's a small world.

82
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,659
The coffee is just in time.

83
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,020
I actually am a bit sleepy.

84
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,259
Can you see how tired I am?

85
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,659
I've been pulling all-nighters for days.

86
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,900
What's it to you?

87
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,860
Here, let me through.

88
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,620
Brother Junsheng!

89
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,340
Brother Junsheng! Brother Junsheng!

90
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,020
Finally found you!

91
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,580
A Jie.

92
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,699
Sister Liang Ying is here too.

93
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,819
Here to buy stocks, or...

94
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,699
here for a date?

95
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,099
I'll smack your mouth.

96
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,379
I'm here on official business.

97
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,379
What are you doing here?

98
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,139
Don't you have to work?

99
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:58,979
I'm on my day off.

100
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,340
Brother Junsheng,

101
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,539
I came first thing this morning,

102
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,340
but couldn't buy any at all.

103
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,060
Help me out.

104
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,099
Look at this crowd. Who came later than you?

105
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,740
I came earlier than them!

106
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,099
Didn't I also fail to buy any?

107
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:09,740
Alright, alright. Wait a bit.

108
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,659
I'll figure something out for you later.

109
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,539
Let's go.

110
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,139
Going.

111
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:14,819
Here's your umbrella.

112
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,379
Don't need it.

113
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,100
By the way, Junsheng,

114
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,139
tell A Jie

115
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:18,980
to stay away from the black market.

116
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:19,899
I know.

117
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,899
Tell me, this Shenzhen Stock Exchange...

118
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,100
Is it an exchange,

119
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,620
or a securities market?

120
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,660
Keeps changing its name every other day.

121
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,740
Gives me a headache just hearing it.

122
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,620
If they want to get it done,

123
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,139
who knows when that'll be.

124
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:40,579
What are you doing?

125
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I'm not talking to you anymore.

126
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,579
Bye.

127
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,500
Wait.

128
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,339
Throw this away too.

129
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,300
Throw it.

130
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,379
Little brat.

131
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,180
Lecturing me with a bunch of principles.

132
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,100
Makes no sense.

133
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:00,779
Director.

134
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,300
I'm back.

135
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,100
I delivered all the booklets.

136
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,500
What was their attitude?

137
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,100
I think everyone is very supportive

138
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,459
and willing to cooperate.

139
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,740
Really that smooth?

140
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,139
Have a little faith.

141
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,139
Xiao Liang.

142
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,779
If we truly achieve great success,

143
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,180
you will have contributed greatly.

144
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:19,579
Not at all.

145
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,259
Look at you.

146
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,019
Your eyes are red from overwork.

147
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,579
The wind is picking up.

148
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,019
Remember this.

149
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,819
You need to enter the right door, find the right person.

150
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:38,819
And worship the right god.

151
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,139
Brother, have a cigarette.

152
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:40,899
No, no thanks.

153
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,060
Brother Junsheng.

154
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:42,860
I've already been to

155
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,819
over a dozen trading halls.

156
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,860
I just can't buy any.

157
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:46,220
It's just starting to get hot.

158
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,100
Why fight for scraps there?

159
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,220
Find Brother Wu. It's a sure thing.

160
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,459
Whoever pays first gets the stock.

161
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:51,019
Brother Junsheng.

162
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:52,139
You have wide connections.

163
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,939
Introduce me to that Brother Wu.

164
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,339
Why do you want to know him?

165
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,019
I need money urgently.

166
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,339
You borrowed money?

167
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:03,939
Your mom worked so hard,

168
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,699
running a rice noodle shop to put you through school.

169
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,579
Was it easy asking favors to get you a job?

170
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,300
I just don't want to see

171
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,660
my mom struggle every single day.

172
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,540
My mom struggles every single day.

173
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,779
That's why I'm doing this.

174
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,540
Now everyone says there's an opportunity.

175
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,579
I want to take a gamble too.

176
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:13,699
What if it doesn't work out?

177
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,579
They can all succeed.

178
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:15,660
Am I the only one who can't?

179
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,819
Bro, we've been friends since we were kids.

180
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:18,779
Consider this me begging you.

181
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,259
Help your little brother one more time.

182
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,379
To be honest with you,

183
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,339
I've already bought some fake stocks.

184
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,100
My entire life savings are on the line, bro.

185
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:28,540
What are you doing?

186
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,339
Come back with me.

187
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,459
I can't go back, bro.

188
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,779
Bro, I'm begging you.

189
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,339
Just treat this dead horse of mine

190
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,660
as a live one to cure one more time.

191
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,300
Please.

192
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:58,939
No moves left.

193
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,579
Hindsight is 20/20.

194
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:01,699
It has to be Brother Wu.

195
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:02,579
Brother Wu.

196
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:06,899
Manager Junsheng.

197
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:07,939
Long time no see.

198
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:08,980
Long time no see. Come, play a game. Play a game.

199
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,339
Sit, sit, sit.

200
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:10,980
Come on, come on.

201
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:11,899
Brother Wu.

202
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,899
This is my brother, A Jie.

203
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:13,579
My childhood friend.

204
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,579
A small token of respect.

205
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,139
Is this an offering for incense?

206
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,699
Or an apprenticeship fee?

207
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,660
Don't joke with me.

208
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,379
Of course it's the apprenticeship fee.

209
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,019
Please look after A Jie from now on.

210
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:31,899
Yes, Brother Wu.

211
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:32,740
We'll get rich following you.

212
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:33,939
Manager Junsheng.

213
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,259
I've heard all about it.

214
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,699
The people from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

215
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,259
have already come knocking on your door.

216
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:40,660
You're from the trading hall.

217
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,300
If even you can't help him get rich,

218
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,540
what use is coming to me?

219
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,660
What kind of manager am I?

220
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:48,899
At our place,

221
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,819
only Manager Wang has the final say.

222
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,139
But for the trading here,

223
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,180
everyone knows

224
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,899
Brother Wu alone calls the shots.

225
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:57,899
Brother Wu, Brother Wu.

226
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,180
So, what does Manager Wang

227
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,180
think of this Shenzhen Stock Exchange now?

228
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,339
Move the cannon.

229
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,819
Those people

230
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,579
who studied abroad,

231
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,259
can't seriously think that

232
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,579
setting up an exchange,

233
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,459
getting a few rusty metal machines,

234
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,939
ringing a golden bell,

235
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,139
making it just like abroad,

236
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,899
means this thing will succeed, right?

237
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,060
Our line of work

238
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:29,459
belongs to metal.

239
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,620
Metal needs flow, energy.

240
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,620
Wealth needs to gather people.

241
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,379
Look at our place here.

242
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,220
Look.

243
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,580
Such vibrant energy.

244
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,259
Watch closely.

245
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,100
Can they compare to us?

246
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,620
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,379
Brother Wu, Brother Wu.

248
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,340
This business deal,

249
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,820
it's not done yet.

250
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,379
First, remember one saying.

251
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,139
If you gamble, be ready to lose.

252
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,100
Cheers.

253
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,340
Here, Brother Junsheng.

254
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,899
Here, Brother Junsheng.

255
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,460
Cheers.

256
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,259
Cheers.

257
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,580
Auntie, the food is here.

258
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,659
Come on, come on.

259
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,259
Mom, take a break.

260
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,460
There's enough food, Auntie.

261
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,379
Sit down and rest a while.

262
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:15,580
I'm not tired.

263
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,139
I'm happy you guys came.

264
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,700
My son only has you few good friends.

265
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,659
With you guys helping him,

266
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,899
I feel much more at ease.

267
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,059
Look, these bowls and chopsticks,

268
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,419
and that stove,

269
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,179
were all newly bought by him for me.

270
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,500
Boss, one order of rice noodle rolls.

271
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,259
He made money.

272
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,019
Just a moment.

273
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,379
No, Mom, let me do it.

274
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,899
No need.

275
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,500
Relying on this small business

276
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,659
will take forever

277
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:39,539
to make any money.

278
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,019
From now on,

279
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,820
I'm sticking with Brother Junsheng.

280
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:43,740
Here, brother.

281
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,059
Junsheng's workplace forbids trading stocks.

282
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,379
That's because you don't know,

283
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,820
Brother Junsheng has plenty of connections.

284
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,539
Here, A Jie.

285
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:50,860
This fish is delicious.

286
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,500
Come on, come on.

287
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,860
Taste the fish your mom made.

288
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,299
Eat the fish.

289
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,500
Talk less. Here.

290
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,539
It's really tasty.

291
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,620
Did you take him there?

292
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,019
No.

293
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,139
Go where?

294
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,500
No.

295
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,340
Tell me.

296
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,059
Did he take you to the black market?

297
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,220
What did I tell you guys?

298
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,740
You see others making money,

299
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,460
but let me tell you,

300
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,100
that is a huge pit, a trap.

301
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,899
We go way back.

302
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,019
How could I possibly trick you?

303
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,179
Otherwise, why do you think I've been

304
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,379
working so hard on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

305
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,220
for the past two years?

306
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,740
Don't I know

307
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,779
what you're doing it for?

308
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,539
I just took him for a look around.

309
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:30,620
What's the big deal?

310
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,340
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,419
Just to broaden my horizons.

312
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,899
Right, just a casual look around.

313
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,179
Why do you have this?

314
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,059
I... I was just studying it.

315
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:50,820
You and your big mouth.

316
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,379
You, you...

317
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,460
You blab about everything.

318
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,139
Why did Liang Ying leave?

319
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,779
Go after her, quick!

320
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:58,820
Such a good girl,

321
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,940
where will you find another like her?

322
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,779
Go, hurry!

323
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,500
Yeah, yeah, Brother, go quickly.

324
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,779
Wait a minute, wait!

325
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:07,620
Listen to my explanation.

326
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,379
Mom.

327
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:13,860
Director Yu, look.

328
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,899
Someone wrote another article saying

329
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:16,259
our Shenzhen Stock Exchange has shallow roots

330
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:16,980
and won't succeed.

331
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,500
Do you think we should wait a bit?

332
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:19,779
There are also people spreading rumors

333
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,139
claiming they have inside information

334
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,259
that the Central Government didn't approve it.

335
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:23,940
How is our preparatory group supposed to work?

336
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,940
Establishing the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

337
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:26,539
is beneficial for the common people.

338
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,179
The Central Government definitely supports it.

339
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,500
We can't wait any longer.

340
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,860
Have you guys heard?

341
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,899
"East Development" in the black market

342
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,379
has already shot up to 160.

343
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,860
While the listed price at the securities office

344
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,139
is 80.

345
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,299
What will happen in the future,

346
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,259
no one knows.

347
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,179
Investors' information is monopolized,

348
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,539
yet they are still rushing in.

349
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,299
One share becomes ten shares!

350
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:49,860
Brother Wu.

351
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,779
A Jie, A Jie.

352
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,379
Manager Junsheng's brother.

353
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,899
Yes, yes, yes.

354
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,539
Come, come.

355
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,740
Ten thousand.

356
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:01,620
Ten thousand.

357
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:02,779
Take a look.

358
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:04,740
So much.

359
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:09,899
Buying now

360
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,059
is the right move.

361
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,019
You think 160 is expensive, right?

362
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:14,740
I'm telling you,

363
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,779
it will rise, rise big.

364
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,740
In a few days,

365
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,179
it'll be too late for regrets.

366
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:20,700
Yes, yes, yes.

367
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,259
We'll listen to Brother Wu.

368
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,379
Here is your stock.

369
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,379
Thanks.

370
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,179
Good luck.

371
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,019
Brother Wu.

372
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:28,659
Thanks.

373
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,100
East Development.

374
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,980
80, 160, 240.

375
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:33,980
They are numbers.

376
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,059
But behind these numbers

377
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,059
are the life savings of so many families.

378
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,779
If black market speculators here

379
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,019
and people from the securities office

380
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:41,899
collude with each other,

381
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:44,059
it could very likely lead to serious consequences.

382
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,059
Did you hear the news?

383
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,539
People are dumping East Development at 90 in the black market.

384
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,019
90?

385
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,899
I bought it at 160!

386
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:00,379
I didn't even sell at 240!

387
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:03,379
Didn't they say it would go to 300?

388
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,019
How can you trust those scalpers?

389
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,379
Who knows if they have inside information?

390
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:10,500
And it was those scalpers who started dumping first.

391
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,179
Now no one dares to buy in.

392
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:13,659
Are you guys selling?

393
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:15,019
Are you selling?

394
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:17,379
If it's 80, so be it.

395
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm telling you, we can't wait anymore.

396
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,700
We have to cut our losses and sell.

397
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,539
If we don't sell now, we'll lose everything.

398
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:24,779
Are you selling?

399
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:26,259
Sell it for me.

400
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,539
I'm selling, I'm selling!

401
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,500
I'm selling!

402
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,220
I-I'm selling it all!

403
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:40,379
Over here, this way!

404
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,500
Let's talk, let's talk.

405
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,740
I can give you eighty-five now.

406
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,899
More than any of them.

407
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:46,860
No problem.

408
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,500
If you wait any longer, you'll miss your chance.

409
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,340
Suppose someone at the securities firm leaks

410
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,019
the news about Dong Fazhan's stock split

411
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:54,740
to the black market speculators in advance.

412
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:56,379
Then they go and spread

413
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,179
the false rumor that the bank will

414
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,139
suppress the stock price.

415
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,059
They create panic,

416
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,899
luring retail investors to sell low.

417
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:03,259
They'll buy up huge amounts of shares.

418
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,539
Once the real split news is announced,

419
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:10,899
one share becomes ten,

420
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,139
by that time,

421
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,659
even more people will be buying.

422
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,940
Dong Fazhan is splitting!

423
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,539
One share splits into ten!

424
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,419
It went from eighty to two-sixty!

425
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:20,779
It tripled!

426
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:22,139
Thank goodness I didn't sell.

427
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:22,820
Heaven be praised.

428
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,379
I'm rich! I'm rich!

429
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:25,980
This time I can turn my luck around!

430
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,580
Darn it.

431
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,779
I've lost everything.

432
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,419
If only I'd waited one more day...

433
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,659
One more day would've made all the difference.

434
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,659
Who still has Dong Fazhan shares?

435
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,860
Give them to me, I'll take them all!

436
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,220
After completing their arbitrage,

437
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,980
the person with the insider information

438
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,820
will split the profits with these speculators.

439
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,899
And the investors kept in the dark

440
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,139
can only be slaughtered.

441
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,259
Two-sixty! Two-sixty!

442
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,419
If I'd just waited a few more days, I'd be rich!

443
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,220
I'd be rich!

444
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:07,059
I could have been rich.

445
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,899
If we don't implement unified management soon,

446
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:11,740
investors will suffer huge losses.

447
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:12,659
But right now, we...

448
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:13,500
No more "buts"!

449
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,019
Rules are forged by action,

450
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,019
not by waiting.

451
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,980
Everyone, lift your heads!

452
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:18,259
From this moment on,

453
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,139
every single one of us

454
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,620
must show the determination to open the exchange!

455
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:22,899
We can't wait for dawn.

456
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,019
If dawn doesn't come,

457
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,940
we must light the lamps ourselves.

458
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,659
What are you doing squatting here?

459
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:43,779
Bro.

460
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,019
Here.

461
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,539
Made money that fast?

462
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:56,179
Following Brother Wu,

463
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,779
catching Dong Fazhan's split and surge,

464
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,539
you made money, right?

465
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,139
No rush to pay me back.

466
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm not a stingy guy.

467
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,179
No, bro...

468
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,820
Thanks, bro.

469
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,940
Here, the principal and interest are all in there.

470
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,539
You made quite a bit, huh?

471
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,139
Did I ask you for interest?

472
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,500
Don't be so formal with me.

473
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,059
Come on, let's go drink and celebrate!

474
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,179
Bro, bro...

475
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,419
I... I...

476
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,500
I've got things to do.

477
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,179
You okay?

478
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,659
I'm fine.

479
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:27,779
I'm off.

480
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,500
Oh, right, bro.

481
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,779
Go see my mom when you have time.

482
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,659
She really misses you.

483
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,259
Obviously! You don't have to tell me.

484
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,899
Your mom is my mom too.

485
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,940
I'll go see her tomorrow.

486
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:43,899
Alright then.

487
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:45,659
See you.
