1
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,620
Today, the city will have moderate rain.

2
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,739
The temperature will be 26 to 31 degrees.

3
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:37,939
For the next three days,

4
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,659
there will be thunderstorms or heavy rain.

5
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,379
Be sure to take an umbrella when you go out.

6
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,700
Dad, I'll be waiting for you in Shenzhen tomorrow.

7
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:26,620
Dad.

8
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,219
You must be tired. Let me.

9
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,659
Didn't I tell you not to come pick me up?

10
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,219
Did it make Xiaoxiao late for her piano lesson?

11
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:32,860
No, it didn't.

12
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,300
We can go pick her up right now.

13
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,740
I'll get it.

14
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,860
Let me, let me. Where's the car?

15
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,580
Over here.

16
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,740
The last time you were in Shenzhen

17
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,300
was the year Xiaoxiao was born.

18
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:54,740
Look.

19
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:55,939
See how much it's changed?

20
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,819
A lot.

21
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,900
It's been over forty years,

22
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,180
and it's still a landmark.

23
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,699
Keep your fingers arched.

24
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,939
Don't let them collapse.

25
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,860
Here.

26
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,139
Right here.

27
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,340
Very good.

28
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:48,860
Hold it.

29
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,620
Look at how she plays the piano.

30
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,099
Isn't she adorable?

31
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,659
You never doted on me like that.

32
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,660
What piece is she playing?

33
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,180
I don't know.

34
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,379
Where are you off to, Brother Lu?

35
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,420
Looking for your wife again?

36
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,500
What, are you jealous?

37
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,100
Like you're the only one with a partner.

38
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,620
Let me tell you,

39
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,300
my wife

40
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,660
is the best in the world.

41
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,459
Mingshu.

42
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,420
There, it's done.

43
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,100
You made this?

44
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,300
It actually looks pretty good.

45
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,819
I copied it from a magazine.

46
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,420
It gets the idea across, right?

47
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,180
Just a rough version.

48
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,139
You can use this to practice your fingering for now.

49
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,220
Someday, we'll be able to buy a real one.

50
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,379
You've really changed since coming to Shenzhen.

51
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,779
Daring to dream of anything.

52
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,939
Why wouldn't I dare to dream?

53
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,740
Back in the day,

54
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,939
when we were building five-story buildings,

55
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,139
who would have thought that one day

56
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:51,579
we could

57
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:52,740
build a fifty-story skyscraper?

58
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,100
As long as you dare to dream and work hard,

59
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:57,699
life will always get better.

60
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,139
Alright.

61
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,420
Don't be in such a hurry to eat.

62
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,579
Try it first.

63
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:02,500
Try it.

64
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,660
These hands are used to tying rebar.

65
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,980
That's why they're so strong.

66
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,819
Others might play for ten minutes,

67
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,060
but you could play all night.

68
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,339
Okay, I'll try.

69
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,939
It's actually pretty good.

70
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,060
Dad.

71
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,500
Mom's been gone for so many years now.

72
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,060
You've been alone all this time.

73
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,500
If someday

74
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,379
you want to find a new companion,

75
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,259
don't worry about my opinion.

76
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,500
I'll definitely support you.

77
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,740
I won't pressure you to have a second child,

78
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,060
so don't you pressure me to remarry.

79
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,379
Look who's being rebellious now.

80
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,139
People of our generation,

81
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,899
we focus on doing one thing well in life,

82
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,500
and staying with one person.

83
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:39,620
That's enough.

84
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,180
Whether your mom is here or not,

85
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,699
my heart is still full.

86
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:51,939
Here.

87
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,579
I heard

88
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,860
this time, over thirty couples

89
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,060
came to work as husband-and-wife teams.

90
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,500
To speed things up,

91
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,620
they're not even allowed to live together.

92
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:12,699
Don't forget,

93
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,180
you promised to marry me the day the building is finished.

94
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,500
Who promised you that?

95
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:22,259
The night before we left Jingmen,

96
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,060
you said it yourself.

97
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,459
Don't even think about backing out.

98
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,939
It seems the higher-ups' intention this time

99
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,460
is dead set on using slipforming.

100
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:35,820
We've tried it twice and failed both times.

101
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,580
Who knows when we'll ever

102
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,179
see this building topped out.

103
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,500
Listen to me, fellow property owners.

104
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,539
Perhaps you all

105
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,700
aren't too familiar

106
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,580
with this traditional jump form technique.

107
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,259
Let me demonstrate for you.

108
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,379
This is the foundation.

109
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,700
Jump forming first requires pouring the first layer.

110
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
After pouring it in,

111
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,580
you have to wait at least two days

112
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,259
for the concrete to set.

113
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,500
Then you dismantle this formwork,

114
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,259
and then build the second layer of formwork.

115
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,700
Then pour concrete in again,

116
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,820
and have to wait another two-plus days

117
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,820
for the concrete to set before dismantling.

118
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,340
Then the third layer pour,

119
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,019
and so on, layer by layer going up.

120
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,259
Our project is over fifty stories high.

121
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,820
Getting anxious is useless.

122
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,580
But if we switch to

123
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,059
our slipforming technique,

124
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,100
that's a whole different story.

125
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,820
Slipforming works like this.

126
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,539
This is the pour body.

127
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,340
This is the pouring.

128
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,980
We pour the concrete

129
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,580
directly in like this,

130
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,220
while simultaneously lifting it upward.

131
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,299
After pouring in the concrete,

132
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,700
we only need to pause briefly for two hours.

133
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,860
Once the concrete sets,

134
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,100
we inject more concrete,

135
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,059
lift and pour again after two hours,

136
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,980
and keep lifting.

137
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,220
Once it sets, we continue.

138
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,700
Like this.

139
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,980
Its efficiency and quality,

140
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,340
especially the smoothness

141
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,820
of the building's exterior,

142
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,059
are something traditional methods

143
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,340
can never achieve.

144
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,220
You can all calculate it.

145
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,779
Which method is more scientific

146
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,179
and more suitable

147
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,580
in terms of time and efficiency?

148
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,940
Alright.

149
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,700
Thank you, Master Fu, for the explanation.

150
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,299
I wonder if after listening,

151
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,179
you property owners

152
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,299
are now able

153
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,659
to understand more clearly

154
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,580
why we insist on slipforming.

155
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,539
We understand, alright.

156
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,580
It sounds impressive.

157
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,340
But so far in this country,

158
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,860
there hasn't been a single successful precedent.

159
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,460
You've already failed twice.

160
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,179
How much manpower and resources,

161
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:40,860
and financial resources were wasted?

162
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,340
Will you keep going?

163
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,019
Failing twice

164
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,460
means we've gained experience twice.

165
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,460
But who's responsible for the delayed schedule?

166
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:48,980
Master Fu just now

167
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,539
has already fully demonstrated.

168
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:51,940
As long as we succeed once,

169
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,299
catching up to the schedule

170
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,220
won't be a problem.

171
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,179
But who can guarantee

172
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:56,340
the next attempt will succeed?

173
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:57,980
What we're building

174
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,059
is China's tallest building.

175
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,340
It costs 140 million.

176
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,659
The whole nation is watching.

177
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,179
Precisely because the whole nation is watching,

178
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
we, the construction iron army,

179
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,299
should set the example first.

180
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:10,860
It seems

181
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,940
even within your own team,

182
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,460
you haven't reached a consensus.

183
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm the workers' representative.

184
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,700
Let me say a couple of things.

185
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,779
If we switch back to traditional jump forming,

186
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,220
we can still do it.

187
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,820
But to be honest,

188
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,460
it's demoralizing.

189
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,059
All of us

190
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,340
came here specifically for the new technology.

191
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,980
Yes.

192
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:33,059
Since the higher-ups also support it,

193
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,659
we workers are willing to gamble one more time.

194
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,860
Once we succeed, we all gain honor.

195
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,299
Right, right.

196
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
You can gamble,

197
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:45,940
but who takes responsibility if you lose?

198
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,700
The city leaders do support it,

199
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:48,820
but do you know

200
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,179
how much pressure they're under?

201
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,100
Since our Third Bureau is here,

202
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:57,940
this battle

203
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:58,940
must be fought

204
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
beautifully.

205
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,940
I will apply to our superiors

206
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,059
for a third experiment.

207
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
Good, good, good.

208
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,860
Darn it! Darn it!

209
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,379
Latest from the weather bureau:

210
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:13,620
a typhoon is about to hit.

211
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,899
Maximum wind force, level twelve.

212
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,700
Attention all personnel!

213
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,580
The typhoon is moving

214
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,820
west-northwest.

215
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,299
Everyone must pay attention to safety!

216
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:28,100
Rebar team!

217
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,659
Move faster, everyone!

218
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:30,259
Got it, got it!

219
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,700
If the motors get soaked, they're ruined!

220
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:32,860
Alright, alright!

221
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,700
Protect the underground cables!

222
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,779
Be careful!

223
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:39,179
Okay!

224
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,779
Give me a hand over here!

225
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,379
All personnel, watch your safety!

226
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,539
Give it to me!

227
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:47,779
Hurry up! Get a move on!

228
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,580
Why is there water pooling over there?

229
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,539
Is this water pump broken?

230
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,580
Where's Old Zhang?

231
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:56,860
Old Zhang!

232
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,779
There's water here!

233
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,539
Everyone, be careful!

234
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:00,700
The lights! The lights!

235
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,059
Don't panic, everyone!

236
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,179
Hold on, everyone!

237
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,620
Hold on!

238
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:07,940
Quick, quick! Hold on! Hold on!

239
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,059
The tower crane!

240
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,100
The tower crane is going to fall!

241
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,620
We need to release the limit switch!

242
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,379
Where's the tower crane operator?

243
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:23,460
Tower crane operator!

244
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,659
He took the day off today.

245
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,899
It's too dangerous if it falls!

246
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,700
Let's go, Xiaohong.

247
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,740
Evacuate! Evacuate!

248
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,460
Get out, now! Move!

249
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,940
Who is that?

250
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,259
Looks like Brother Lu.

251
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,580
He's got a death wish!

252
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,340
Sister Su!

253
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,179
Your man's something else!

254
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,460
The tower crane is secure!

255
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,179
We hold the line tonight!

256
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,820
Protect the foundation pit!

257
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,220
Hold the line!

258
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,580
Crane's stable, let's secure all the building materials.

259
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,940
Okay, I understand.

260
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,580
How long will this wind last?

261
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,179
We'll hold as long as it blows.

262
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,820
You just love showing off.

263
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,220
You're the one with no regard for your life.

264
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,860
Damn right, I'm your man.

265
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,379
I think you two are six of one and half a dozen of the other.

266
00:14:59,059 --> 00:14:59,700
Sister Su!

267
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,100
Our dormitory collapsed!

268
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:01,980
My qin!

269
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,700
My qin is still in there!

270
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,820
Don't panic, I'll look for it.

271
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,500
It's not here.

272
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:19,500
It couldn't have been blown away, could it?

273
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,340
Found it!

274
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,259
The foundation pit is safe.

275
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:12,580
But the shacks are wrecked.

276
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,460
Not bad, Sister Su.

277
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,940
Look, I didn't salvage a thing.

278
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,139
And you managed to salvage this old thing.

279
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,940
I don't want to play anymore.

280
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,139
Why do I keep making mistakes?

281
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,059
Don't get discouraged, sweetie.

282
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,460
Xiaoxiao.

283
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,580
Grandpa.

284
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,819
It's not that I'm slacking off.

285
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,220
It's just getting harder and harder.

286
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,980
I'm afraid of making mistakes.

287
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
The more I learn, the harder it gets.

288
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,980
What if your teacher now...

289
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,180
...had you practice every day...

290
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,299
...the same simple tunes...

291
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,180
...from when you first started learning?

292
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,579
Those easy pieces.

293
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,579
Would you want that?

294
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,980
Exactly.

295
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,140
Things that are too easy...

296
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,940
...aren't interesting to do, right?

297
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:26,660
Right?

298
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,059
This is really bizarre.

299
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:36,819
We've slipped three times already.

300
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,299
Why isn't it working yet?

301
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,980
They say it's because it's hot this time, the temperature is high...

302
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,500
...so the concrete's curing time changed again.

303
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,579
It's a new method, you have to test it.

304
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,259
Test it every single day?

305
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,180
When will it ever end?

306
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,500
Daring to try is better than not trying at all.

307
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,420
Then what do you call going in circles?

308
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,180
What's that?

309
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
You imitate it pretty well.

310
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,420
Still cracking jokes here?

311
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,579
The construction site across the way...

312
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,220
...is using us as a cautionary tale.

313
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,019
People have mouths.

314
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,019
Let them talk if they want.

315
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:10,779
They across the way dare to laugh at us?

316
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,579
Serves them right, stuck doing brick-concrete forever.

317
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,900
Well, at least they've built something.

318
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,779
Yeah.

319
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,380
And what about us?

320
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,299
Here every day, building and tearing down...

321
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,059
...tearing down and building.

322
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,140
Several sites over there...

323
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,019
...are already finished.

324
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,460
How many floors have we even built?

325
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,259
Enough from you.

326
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:24,779
They haven't shorted your pay, have they?

327
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:25,980
At most, it's just wasted some time.

328
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,740
You were the enthusiastic one back then.

329
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,220
And now you're still talking tough.

330
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,500
If we'd used slip-form casting earlier...

331
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,579
...we'd be topping out by now.

332
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:32,420
If you want slip-form...

333
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,380
...go do it across the way!

334
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,740
Stop your whining here!

335
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:35,819
What did you just say?

336
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:39,619
Hey, hey... say less.
