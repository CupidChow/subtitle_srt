1
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:16,140
Down.

2
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,180
Up.

3
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,299
Lei Xingxing.

4
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,299
How did you get it wrong again?

5
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,939
This is the simplest basic skill.

6
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:28,540
Do you know that?

7
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,900
In my twelve years in this industry,

8
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,659
you are the person

9
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,980
least suited to be a nanny I've ever seen.

10
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,259
As long as you work as a nanny for a month,

11
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,620
the investment funds will arrive immediately.

12
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,580
Look at this photo of you.

13
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,620
That's still better than your dad.

14
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,740
Look, your dad's eyes are gone.

15
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,060
What do you mean "gone"? Hurry up.

16
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,900
What took you so long?

17
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,060
Didn't you want grape flavor?

18
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:37,860
This is yours.

19
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,219
You're so timid,

20
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,300
yet you insist on playing something so thrilling.

21
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,620
It wasn't easy to snag this

22
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,060
buy-one-get-one-free coupon.

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,939
Can't let it go to waste.

24
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,620
Why are you always group-buying coupons lately?

25
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,500
My workplace...

26
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,539
isn't it supporting these high-tech enterprises?

27
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm in charge of policy subsidies.

28
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:53,780
What? Looking for inspiration?

29
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,580
Just looking for inspiration.

30
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,580
Mom, you have a message.

31
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,099
Oh my god.

32
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:00,300
I'm pregnant.

33
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:09,099
Hello.

34
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,259
Hello.

35
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,139
I am a nanny from Great Virtue Home Services.

36
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,180
Here for the trial run.

37
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,699
How did you find a male nanny?

38
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,419
I placed the order at the amusement park.

39
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,819
I checked the wrong gender option.

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,979
Why don't we give him a try?

41
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:22,900
Try my foot!

42
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,979
A man definitely won't work.

43
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,300
Right, it won't work.

44
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
And his outfit doesn't work either.

45
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,099
Hello.

46
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:29,860
Hello, hello.

47
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:30,580
Just now,

48
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,539
regarding your living environment,

49
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,379
I conducted an assessment.

50
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,139
Great Virtue Home Services.

51
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:35,539
Yes.

52
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,740
and generated a report.

53
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,259
Come, sit. Take a look.

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,979
Sit, sit down.

55
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,379
The green dots represent...

56
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:42,860
Look at the screen.

57
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:46,939
The green dots are...

58
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:47,979
representing untidy areas.

59
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,620
Red dots represent unclean areas.

60
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:50,659
Green dots and red dots

61
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,419
are distributed very densely.

62
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,659
This indicates that your living habits

63
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:54,259
are very poor.

64
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:55,620
Who is a Leo?

65
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:56,620
Her.

66
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:58,620
You are...

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,259
Guess.

68
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,180
Aries.

69
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,259
You see,

70
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,300
among the twelve zodiac signs,

71
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,379
the two sloppiest signs

72
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,099
living together...

73
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,539
this kind of living environment

74
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:07,819
is understandable.

75
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,139
So when you look for a nanny,

76
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:09,860
you shouldn't look for that kind of

77
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,740
traditional nanny.

78
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:11,699
I am the most suitable.

79
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,379
I am an Integrated Nanny.

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,100
Takeout is here! Time for a feast!

81
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:16,819
Hello everyone.

82
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
Dad, what is this?

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,740
What did you buy now?

84
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:22,259
A rug.

85
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:22,980
Don't move.

86
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,699
Put it down.

87
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,019
Dad, comb my hair first.

88
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:30,939
Dad will comb it for you in a bit.

89
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,660
You do your homework first.

90
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:32,540
The homework from last night

91
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,220
is all done.

92
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,100
There are just a few math problems left.

93
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:35,980
I don't really know how to do them.

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,060
Well, well, well...

95
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,139
Dad will tutor you in a bit.

96
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:38,980
What the heck is this?

97
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,180
I'll go back to my room first then.

98
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,740
Okay, okay.

99
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,019
Where should I set up my bed?

100
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:50,939
Hybrid type.

101
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:51,899
You... calm down first.

102
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
How should I address you?

103
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,180
My surname is Lei.

104
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:54,980
Lei Xingxing.

105
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:55,819
Lei Xingxing.

106
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,899
My situation...

107
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,860
I'm pregnant again.

108
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,379
So, having... in the house...

109
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,779
suddenly having a...

110
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,860
strange man...

111
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,860
is quite inconvenient.

112
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,100
Hope you understand.

113
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:04,899
Um...

114
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,860
I also have an older daughter.

115
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,220
Yes.

116
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,740
You know, one mountain can't hold two tigers.

117
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,420
You're pregnant, why choose a male nanny?

118
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,300
It's inconvenient.

119
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,339
How about... for your trip here...

120
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,259
we reimburse your travel fare.

121
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,060
We'll cover the round trip.

122
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,620
I think...

123
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,139
your current perception...

124
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:16,819
is a bit one-sided.

125
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,620
Besides doing regular housework,

126
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,139
I can also give the children...

127
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,819
tutoring.

128
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,139
I can also provide the fetus...

129
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,579
with Advanced Mathematical Prenatal Education.

130
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,699
I can use these everyday items...

131
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,500
to arrange geometric shapes...

132
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,379
and numerical figures,

133
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,699
thereby turning your living scenes...

134
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,660
into numerical scenes.

135
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,500
This will make your mathematical thinking...

136
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,180
more active.

137
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,259
This is the highest level of Mathematical Prenatal Education.

138
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,019
Many children...

139
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,620
only win at the starting line.

140
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,100
I can let your child jump the gun.

141
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,339
How long is the trial period?

142
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:47,819
Two days.

143
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:48,860
I'll give you two days.

144
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:50,699
Start.

145
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:07,500
Why did you agree...

146
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,540
to let him stay for a trial?

147
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:09,420
Do you really want to find...

148
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,180
a live-in male nanny?

149
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,860
No.

150
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,779
The customer service at the housekeeping center...

151
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:13,540
sent me a WeChat message.

152
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,300
As long as we try this male nanny for two days,

153
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:15,980
his KPI...

154
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,579
will be met.

155
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:17,740
Consider it doing him a favor.

156
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,459
They'll upgrade me to Star Diamond member.

157
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,180
Honey, Star Diamond?

158
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:21,939
Oh my god.

159
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,779
That's just pure nonsense.

160
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:24,300
It's not nonsense.

161
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,860
Let's try it then. It's just two days anyway.

162
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,300
Right?

163
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,740
Let's see what exactly is...

164
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,740
Mathematical Prenatal Education.

165
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,379
Actually, besides doing housework,

166
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:31,540
I can also provide...

167
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,819
very rich emotional value.

168
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,740
Wait, you... how did you get in?

169
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,779
There are only two difficult things in the world.

170
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:37,699
One,

171
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
is to put your own thoughts...

172
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,819
into someone else's head.

173
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,300
Two is to put someone else's money...

174
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,500
into your own pocket.

175
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,300
Look at you.

176
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,339
You've done both.

177
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:45,699
Really?

178
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,740
Just now, you were...

179
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,740
arguing in the kitchen...

180
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,819
about who manages the money.

181
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,939
You won the argument.

182
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,740
How impressive.

183
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:52,819
I think you...

184
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,579
don't lack the talent for arguing.

185
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:55,939
You just didn't perform well.

186
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,620
If you argue again now,

187
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:58,740
I bet you can win.

188
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:00,100
Okay, okay, that's enough.

189
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,300
That emotional value of yours...

190
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,939
is already maxed out.

191
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,740
Go get busy.

192
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:03,379
Okay.

193
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,579
I got the offer letter

194
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,860
Was the person who hired you blind?

195
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,100
I didn't program you with

196
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
a mockery mode

197
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,220
You programmed me with

198
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Straight male mode

199
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,740
What I just said was the truth

200
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,300
I have a problem now

201
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,139
I can't cook

202
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:29,939
That's simple

203
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,139
I'll send you a few

204
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,300
recipes that don't require high knife skills

205
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,100
and are rough and simple to make

206
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,540
Okay

207
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,060
Send them to my phone

208
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,379
This is for the Science Museum

209
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,939
It's the sample I made

210
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,500
of the intelligent voice system

211
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,819
You carry it up for them

212
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
You deliver it to them

213
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,500
It's too heavy, I can't carry it

214
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,779
I'll go find a security guard

215
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:52,259
Hello

216
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,259
Xingxing

217
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:54,379
Mr. Jin

218
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,620
How is it going?

219
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,540
Is the nanny job going smoothly?

220
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,579
As long as your funding is in place

221
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,620
our company

222
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,980
will soon be able to build

223
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,740
the first robot that knows how to slack off

224
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,060
Slack off

225
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,180
Is slacking off a good thing?

226
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:11,100
Anyway, slacking off at least represents

227
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,019
a high degree of intelligence, right?

228
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,300
Understood

229
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,300
With your Boss Wang

230
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,779
we've already signed a betting agreement

231
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,620
As long as you work as a nanny for a month

232
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,300
without being exposed by the employer

233
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,500
the investment funds will arrive immediately

234
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,740
Okay, thank you

235
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,060
This food is too plain

236
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,299
There's no meat at all

237
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,340
This was prepared based on

238
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,820
data prompts

239
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,299
The glasses you're wearing now

240
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,980
have health monitoring sensors

241
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,139
They monitor in real-time

242
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,500
heart rate during meals

243
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,259
blood pressure

244
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,179
and body fat data

245
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,620
If it detects any

246
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,860
food that endangers health

247
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,259
it will issue a timely warning

248
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,259
Can we eat this?

249
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,179
Please enjoy your meal

250
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:53,779
High temperature warning

251
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:55,860
High temperature warning

252
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,379
It's too hot

253
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,059
It will damage your oral mucosa

254
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:58,620
Let it cool down

255
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,139
High temperature warning

256
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,259
High temperature warning

257
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,179
Excess fat

258
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,299
Excess fat

259
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,340
The vegetable is fine

260
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,179
The dipping sauce is a bit high in calories

261
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,139
After you dip it

262
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:16,940
put it in the warm water

263
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,820
rinse it a bit, then eat it

264
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,700
Then why did you make this dipping sauce?

265
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,580
I was afraid it would be tasteless for you

266
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Isn't that totally redundant?

267
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:24,460
Let's... let's not get angry

268
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:25,059
You're pregnant

269
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,500
It's just that this

270
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,220
can this broadcast play just once?

271
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,700
It's too noisy

272
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,340
Yes

273
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,460
I'll adjust it for you after the meal

274
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:31,419
Also

275
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,139
the items in the house

276
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:35,179
I've reorganized and stored them

277
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,019
If you want to find anything

278
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:38,820
just ask Blackie

279
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,700
Blackie, Blackie

280
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,820
I'm here

281
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,220
Where is the wrench?

282
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:48,940
In the cabinet behind you

283
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:50,299
Third layer of the toolbox

284
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,539
Have you put the wrench back?

285
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,379
Almost.

286
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:15,659
How long is "almost"?

287
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,379
Have you put the wrench back?

288
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,779
I put it back.

289
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,059
Pause in response exceeded two seconds.

290
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:25,340
You are lying.

291
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:26,899
Lei Xingxing!

292
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,379
No...

293
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,059
This voice system...

294
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:33,220
why does it have a lie detector?

295
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,059
If you want to keep the house

296
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,179
tidy at all times,

297
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,779
items must be returned immediately after use.

298
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,820
Simple reminders

299
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,940
do not serve a supervisory purpose.

300
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,899
Have you put the wrench back?

301
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:46,580
Turn it off!

302
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:49,299
You are currently a bit emotional.

303
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,259
Blackie,

304
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,700
tell him a joke first.

305
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,299
Believe it or not, I'll stab you.

306
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:55,820
I do not believe it.

307
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,620
Can you hurry up?

308
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,899
Boss Lei, you wanted to see me?

309
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,419
That smart voice system...

310
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,379
did you tweak it?

311
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:09,899
Why does it have a Mouthy Mode

312
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,019
and a lie detector mode?

313
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,220
I set the voice system

314
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,539
to Self-Discipline Mode.

315
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,740
Human self-discipline is forced out.

316
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:17,379
Okay, okay, okay.

317
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,820
Can you just adjust that mode

318
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,539
again?

319
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:20,299
Sure.

320
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,299
I have a serious question for you.

321
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,779
I'm going to the supermarket to buy groceries.

322
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,259
How can I buy

323
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,059
vegetables with high cost-performance?

324
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:26,820
Is that it?

325
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,019
Did I need to come personally for that?

326
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,419
Just follow the grandpas and grandmas.

327
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,779
Don't write so cursively.

328
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,379
Okay.

329
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,779
You wrote this well.

330
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,299
Hello.

331
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,659
Let me introduce you.

332
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:44,899
This is our previous nanny.

333
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:45,980
She took leave originally,

334
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,299
but now she's back early.

335
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,500
My dad was misdiagnosed by the county hospital.

336
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,019
Made me go there for nothing.

337
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
So, for the previous wages,

338
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,940
do I pay you,

339
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,779
or the platform?

340
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,899
She is a Primitive-type Nanny.

341
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,259
I am a 4th-generation Integrated Nanny.

342
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,659
It's not very reasonable for you to choose this way.

343
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,500
You can't even stir-fry vegetables.

344
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,580
And you call yourself 4th generation?

345
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,580
You... each generation is worse than the last.

346
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,419
You're not even as good as my heel.

347
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,019
I'm sorry.

348
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,419
I have a contract with Qingqing.

349
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,820
You are indeed very excellent.

350
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,220
You won't have trouble finding another employer.

351
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,059
Hurry up and pack your things.

352
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,019
Let's go.

353
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:24,940
Can't go anymore.

354
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:26,820
Oh my god.

355
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,100
What happened?

356
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,379
Dad, what happened to you?

357
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:30,539
Broke my leg.

358
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:32,179
Gonna need two nannies.

359
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,620
What kind of family needs two nannies?

360
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,460
Hold this.

361
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:35,740
Who broke it?

362
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,419
Stepped on my own heel.

363
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,139
Where did you hit it?

364
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:38,580
Oh my goodness.

365
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,179
The ball came, I jumped up,

366
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,580
went for a header, bam, landed,

367
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:42,940
and stepped on my own foot.

368
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,299
Can we have Xiaoxi and Qingqing

369
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,419
wear small baskets on their backs at home?

370
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,779
They always shed hair.

371
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:56,539
If they wear a small basket,

372
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:57,700
the hair can fall directly into it.

373
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,580
Trailing behind my butt every day

374
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,179
picking up hair...

375
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:00,940
it's so annoying.

376
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,139
Being hygienic is good,

377
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,179
but you can't be a germaphobe.

378
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:07,179
Who doesn't shed hair?

379
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,139
How about you cook and I clean?

380
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,259
No.

381
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:23,779
Boss Wang.

382
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,419
Let's pause the nanny work.

383
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,700
Mr. Jin, this morning,

384
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,899
passed away from a sudden heart attack.

385
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:29,700
The betting agreement is cancelled.

386
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,299
I'll arrange a new task for you.

387
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,419
Xingxing,

388
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:43,059
why are you resigning?

389
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,100
The boss who promised to give us

390
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,980
investment for the robot project

391
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:48,860
has passed away.

392
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:52,379
My department,

393
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,460
for innovative enterprises like yours,

394
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,820
has many subsidy policies.

395
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,740
I can help you apply for them.

396
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,539
I work at the District Government.

397
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,059
Right, and also,

398
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:01,539
could you

399
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,659
help us build a

400
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,059
subsidy policy

401
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:05,940
AI Calculator?

402
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:07,539
For innovative enterprises like yours,

403
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,179
just by entering the company name,

404
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,139
you can instantly apply online for

405
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,059
all government subsidies.

406
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:12,940
Is that possible?

407
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,940
We need one-click search,

408
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,700
one-click application,

409
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,340
automatic review, and automatic payment.

410
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,980
It's doable

411
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,779
Why do you want to help me?

412
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:24,419
Me?

413
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,059
Aren't I a public servant?

414
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,899
Right?

415
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,299
And I want to make you a benchmark.

416
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:30,139
Someone like you,

417
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,220
an entrepreneur with low EQ,

418
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,820
if you can succeed with our help,

419
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,659
then other entrepreneurs

420
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,860
have no reason not to succeed.

421
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:35,940
Right.

422
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:37,539
That's good.

423
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,779
This way, while I'm at your home,

424
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,740
I can also test

425
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,860
the robot I developed.

426
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,019
What?

427
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,500
A robot.

428
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:45,580
I agree.

429
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:47,779
Look.

430
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,820
Okay, okay, done, it's a deal.

431
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,580
You handle storage and organization.

432
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,940
I'll handle Circulation Design.

433
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,460
What is Circulation Design?

434
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,340
I'll teach you.

435
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,179
How to organize with more style.

436
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,220
So you only know how to do

437
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,419
work that involves talking?

438
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,580
How is that possible?

439
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,220
Am I not working right now too?

440
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,340
What kind of robot is this?

441
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,179
A fifteen-yuan glass pendant,

442
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,779
it's been wiping it for an hour.

443
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,059
Isn't that just slacking off?

444
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,820
You say it tricked Qingqing

445
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,539
into washing dishes there.

446
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,620
While it does Circulation Design itself?

447
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,779
Isn't that just being lazy?

448
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:23,419
Exactly.

449
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,299
I set it

450
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:24,940
to Mouthy Mode.

451
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,539
Oh my god.

452
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,019
Why are you here again?

453
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,539
You almost scared my left leg lame.

454
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,419
Tomorrow,

455
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,100
it's going to participate in a startup competition.

456
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:32,580
If it wins,

457
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,059
we can get that thing you mentioned,

458
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,059
the one million government tech support fund.

459
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,340
Then why don't you go?

460
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:38,940
I still need to optimize the Subsidy Calculator.

461
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,220
Besides, my eloquence is okay,

462
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:41,139
but my EQ is not.

463
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:43,299
That's quite self-aware.

464
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,059
Self-aware.

465
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,379
Self-aware.

466
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,620
S-Self-aware.

467
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,700
Self-awareness.

468
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,019
S-Self-aware.

469
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,700
Self-awareness.

470
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,940
Yes, self-awareness.

471
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:52,940
A live-in nanny,

472
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,539
sixty percent of what they give the client

473
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,700
should be emotional value.

474
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,460
What kind of

475
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,460
emotional value can you provide me?

476
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,700
If you lose an argument with your husband,

477
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,899
you can use his face towel to wipe your feet.

478
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,899
Your dopamine secretion will also be more vigorous.

479
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,139
What are you laughing at?

480
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,539
Is it that funny?

481
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,779
That's a good idea.

482
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,740
The person who created me once said,

483
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,299
only when technology has warmth

484
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,379
can innovation become a blessing.

485
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:19,940
In my chip, he

486
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:21,220
carved a sentence:

487
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,700
"You are not a cold machine,"

488
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,259
"you also have body temperature."

489
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:27,539
"Because you are always transmitting warmth."

490
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,779
"You took the love others have for children,"

491
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,460
"the love for parents,"

492
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,820
"the love for life,"

493
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,940
"and stored it all in the algorithms,"

494
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,899
"stored it in the chip,"

495
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,580
"stored it in time."

496
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,700
"It became my body temperature,"

497
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,700
"and became your body temperature."

498
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
"His body temperature"

499
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,179
"became the warmth of everyday life."

500
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:00,700
Boss Wang,

501
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:01,779
the online footage

502
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:02,940
has been sent back to headquarters for you.

503
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,420
I'm currently in a meeting abroad.

504
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,579
The experiment this time was very successful.

505
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,940
No one realized you are a robot.

506
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,539
A new mission has been sent to you.

507
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:12,900
Please keep up the good work.

508
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,539
Yes. What new mission?

509
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,539
Attend a parent-teacher meeting for me.

510
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,700
Now,

511
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,660
the only person who knew

512
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,700
that you look exactly like me

513
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,220
is no longer of this world.

514
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:23,059
If this time

515
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,140
you also complete the mission successfully,

516
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,660
I will update you

517
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,579
to a new system version.

518
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,059
Okay.

519
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,859
Received.
