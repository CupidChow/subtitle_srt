1
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,060
Every yak in Xizang has a name.

2
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,780
Can you believe it?

3
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:56,460
Loudima.

4
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:57,060
Donggeimai.

5
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:57,939
Dunzhu Zhuoma.

6
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,979
No, no, no. I'm not talking about them.

7
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,219
But this little guy.

8
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:02,820
I'm going to put an ear tag

9
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,539
on its ear.

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,579
We've been in a standoff

11
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,579
for five minutes and thirteen seconds.

12
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,379
The last time I

13
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:07,659
looked at a cow this seriously

14
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:08,579
was this one.

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,579
And this one.

16
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,019
And... wait, wrong.

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,939
This is the one.

18
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:14,900
Daddy, daddy, I miss you.

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,980
Niu Niu and Niu Niu.

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,500
They've been a constant in my life.

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,579
What does this weird uncle want?

22
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,420
Little Niu Niu.

23
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,859
I'm going to give you an ear tag.

24
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:23,659
It won't hurt at all.

25
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:25,099
I don't believe you.

26
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:26,579
Don't come any closer!

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,579
Be good, be good, be good.

28
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:29,260
Don't come over.

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,659
If you come any closer, I'll...

30
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:31,620
Come on.

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
I... I... I'll fight him!

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,900
Why did I come here?

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,579
Leaving behind my job

34
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:38,900
and Shenzhen, where I lived for over ten years,

35
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,219
to come to Xizang, over three thousand kilometers away,

36
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,939
to wrestle with a yak?

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,019
My name is Zhang Zhaoyuan. I'm from Shenzhen.

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,780
I came to Xizang to promote yak insurance.

39
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:51,260
Zhaoyuan.

40
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,780
The company wants to strengthen

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,620
its insurance operations in Xizang,

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,859
Qinghai, and other regions.

43
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,379
To promote the country's pro-farmer policies,

44
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,980
we need to send our best people

45
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,500
to insure the yaks.

46
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,260
The work will be very challenging.

47
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,140
Are you willing to go?

48
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,980
Sending you

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,579
shows we believe you have the ability

50
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,500
to fight the tough battles

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,420
and create miracles.

52
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,340
Hello.

53
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:25,979
This is

54
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,379
Brother Zhang.

55
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:28,580
This... this is our savior.

56
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,939
The big boss from the Shenzhen headquarters.

57
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,780
Hello, boss.

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,539
I'm not some big boss.

59
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:36,219
We're all just working folks.

60
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:36,860
Hello.

61
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,259
My name is Zhang Zhaoyuan.

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,699
From now on, we're colleagues.

63
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,819
What should I call you?

64
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:42,340
Brother Zhang.

65
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,340
Just call me Hazha.

66
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,620
I'm really just here to provide support.

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,020
I'll be counting on you from now on.

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,419
Of course, of course.

69
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,219
Brother Zhang.

70
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,539
It was too late yesterday,

71
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,139
we didn't have time to chat properly.

72
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,340
You know, we've

73
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:56,419
been working for a few months now.

74
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,699
To be honest,

75
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,219
it's been full of difficulties.

76
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:00,580
I feel like my job

77
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,219
is about to be lost.

78
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,099
You know,

79
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,259
if I really had to leave Xizang,

80
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,699
I'd actually be a bit reluctant.

81
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,460
What specific difficulties are there?

82
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,139
Tell me.

83
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,939
Well, brother.

84
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,939
Let me report to you first.

85
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:11,180
It's like this.

86
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,979
Look.

87
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,819
Our equipment here

88
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:14,939
has been ready for a long time.

89
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:16,699
See, it can display

90
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,020
the yak count, location,

91
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,620
and vital signs.

92
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:21,699
It can show it all.

93
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,020
It's just that the locals

94
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,500
still can't really accept it.

95
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,180
We've done

96
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,139
several rounds of work.

97
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:27,699
The results still aren't good.

98
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:28,419
Right.

99
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,300
But that's not specific enough.

100
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,539
For example, last month,

101
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,379
Wangmu's yak

102
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,259
got eaten by a snow leopard.

103
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,259
I thought to myself,

104
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,139
'Heaven won't let a blind sparrow starve.'

105
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,379
Isn't this a great opportunity

106
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,020
to promote yak insurance?

107
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,099
So the two of us went.

108
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,020
Guess what Wangmu said?

109
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,020
'If it's eaten, it's eaten.'

110
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,860
'That way the snow leopard won't starve.'

111
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,580
I was stunned at the time.

112
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,419
This herder,

113
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,939
she thinks it's just fate.

114
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,219
But the yak can't

115
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,500
just be eaten by a snow leopard, right?

116
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,939
That's exactly what I'm saying.

117
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,539
I understand the basic situation.

118
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,819
But it's okay.

119
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,020
The more difficult it is,

120
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,419
the more challenging it is.

121
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,340
Let me introduce myself.

122
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,939
I'm from the Shenzhen headquarters,

123
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,979
a six-time consecutive "Quarterly Star."

124
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,099
No matter how tough the project,

125
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,979
I can handle it.

126
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,139
In one month's time,

127
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,860
all the yaks in our jurisdiction,

128
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:16,980
one hundred thousand of them,

129
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,660
will be fully insured.

130
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,180
Easy, easy.

131
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,779
Back off, take it easy.

132
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,540
They are family.

133
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,540
They've lived here for decades.

134
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,860
You city folks,

135
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,980
why are you disturbing them?

136
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,060
What's he saying?

137
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,300
Why is he chasing us out?

138
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,180
He's not chasing us out.

139
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,939
He's not chasing us.

140
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,139
We're here to...

141
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,939
protect your money.

142
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,220
With just a piece of paper?

143
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,980
Can you get his dog to stop barking?

144
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:40,779
What's he saying?

145
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,139
Is he cursing at my dog?

146
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,540
Your dog keeps barking.

147
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,740
It's giving me a headache.

148
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,779
Stop barking!

149
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,259
Don't you shout!

150
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,139
You need to be

151
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:49,699
more polite to our client.

152
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,459
He just can't understand

153
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,899
what this thing is.

154
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,339
The state is spending so much money for you.

155
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,899
You'll have security afterwards.

156
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,860
If it's lost, if it dies,

157
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,980
they'll compensate you.

158
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,899
What a great deal!

159
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,100
We're not tricking you.

160
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,540
Brother Zhang is a good man!

161
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,180
You... you just don't get it, do you?

162
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,420
Are you speaking Chinese to me?

163
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:09,860
Brother Zhang.

164
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,939
Here, have a sip.

165
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,860
No need, my altitude sickness is long gone.

166
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:14,819
Which household are we visiting today?

167
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,339
We're going to Grandma Zhuoma's place today.

168
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,379
Let me tell you,

169
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,699
she has a lot of yaks.

170
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:20,620
That's good.

171
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,019
She's just a bit stubborn.

172
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:23,459
What's there to fear about stubbornness?

173
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:24,779
Our policy is so good,

174
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,019
how could we not promote it successfully?

175
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,060
Let's go back to that first scene.

176
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,060
Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang!

177
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,019
Quick, quick, quick! Got it!

178
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,899
Brother Zhang, come quick! Brother Zhang!

179
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,459
Grab it quick!

180
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:38,939
Brother Zhang, come quick! Brother Zhang!

181
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,420
Quick, quick! Don't move, don't move!

182
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,459
Grandma Zhuoma!

183
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,100
No, no, no, don't!

184
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,819
You agreed to the ear tagging!

185
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:50,660
You said it was okay!

186
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,420
Who told you to punch a hole in its ear?

187
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:56,740
Grandma Zhuoma

188
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:57,899
This ear tag is meant to go on the ear.

189
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,259
It can't go anywhere else.

190
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,100
You need to understand.

191
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,459
Then don't put it on.

192
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:02,620
No.

193
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,699
Look at all these yaks behind you.

194
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,139
They all have them.

195
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,459
See how happily they're grazing, full of life.

196
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,139
So much energy.

197
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
They can handle it.

198
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,660
This one can't.

199
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:13,339
It's still young.

200
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,220
It's afraid of pain.

201
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,699
It just called for me to save it.

202
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,420
Called for you to save it.

203
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,100
Yes.

204
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,540
No, Grandma, it's like this...

205
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,779
Look, we get our ears pierced too.

206
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,139
It doesn't hurt, just a quick pinch.

207
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,019
It's over in just a second.

208
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,019
I'm afraid of pain.

209
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,540
I don't get my ears pierced.

210
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,339
And I don't wear earrings.

211
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:32,259
I won't allow it.

212
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,779
Not allowed.

213
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,339
Alright then.

214
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,259
Brother Zhang.

215
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,339
So here's the thing.

216
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,019
Just now, this little calf...

217
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,699
It cried for help.

218
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:42,860
Grandma heard it.

219
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,100
And came over to save it.

220
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,660
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

221
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,660
It called out twice.

222
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,699
She could hear it from that far away?

223
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,899
And she could understand what it said?

224
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:50,779
It's like this for us.

225
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,939
People...

226
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,100
and cattle...

227
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,540
or other animals...

228
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,339
There's this kind of...

229
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,980
It's just a sudden... connection.

230
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,019
I get it.

231
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,939
Telepathy, right?

232
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,939
Yes, telepathy.

233
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:04,699
Bro.

234
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,139
How about this?

235
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,420
Let's just skip this calf.

236
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,100
How can we do that?

237
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,100
We can't make exceptions.

238
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,500
What's this cow's name?

239
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:16,740
What's it called?

240
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,180
Niu Niu.

241
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:18,620
Niu Niu.

242
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,379
It's Niu Niu.

243
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:21,980
I...

244
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,139
I asked for its name.

245
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:24,939
I know it's a cow.

246
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:25,939
Its name is Niu Niu.

247
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,019
It's just called Niu Niu.

248
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:29,699
Yes, Niu Niu.

249
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,180
You name your cattle...

250
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
so casually?

251
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,620
No, not casually.

252
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,300
Its name in the Xizang language...

253
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
is Yake.

254
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,579
Translated into Chinese...

255
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:41,899
it means Niu Niu.

256
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:42,819
Niu Niu.

257
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:43,819
Niu Niu, right?

258
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,180
Yes.

259
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,980
Grandma Zhuoma.

260
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,139
Its name is Niu Niu.

261
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,540
Grandma Zhuoma.

262
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:52,540
Its name is Niu Niu.

263
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
What a coincidence!

264
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:56,779
My daughter's nickname is Niu Niu too.

265
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,740
See? What a coincidence!

266
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,019
So when I see it...

267
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,899
it's like seeing my own daughter.

268
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,860
Think about it.

269
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,339
If I were putting this ear tag on my daughter...

270
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,540
how could I use force?

271
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,860
In a moment, I'll just...

272
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,139
gently...

273
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,740
press it like this.

274
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
It won't hurt at all.

275
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,259
No pain.

276
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,860
Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang! Brother Zhang!

277
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

278
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,420
No, wait.

279
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,379
What on earth did you translate to her?

280
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,860
I just translated exactly what you said.

281
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,899
What did you say? What did you say?

282
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,819
This Grandma Zhuoma...

283
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:24,860
has quite the temper.

284
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,300
What exactly did you tell her?

285
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,420
Did you tell her before...

286
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,740
that buying yak insurance...

287
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,100
protects the herders' interests?

288
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,860
Brother Zhang, I really did say it.

289
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,059
And I said everything I was supposed to.

290
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,500
You have to keep saying it, over and over.

291
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:37,740
We're in insurance.

292
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,059
There's no secret trick, right?

293
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,299
It's just about repeatedly...

294
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,179
putting your message out there.

295
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,059
Doing promotion is like ironing clothes.

296
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,820
You have to push your idea out...

297
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:45,820
and then smooth it back over.

298
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,740
That's how you leave your mark.

299
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:48,659
Yes, bro.

300
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,059
But we don't iron clothes.

301
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,419
It's an analogy.

302
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,500
You know, a metaphor? Understand?

303
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,740
When we first got here...

304
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,019
how much yak insurance had we sold?

305
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,139
And how many head do we have now?

306
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:58,740
That's your ironed clothes.

307
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,259
Right.

308
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,299
That makes sense.

309
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:01,820
We've made progress.

310
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,580
Brother Zhang, you're amazing.

311
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,100
I give you a thumbs up.

312
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,460
Quarterly Star.

313
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,580
Quarterly Star.

314
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,139
Six times.

315
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,419
Brother Zhang, Brother Zhang.

316
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,580
Are you okay?

317
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:15,700
I'm fine.

318
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,700
There's dung.

319
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,539
These wasteful yaks

320
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,659
How can they poop so much?

321
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:30,139
And every single pile is so huge.

322
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,139
What's wrong with big?

323
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,460
You just don't understand.

324
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,659
Yak dung is incredibly useful.

325
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,740
It can fuel fires, boil milk tea.

326
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,940
Build houses, raise courtyard walls.

327
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,299
Be carved into decorations.

328
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,500
Even the food

329
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,139
we Tibetans eat at home

330
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,860
is cooked over yak dung fires.

331
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,500
It tastes delicious.

332
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,100
Bro, what's wrong?

333
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:50,580
Hazha.

334
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,259
You're like a blacksmith burning his own butt.

335
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,019
You can't read the situation.

336
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:54,860
Is now really the time

337
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,220
to talk about food with Brother Zhang?

338
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,980
And is it right for you to mention butts?

339
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:59,500
That's still better than you talking about food!

340
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,899
Brother Zhang just ate that stuff...

341
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,539
Ugh!

342
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,379
Are you two doing this on purpose?

343
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,340
Will you ever stop?

344
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,740
Bro, it wasn't on purpose.

345
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,779
Bro.

346
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:15,419
I'm not lying to you.

347
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,460
Once yak dung is dried out,

348
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,659
it has no smell at all.

349
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,500
Brother Zhang.

350
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,139
If one day

351
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,860
you can accept yak dung,

352
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:31,779
it will prove

353
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,139
you truly understand us.

354
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,860
Old Mou just called to ask

355
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,620
when the two of us are going back.

356
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,500
This rain isn't going to stop

357
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,340
anytime soon.

358
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,779
We'll just... stay here tonight.

359
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:01,899
Sleep here?

360
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:02,580
Yeah.

361
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:03,740
Isn't this nice?

362
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,500
We have everything we need.

363
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,580
Wait, wait.

364
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,019
Wipe your hands.

365
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,740
It's fine.

366
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,899
Alright, alright.

367
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,340
Have some tea to warm up.

368
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,820
Then come take a look for me, quick.

369
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,299
Is this yak Dongrulai

370
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,019
or Kabu?

371
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,139
They all look the same.

372
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,419
This one...

373
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:31,620
This yak

374
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,860
is not Dongrulai.

375
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,019
This is

376
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,059
Daren family's Nuo'er.

377
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,340
It means "treasure."

378
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:39,700
So this is Nuo'er.

379
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,019
Yes, little treasure.

380
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,139
Then look at this one.

381
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
This is Dongrulai, right?

382
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:44,940
Nope.

383
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,740
This is also from the Daren family.

384
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:47,620
Named Gang.

385
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,860
It means "above" or "on top."

386
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,580
As far as I can see,

387
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,659
they all look pretty much the same.

388
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,179
What are you laughing at?

389
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:00,899
Hearing you say that

390
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,259
suddenly makes me think.

391
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,340
You can't tell these yaks apart,

392
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,700
just like us locals

393
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,220
can't understand that

394
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:11,340
policy of yours.

395
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:13,620
Every single character in it,

396
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:14,139
separately,

397
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,179
we recognize.

398
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,500
But when you put those characters together,

399
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,740
we don't understand.

400
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,059
It's leaking over there.

401
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,100
Is that okay?

402
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,700
Let it leak.

403
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,779
It's fine, you're not sleeping there.

404
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,139
We're sleeping here, what's there to fear?

405
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,019
No,

406
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:31,500
your

407
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,580
dung is getting all wet.

408
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,659
This... this...

409
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,460
The dung?

410
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,460
So it gets wet, there's plenty here.

411
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,259
There's lots of dry dung.

412
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:40,940
You know what?

413
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,259
When this dung is dried and burned,

414
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:43,899
it doesn't smell at all.

415
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,740
Right.

416
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,379
It's even a bit fragrant.

417
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,740
Let me tell you,

418
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,500
the yaks here

419
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,740
are all raised on green grass.

420
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:55,100
Completely natural and healthy.

421
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,620
Let me tell you another secret.

422
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:01,500
Some yaks have great taste.

423
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,580
They eat cordyceps.

424
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,379
You know what cordyceps are, right?

425
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,379
Stop bragging.

426
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:08,539
Eating cordyceps?

427
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm really not bragging.

428
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:12,460
This...

429
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:14,019
This here...

430
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,340
Isn't this it? Here.

431
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,340
Bro.

432
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,659
Cor... cordyceps?

433
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,299
This is... this is hay.

434
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:20,899
This... this is hay.

435
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:21,820
Cordyceps, my foot.

436
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,820
I've always been curious,

437
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,259
what kind of place

438
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,139
Shenzhen really is.

439
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,100
And also,

440
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:29,740
you must be

441
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,220
a

442
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,700
really important big shot in Shenzhen.

443
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,139
What big shot am I?

444
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,860
Let me tell you

445
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
what kind of place Shenzhen is.

446
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,139
Shenzhen is a place

447
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,139
where even the air is running.

448
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,899
The air is running?

449
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:44,220
What happens if it stops running?

450
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,659
If you don't run, you fall behind.

451
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:46,940
Fall behind...

452
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:50,860
Life here is

453
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,059
quite different.

454
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,340
Take us, for example.

455
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,220
Every day,

456
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
we ride horses, herd yaks,

457
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:01,179
bask in the sun, drink some butter tea.

458
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,980
When the sun sets,

459
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,100
we return to the tent,

460
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,580
sing and dance.

461
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,059
The days pass a bit slower,

462
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,539
but our hearts are never anxious.

463
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,019
We're not afraid of falling behind at all.

464
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,379
Bro

465
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,019
We've only tagged two thousand.

466
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:28,460
We're so far from the target.

467
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:30,620
I'm the Star of the Quarter.

468
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,779
You have to believe in miracles.

469
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,700
Believe in miracles.

470
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,860
Believe in miracles.

471
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,740
Go faster! I'm chasing you!

472
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,340
Now we put this photo

473
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,620
in this slot.

474
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:43,179
Okay.

475
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,019
It's flying! So cool!

476
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
Every time I see it take off,

477
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,220
I get so excited.

478
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:02,980
Look!

479
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:03,899
You try.

480
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,740
Me? No, no, no.

481
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,019
Believe in yourself. You can do it.

482
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,419
Here.

483
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,139
This one on the left

484
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,779
controls ascent and descent.

485
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,860
The right one controls direction.

486
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,500
I watch you fly it every day.

487
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,860
I've even learned a little.

488
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:18,220
Not bad, you.

489
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,500
It's flying away! It's gone!

490
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,419
Alright, alright.

491
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,899
Fly, fly, fly!

492
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,460
Little Niu Niu.

493
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,500
We meet again.

494
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:37,539
This weird uncle

495
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,659
is trying to trick me again.

496
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,019
I'm a good guy.

497
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,379
Listen to me.

498
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:46,259
If we tag your ear,

499
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,259
if we tag your ear,

500
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,740
and you get lost,

501
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:52,899
we can find you.

502
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,620
If someday, just maybe,

503
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,460
I'm saying just maybe,

504
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,539
if you were to... pass on,

505
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:00,620
how sad and heartbroken Grandma would be.

506
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,500
Let's pick a day

507
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,620
to do it, just a quick little pinch.

508
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:07,980
Zhang.

509
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:10,139
Grandma.

510
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
Yak is a good yak.

511
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:15,860
Life has been hard for him.

512
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,019
His mother died during a difficult birth.

513
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,779
He has no mother to love him.

514
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,299
I love him.

515
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,700
Grandma.

516
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:27,460
Let me show you.

517
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:28,940
Her.

518
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,259
My daughter.

519
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,340
My daughter's name is Niu Niu.

520
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,019
Him.

521
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,740
His name is Niu Niu.

522
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,539
The names are the same.

523
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:41,139
I love her.

524
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:42,740
I protect her.

525
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,860
I love him too.

526
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,100
I protect him.

527
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:47,899
Protect.

528
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,139
Zhang.

529
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:55,779
I understand.

530
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:59,779
I will think carefully about this.
