1
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,600
Director Wang, morning.

2
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,399
Morning.

3
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,679
Since you're here,

4
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,840
help me with some work.

5
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,840
No problem.

6
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,320
I came here to learn from you.

7
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,159
Here's the plan.

8
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,439
I'll read,

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,799
and you copy.

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,519
Alright.

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,560
Before 1980,

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,120
Shenzhen's mangroves covered over 500 hectares.

13
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,840
In 1984,

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,239
a protected area was established,

15
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,640
about over 300 hectares.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,799
That's still a lot left.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,959
In recent years,

18
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,040
due to land reclamation projects

19
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,040
and road construction,

20
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,400
they've been shrinking by 15

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,400
to 20 hectares annually.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,799
I know about those two things.

23
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,599
By the end of 1991,

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,799
the mangrove area was estimated to have shrunk drastically.

25
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,920
Now, the mangroves in your Dasha Village

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,400
are only half of what they were.

27
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,680
These are all expert findings.

28
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,719
Do you think the situation is accurate?

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,359
It should be about right.

30
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,719
Director Wang,

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,200
you say the root of all this

32
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,360
lies with these mangroves.

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,080
I've thought of a

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
permanent solution.

35
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,800
Could we just

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,719
cut down all these mangroves?

37
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,800
We reclaim the land,

38
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,599
create a new environment.

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,919
Enough.

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,919
Let's stop here.

41
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,439
A small token of appreciation.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
Our group's Director Jia asked me

43
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,919
to bring this to you.

44
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,639
It's nothing valuable.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,000
I got it specially for you

46
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,719
from Hong Kong, China.

47
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,719
Is this appropriate?

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
It's not convenient here.

49
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,560
Please,

50
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,400
deliver it to my home.

51
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,080
My fault.

52
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,439
I didn't think it through enough.

53
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,520
I'll come over tonight.

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,680
Do you know where this is?

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,680
Director Wang's home.

56
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:13,639
Home?

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,319
What he wrote for you is

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,599
the address of the Municipal Discipline and Inspection Committee.

59
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,879
Looks like this path is blocked.

60
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,360
I just don't understand.

61
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,240
What's so un-eco-friendly about building?

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
We're not opening factories or polluting.

63
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,360
Which coastal place

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,199
doesn't reclaim land?

65
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,360
Only the mangroves are so darn precious.

66
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:36,960
Director Jia,

67
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,919
there's a situation

68
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,919
I need to report to you.

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,639
These past few days, I took my daughter

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,360
to the mangroves to look for mangrove frogs.

71
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
You know, the croaking kind, those frogs.

72
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,919
The result?

73
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,199
Not a single one.

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,879
They used to be everywhere.

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Do you think this

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,120
has anything to do with the reclamation?

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,199
What connection?

78
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
People can move.

79
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,199
Can't frogs move too?

80
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,080
Right, right, right.

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
Believe me, Pengqian.

82
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,159
This sea must be reclaimed.

83
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,560
The difference is,

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,080
whether others do it or we do it.

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,560
You go and get the villagers' signatures sorted.

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,800
As for other matters,

87
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,960
don't worry about them.

88
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
What about that villagers' petition?

89
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,519
Is it done?

90
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,920
Don't ask. Still four short.

91
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,279
The most troublesome one

92
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,079
is your cousin.

93
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,600
Buy me a drink,

94
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,560
and I'll help you settle it.

95
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
Really?

96
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,519
Good brother,

97
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,959
for life.

98
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,000
Why look for mangrove frogs?

99
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,399
Last time,

100
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,199
when I came with Linlin,

101
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,519
we only found a dead one.

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,800
I promised her

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I'd catch a live one for her to see.

104
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,519
Where am I supposed to find one?

105
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,079
They're all gone.

106
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,920
Chen Pengqian!

107
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,639
Director Wang!

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,639
What brings you here?

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,720
Was this your doing?

110
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,480
What?

111
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Look for yourself.

112
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920
Dumping construction waste into the mangroves.

113
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,519
It's not just polluting the environment,

114
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,279
it's a crime.

115
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
I didn't do this.

116
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,879
Then why are you here?

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,079
I just came to look for mangrove frogs.

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,040
Look for frogs?

119
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,199
Ever since the mangroves

120
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,160
were polluted,

121
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,439
there have been no frogs for a long time.

122
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,759
This matter

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
is inextricably linked to your company.

124
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,000
I will hold them accountable to the end.

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,319
Chen Pengqian,

126
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,120
this is your home.

127
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,759
How can you do this?

128
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,759
Are you worthy of your ancestors?

129
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
Unworthy descendant!

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Is he crazy?

131
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,240
Who is this guy?

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,439
Don't say that.

133
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,240
He's a good person.

134
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,480
An old revolutionary.

135
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,680
I told them to dump it.

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,480
He wants to protect

137
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
that muddy mangrove forest, right?

138
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,720
First, we'll give him a

139
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
"work error."

140
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
Then, wholeheartedly,

141
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,000
spend ten days or half a month

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,879
digging it all out.

143
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,680
By then,

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,879
the mangroves will be dead anyway.

145
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,079
I'm just worried

146
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,199
Director Wang said

147
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,079
he'll investigate to the end.

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,879
What do we do?

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
I've got the fine money ready.

150
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,439
Then there's no problem.

151
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,639
How about those signatures?

152
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,439
How many households left?

153
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,439
In principle, just one left.

154
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,959
That's the toughest one.

155
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,439
Give me some time.

156
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll definitely get it.

157
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,079
Ah Peng.

158
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,279
Ah Peng!

159
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,399
Tao'er.

160
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,160
Get me some water, Linlin.

161
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,439
Have you eaten?

162
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,519
I've eaten.

163
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,000
Drank a lot, huh?

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,639
I'm your benefactor, you know.

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
Listen,

166
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,879
take this paper.

167
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,639
Can I

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,920
work at your company?

169
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,480
Your cousin signed.

170
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,439
The last one in the whole village.

171
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,800
I got him.

172
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,959
Our village is getting demolished!

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,759
I'll live in an apartment!

174
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,879
I'll get a wife!

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,319
Dad.

176
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,639
Will the mangroves be torn down too?

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Of course.

178
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,079
Then when we have a new home,

179
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,240
won't the mangrove frogs have a home?

180
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:12,920
Now this matter

181
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,360
has reached the higher-ups.

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,000
They're urgently calling a coordination meeting.

183
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,000
Take that suit.

184
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,120
Go home and change.

185
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,079
No need.

186
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,439
The clothes you usually give me

187
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,319
are all fine.

188
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
Tomorrow, as the villagers' representative,

189
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,439
you'll need to speak.

190
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Dress more formally.

191
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,759
Me? I have to speak?

192
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
What should I say?

193
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,319
Say why you all signed.

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
Say why we need land reclamation.

195
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,120
Without reclamation,

196
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,360
how can we develop?

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,639
How can ordinary people

198
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,959
live a good life?

199
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,279
Do I really need to teach you this?

200
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,600
Understood.

201
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,079
How was your

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,319
essay writing in middle school?

203
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,079
Should be okay, right?

204
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,439
I was the Chinese class

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,240
representative for a semester.

206
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,199
Good.

207
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,199
Go home today

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,399
and write a speech.

209
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,639
Use genuine emotion.

210
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,199
I'm good at that.

211
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,639
Any word count requirement?

212
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,439
The more detailed, the better.

213
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,199
Okay.

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,759
Pengqian.

215
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,560
Wanting a good life isn't wrong.

216
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,000
After this is done,

217
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,800
the company won't treat you badly.

218
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:16,879
Director Jia.

219
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,040
You've been more than good to me.

220
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,360
Thank you very much.

221
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Wanting a good life isn't wrong.

222
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,480
Ah Tao, then why

223
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,120
can't we see any mangrove frogs?

224
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
For two or three years now,

225
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,120
haven't seen a single one.

226
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,639
It's dead.

227
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,440
Then when we have a new home,

228
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,559
won't the mangrove frogs have a home?

229
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,240
Dumping construction waste in the mangroves

230
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,759
isn't just polluting the environment.

231
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,559
It's a crime.

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,279
This is your home.

233
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,120
How can you do this?

234
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,240
Are you worthy of your ancestors?

235
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,320
Respected leaders,

236
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Let me ask you,

237
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,120
where do you think you're going?

238
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,879
Who sent you?

239
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,519
Stop! Stop the car!

240
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,600
Who sent you?

241
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,240
What's wrong?

242
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,960
Director Wang.

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
A bunch of thugs have surrounded him.

244
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,000
Stop! Stop!

245
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Alright, alright.

246
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,120
Can't persuade a stubborn fool.

247
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:33,480
No,

248
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,279
let's do him a favor.

249
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,000
Be friends later.

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,360
What favor?

251
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,120
How would you help?

252
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,519
He needs to be taught a lesson.

253
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
Prepare your speech well.

254
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,960
The coordination meeting won't wait.

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
Chen Pengqian

256
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,600
This is your home.

257
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,120
By doing this,

258
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,240
are you worthy of your ancestors?

259
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,360
Honorable leaders,

260
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,679
As developers,

261
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,000
we are, of course, very willing

262
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,759
to develop this land.

263
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,039
We want to contribute to Shenzhen's development

264
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,639
and bring benefits to the people.

265
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,840
But the situation now is

266
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,799
that on one hand,

267
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
there is government policy support.

268
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,279
On the other hand,

269
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,159
we cannot force people against their will.

270
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,120
This is the will

271
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,279
of the villager representatives and friends.

272
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,639
Lao Wang, why are you so late?

273
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,159
I'm afraid some people

274
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,159
think I came too early.

275
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
What's going on?

276
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,360
What the heck?

277
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,440
As a responsible enterprise,

278
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,559
we have always placed

279
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,759
great importance on environmental protection.

280
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,600
The ecological report

281
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,759
on your desks

282
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
can fully prove

283
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,240
that the ecological value of the mangroves

284
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,919
has been severely overestimated.

285
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,039
The mangroves

286
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,039
are considered by experts worldwide

287
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,000
to be the green lungs of the ocean.

288
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,559
This report

289
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,559
is simply turning black into white,

290
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,600
a pack of lies!

291
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,039
It says the pollution level

292
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,919
far exceeded the environment's capacity first,

293
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,120
and the mangroves' role

294
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,039
was weakened later.

295
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,639
Alright, alright.

296
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,000
If...

297
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,639
Alright.

298
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,720
If we can draw a line now...

299
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,919
Alright, alright, alright.

300
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,679
Cutting down the mangroves is easy,

301
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
restoring them is almost impossible.

302
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,000
The villagers signed

303
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,080
because they didn't know the truth.

304
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,159
Your modification of the coastline

305
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,519
is completely criminal.

306
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,759
We will never be accomplices.

307
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,120
Dad,

308
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,559
could this be

309
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,240
Shenzhen's last mangrove frog?

310
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,320
If the mangroves are there,

311
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,200
then there must still be mangrove frogs.

312
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,679
Don't you raise fish?

313
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,159
It doesn't make money.

314
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,720
We need to find a way out.

315
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,320
Our family for generations

316
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,440
has relied on this field to live.

317
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,399
I never thought

318
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,799
I would sell it.

319
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,679
The teacher said

320
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,559
next time I should draw her a picture

321
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,679
of the mangroves full of mangrove frogs.

322
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,519
Chen Pengqian,

323
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
you know very well what the situation is.

324
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,240
Tell us the truth.

325
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,000
Alright, alright.

326
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,440
Director Jia's willingness to actively build

327
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,440
Shenzhen

328
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,320
is clear to us.

329
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,799
The Environmental Protection Bureau's

330
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,799
desire to preserve that

331
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,399
mangrove forest

332
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,679
has also been received.

333
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,879
Both sides' reasons

334
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,840
are very substantial.

335
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,039
Xiao Chen.

336
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:07,960
Xiao Chen.

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,399
Please continue speaking

338
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,600
about our villagers' will.

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,559
I...

340
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,639
Continue.

341
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,919
I'm a bit flustered.

342
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know where to start.

343
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,679
Can I... can I...

344
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,639
speak in dialect?

345
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,799
You may.

346
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,399
Well...

347
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,159
There's a saying that goes,

348
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,080
"Live off the mountains, live off the sea."

349
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,559
Our Dasha Village is by the sea.

350
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,120
We're all called fishermen.

351
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,840
I heard that in Fujian,

352
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,480
what do the fishermen worship?

353
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,679
They worship Mazu.

354
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,600
Right?

355
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,200
I've always been thinking,

356
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,399
in our Dasha Village,

357
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,919
what is the god in our hearts?

358
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,559
What is it?

359
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,679
I suddenly remembered my grandfather.

360
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,639
He once told me,

361
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,519
he said Dasha Village is amazing.

362
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,759
Although it's by the sea,

363
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,039
every year in Shenzhen, no matter

364
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,799
how strong the wind, rain, or waves are,

365
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,879
our Dasha Village

366
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,159
has never been affected.

367
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,440
Yes, yes.

368
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,559
He said he knew since he was a child

369
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,159
that at the village entrance by the sea,

370
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,679
there was a large mangrove forest.

371
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,279
The mangrove roots are deep.

372
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,399
No matter how big the storm,

373
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,799
you can't blow them down.

374
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,159
Those trees are dense

375
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,039
and can block

376
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,679
all foreign invasion.

377
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,679
So since he was a child,

378
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,840
sometimes during holidays,

379
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,200
he would light incense

380
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,519
and say thank you,

381
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,080
mangroves, for protecting us.

382
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,360
So I was thinking,

383
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,399
can the mangroves be considered

384
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,720
the god in our hearts?

385
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,519
Well said.

386
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,320
Everyone, wait a moment.

387
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,279
The meaning of what you just said,

388
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,240
I understand.

389
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,399
But,

390
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,679
your upcoming statement,

391
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,000
can it represent

392
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,559
the will of the entire village?

393
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,960
I watched Ah Peng grow up.

394
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,799
What he says,

395
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,080
I believe.

396
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,960
He

397
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,200
can represent our whole village.

398
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,639
Yes, yes, yes.

399
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,000
So your meaning is...

400
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,440
Among all the villages in Shenzhen,

401
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:23,919
Dasha Village's economy

402
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,679
is not considered developed.

403
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,039
I know

404
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,200
this land reclamation project

405
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,440
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

406
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,840
for us, the people of Dasha Village.

407
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,519
Therefore, if our village

408
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,440
needs to relocate entirely,

409
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,200
we are all willing.

410
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,120
If, for the sake of development,

411
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,799
land reclamation is needed in Dasha Village,

412
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,240
our entire village

413
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,279
is also willing.

414
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,360
But if, because of reclamation,

415
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,919
they want to dig up

416
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,480
this mangrove forest

417
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,360
that has protected us for centuries,

418
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,000
I think

419
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,639
I would not agree.

420
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,919
We, the people of Dasha Village,

421
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,720
are a hundred times against it!

422
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,559
No! No! No!

423
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,759
No! No! No!

424
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,279
We must protect our mangroves!

425
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,080
No! No! No!

426
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,399
Ah Peng is right!

427
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,200
We cannot be without the mangroves!

428
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,799
We cannot be without the mangroves!

429
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,360
After the coordination meeting,

430
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,240
the mangroves were preserved.

431
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,559
Our village also moved

432
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,440
into new buildings with better conditions.

433
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,039
To this day,

434
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,200
we still guard this mangrove forest,

435
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,440
guarding our home.
