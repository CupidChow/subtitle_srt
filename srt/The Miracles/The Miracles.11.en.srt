1
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,899
The four sisters are so united.

2
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,340
Muscular and mighty.

3
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,500
Not creepy, refined and gentle.

4
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,820
What are you looking at?

5
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,740
Full of vitality and vigor.

6
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,579
Happily moving into the dorm.

7
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,540
What are you looking at?

8
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,180
What are you looking at?

9
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,859
What are you looking at?

10
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,099
What are you looking at?

11
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,340
What are you looking at?

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,620
This silly deer.

13
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,819
That's my roommate, Datou Wen.

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,099
In the days to come,

15
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,620
he would become my most annoying jerk of a friend,

16
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,859
but also

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,579
the most reliable one.

18
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,219
Through everyone's efforts,

19
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,340
we managed to secure our own dorm room

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,540
in the land-scarce Hong Kong, China.

21
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:40,700
Friend.

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,579
Friend.

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,140
You're a fan of Fatt Gor too?

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,859
Did you know?

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,500
He and I are from the same hometown.

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,420
We even share the same childhood nickname.

27
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:52,739
Both called Xigou.

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,540
Who? Who's a dog?

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,859
I'm the dog.

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,540
Yeah, dog.

31
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,700
Who do you think you're talking to?

32
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,579
Xigou.

33
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:02,260
Touch it.

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,819
I'll take my shirt off and scare you to death.

35
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,980
I'm Xigou.

36
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,180
That hurts, bro.

37
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,860
What a thing to say.

38
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:10,979
Bro.

39
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,419
What about "bro"?

40
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,340
It means

41
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,340
brother.

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,780
Don't you think the two of us

43
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,500
could be like those three,

44
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,419
good brothers?

45
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,139
Looking out for each other.

46
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:29,259
Alright.

47
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,180
I'll be your brother.

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,340
I didn't understand a word of that,

49
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,259
but I like your personality.

50
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,180
Fine.

51
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:40,900
From now on, I've got your back.

52
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,259
It's okay.

53
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,900
Even though I didn't understand a single sentence,

54
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:44,939
just remember this:

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,060
If you have me with you,

56
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,180
you'll definitely pass the exams.

57
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,860
What if we totally misunderstood each other?

58
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,180
Soft laughter brings me warmth.

59
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,900
You charge me up with joy.

60
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,099
Softly saying,

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,099
the long road is almost behind us.

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,900
Finally reaching a bright, sunny day.

63
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,659
Fatt Gor.

64
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,180
Brother Ma.

65
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:40,659
I'm not telling you.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,979
I've been down on my luck for three years,

67
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:44,300
just waiting for one chance.

68
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,500
To prove myself.

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,620
Not to prove to others

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,219
how amazing I am.

71
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,060
Just to tell them

72
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,740
what I've lost,

73
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,500
I'll take it back myself.

74
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,180
The signal is too strong.

75
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,740
All signals are gone.

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,340
Boss.

77
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,699
I'm using low frequency.

78
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,419
That won't work either.

79
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,259
What are you looking at?

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,740
What's it to you?

81
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,540
Even though we were talking past each other,

82
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,100
because of Fatt Gor,

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,019
we understood each other.

84
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:33,860
Sorry, sorry.

85
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,180
Hurry up, what's the holdup?

86
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,660
Ordering takeout is so convenient.

87
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,860
Save a penny where you can.

88
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,500
Why do we have to...

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,060
Move aside, move aside.

90
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,339
Wait, wait, wait.

91
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Sorry, sorry, ma'am.

92
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,500
Excuse me, excuse me.

93
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,860
Iced Yuenyeung.

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,939
Made it myself.

95
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:55,500
Yes, made it myself, myself.

96
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:56,899
I know you two.

97
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,980
You applied to be my graduate students.

98
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,620
Fourteen people applied this year.

99
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,899
I'm only taking two.

100
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,939
Good luck.

101
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,740
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,980
Watched too much Hong Kong, China TV, huh?

103
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,660
So fierce.

104
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,500
Refreshing.

105
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,980
Cool you down.

106
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Oh my goodness.

107
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,339
We both smoothly

108
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,980
got accepted as Teacher He's graduate students.

109
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:50,620
After that,

110
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,060
we successfully became

111
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,980
her PhD students.

112
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,740
We seemed to see

113
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,620
the dawn of victory.

114
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,540
However...

115
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:00,860
Going crazy.

116
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,579
Really going crazy.

117
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,899
Five times.

118
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,060
The thesis got rejected five times.

119
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,819
Do they even want us to graduate?

120
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,660
If we'd known, we shouldn't have

121
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,019
asked The Goddess to be our advisor.

122
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,019
What "Goddess"?

123
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,620
Isn't she The Ice Queen?

124
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,300
You're right.

125
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,899
But don't worry this time.

126
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,100
I asked my mom to go to the temple

127
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,980
and pray for blessings.

128
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,980
I'm sure,

129
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,019
I guarantee,

130
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,100
this time it will definitely pass.

131
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,579
Technology isn't child's play.

132
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,300
You need innovation, but it must be practical.

133
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,899
It's easy to talk when you're not the one doing the work.

134
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,060
What did you say?

135
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,300
I said...

136
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,300
What kind of innovation is this?

137
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,180
What kind of practical application is this?

138
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:39,699
What?

139
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,699
Do you want us to build you a rocket?

140
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,420
Would that make you happy?

141
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,740
We've followed you for five years, boss.

142
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,620
Search the entire school.

143
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,579
How many are there who...

144
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,540
...can live in the lab more than us?

145
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,100
Do you really think staying up all night...

146
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,540
...and living in the lab...

147
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,980
...is all there is to academia?

148
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:52,740
The real difficulty...

149
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,660
...lies in...

150
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,220
...when you're gritting your teeth and persevering...

151
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,420
...you still have to accept...

152
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,540
...being rejected time and again.

153
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,339
The real difficulty...

154
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,620
...is when you think you...

155
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,579
...have already worked hard enough...

156
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,259
...but in the end...

157
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,579
...still no one recognizes you.

158
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,459
It's watching others...

159
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,300
...move faster than you...

160
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,100
...and you still have to force yourself...

161
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,740
...to go slower...

162
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
...and steadier.

163
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,180
We completely understand what you're saying.

164
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,579
We agree with all of it.

165
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,459
Lucy, we know we were wrong.

166
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,899
Actually, Xiaoyu...

167
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,740
...was just a bit too impatient.

168
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,019
What are you in such a hurry for?

169
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,899
Steven Zhou next door...

170
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,660
...his robotics project...

171
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,060
His teacher...

172
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,339
...secured him a spot...

173
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,139
...at an American lab.

174
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,980
He even bought...

175
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,139
...a big house over there.

176
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,220
Do you really think...

177
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
...you can get rich off this?

178
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,100
I won't mentor students like this.

179
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,779
Get out.

180
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,540
Fine, we're leaving.

181
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,300
I don't want to get rich off this.

182
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,980
Why won't you approve it?

183
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:54,699
It's normal to fail.

184
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,579
Lucy?

185
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:56,819
What's wrong?

186
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,740
What happened?

187
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,220
Go, go, go!

188
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,819
What is it?

189
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:00,620
Call an ambulance!

190
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,660
How did this happen?

191
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,740
Why did I have to argue with her?

192
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,699
I just can't control my mouth.

193
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,300
Doctor!

194
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,100
How is she?

195
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,500
It's an intestinal obstruction, but surgery isn't possible yet.

196
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,620
We need to switch to...

197
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,540
...a conservative treatment plan.

198
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,060
Why?

199
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,980
Her intestinal opening is severely narrowed.

200
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,540
The surgical risk is too high.

201
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,660
We recommend conservative treatment first.

202
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,420
Once her inflammation...

203
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
...is under control...

204
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,139
...we'll reassess.

205
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,419
Can't you...

206
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,419
...use a surgical robot?

207
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,580
Surgical robots...

208
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,980
...their force control...

209
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,940
...is still not very stable.

210
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:39,980
They can easily cause...

211
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,139
...secondary injury to the patient.

212
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,019
Thank you.

213
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,419
Unstable...

214
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:49,980
If it's unstable, put our sensor...

215
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,059
...inside the surgical robot.

216
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,700
Then Lucy wouldn't have to suffer.

217
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,100
Right?

218
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,899
Doing tech...

219
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:57,100
...requires innovation...

220
00:08:59,259 --> 00:08:59,899
...and practical application.

221
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:12,340
Wait a second.

222
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,299
This algorithm of yours...

223
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:15,340
...isn't it too conservative?

224
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:15,940
Look.

225
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,620
The response is lagging.

226
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,059
In a medical setting...

227
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,259
...you need real-time monitoring.

228
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,980
Didn't Boss He say...

229
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,700
...to go slower and steadier?

230
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:24,980
I also said...

231
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,340
...time waits for no one.

232
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,740
Look at this.

233
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,580
This competition in Shenzhen...

234
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,299
...has a prize bigger than past project grants...

235
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,100
...combined.

236
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,860
If we win...

237
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,100
...Shenzhen will...

238
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,500
...give us a lot of support.

239
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,940
2018...

240
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:41,779
...Shenzhen City...

241
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,379
...Science and Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition...

242
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,340
...Startup Project Group...

243
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,820
...Third Prize Winner...

244
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,100
Hu Xiaoyu...

245
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,299
Chen Jiawen.

246
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,620
Project Title:

247
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,340
Six-axis Force Sensor...

248
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,940
...Application in Medical Surgery.

249
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,580
Mom, you can't say that.

250
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,059
What do you mean, the longer you study for a PhD, the poorer you get?

251
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,340
I know.

252
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,299
I know Dad's health isn't great.

253
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Just give me two more years.

254
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:04,980
Two years, okay?

255
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,940
The neighbors say, the neighbors say...

256
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,500
Why is it always what the neighbors say?

257
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,860
Well, Spider-Man also said...

258
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,460
With great power comes great responsibility.

259
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,019
Dad.

260
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:13,740
In the future, on Lamma Island's list of famous people...

261
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,220
...right there...

262
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,539
...next to Fatt Gor's name...

263
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,059
...will be your son's.

264
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,500
Am I bragging?

265
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,379
I brag every day.

266
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,460
Dad, Mom.

267
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,820
This time, us brothers...

268
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,740
...must pull off something big.

269
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,500
Why did the power go out too?

270
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,460
You didn't pay the electric bill, did you, bro?

271
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,620
Wasn't it your turn to pay?

272
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:32,740
Did you save the file?

273
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,100
Soon...

274
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,100
...we received...

275
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,620
...Shenzhen's innovation support.

276
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,620
We moved into the tech industrial park for free.

277
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:40,820
It was darn impressive.

278
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,100
But...

279
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,860
These 6mm thick little gadgets

280
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:53,580
always deform

281
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,500
during high-pressure testing.

282
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,820
That's enough for general sensors,

283
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,460
but for surgery,

284
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,899
it's a matter of life and death.

285
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,259
Another two years have passed,

286
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,019
and we have nothing to show for it.

287
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,139
I guessed you'd be here.

288
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:36,620
They all say

289
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,659
Shenzhen is the city of miracles.

290
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,659
Do you still believe in miracles?

291
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:44,659
Next time,

292
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:45,860
it will definitely work.

293
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,500
I believed that a year ago,

294
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,139
but I don't believe it now.

295
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,259
Doing research

296
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,779
isn't about luck.

297
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,019
How about this?

298
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,299
My treat tonight.

299
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,059
Let's go karaoke.

300
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,019
Not in the mood.

301
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,019
*Soft laughter*

302
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,100
*bringing me warmth*

303
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,059
Cut it out.

304
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,059
*You inject high-voltage joy into me*

305
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,019
Stop singing.

306
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,820
Let's go. Stop feeding the dog.

307
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,220
Let's go.

308
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,899
I said cut it out.

309
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,059
I told you I'm not in the mood.

310
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:29,100
Stop messing around, will you?

311
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,779
Why are you getting mad at me?

312
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,100
You think I'm not anxious?

313
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,940
What are you anxious about?

314
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,019
Don't you know?

315
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,299
We only have 1,000 yuan left.

316
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,299
I know that better than you.

317
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,259
Here, take a look.

318
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,500
I just borrowed 2,000 yuan from home.

319
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:42,539
My mom said,

320
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:43,659
if I borrow more, she'll disown me.

321
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,179
What about you?

322
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,340
Amazing. Very amazing.

323
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,179
What do you want me to do?

324
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,899
My dad is sick.

325
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,820
My brother is getting married.

326
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,940
My sister needs to go to school.

327
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,940
So? Do you want me to go home

328
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,340
and keep asking them for money?

329
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,059
This is all I can do!

330
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,539
I can do the legwork. What about you?

331
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,299
Who are you looking down on? I'll do it.

332
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,460
You dare sneak attack me?

333
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,539
You stealing my stuff?

334
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,740
If it's in my hand, it's mine.

335
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,259
It's mine!

336
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:16,980
Your skills are better than mine.

337
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,659
You stay in the lab.

338
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:18,299
I'll be in charge of making money.

339
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:18,899
It's settled then.

340
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,419
No.

341
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,179
Brothers shoulder it together.

342
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:29,379
Okay.

343
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,980
You said it.

344
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:36,299
Brothers...

345
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,779
shoulder it together.

346
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:42,980
Together.

347
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:55,500
Buddy, stop rushing me.

348
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,379
I'm almost there.

349
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,340
What's the rush?

350
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,019
Xiaoyu.

351
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,299
The technical problem you encountered...

352
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:00,059
there's been a breakthrough.

353
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:00,899
Boss.

354
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,259
There's a company in Shenzhen

355
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:02,940
that developed their own

356
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,139
metal 3D printer.

357
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,220
It can make the sensor

358
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,179
casing strength

359
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,500
reach 2,300 megapascals

360
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,220
without deforming.
