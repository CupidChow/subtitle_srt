1
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,020
No, thanks. Thank you.

2
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,460
Don't need it.

3
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,299
This way, please.

4
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,179
Take a look at the menu.

5
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,179
What would you two like to eat?

6
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,380
Where's your boss?

7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,979
Oh, you mean Qiang Ge?

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,659
He drove out.

9
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,260
You know Qiang Ge?

10
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,700
Then we'll wait for him.

11
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,980
Alright, call me if you need anything.

12
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,379
Can we call the police now?

13
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,579
Not yet.

14
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,739
We need to see the person.

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,739
We need to catch them red-handed.

16
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:20,659
That's the only way to get proof.

17
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:21,859
Then...

18
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,260
That clears my name, right?

19
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,900
Let's talk after we find the head.

20
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:26,819
Okay.

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,459
Well, I'm hungry.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,540
Let's eat while we wait.

23
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:31,900
Waiter!

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,019
Hold on a sec.

25
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:35,819
My phone's broken.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,700
Then I don't have any money on my phone.

27
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,780
Coming! What would you two like?

28
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,859
Let's just have some tea first.

29
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:44,659
Bring two cups.

30
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:45,819
Sure.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,379
In your trunk...

32
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,299
...isn't there a cake?

33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,420
Let's eat that.

34
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:54,980
That's for me...

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,299
...to eat with the statue.

36
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,739
You're so stubborn.

37
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,019
Your arm is part of the statue too.

38
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,739
Then eat it with the arm.

39
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:00,939
I need to use the restroom.

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,379
Don't you run off.

41
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,060
Just go already.

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,340
One hundred and five.

43
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,579
I already rounded it down for you.

44
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,379
That'll be one hundred.

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,020
How about rounding off that zero in the middle too?

46
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,099
You mean the fifteen?

47
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,460
That's definitely not possible.

48
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:11,900
You have such a big restaurant here.

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,020
You can't be short this little bit of money.

50
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,740
Boss!

51
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,020
We're running a small business here.

52
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,780
I really can't do that.

53
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,259
It's settled.

54
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,020
Thank you.

55
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,699
Li Ge.

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,020
I...

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,939
A glass of water is free.

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,060
Li Ge.

59
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,699
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

60
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,099
You...

61
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,939
The phone's out of credit.

62
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:28,780
What did you think?

63
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,259
No credit, but you have money to eat?

64
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,300
If I don't eat, I'll starve to death.

65
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,500
Li Ge.

66
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,139
Stop hiding.

67
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,460
I can see you.

68
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,300
There's nowhere left to hide anyway.

69
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,780
Come out and talk.

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,139
Fine, don't come out.

71
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,580
I'm guarding this door all day.

72
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:04,699
Back, back, go back!

73
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,379
Let me tell you something.

74
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,099
Keep pushing me and I'll jump.

75
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:07,860
Go ahead and jump.

76
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,340
Want me to join you?

77
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,539
We'll jump together.

78
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,300
If I really jump, you'll be breaking the law.

79
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,219
If we have a point, let's talk it out.

80
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,219
This is a society governed by law.

81
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,660
So you *do* know it's a society governed by law.

82
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,699
Hurry up.

83
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,100
Give me the project payment.

84
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,060
I already told you.

85
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,620
Give me a couple more days.

86
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,579
I'll definitely give it to you.

87
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,540
*You* want more time?

88
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:24,500
Do you know my situation?

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,300
You know perfectly well.

90
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,540
That's my life-saving money.

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,339
I know.

92
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,779
That project fell through!

93
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,620
I don't have any money either.

94
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,139
Alright, let's stop the nonsense.

95
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:32,660
If I don't see the money today,

96
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,339
you're not going anywhere.

97
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,379
I finally see you for who you are.

98
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,060
You...

99
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,939
You're just a big liar.

100
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,420
Who's there?

101
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,939
It's me.

102
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,740
What are you doing?

103
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,660
Stealing my bike is one thing,

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,540
but you didn't even take the key?

105
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,819
Planning to share it with the whole world?

106
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:43,939
Get up first.

107
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,100
You're a big liar.

108
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,540
Let go of me, now!

109
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,819
Excuse me for interrupting.

110
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,259
Warrior,

111
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,379
although I don't know

112
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,259
which construction site you're from,

113
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,459
but I'm deeply grateful.

114
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,060
You'll be the first to get paid.

115
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:54,980
Thank you.

116
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,980
Don't you leave!

117
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,819
Get back here!

118
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:01,819
What's going on?

119
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,339
That's enough.

120
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:07,699
I... I was just...

121
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:09,740
It was all a misunderstanding.

122
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:11,459
You...

123
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:13,939
Do you know...

124
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,579
Do you know, to raise the money

125
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,379
for my brother's surgery,

126
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,819
we sold our family home?

127
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:18,939
These past few months in Shenzhen,

128
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,019
I've done every job imaginable.

129
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,939
I was so close to having enough,

130
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,939
then that swindler...

131
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,939
If I weren't at the end of my rope,

132
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,060
I would never have thought

133
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,459
to take your arm.

134
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,420
There's no need

135
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,579
to keep arguing, right?

136
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:30,939
If you keep this up,

137
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:31,939
you'll make me feel guilty.

138
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,180
I already apologized to you!

139
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,740
You *should* feel guilty.

140
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,019
If it weren't for you,

141
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,220
that Li guy wouldn't have gotten away.

142
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,459
You even used my phone

143
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:39,139
to unlock a shared bike.

144
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,180
And you didn't even lock it!

145
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,819
You rode my motorcycle

146
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:41,699
and didn't take the key either!

147
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,379
And you think *you're* in the right?

148
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,139
This whole night tonight,

149
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,259
all this trouble,

150
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:48,100
is because of looking for your stupid head.

151
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:48,779
I just don't understand

152
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:49,620
why you absolutely have to

153
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,459
find that stupid head of yours.

154
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,540
What stupid head? What do you mean stupid head?

155
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,259
Stop emphasizing the word "stupid."

156
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:53,819
Okay?

157
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,259
That's *my* head. Mine.

158
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,579
Your head is on your shoulders, man.

159
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:57,540
Don't twist my words.

160
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,660
That sculpture

161
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,379
is the greatest honor

162
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,339
of my entire life.

163
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,420
That head

164
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,220
is also the source of my confidence.

165
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,139
That year...

166
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,500
Who wants to hear your story?

167
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
What are you doing?

168
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,459
I had it right on the tip of my tongue.

169
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:18,860
No,

170
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:19,699
what's wrong with listening?

171
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,019
I've never told anyone else.

172
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,100
Then tell it, tell it, go ahead.

173
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,579
We've got nothing better to do anyway.

174
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,579
That year...

175
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,139
I had also just arrived in Shenzhen.

176
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,139
Li Junrong, what are you thinking about?

177
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Hurry up and find the owner.

178
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:16,660
Teacher Su,

179
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,459
we're still one person short.

180
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,259
What kind of person are you looking for?

181
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:24,259
Artistic creation can't be rushed.

182
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:24,339
Artistic creation can't be rushed.

183
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,019
You need to have inspiration.

184
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,459
This is exactly what I've been looking for.

185
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,819
The last one in Shenzhen.

186
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,860
Image of a migrant worker.

187
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:41,300
So, teacher.

188
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,259
What are we waiting for now?

189
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,420
Waiting for him to finish his call.

190
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,259
This... that... this bag.

191
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,540
Don't know who left it here.

192
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,180
I... I was calling to report it.

193
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,660
It's you.

194
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,420
Wh-what do you mean, me?

195
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,139
See?

196
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,180
Returns what he finds, and is genuine inside and out.

197
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,060
He's the one.

198
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,180
I'm a teacher from the Sculpture Academy.

199
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm working on "A Day in the Life of Shenzhen."

200
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,100
This theme.

201
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,420
Looking for inspiration.

202
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,420
We plan to.

203
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,660
Make a bronze statue of you.

204
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,100
Do you agree?

205
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,019
Ever since I was little.

206
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,180
Back in school.

207
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,939
I never got a certificate of merit.

208
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,459
When I grew up.

209
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,740
And started working.

210
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,740
I never got a bonus either.

211
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,300
In my whole life.

212
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,620
I've never even won.

213
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,699
A "win another bottle" prize.

214
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:28,620
This statue.

215
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,300
Is the only affirmation.

216
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,059
This world has ever given me.

217
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,299
Do you understand?

218
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,539
Do you know how important this is to me?

219
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,700
You're still so young.

220
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,940
You can't keep living in the past.

221
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,580
You have to look forward.

222
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,059
Where are you going?

223
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,539
To find your head for you.

224
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:53,700
How much more do you need for your brother's surgery?

225
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,340
Still need eighty thousand.

226
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,299
Eighty thousand.

227
00:08:58,659 --> 00:08:59,700
That's not a small amount.

228
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:01,700
Alright.

229
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,340
Figure it out yourself.

230
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:06,299
Wait, you...

231
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,419
I... I thought you would...

232
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,779
No, it's...

233
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,259
Forget it.

234
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:11,100
Let's find the head.

235
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,299
Then I'm sorry, sorry.

236
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,659
Let's go.

237
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:19,539
Qiang Ge.

238
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,059
Is this your vehicle?

239
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:21,940
Yeah.

240
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,340
I usually use it to pick up goods.

241
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,059
Do you normally have.

242
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,379
A three-wheeled cart here.

243
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:29,019
With "Four Seasons Food Stall" written on it?

244
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:29,940
No.

245
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,460
Liar.

246
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,779
We're not the police.

247
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:34,419
But.

248
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,659
Tonight, there was a witness.

249
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,820
Who saw you at the Sculpture Park.

250
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,059
Steal a bronze head.

251
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,059
What head?

252
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,539
Bronze head, bronze head!

253
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,419
At the Sculpture Park.

254
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:43,940
I saw it.

255
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,620
Was that you or not?

256
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,139
What nonsense!

257
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:46,779
I don't even know.

258
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:48,259
Our family has never.

259
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,779
Had an electric three-wheeler.

260
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,220
Yeah.

261
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,460
Haven't seen A-Qiang with a three-wheeler.

262
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:53,940
A gang.

263
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:55,700
If you... you're going to be like this.

264
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,820
Then... then I'm calling the police.

265
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,179
Go ahead.

266
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,539
I'll call, I'll just...

267
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,620
I... I'll... I...

268
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,419
What? Want me to call for you?

269
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,419
Alright, alright.

270
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:02,100
You do it.

271
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,820
Let's talk over here.

272
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,259
Okay, okay, okay.

273
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:03,980
Let him make the call.

274
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,500
Come on, you dial.

275
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,259
Come on, come on.

276
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:05,820
Hold on, don't rush to call the police.

277
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,500
Hold on, don't rush to call the police.

278
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,860
He doesn't seem like he's lying.

279
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:09,740
And those customers.

280
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,980
Wouldn't help him lie either, right?

281
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,860
So what do you think?

282
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,700
I suddenly thought of another possibility.

283
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,820
That sculptor is lying.

284
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:40,899
He's here, Boss Hu.

285
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:41,899
Where's the kid?

286
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,539
His mom picked him up.

287
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:45,899
Where's the stuff?

288
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,100
It's inside.

289
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,740
Boss Hu.

290
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,659
We gotta stick to the deal.

291
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:51,820
Seventy-nine per kilo.

292
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,460
C-come on, lower it a bit.

293
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:54,740
I really can't go any lower.

294
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,700
But I've got a head.

295
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
I can give it to you for sixty.

296
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:58,340
Wait.

297
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,259
Why's the head so cheap?

298
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:00,539
It's ugly.

299
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
You think that boss...

300
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,259
...might want to destroy...

301
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,379
...all things beautiful...

302
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,379
...because he failed...

303
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,500
...the art school exam?

304
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:12,620
I don't know about him.

305
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:13,740
But do you have some...

306
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
...misunderstanding about beauty?

307
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,100
Don't you talk.

308
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,179
Stop talking.

309
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,460
This is way too ugly.

310
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:18,899
Yeah.

311
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,059
That's why it's cheap, bro.

312
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,220
I'll admit...

313
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,860
...I admit it's bronze material.

314
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,059
But this thing...

315
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,740
I really have no way...

316
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
...to take it as bronze, man.

317
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,379
No, bro.

318
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:28,899
You... do this.

319
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,419
Doesn't this look much better?

320
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,940
You're making this really hard for me.

321
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,419
Just sell it with a cloth over it, bro.

322
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,419
This, this, this...

323
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,500
I'll give it to you, free, free.

324
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,860
Don't pull this again next time.

325
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,220
Call the cops! Cops! Cops!

326
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,940
Okay, okay, okay!

327
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Darn it, darn it, darn it!

328
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:45,980
My phone's dead.

329
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,220
Tell me the truth.

330
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:51,899
Are you in on this with them?

331
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,259
How could I be?

332
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,620
I'm just unlucky.

333
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,580
Every time it's crucial...

334
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,539
...my phone dies.

335
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,019
If I go out for noodles...

336
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,220
...I'm definitely wearing white.

337
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,500
If I rush to the bathroom...

338
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,620
...I for sure have no tissue.

339
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,580
It's always like this for me.

340
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,740
I get that a lot too.

341
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,340
In the mall...

342
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,139
...when using the restroom...

343
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,980
...I find every time I grab...

344
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,899
...it's the last bit of paper.

345
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,620
Does that happen to you?

346
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:09,460
It does! It does! Yes!

347
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,220
Have you ever been running...

348
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,019
...and suddenly need to burp...

349
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,580
...then a pretty girl comes your way?

350
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,779
You know when you're running...

351
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:14,500
...you can't hold a burp in.

352
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,340
If you run past her...

353
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:16,259
...you'll burp non-stop.

354
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,379
Leaving an air of awkwardness.

355
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,379
If you don't run past...

356
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:19,100
...and just stop suddenly...

357
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:19,820
...the girl will think...

358
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,620
...you're a creep.

359
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,860
At that moment, you...

360
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,340
...follow her.

361
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:43,139
Brothers

362
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,659
Enjoying your food and drinks?

363
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,100
Come on, gather around.

364
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,059
I need to say something.

365
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,259
Who are you?

366
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,100
Hey, you're sitting there talking

367
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,740
is that appropriate with me?

368
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,379
You stand up!

369
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,259
No, no, no, don't move.

370
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,059
Seriously, who are you?

371
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,299
Who am I?

372
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,100
I heard

373
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,259
you pay top dollar for fencing here.

374
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,899
I've got some bronze, you want it?

375
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,860
Fencing?

376
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,220
Haven't heard that term in years.

377
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,820
Wait, who told you that?

378
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:17,539
It was

379
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,379
that boss who likes to paint.

380
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,259
Yuan Zai.

381
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,220
Right.

382
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:22,139
I knew it was him.

383
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,259
He can't keep his mouth shut.

384
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,539
Let's settle on a price first.

385
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,539
I'll give you sixty at most.

386
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,259
Yuan Zai said seventy-nine.

387
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,580
Why are you shouting? Stop shouting!

388
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:37,019
That's way too low.

389
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,820
Who's in charge here, him or me?

390
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,220
Sixty, take it or leave it.

391
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,340
Come on, negotiate a bit.

392
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,379
How about seventy?

393
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,019
Sixty-five.

394
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:43,620
Sixty-seven.

395
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,019
Should be sixty-six now.

396
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,139
Sixty-six.

397
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:46,820
Sixty-six fifty.

398
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,259
Are you here to break my bills?

399
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,019
Who are you?

400
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:54,779
It's me.

401
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,019
Remember me?

402
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,419
You are...?

403
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,059
Nineteen eighty-four.

404
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,100
Changbai Mountain.

405
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,860
There was a heavy snowfall.

406
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,259
My mother

407
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:10,779
in that snowstorm,

408
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,379
gave birth to you.

409
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,379
Do you both think I'm an idiot?

410
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,100
Let me tell you,

411
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,220
this thing isn't worth much.

412
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,259
But he also said

413
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,340
this is a fencing spot.

414
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:23,299
If I lose something here,

415
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,460
I lose all my face.

416
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,259
Alright.

417
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,379
Let's see if its head is harder

418
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:27,019
or your head is harder.

419
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,379
Run! Run!

420
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:32,980
Don't come over! Don't!

421
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,059
Nobody come any closer!

422
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:34,700
Beat him to death!

423
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,379
Beat him to a pulp!

424
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:42,980
Stop hitting him!

425
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,340
You already have the head.

426
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,220
Why did you come back?

427
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,860
Don't worry about me.

428
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,899
This...

429
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:54,460
Brother.

430
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,500
This head is very important to me.

431
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,379
So I had to trespass.

432
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:01,419
But now, I don't want it anymore.

433
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,419
Here.

434
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,860
Let my brother go.

435
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,379
Okay?

436
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:06,100
This head...

437
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:07,379
is not important to me.

438
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,620
I can give it to you.

439
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,379
But my face is very important to me.

440
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,139
Beat them both to death!

441
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:25,820
Stop!

442
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,259
Don't move! Don't move!

443
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,259
I just said,

444
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,019
you already had the head.

445
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,379
Why did you come back?

446
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,740
Aren't you supposed to look forward?

447
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,860
Why worry about my head?

448
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,100
Isn't this your glory?

449
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,139
What's your blood type?

450
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:05,419
I'm type A.

451
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,019
I'm AB.

452
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:09,580
Then if you hemorrhage, I can save you.

453
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,220
But I can't save you.

454
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,620
Then I shouldn't have

455
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,980
gone to sleep in that park.

456
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,779
My timing was just right.

457
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,259
In the future, when you have a problem,

458
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,379
you must immediately

459
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:29,980
choose to call the police.

460
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,059
Actions like yours,

461
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,820
solving the case yourselves,

462
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,860
are absolutely unacceptable.

463
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,460
Yes, yes, yes.

464
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,580
We accept the criticism and education.

465
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:36,860
Fortunately, a concerned citizen

466
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,139
was walking in the park at night

467
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,500
and promptly discovered the damaged statue.

468
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,100
They chose to call the police immediately.

469
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,379
Otherwise, who knows

470
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,340
what danger you might have faced.

471
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,299
Right.

472
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,100
Sorry.

473
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,259
We caused you trouble.

474
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,259
But thanks to you,

475
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,379
we were able to bust

476
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,419
an underground fencing den.

477
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,259
That deserves praise.

478
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,659
By the way,

479
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:53,500
do you need a police car

480
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,100
to take you back?

481
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:54,980
No, no, no.

482
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,379
We, we can walk ourselves.

483
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:56,779
Yes, yes, yes.

484
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:57,259
You're busy, you're busy.

485
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:57,700
Alright.

486
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,220
I guess repairing this statue

487
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,259
will take a while, right?

488
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,859
Doesn't matter anymore.

489
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,059
I'm hungry.

490
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:06,900
Let's go get something to eat.

491
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,099
Eat what? Neither of us has any money.

492
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,099
I have a birthday cake.

493
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,220
Speaking of which,

494
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,460
I haven't wished you a happy birthday yet.

495
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,460
Thanks.

496
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,099
When my phone is fixed,

497
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,460
I'll transfer you 73,621.

498
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,059
Why is this amount so specific?

499
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,500
Because that's all the money in my card.

500
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,140
But you have to pay me back.

501
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,099
If you don't,

502
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:28,859
just call the police.
