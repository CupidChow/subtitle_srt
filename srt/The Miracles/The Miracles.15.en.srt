1
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,599
How are you doing?

2
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,400
Are you okay?

3
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,560
Was this sign just here?

4
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,280
Yes, it's always been here.

5
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,519
You're lying through your teeth.

6
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,239
You just now, this sign...

7
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,200
...was not here, okay?

8
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,000
What?

9
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,879
Were you just...

10
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,879
...taking it out from inside?

11
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,319
Excuse me.

12
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,040
No.

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,959
See? Look.

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,159
He's perfectly fine.

15
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,280
Don't talk nonsense.

16
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,879
If the boss finds out, I'll get fined.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,879
Watch where you're going.

18
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,239
Why are you looking at your phone?

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,239
I already told you.

20
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,159
You just wouldn't believe me.

21
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,200
So what could I do?

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
How could I have known?

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,719
I really don't get it.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Better luck next time.

25
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,959
Stop. The interview just ended.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,280
I don't know what to say.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
He started by asking my salary expectation.

28
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,879
I've never been to Shenzhen before.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,319
And I've never done sales.

30
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,200
And I've only been here a few days.

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
So of course I didn't know.

32
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,159
What do you think?

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,039
I know.

34
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,879
But last month...

35
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,319
...you got eighty points, right?

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,479
How come it's only seventy this month?

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,919
What's going on?

38
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,039
What do you mean, "what's going on"?

39
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,199
This is what's going on.

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,159
And let me tell you...

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,400
...the other candidates just now...

42
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,960
...all had at least a bachelor's degree.

43
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,719
How can I compete with that?

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,840
I'll hang out for a couple days and go back.

45
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,960
It's such a trivial thing.

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,039
And you're already crestfallen.

47
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,400
The worst part is...

48
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,759
...this morning...

49
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,879
...I slipped and fell in the bathroom.

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,479
A cleaning lady...

51
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,479
Forget it.

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
She wouldn't admit it anyway.

53
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,360
Alright.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
A bad workman blames his tools.

55
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,479
Gotta go.

56
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,120
Here.

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,800
What's this?

58
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
All the job openings in this building are here.

59
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,960
There are some resumes in there too.

60
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,319
Look at how theirs are done.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,759
So professional.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,120
Yours isn't up to par.

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,599
I mean, not every company...

64
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,840
...requires a diploma.

65
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
Just try them one by one.

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
I collected all these...

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
...for my son.

68
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,560
He graduates high school next year.

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
I was thinking, just in case...

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,879
...if he doesn't get into college...

71
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,439
...I'd let him come to Shenzhen to try his luck.

72
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm giving them to you.

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,360
I can't take these.

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,919
Zhang Lifen!

75
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,319
The cigarette butts on the 16th floor hallway...

76
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,879
...deal with them now!

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,520
So annoying.

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,360
Everything lands on me.

79
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,199
Okay.

80
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,120
Coming right away.

81
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,520
Eighth floor.

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,000
Going up.

83
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,120
Excuse me.

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,960
Sorry, let me through.

85
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,439
Coming through.

86
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,800
Thanks. Sorry about that.

87
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Good luck.

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,639
Hello.

89
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,879
I'm here for an interview.

90
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,960
My resume.

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,120
Hello.

92
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,000
Excuse me, may I ask...

93
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,360
...Thirteen Tuo?

94
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,839
Do a good job. Don't make a mess.

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,560
Got it.

96
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,879
Slacking off while on duty?

97
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,160
Oh my!

98
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,959
What are you doing here?

99
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,920
Found a job?

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,839
Not bad. Impressive.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,680
Alright then.

102
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,399
So your name is Li Lei too?

103
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,920
My son is also named Li Lei.

104
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,959
Your son is also named Li Lei?

105
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,439
Yeah, what a coincidence.

106
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,959
That is quite a coincidence.

107
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,040
Too much of a coincidence.

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Then we also have...

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
...a mutual classmate.

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,920
Named Han Meimei.

111
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,240
Han what?

112
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,879
Anyway, my name...

113
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,639
...people always say...

114
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,560
...it's very common.

115
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,879
Common? Nonsense.

116
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,240
I chose my son's name.

117
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
How strong, how resounding it is!

118
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,360
Full of grandeur.

119
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,920
Li Lei, Li Lei!

120
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,959
Hou Sai Lei! (So awesome!)

121
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,279
Hou Sai Lei!

122
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay.

123
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,879
Well, I just wanted to let you know.

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm off.

125
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Let me take a picture.

126
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,040
I'll show it to our Little Lei later...

127
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,920
...so he can also see...

128
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,439
...the Li Lei of Shenzhen.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
The aroma is just pouring out.

130
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,160
Yeah.

131
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,720
Your noodles...

132
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,519
there's so much.

133
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,600
I just love hearing your jokes.

134
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Um, is Auntie Fen here?

135
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,360
Auntie Fen!

136
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:39,879
Coming!

137
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,199
I thought you weren't coming.

138
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,959
Come on, come on.

139
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,040
Let me introduce everyone.

140
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
This is the one I told you about,

141
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,480
who shares the same name as my son.

142
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,519
That's Li Lei.

143
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,040
Why are there so many people?

144
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,120
And even foreign friends.

145
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:50,959
Carrot Top.

146
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,160
What's your company called again?

147
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,120
My English isn't good.

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,720
Introduce yourself.

149
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,279
Hello.

150
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,920
BTS.

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Hello, handsome.

152
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,839
That's Cantonese.

153
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,959
Hello.

154
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,120
I'm from Gang Da Hui on the eighth floor.

155
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,600
Great.

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Here's my business card.

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,839
Come down for a visit sometime.

158
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Okay, sure.

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,279
Good, of course.

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,879
Come on, cheers! Happy New Year!

161
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,360
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

162
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,360
Happy New Year.

163
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Want some chili?

164
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:12,959
No.

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
I can't handle much spice.

166
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,000
Did you call your parents?

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,800
Just did.

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,600
What about you?

169
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,959
Why aren't you going home for the holiday?

170
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,680
There's overtime pay for Spring Festival.

171
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,279
Besides, after the holiday,

172
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,040
I'll go back.

173
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:24,839
Thanks.

174
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,120
What do you mean, you're leaving?

175
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,160
Going back to Harbin.

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
My son is about to take the college entrance exam.

177
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,639
At a time like this,

178
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,800
I need to go back and be with him.

179
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,959
What about his father?

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,279
He's been gone for many years.

181
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,199
After this meal,

182
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,399
we'll be saying goodbye.

183
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,959
Li Lei! Li Lei!

184
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,680
The beef is ready.

185
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,240
Okay.

186
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,000
Coming!

187
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,040
Did you pack everything?

188
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,360
Not much to pack.

189
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,279
Here, this is for you.

190
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,720
What is it?

191
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,879
The good luck you gave me six months ago.

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,079
Oh my goodness.

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,519
You still have it.

194
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,720
During this time,

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,959
I gathered some new ones.

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Take them back with you.

197
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,680
Give them to Little Lei.

198
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,360
Pass this good luck on to you too.

199
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,079
Wait a second.

200
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,959
I need to take a picture.

201
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,279
Look at our Li Lei from Shenzhen,

202
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,279
who went from intern to big manager.

203
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,240
So awesome.

204
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,160
Go on back now.

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,879
I won't see you off then.

206
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,639
No need.

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,279
Li Lei.

208
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,399
Don't forget.

209
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,800
Li Lei! Li Lei!

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,279
Hou Sai Lei!

211
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,480
No problem.

212
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,319
I'm off.

213
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
Eleventh floor.

214
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,120
Everyone, settle down.

215
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,800
Settle down.

216
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,279
Alright. Welcome again, everyone.

217
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,879
To our opening ceremony.

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,240
This year,

219
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,399
is actually the third year

220
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
that A Shuo, Meihe, and I,

221
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,879
have been in business together.

222
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
For me personally,

223
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,720
it's also

224
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
the third time

225
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,800
I've changed

226
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,720
my office floor in this building.

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,199
Our first product

228
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,120
successfully collaborated with

229
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,800
Carrot Top's BTS Company.

230
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,720
And we secured

231
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
our first million-yuan order.

232
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,560
These past two years, we were also

233
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,639
fortunate enough to catch

234
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,600
the e-commerce wave.

235
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,600
We will also stride

236
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,360
towards more and better

237
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,279
avenues of business.

238
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,920
Let's go!

239
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

240
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,240
It was Auntie Fen

241
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,399
who told me to apply here.

242
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,720
Said you're a good person, doing well.

243
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
There's definitely a chance.

244
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,160
Thanks.

245
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,480
Auntie Fen?

246
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,519
Which Auntie Fen?

247
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,039
Auntie Lifen.

248
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,480
Zhang Lifen.

249
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,600
My fellow villager.

250
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,600
Where is she now?

251
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,159
I called her before,

252
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,120
but the number's disconnected.

253
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,679
She's right here in Shenzhen.

254
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,000
In Bao'an district.

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,120
Works at a mall there.

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,639
Who started it, you or me?

257
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,720
Make it clear.

258
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,399
I hit on you?

259
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,279
Why are you hitting me?

260
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:50,799
You're not human!

261
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,120
You little bastard!

262
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,039
What do you take me for?

263
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,480
You're a crazy woman!

264
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,720
How dare you hit me!

265
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,600
You call me a crazy woman?

266
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,639
I'll beat you to death, you shameless jerk!

267
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,240
Zhang Lifen!

268
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,600
You look decent enough,

269
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,919
why don't you act like a decent person?

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,600
Don't come in tomorrow.

271
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,279
Stop the cursing!

272
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,039
You shameless jerk!

273
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,399
It's all because of you!

274
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:07,799
Sister Fen, let's go.

275
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,200
I know you!

276
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,360
Fine, fine, fine!

277
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm telling you, I'm not done with you!

278
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,840
You're insane!

279
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,399
Let's go.

280
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,799
I'm telling you, fine!

281
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,399
I'm not done with you!

282
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:15,840
Alright.

283
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,639
That scumbag has a wife at home.

284
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,639
He's been lying to me all along.

285
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,000
He told me his wife was dead.

286
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,799
Today I got a call.

287
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,360
It was a woman.

288
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,919
Darn it, then he told me it was his mom.

289
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,519
My whole life,

290
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,399
I've lived cleanly.

291
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,320
How come, in my old age,

292
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,240
I've become the other woman?

293
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,639
Well, well, Sister Fen.

294
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,799
So all those years you disappeared,

295
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,320
you were off having a romance.

296
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,000
I've been a widow for so long.

297
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,399
Is it wrong to find a partner?

298
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,919
Didn't Shi Tiesheng say,

299
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,960
love is the redemption of life?

300
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
All those years copying poems weren't wasted.

301
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,279
Why did you come to Bao'an?

302
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,360
You came back to Shenzhen and didn't tell me.

303
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,320
Didn't even call.

304
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,279
I have my sources.

305
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,279
Knew you were doing well.

306
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,799
Didn't want to mooch off you.

307
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,279
What do you mean, mooch off me?

308
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,279
What kind of talk is that?

309
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,480
It's been six or seven years in a flash,

310
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,200
since we last saw each other.

311
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,399
Six years.

312
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,879
My son

313
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,600
went to university in Sichuan.

314
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Now he's settled there.

315
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,519
Really?

316
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,679
Actually, I wanted to come back then.

317
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,919
But then my mom

318
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,039
had a stroke, I took care of her for years.

319
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,080
Then recently, she passed away.

320
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,720
So I came back.

321
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,399
So then,

322
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,679
come work for me.

323
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,799
Help with logistics and stuff.

324
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,639
No, no, I won't go.

325
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Don't want to be a bother.

326
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,039
Now I'm just one person to feed.

327
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,759
No family to worry about.

328
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,399
I can support myself anywhere.

329
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:53,440
Hello?

330
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,720
Hello? Hi, food delivery.

331
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,799
Where are you?

332
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,480
See the park here?

333
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,559
Come.

334
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,399
Check the size.

335
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,159
See if it fits.

336
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,879
That old lady style,

337
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,039
I don't like it.

338
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,240
I'll throw it away.

339
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
No, no, no! How much? I'll pay you.

340
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,759
Here.

341
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:19,639
Oh my god.

342
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,799
We don't have each other on WeChat.

343
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,360
Oh, geez.

344
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,480
Right?

345
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,759
Let's add each other, quick.

346
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,679
Eleventh floor.

347
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,639
Manager Li.

348
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,399
Morning.

349
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,639
Manager Li! Manager Li!

350
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,399
What's going on?

351
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm now in charge

352
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
of your floor.

353
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,000
From now on, if Boss Li needs anything,

354
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,759
just let me know.

355
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm learning from you.

356
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,320
One must aim high.

357
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,000
What do you think we should do?

358
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm in high demand now.

359
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,679
Everyone wants me.

360
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,120
But the pay here is the highest.

361
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm off.

362
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,240
You'd really be better off

363
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,120
just coming to work for me.

364
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,600
Alright, alright.

365
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't want to ride on my coattails.

366
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,879
I know.

367
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,000
Feet are already on the ground.

368
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,240
See you.

369
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,639
Auntie Fen.

370
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,679
Hold on a sec.

371
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,799
Okay, you go ahead.

372
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,039
Give it to me.

373
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,639
Okay.

374
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,879
Yes, I'm coming out now.

375
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,320
Here, here, here.

376
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
Hello, license plate ending in 6993?

377
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,320
Thank you.

378
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,799
Alright.

379
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Thanks for your hard work, Xiao Yue.

380
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,440
It's my duty.

381
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,600
That shipment to Europe,

382
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,799
I went to the factory the other day to check.

383
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,519
We should make it in time.

384
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,120
Okay, I'll send it out in a bit.

385
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,720
Good.

386
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,279
Auntie Fen.

387
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,360
What brings you here?

388
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,919
Let me help you with that.

389
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,840
I'll get the broom.

390
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,080
Don't worry.

391
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,320
We'll figure something out.

392
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,799
Hang in there.

393
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,360
Hou Sai Lei!

394
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,600
Clock in for hourly bathroom disinfection.

395
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,720
When cleaning the floors,

396
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,039
make sure to put up the wet floor sign.

397
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,320
And one more time,

398
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,200
cleaning agents and disinfectants

399
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,919
must not be mixed together.

400
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:17,840
They're toxic.

401
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
Make them take it inside every time.

402
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,960
Don't let them develop this bad habit.

403
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,080
Auntie Fen, look here.

404
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,720
Auntie Fen.

405
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,159
The boss of this company,

406
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,519
you've known him for years.

407
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,600
Their receptionist

408
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
quit a couple of days ago.

409
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,799
Come on, give me a hand.

410
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,240
Help out if you can.

411
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,559
Serial entrepreneur.

412
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,559
We should support him.

413
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,840
A Shuo, that's not what I meant.

414
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,600
Then what do you mean?

415
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,840
Can't you go out and see

416
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,440
what the market is like now?

417
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm not going out again.

418
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,480
I'm not going out again.

419
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,720
Split up, break the partnership.

420
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,440
Break up, fine.

421
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,639
Bringing up splitting up again, huh?

422
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,879
A Shuo, think carefully.

423
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,919
Are you doing this for the company

424
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,440
or for yourself?

425
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,200
Stop it, Li Lei.

426
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,919
Stop it, Li Lei.

427
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,039
Right now, it's you who hasn't thought it through.

428
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,039
Think it over and then talk to me, okay?

429
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,720
Twenty-eighth floor.

430
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,200
What's wrong?

431
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,279
I want to invest in R&D,

432
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,039
develop new products,

433
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
and expand our scale.

434
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,519
Isn't that a good thing?

435
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,720
You have to spend money to make money.

436
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
To see a thousand miles ahead,

437
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,159
climb one more story higher.

438
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,639
Right?

439
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,240
Look over there.

440
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,120
Surveillance cameras.

441
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,879
Over there, AC outdoor units.

442
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,279
In the distance, traffic lights.

443
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,360
Those are all things you can see.

444
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,159
And there are things you can't see.

445
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,399
Inside hospitals,

446
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,240
Computed Tomography scanners,

447
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,679
scanners.

448
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,279
They all need cooling fans.

449
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,919
So I feel our potential

450
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,559
is still huge.

451
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,480
Why aren't you willing to believe

452
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,159
in ourselves for once?

453
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:35,679
Why don't we

454
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,679
take a chance?

455
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,240
Yeah.

456
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,360
We should take the chance.

457
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,240
What if we fail?

458
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,759
Feel like going for a drive?

459
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,120
I bought a new car.

460
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,840
Auntie Fen, this is a dead end.

461
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,679
If it's a dead end, you turn.

462
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,519
Make a U-turn.

463
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,919
Remember that year,

464
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,159
when I gave you that job flyer?

465
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,919
Later, you gave it back to me.

466
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,519
I've kept it all this time.

467
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,879
Look, it says right here on this page:

468
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,679
Encourage innovation.

469
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,960
Tolerate failure.

470
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't forget,

471
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,240
you're the one who went

472
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
from the 8th floor to the 28th.

473
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,559
People...

474
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,759
Life has its ups and downs,

475
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,759
its peaks and valleys.

476
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,039
It's normal.

477
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,120
Don't worry about being right or wrong for a moment.

478
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,120
Don't forget,

479
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,240
you are Li Lei.

480
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,720
Hou Sai Lei!

481
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,480
Auntie Fen, which way up ahead?

482
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,000
Roads lead everywhere.

483
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
Any direction is fine.

484
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,399
Excuse me.

485
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,519
Boss Li.

486
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,879
I was just about to look for you.

487
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,720
I was just about to look for you too.

488
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,639
Once again, congratulations to our Boss Li.

489
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,639
Grand opening, great fortune.

490
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:03,639
Business booming.

491
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,200
Always smiling.

492
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,119
Thank you.

493
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,279
Then I wish you

494
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,519
a happy retirement.

495
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,799
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

496
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,680
Li Lei, Li Lei.

497
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,200
Hou Sai Lei!

498
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,279
Hou Sai Lei!
