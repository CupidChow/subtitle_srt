1
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,340
The topic of my speech today is

2
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,259
"My Mom"

3
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,219
My mom's name is Wu Ya.

4
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,019
She is the best mom in the world.

5
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,859
She is tall,

6
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,379
has long hair,

7
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,939
and two big eyes.

8
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,340
Mom is beautiful and gentle,

9
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,659
and she loves me very much.

10
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,780
Even though Mom is very busy with work,

11
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,180
she takes me to school every day,

12
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,379
picks me up after school,

13
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,980
and helps me with my homework.

14
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,060
Also, my mom is a super chef.

15
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,700
She makes me

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,379
lots and lots of delicious food every day.

17
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,859
Mom says I need a balanced diet

18
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,620
so I can grow tall quickly.

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,019
My mom

20
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,780
isn't like other moms

21
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,620
who only make their kids study.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,459
She encourages me to have my own hobbies

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,299
besides studying.

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,939
Mom tells me

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,219
to learn to be independent

26
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,859
and to become

27
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,780
a responsible man in the future.

28
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,180
Ye Xiaopeng, you're lying!

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,659
Your mom never picks you up!

30
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,299
Yeah!

31
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,099
She didn't even come to the last parent-teacher meeting.

32
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,620
Or the sports day.

33
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,180
Ye Xiaopeng, stop bragging.

34
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,659
If we were the same as others,

35
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,099
we wouldn't have the lowest price online.

36
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,659
Maybe we shouldn't go live today.

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,860
Make a decision quickly.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,379
Alright.

39
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:12,939
Sis, give it to me.

40
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,699
Hello, Teacher Wang?

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
Ye Xiaopeng, let me ask you something.

42
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,099
Do you have to cause trouble for me every single day?

43
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,060
You just can't help yourself, can you?

44
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,900
He said I was lying.

45
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,099
He said you were lying.

46
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,180
Did you lose a piece of flesh?

47
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,020
So if he says you're lying, you hit him?

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,699
Is that what Mom taught you?

49
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:44,900
Xiao Kui.

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,539
Just go with the previous price.

51
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,139
I've already sorted it out with the brand.

52
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,659
Alright.

53
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,139
Go wash your hands and do your homework first.

54
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,020
Your delivery.

55
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,300
The food delivery is here.

56
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Come over and eat quickly.

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,020
Hello?

58
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,139
No, the order can't be changed.

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,139
What new problem has she come up with now?

60
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,099
Don't bother arguing with her anymore.

61
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,219
Find a backup option right now.

62
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:17,699
Mom, look.

63
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,419
Son, you see?

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,379
Mom has an emergency.

65
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,500
I have to rush back to work.

66
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:23,060
Do you hear me?

67
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,539
Here.

68
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,699
The food's here, eat by yourself.

69
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:25,259
Okay?

70
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,060
Be good.

71
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,219
Do your homework after you eat.

72
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,900
Wash up and go to bed at nine o'clock.

73
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:29,580
After you brush your teeth,

74
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,379
no more eating.

75
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,979
Bye, Mom.

76
00:03:59,379 --> 00:03:59,819
Sister Ya.

77
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,819
The livestream script is revised.

78
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:01,620
The brand wants to meet with us

79
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,740
tomorrow at nine AM.

80
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,780
Should we run through it now?

81
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,580
Got it. We'll talk about it tomorrow.

82
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,259
Mom.

83
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,219
Why aren't you asleep yet?

84
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,180
I was waiting for you on purpose.

85
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,620
How did I get such a good son?

86
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,379
Mom.

87
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,019
The school is organizing

88
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,939
a field trip to Fenghuang Shan tomorrow.

89
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,139
You haven't forgotten, right?

90
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,220
I haven't forgotten.

91
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,180
Is bringing bread okay?

92
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,579
You're supposed to come too.

93
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,860
You forgot.

94
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,139
Come together. I haven't forgotten.

95
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:29,779
I'll go.

96
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:30,819
Mom.

97
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,100
Do you want to know

98
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,139
what the topic of my speech contest

99
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,860
was today?

100
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:37,779
What was it?

101
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,819
"My Mom."

102
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,019
Do you want to hear it?

103
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,819
I can tell it to you again.

104
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:43,860
Okay.

105
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,540
Are you really mad at Mom?

106
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,259
I really have

107
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,459
a very important meeting to attend.

108
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,699
Mom will definitely make it next time.

109
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,060
It's always 'next time'.

110
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,819
Mom promises you,

111
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,500
this time I'll definitely keep my word.

112
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,899
Classmates.

113
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,939
What small animals or plants

114
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:49,420
did you see this morning?

115
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,180
Teacher.

116
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,180
I saw a Strophanthus vine.

117
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,339
The book says it's poisonous and you shouldn't touch it.

118
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:55,220
Teacher.

119
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,420
I saw a squirrel,

120
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,339
but I didn't catch it.

121
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,660
Black-faced spoonbill.

122
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,939
Black-faced spoonbill.

123
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,220
What about the black-faced spoonbill?

124
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,819
They usually appear on coastal mudflats.

125
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,939
At this time of year,

126
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,420
they've already left Shenzhen.

127
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,180
Did you all remember that?

128
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,420
We remembered.

129
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,220
Having a rich imagination is your strength.

130
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,459
But remember,

131
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,660
today's task is observation,

132
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,660
not imagination.

133
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,779
Understand?

134
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,259
Have something to eat first.

135
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,019
Come here.

136
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,540
Adjust the order of these few.

137
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,139
Senior products.

138
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,459
Who's going to watch after midnight?

139
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,019
Is the lighting adjusted?

140
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,139
Today is the Snack Special.

141
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,459
The lighting needs to make it look appetizing.

142
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,139
Hello? Teacher Wang?

143
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,819
What's wrong with Xiaopeng now?

144
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,939
Ye Xiaopeng!

145
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,939
Ye Xiaopeng!

146
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,339
Xiaopeng!

147
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,540
Ye Xiaopeng!

148
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:11,939
Ye Xiaopeng!

149
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,459
Ye Xiaopeng!

150
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,420
Teacher!

151
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,540
Ye Xiaopeng!

152
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,220
Where's the child?

153
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,139
Still looking.

154
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,740
He was fine this morning.

155
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,379
Xiaopeng!

156
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:22,779
We found something.

157
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,740
Xiaopeng!

158
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,060
It's Xiaopeng's.

159
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,339
Where was it found?

160
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,300
Just ahead. Xiaopeng!

161
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,660
Ma'am.

162
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,259
It's too dark now.

163
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,100
If my child is gone, where do I go?

164
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,579
It's not very safe right now.

165
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,579
Why didn't I come with him?

166
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,740
What meetings am I having every day?

167
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:51,660
Hello?

168
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,060
Xiaopeng's mom?

169
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,740
Xiaopeng!

170
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,420
Xiaopeng! Xiaopeng!

171
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,660
The child is okay.

172
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:05,259
We received a report.

173
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:06,860
A child was crossing the highway.

174
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,459
When we arrived at the scene,

175
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,899
this child was holding

176
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,220
an injured kitten in his arms.

177
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,420
The kitten was likely hit by a car.

178
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,459
It's serious.

179
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,379
Mom.

180
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,139
Save Hua Xiaoli.

181
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,339
Mom.

182
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,420
Save Hua Xiaoli.

183
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,500
Thirty-six, thirty-seven.

184
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,419
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine.

185
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,419
Forty.

186
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,779
He's been drawing nonstop at home too these days.

187
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,659
He barely talks to me.

188
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,500
And he won't let me see what he's drawing.

189
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,220
He's like this at school too.

190
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,500
Doesn't speak.

191
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:58,620
What did he experience

192
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,820
in the woods?

193
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,059
Could he have been frightened by something?

194
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,019
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:05,179
It's my fault for being so careless.

196
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,700
No, no, Teacher Wang.

197
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm not blaming you.

198
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:09,059
So today,

199
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,379
I'd like to ask for your help.

200
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:11,899
Go ahead.

201
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:15,139
Xiaopeng.

202
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,820
Can you tell Teacher

203
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:20,860
what you're drawing?

204
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,659
The story of me and Hua Xiaoli.

205
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,500
What kind of story

206
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:29,179
are you drawing?

207
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,059
Once upon a time, there was a little boy.

208
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,700
He got lost in the forest.

209
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,580
He was very scared.

210
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,539
He was afraid that later,

211
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:41,940
he would never see

212
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,179
his own mom again.

213
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,419
He walked in the forest

214
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,059
for a very, very long time.

215
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,419
Then,

216
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:52,299
he met a stray cat.

217
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,580
The little boy wanted the stray cat

218
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,659
to lead him home.

219
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,779
But the stray cat said

220
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,580
it was also looking for its mom

221
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,460
and had no time for the boy.

222
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:02,539
At that moment,

223
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,059
other little animals in the forest

224
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,940
also spotted the little boy.

225
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,539
They all rushed over.

226
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:09,779
Hand him over! Hand him over!

227
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:09,860
Hand him over! Hand him over!

228
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,419
Hand over the human

229
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,100
behind you!

230
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,539
Don't be so angry.

231
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,259
It wasn't him

232
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:16,059
who abandoned you by the roadside.

233
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,220
All humans

234
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,539
are no good.

235
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,220
Get rid of him!

236
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,139
Wait!

237
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,259
Take a good look.

238
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,940
He's just a child.

239
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,980
When my mom was taken by them,

240
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,860
I was just a child too.

241
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,539
Because of your selfishness,

242
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,500
we became who we are today.

243
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,980
Blame being born human.

244
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,059
You're all right.

245
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:38,460
But he hasn't done anything.

246
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,100
I can't let you hurt him.

247
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,820
Go! Run!

248
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:43,899
Hua Xiaoli!

249
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,940
Have you forgotten

250
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,460
how your mom was abandoned by humans?

251
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,500
Have you forgotten?

252
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,500
I haven't forgotten.

253
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:50,539
But my mom also said

254
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:51,700
humans are like us.

255
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,700
There are bad ones and good ones.

256
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:55,500
In that case,

257
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:56,980
don't blame us.

258
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,299
Overestimating yourself.

259
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,700
They ran for a very, very long time.

260
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,340
Finally, they escaped.

261
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,820
from those little animals.

262
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,779
Hua Xiaoli told the little boy

263
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,299
that the forest they lived in

264
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,940
had been destroyed.

265
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,419
There was no clean water or food.

266
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,539
Hua Xiaoli's mother

267
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,940
went to the mountain across the way

268
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,779
to look for food.

269
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,299
But that mountain

270
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,659
was guarded by a monster.

271
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:35,940
Her mother

272
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,700
must have been captured by the monster.

273
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,899
She had to go save her mother.

274
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,179
The little boy decided to help Hua Xiaoli

275
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,299
rescue her mother together.

276
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:47,059
Hua Xiaoli was very grateful for his help.

277
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:47,779
What happened next?

278
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,580
Did they defeat the monster?

279
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,940
Were they eaten by the monster?

280
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,659
Is Hua Xiaoli's mother still alive?

281
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:55,779
Tell us! Tell us!

282
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,019
This is the monster you mentioned?

283
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,299
Yes.

284
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,460
These are cars.

285
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,460
They're our human transportation.

286
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,259
They *are* monsters.

287
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,220
It's them.

288
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,100
They've killed many little animals.

289
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,419
Mom!

290
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,779
Mom, are you there?

291
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,539
Xiaoli! Xiaoli!

292
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,299
Mom! Mom!

293
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:18,700
My mom is still alive!

294
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,820
I have to go save my mom!

295
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,580
Hua Xiaoli, don't be hasty.

296
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,419
Crossing the highway is very dangerous.

297
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,379
Hua Xiaoli!

298
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,340
*My Mom*

299
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:54,379
My mom's name is Wu Ya.

300
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,700
My mom's name is Wu Ya.

301
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,659
She is very tall,

302
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,580
has long hair,

303
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,620
and two big eyes.

304
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,659
My mom walks very fast,

305
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,820
like she's on rollerblades.

306
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,580
But she has no time to take me to school

307
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,019
or pick me up.

308
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:16,299
She sells lots of delicious food,

309
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,580
but rarely cooks for me.

310
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,700
She answers many calls every day,

311
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,940
so she has no time to listen to my stories.

312
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,100
Hua Xiaoli said its mother

313
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,139
went hunting for it

314
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:39,779
and that's why the monster took her.

315
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:43,659
Just like my mom works hard

316
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,259
for my sake too.

317
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,059
Although I sometimes

318
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,620
get angry with Mom,

319
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,620
if she were to disappear,

320
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,899
I would be very sad.

321
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,179
I would also, like Hua Xiaoli,

322
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,299
go look for her.

323
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:58,580
Because

324
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,259
I love my mom very, very much.

325
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,340
Hello everyone, my name is Wu Ya.

326
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,340
Today, I'd like to share something

327
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,620
that deeply moved me.

328
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,860
A few days ago,

329
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,340
my son Xiaopeng got lost

330
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,740
on Fenghuang Shan.

331
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,500
When the police found him,

332
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,419
they saw he was holding a

333
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:33,620
seriously injured calico cat

334
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,419
that had been hit on the highway.

335
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,700
Xiaopeng was very upset.

336
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,740
He asked me,

337
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,700
"Why can't we build an overpass

338
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
on the highway?

339
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,620
Then the little animals on this side

340
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,179
could cross to the other side

341
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,580
without fear of being hit by cars.

342
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,700
Just like we cross the street."

343
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,860
I didn't know how to answer him.

344
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,700
Because I thought

345
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,980
the question was ridiculous.

346
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,059
But when I stood

347
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,460
at the spot where Hua Xiaoli

348
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,580
was seriously injured,

349
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,419
I realized

350
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,980
the question wasn't ridiculous at all.

351
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,220
I looked into it.

352
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,340
Every year, thousands of

353
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,299
little animals like Hua Xiaoli

354
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,460
are killed on highways.

355
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,500
Thousands of them.

356
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,580
And traffic accidents caused by this

357
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,620
are also rising year by year.

358
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,940
Imagine,

359
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,419
if we really had an overpass

360
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,059
that little animals could use.

361
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,220
It wouldn't just help them,

362
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,700
but ourselves even more.

363
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,019
Because we are all connected.

364
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,100
Comrades,

365
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,620
this is a letter written

366
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,539
by a mother and her child.

367
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
A child's world

368
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,620
is far richer

369
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,820
than we imagine.

370
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,139
I am deeply moved.

371
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,299
Now, let's invite this mother and son

372
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,220
to speak to all of us.

373
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,740
Please.

374
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
I am an inadequate mother.

375
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:19,620
I always thought

376
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,340
a child's world was simple.

377
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,460
Until I heard

378
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,139
the story Xiaopeng told me.

379
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,940
In the world we live in,

380
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,740
little animals, just like children,

381
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
need a bridge

382
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,539
that protects life.

383
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,419
