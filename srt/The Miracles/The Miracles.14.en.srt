1
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,299
Xiaoxi

2
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,299
Let's meet.

3
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,500
Well,

4
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,019
see you tomorrow.

5
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,980
Let me think.

6
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,780
Your tomorrow,

7
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,299
or my tomorrow?

8
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:15,659
My tomorrow.

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,420
Then I'd have to wait nine years.

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,500
How about at my place then?

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:22,900
Um...

12
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,540
Okay.

13
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,140
Your tomorrow.

14
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,500
But I don't know you yet.

15
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,739
Right.

16
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:29,500
So what do we do?

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,219
I remember now.

18
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,019
That was in 2016,

19
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,459
on May 6th.

20
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,340
It was really funny.

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,540
The food was so good.

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,099
Yeah.

23
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,900
Let's meet here again next time.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,459
Alright, sure.

25
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:42,260
Great, great.

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,060
Did everyone get a cab?

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,140
We did, we're heading back first.

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,140
Bye, bye, bye.

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,579
Bye, let's meet again, bye.

30
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,340
Bye, bye.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,500
Xiaoxi.

32
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:49,700
Did you get a cab?

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,299
Not yet.

34
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,299
But it's fine.

35
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:52,939
I can wait a bit.

36
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,060
Worst case, I'll walk home.

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,019
What about your car?

38
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,260
My car is almost here.

39
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,700
Then you should go.

40
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,540
Okay.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,859
Bye, take care on the road.

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,540
Bye.

43
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,659
You creep!

44
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,699
Something that happened so long ago,

45
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,979
and you remember it so vividly?

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
You were followed by a creep.

47
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,340
How could I forget?

48
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,860
If that day,

49
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,300
you had come to be my hero,

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,659
wouldn't we have met then?

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,020
And my impression of you would've soared.

52
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:07,860
Good idea.

53
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,620
But wouldn't that be dangerous?

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,099
What's there to fear?

55
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,539
The creep will trip over the green belt.

56
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,659
Alright.

57
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
Wing Chun!

58
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,340
Chen Mo!

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Keep your voice down!

60
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:24,740
Okay.

61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,580
The food is so good.

62
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,180
Yeah.

63
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,060
Let's meet here again next time, okay?

64
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,939
Sure, sounds good.

65
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,580
Which one is it?

66
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,219
Did everyone get a cab?

67
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,340
We did, we're heading back first.

68
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,340
Bye, bye, bye.

69
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,460
Bye, bye.

70
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,139
Let's meet again.

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,620
Bye.

72
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,500
Xiaoxi, did you get a cab?

73
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,099
Not yet.

74
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:48,699
What about your car?

75
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,780
My car is almost here.

76
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,379
Then you should go.

77
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,180
Okay.

78
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,900
Take care, Bella.

79
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:52,620
Bye.

80
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,379
Bye, bye.

81
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,099
Hello.

82
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,219
Du Xiaoxi?

83
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,620
Where's the creep?

84
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,540
Why are you running so fast?

85
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,620
Why is it so dark here?

86
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,540
Where are you running to?

87
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,060
Green belt!

88
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,779
You pervert!

89
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,740
So the creep was you?

90
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,100
And you can still laugh?

91
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,980
My eyes didn't open for three days.

92
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,540
And did you really have to write

93
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,060
fifteen "ha"s on the note?

94
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,139
Sorry, sorry.

95
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,579
But it was worth it.

96
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,860
At least

97
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:09,420
I got to see you.

98
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,660
Am I like you imagined?

99
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,899
No.

100
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,300
Clearly, my imagination

101
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,100
was too limited.

102
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,540
That's so cheesy.

103
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,540
More or less.

104
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,939
The writing reveals the person,

105
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,300
the person is in the writing.

106
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,740
Then your handwriting isn't great.

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,019
Don't you think it's amazing?

108
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,420
I want to write our experience

109
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,220
into a novel.

110
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,339
Incorporate what you said,

111
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
about how at certain points

112
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,100
in the world,

113
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,100
due to changes in the gravitational field,

114
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,740
causing time dilation

115
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:47,899
and spacetime curvature,

116
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,980
enabling people from two different times

117
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,420
to communicate across time.

118
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,180
That's not good.

119
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,339
Someone already wrote it.

120
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,699
Even though you'd write it before her,

121
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,100
it would be cheating.

122
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,259
I even came up with a pen name.

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,779
"Suan Tang," how about that?

124
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,420
How do you know "Suan Tang"?

125
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,019
I don't.

126
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,339
Then why call yourself "Suan Tang"?

127
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,660
It's a secret.

128
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:19,300
And also,

129
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,540
I've already thought of a title.

130
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,259
It'll be called

131
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,500
"The First Reunion."

132
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,100
What do you think?

133
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,420
But I still can't write these days.

134
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,259
The doctor said not to strain my eyes.

135
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,060
I have to go to

136
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,220
First Hospital for a check-up tomorrow.

137
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:37,500
I'll come find you.

138
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:39,980
Where will you find me?

139
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,500
At First Hospital?

140
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:49,420
Hello?

141
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,740
You called me over in such a hurry.

142
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,660
Is there good news?

143
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,300
What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?

144
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,300
I am...

145
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,420
I... I have lost a bit of weight recently.

146
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,980
It's not because...

147
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,339
my book can't get published, is it?

148
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,540
I've been so worried I can't eat anything.

149
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:15,660
And then...

150
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,620
Are you Suan Tang?

151
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,660
Yes, I am.

152
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,420
Did you write "The First Reunion"?

153
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,620
You... Listen to what you're saying.

154
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,819
If I didn't write it, who did? You?

155
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,699
Tell me the truth.

156
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,300
I am telling the truth.

157
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,539
Then who is Chen Mo?

158
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,299
You... maybe you should sit down.

159
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,059
My... my brother's room is at the very back.

160
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:30,980
Suan Tang.

161
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,220
Love Fish.

162
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,580
Sis, we have a guest.

163
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,500
Chen Mo.

164
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,580
Who is it?

165
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,019
You... you've got the wrong person.

166
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,740
Is that so?

167
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,539
Then how do you explain this photo?

168
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,980
From 2016.

169
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,940
May 11th.

170
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,700
Because Chen Mo went to the hospital for his eyes.

171
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,379
Because Chen Mo went to the hospital for his eyes.

172
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,259
At the entrance of the First Hospital...

173
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,500
a car lost control.

174
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,340
It crashed into the crowd.

175
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:48,940
Fortunately...

176
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,740
he was treated in time.

177
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,740
Chen Mo's life was saved.

178
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,139
Ever since then...

179
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,700
he hardly ever goes out.

180
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,860
He hardly ever goes out.

181
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,860
He stayed home and finished writing...

182
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,899
"The First Reunion."

183
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:04,659
Because of his leg...

184
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,100
he became extremely insecure.

185
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,740
He's afraid to see people.

186
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,580
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

187
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,220
Especially to you.

188
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:19,259
One...

189
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,139
Boss!

190
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,620
Boss! Boss!

191
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,779
Where's that copy of "One Hundred Years of Solitude" from the bookshelf?

192
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,980
Sold.

193
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,620
Sold it.

194
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,980
Is it strange for a bookstore...

195
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,620
to sell a book?

196
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,820
Then... when did you sell it?

197
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,940
Just now.

198
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:38,940
Who did you sell it to?

199
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,980
A girl wearing a red hat.

200
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,340
Red hat...

201
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,659
Okay.

202
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,259
Thank you, Boss. Thank you.

203
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:50,460
Red hat!

204
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,100
Wait!

205
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,620
Wait a second!

206
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,580
What's wrong?

207
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,419
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:58,419 --> 00:12:59,500
I... I mistook you for someone else.

209
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,860
It's... it's fine.

210
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,220
Don't go to the hospital.

211
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,740
Don't go to the hospital.

212
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:53,580
Chen Mo!

213
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,220
Don't go to the hospital!

214
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,460
Don't go to the hospital!

215
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,259
Don't go to the hospital!

216
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,659
What was that?

217
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,740
If this bookshelf...

218
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,179
is a medium connecting different times...

219
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,019
then every...

220
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,220
coordinate point on it...

221
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,299
every book...

222
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,419
is it possible...

223
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,019
that each one connects to...

224
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,419
a different time and space?

225
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,179
So...

226
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,860
you knew all along.

227
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:08,860
Who are you, really?

228
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,059
Just an ordinary bookstore owner.

229
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:13,700
Boss...

230
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,779
Actually...

231
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:25,419
I've already tried to save Chen Mo.

232
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:26,940
Many times.

233
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,460
And failed every time.

234
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,059
No.

235
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:49,580
This time, I've found...

236
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
a way to save him.

237
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,059
As long as I, on that day...

238
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,460
don't leave a message in "One Hundred Years of Solitude"...

239
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,259
for him...

240
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,220
then everything that follows...

241
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,179
won't happen.

242
00:15:58,419 --> 00:15:59,940
Chen Mo won't get hurt.

243
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,299
If that's the case...

244
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,019
you two might never...

245
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:03,740
meet each other.

246
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,019
That's okay.

247
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,419
Du Xiaoxi.

248
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,460
Although this is a bit hard to believe...

249
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
please trust me.

250
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,820
Don't leave a message in "One Hundred Years of Solitude."

251
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,059
Because...

252
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:40,700
Okay.

253
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,019
We can see...

254
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,940
the main objectives...

255
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,099
of this event are...

256
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:45,180
First...

257
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,059
to boost the sales...

258
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:47,059
of our new book.

259
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:47,539
Xiaoxi.

260
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,140
Through the impact of the book signing...

261
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,579
Xiaoxi!

262
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,220
Why do you look so listless?

263
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,019
It's nothing.

264
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,700
I just feel like...

265
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,539
I had a very long dream.

266
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:58,900
But I can't remember any of it.

267
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,579
Right?

268
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,140
Now, second...

269
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,819
Xiaoxi.

270
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:05,500
Here.

271
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:05,940
Xiaoxi!

272
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,339
Here, Editor-in-Chief.

273
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,700
Do you think you can handle it?

274
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:11,700
I... I think...

275
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,019
Yes, I can.

276
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:16,660
Good.

277
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,339
Then tonight at eight...

278
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:19,380
you go to the bookstore.

279
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,420
Go to that new book signing event...

280
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,579
and assist Pipi.

281
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,019
Any objections?

282
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:29,859
No.

283
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:31,180
No.

284
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,779
Editor-in-Chief.

285
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,779
Good. Let's continue.

286
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,220
This definitely counts as overtime.

287
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,660
And whose fault is that?

288
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
You slacked off during the meeting.

289
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,460
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

290
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,859
You're the best.

291
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
You're the only one who'd come with me.

292
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:49,619
You're buying me a late-night snack later.

293
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,059
Sure.

294
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:54,019
What's wrong?

295
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,099
Let's go.

296
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,019
It's nothing.

297
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,019
Let's go in.

298
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:00,460
I thought...

299
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,819
...you didn't want to buy me that snack.

300
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,099
What are you talking about?

301
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,500
The book signing is on the second floor.

302
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,420
We still have some time.

303
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,180
You go on up first.

304
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:11,700
I want to look around.

305
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,900
Okay, but hurry up.

306
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:02,180
It's okay.

307
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:03,420
You... you can... it's fine.

308
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,660
Here you go.

309
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:08,500
Thank you.
