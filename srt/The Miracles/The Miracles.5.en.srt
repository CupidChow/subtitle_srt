1
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,500
I'm useless.

2
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,100
So thin the wind could blow me away.

3
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,340
It's fine, I have you.

4
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,420
When a typhoon comes, I won't hide.

5
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,379
I'll just hold onto you.

6
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,579
If not a typhoon, then a cold, bitter wind?

7
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,459
Last Mid-Autumn we had river snails.

8
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,019
This year for my birthday, more snails.

9
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,219
What about next year?

10
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,980
Do you have a grudge against me,

11
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,980
or against snails?

12
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,060
Well, you married

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,180
a fish seller, didn't you?

14
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,819
How do you know he sells fish?

15
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,260
Just a wild guess.

16
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,180
One last year of snails.

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,739
Next year, abalone.

18
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,060
No problem.

19
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,459
Alright then.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,260
You always brush me off.

21
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,819
It's boring. That's it.

22
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:41,140
What do you want me to do then?

23
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,299
If we can't afford it,

24
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:43,540
then we won't celebrate.

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,060
Hong Fu.

26
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,859
Check, please.

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,500
Two herbal teas,

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,379
one plate of river snails.

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,459
That'll be eight yuan.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,180
Here, here.

31
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,099
How about some stir-fried clams?

32
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:56,819
On the house.

33
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:57,739
No.

34
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,099
I like snails.

35
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,739
He wants to go to Fortune's Gate.

36
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,420
Gets a little money and forgets

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,739
which way is up.

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,739
Fortune's Gate Grand Restaurant.

39
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,579
It's not cheap.

40
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,060
It's not like I can't afford it.

41
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,300
I collect rent for two days,

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,259
and I'm set.

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,099
The keys to half a street's properties

44
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:12,939
are all right here.

45
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,419
Let's eat something nice.

46
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,659
It's all thanks to our village

47
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,780
developing.

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,099
That's how a loser like you turned things around.

49
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,139
You really think you're a Property King.

50
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,500
Just indulge

51
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,060
this loser of mine.

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,659
Let's have a two-head abalone.

53
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,139
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone,

54
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,979
since its establishment in 1980,

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,580
has become the forefront of China's reform and opening-up

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,939
and a globally renowned

57
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,219
city of innovation.

58
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,060
People from all corners of the land

59
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,379
gather in Shenzhen,

60
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,340
realizing

61
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,139
miracles in their lives.

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,900
Hong Fu, we're leaving.

63
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:34,580
Thank you.

64
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,340
Take care, sir.

65
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,060
Here, beer.

66
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,099
Boss, sit anywhere.

67
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:38,659
Be right there.

68
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:40,539
Here.

69
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:41,780
Thanks.

70
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,180
Sit anywhere.

71
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,500
Here.

72
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,300
Put it here.

73
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,340
Miss, where are you from?

74
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,139
What does it matter where I'm from?

75
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:52,699
Different prices?

76
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,539
No, same price for everyone.

77
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,259
What would you like?

78
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,419
Any recommendations?

79
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
From north to south,

80
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,219
our shop proudly presents our signature mixed noodles.

81
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,219
A pioneering fusion of northern and southern flavors.

82
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:03,580
No matter how far from home you are,

83
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,219
you'll taste a bit of home.

84
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,819
It even has a beautiful name:

85
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,300
called

86
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,500
Flavor from Afar.

87
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,259
Northerners call it delicious,

88
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,699
southern girls praise its amazing aroma.

89
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,340
One order, please.

90
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:13,939
One order.

91
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:15,460
Wonton noodles.

92
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,660
Wonton noodles, thanks.

93
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:17,980
One wonton noodles.

94
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,899
Two wonton noodles.

95
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,220
Wait a second.

96
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:22,899
Add pork cracklings.

97
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,379
Sure, coming right up.

98
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,339
Those two are so fashionable.

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,019
The newspaper says this is called

100
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,699
white-collar.

101
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,660
White-collar.

102
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,500
Because their collars are whiter?

103
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:43,540
They're leaders who wear white shirts.

104
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:44,939
They're very particular.

105
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,660
They'll definitely wipe the table first.

106
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:48,540
It's already wiped.

107
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,379
Boss!

108
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:51,899
Two more beers!

109
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:52,420
Coming!

110
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,500
Can you stop drinking?

111
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
You've had a lot.

112
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,980
No way.

113
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,100
I'm happy to see you today,

114
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,500
so I must drink more.

115
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,060
Usually after my shift, I just slurp a bowl of noodles alone.

116
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,139
Today, I've had eight bottles.

117
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:04,939
What's going on?

118
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,540
Driving a taxi pays pretty well.

119
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:09,180
I think

120
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,500
he's probably trying to win back

121
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,259
his estranged wife.

122
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,620
Before, I was useless.

123
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,699
Now it's different.

124
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,899
I work steadily,

125
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,579
monthly earnings over ten thousand.

126
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,860
Pick up Hong Kong visitors at Luohu Port,

127
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,100
deliver wholesalers to Huaqiangbei.

128
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:25,860
Next year,

129
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,699
I'll buy an apartment in Lianhua Village.

130
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:31,339
Cigarettes?

131
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,459
Quit.

132
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:33,379
Alcohol?

133
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,899
Only drink when I see you.

134
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,899
I just want you to see

135
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,139
I've changed a lot.

136
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,860
But the one thing unchanged

137
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,779
is this

138
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,939
heart that cares for you.

139
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,459
I've forgotten.

140
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,899
If I say I've forgotten, then I have.

141
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,259
Deep down, I know better than anyone,

142
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,740
what's gone is gone.

143
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:57,660
You and I haven't been

144
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,420
in the same car for a long time.

145
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:00,779
The wheel's turned all the way.

146
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,420
No turning back.

147
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,339
Anyway, Brother.

148
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,019
Being able to see you again

149
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:12,819
makes me really happy.

150
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,220
Really.

151
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:18,819
Very happy.

152
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:37,459
Pork cracklings.

153
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,540
I have to say,

154
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,019
the Special Zone Speed

155
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,019
isn't that great?

156
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,899
Look how perfect they are for each other.

157
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,100
I'm here, Shan Ge.

158
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,019
How's it going?

159
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,300
Is everything taken care of?

160
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,860
Don't worry, Shan Ge.

161
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:36,740
The brake pads are changed.

162
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,100
The gas tank is full too.

163
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,740
I won't screw up again.

164
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,500
What screws did you use?

165
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,259
The hex socket ones strip easily.

166
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,420
The hex head ones can't get enough torque.

167
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,699
It's tight.

168
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,060
I told you,

169
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,819
no more screw-ups.

170
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,100
Alright, alright, alright.

171
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,019
Whatever it is, we'll talk when we meet.

172
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:54,899
Remember

173
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,100
to bring the goods.

174
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,300
Time's almost up.

175
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:12,579
Boss.

176
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,779
Sit anywhere.

177
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,860
You brothers just got off the construction site.

178
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,019
Have some soup to nourish yourselves.

179
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,259
Do I look like I need nourishing?

180
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,539
Go get the menu.

181
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,379
Right away.

182
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,340
Today, at a bank in Luohu District,

183
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,899
a major robbery occurred.

184
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:46,340
There were four robbers in total.

185
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,340
We hope the general public

186
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,340
will actively provide

187
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,019
Fu Ge.

188
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,259
It's fine.

189
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:06,860
You go prepare the dishes.

190
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,100
I'll take care of them.

191
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,899
Shan Ge.

192
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,259
The Type 79's recoil is half of the Type 54's.

193
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,899
Everything else is fine.

194
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,460
Just the sights need calibrating.

195
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,539
Shenzhen's weather is humid.

196
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
When the gun oil gets damp,

197
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,019
it gets sticky.

198
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
If the gun oil is sticky,

199
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,500
the lubrication is poor.

200
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,139
What are you trying to say?

201
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,019
If the lubrication is poor,

202
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,419
then it'll jam, won't it?

203
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:26,539
I'll smack you.

204
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,179
Enough.

205
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,299
Don't talk about this here.

206
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,379
Later, find someone who knows guns

207
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,019
and ask again.

208
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,139
Come on, come on.

209
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:37,940
Look at the map.

210
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:38,779
Everyone, look at the map.

211
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,779
From this Dongmen Jewelry Store

212
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,620
to the Shekou Free Trade Zone,

213
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,539
the whole route is thirty-two kilometers.

214
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,059
There are three high-risk points.

215
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,659
Whether the tools work well now

216
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:48,179
is not important.

217
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,139
There's only one rule:

218
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,179
Steady hands, ruthless heart, sharp eyes.

219
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:52,980
Got it?

220
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,500
Our future depends on this.

221
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,059
Let's take the gamble.

222
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:55,980
If we succeed,

223
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,620
we'll be rich and prosperous for life.

224
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:57,980
Come on.

225
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,139
Cheers.

226
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,259
A Hong.

227
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,620
Not many people today, huh?

228
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,259
Lao Ma.

229
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,259
No rush, no rush, no rush.

230
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,860
Let's you and I go out for a smoke first.

231
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:09,899
Let's go, let's go.

232
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:10,539
I don't smoke.

233
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,419
Quit.

234
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,539
You should quit too.

235
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,019
Look, your brow is dark.

236
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,259
Your liver's on fire.

237
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,500
A Miao.

238
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:19,700
Business good?

239
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:21,779
I told my son,

240
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,580
"If you get into Shenzhen Middle School,

241
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,899
I'll quit immediately."

242
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:26,299
Guess what?

243
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,500
That rascal actually got in.

244
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:30,980
What a coincidence, right?

245
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,539
Just got some fresh fish today.

246
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,899
Steam one to celebrate with you.

247
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,659
Come on, come pick one.

248
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:35,059
No hurry, no hurry.

249
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:35,299
Go pick one.

250
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,500
Fry me some beef chow fun.

251
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:37,139
Miao Miao.

252
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,620
Here, change this for some herbal tea.

253
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:39,500
Okay.

254
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,259
No, no need. I'll do it.

255
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,139
Back in the day,

256
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:45,860
when we were on stakeouts

257
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,139
catching the motorcycle gangs,

258
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,259
it was so tiring.

259
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,379
Covered in stinky sweat.

260
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,259
That sweat could pickle a loser.

261
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,379
Now it's better.

262
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:55,259
Our dorm has air conditioning.

263
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,139
On night shifts,

264
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,539
we can even eat chilled watermelon.

265
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,100
Here, here.

266
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:07,620
You should install one too.

267
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,139
Install... install what?

268
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,539
Air conditioning.

269
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:11,860
Look outside,

270
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,659
it's hot as a steamer.

271
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:14,940
Alright.

272
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:16,779
Alright.

273
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,779
Got the house.

274
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,259
Son got into school.

275
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,740
Restrained myself for so long.

276
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:25,779
Taking one puff should be fine, right?

277
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,740
Your hands are pretty quick.

278
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:58,379
Thanks.

279
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,220
You guys...

280
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,700
are movers, right?

281
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,379
More or less.

282
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,299
Officer.

283
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
How long have you been in this line of work?

284
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,580
One month short of thirty years.

285
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:21,500
What's up?

286
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,379
Then you must understand everything.

287
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,299
Just tell me,

288
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,059
does the Type 79 jam or not?

289
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,980
Well...

290
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,500
It's been a very long time

291
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,100
since I've handled one.

292
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,899
Not sure.

293
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,179
Why are you asking?

294
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:49,500
Just eat your meal properly.

295
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,059
A Miao

296
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:58,740
My brothers haven't eaten.

297
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,019
Get four boxed meals for them.

298
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,779
You know the place, right?

299
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:02,980
Go.

300
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:03,899
I know, I know.

301
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,419
Is there any more food?
