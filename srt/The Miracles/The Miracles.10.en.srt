1
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,439
My worst fear

2
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,799
has come true.

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
But I didn't expect them to be so ruthless.

4
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,680
The stock market shouldn't be a trap-filled casino.

5
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,000
Look.

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,799
A storm is coming.

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,840
Coming, coming! Stop knocking!

8
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,560
Who is it?

9
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,200
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,239
Quick, quick, come in and sit.

11
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,000
A Jie is in trouble.

12
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,680
Trouble? What trouble?

13
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,079
Don't play dumb with me.

14
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,840
Wasn't it you who took him to the black market?

15
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,439
Thanks to your great introduction.

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,239
He lost all the family's savings

17
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,959
and the money he borrowed.

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,840
Where is he? Where is he now?

19
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:52,920
Where?!

20
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,200
He jumped off a building.

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,520
From today on,

22
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,159
you are you, and I am me.

23
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,599
I'm done.

24
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,479
I sold the shop.

25
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,159
Boss Wu.

26
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
They're using computers now.

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
It's clearly meant to keep us common folks

28
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,960
from understanding it.

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,199
They say one thing to your face,

30
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,879
and another behind your back, to trick you.

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,400
What?

32
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
You're the one who says one thing

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,159
and does another.

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
You're the one who ruined A Jie.

35
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,280
He didn't have the luck for it.

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
Don't blame me.

37
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,680
Don't think I don't know.

38
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,879
It's you who deliberately crash the price to buy low,

39
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
then wait for the stock split to sell high.

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,159
Let me tell you something.

41
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,879
Don't talk nonsense without evidence, okay?

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,319
Beat him up.

43
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,080
Who do you think you are?

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,439
You're just a dog raised by the brokerage branch.

45
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,759
Kick him in the mouth.

46
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,879
Get him from over there.

47
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,879
Everything's been handled properly for you.

48
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,800
Everything's been handled properly for you.

49
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
Thanks to your brilliant planning,

50
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,279
we made another big profit.

51
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,519
I heard

52
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,399
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange is really happening.

53
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,240
Computerized matching is really coming.

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,079
Some of our old clients

55
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,319
are getting tempted.

56
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,639
To be honest with you,

57
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,519
I'm getting nervous too.

58
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,360
The market is a stage.

59
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,879
We set the scene and the lights.

60
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,519
They perform and dream.

61
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,199
Your job isn't to worry.

62
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,639
It's to hold steady.

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,279
Everyone says

64
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,360
your name, Boss Wu, is famous and powerful.

65
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,079
You have to live up to that name.

66
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,079
Yes, yes, yes.

67
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,800
Thanks to you watching over me.

68
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,600
I, this "Boss Wu," am just a front.

69
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,040
You are the real Boss Wu.

70
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,199
The doctors' consultation results...

71
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,040
The situation might not be optimistic.

72
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,199
Wait a minute.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,959
I know who's behind this.

74
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,720
Why do you meddle in so much?

75
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,720
Watch your own back.

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Just shut up already.

77
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,639
I wasn't talking about you.

78
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,720
Alright, if there's nothing else, hang up.

79
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,000
Mommy.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,360
I still want to buy a toy.

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,600
We'll buy it.

82
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,920
We'll buy whatever you want.

83
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,439
Okay.

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,199
Deputy Head Liang.

85
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,199
Deputy Head Liang.

86
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Where's Head Yu?

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,399
The leadership is here.

88
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,000
Head Yu is giving a report.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,959
How long has he been in there?

90
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,079
One hour and forty minutes.

91
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,199
Head Yu! Head Yu!

92
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,279
How did it go, Head Yu?

93
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,519
How many years have you all been in Shenzhen?

94
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,839
Three years for me.

95
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,600
A year and a half. One year.

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Same year as him.

97
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,759
One year. I'm also one year.

98
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,639
Two years for me.

99
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,519
I came to Shenzhen after graduation.

100
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,040
And you recruited me into the preparation team.

101
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,959
I've been here for seven years.

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,959
During these seven years,

103
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,600
I've been waiting for an answer.

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
Comrades,

105
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,040
you must remember today.

106
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,040
Just now,

107
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,800
it has been decided

108
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,600
that the Shenzhen Stock Exchange

109
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
will, in 1990,

110
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,199
on December 1st,

111
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,199
officially begin centralized trading.

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,759
We did it! We did it!

113
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,279
Fantastic!

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,720
Thank you.

115
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,639
Let's keep it up.

116
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,519
December 1st.

117
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,600
Impossible.

118
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,839
I'm exhausted from taking them to buy toys.

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,439
There's a bag.

120
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,079
Later, you'll come with me

121
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,720
to buy it, okay?

122
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,519
Buy what?

123
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,399
A typhoon is coming.

124
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,399
Hurry through the checkpoint and go home.

125
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,519
Make sure to double-check before hitting Enter.

126
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,800
Buy orders on the left, sell orders on the right.

127
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,879
Don't mix them up again.

128
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,079
Alright, let's call it a day for now.

129
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,120
Tomorrow,

130
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,879
tomorrow we'll keep working hard.

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,839
Go on home.

132
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,519
We veteran brokerage branches,

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,639
we went door-to-door for clients back then.

134
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,959
We covered costs out of our own pockets.

135
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,199
Every step was a hard-fought struggle.

136
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,319
And now look,

137
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,519
they've created this Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

138
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,439
Our future livelihood

139
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,839
is going to be tough.

140
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,519
Tough.

141
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,920
I actually have a plan.

142
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,399
To make things tough for *them*.

143
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,720
Jun Sheng,

144
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,839
brew my good tea.

145
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,639
On December 1st,

146
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
let's also stick together for warmth.

147
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,799
When the time comes,

148
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,039
not a single buy or sell order

149
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,159
gets reported.

150
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,440
Zero trades in the market.

151
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,960
Let everyone see

152
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,759
that they don't have public support.

153
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,200
That's a great idea!

154
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,519
We'll make sure they have zero trades on opening day.

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
If the higher-ups find out we're

156
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,960
banding together to oppose them...

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,360
This isn't opposition.

158
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,279
It's a test from the market.

159
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,840
Do you really want

160
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,720
to just stand by and watch

161
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,159
as we get kicked off the gaming table?

162
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:12,919
Here.

163
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,159
Drink your tea.

164
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm thinking,

165
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,679
first we spread some rumors outside

166
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,440
to keep the investors calm.

167
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,159
Well, I know a few newspapers.

168
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,519
I'll have them write some articles.

169
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,919
That's more like it.

170
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,519
Unity is strength.

171
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
You seem anxious.

172
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
I *am* anxious.

173
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,639
Since the news about the Shenzhen Exchange opening

174
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,639
got out these past couple of days,

175
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,240
the investors have been very anxious.

176
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,039
They're afraid we'll press the wrong key and their money's gone.

177
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,639
Right.

178
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,000
So,

179
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,320
we need to find a way

180
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,519
to ease their concerns.

181
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,519
How about we implement a

182
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,720
manual call auction,

183
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,120
combined with the computer.

184
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,039
Hello?

185
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,559
Shenzhen Exchange.

186
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,440
Understood.

187
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,759
Good.

188
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,559
East Development, sell ten lots.

189
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,159
Unit price fifty.

190
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,440
East Development, buy ten lots. Trade executed.

191
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,480
Trade executed.

192
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,519
Put it on the board.

193
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,159
Put it on the board.

194
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,879
Do you understand?

195
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,519
Does everyone understand?

196
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,639
Understood.

197
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,559
Do you have confidence?

198
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,399
Yes!

199
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,399
Starting tomorrow,

200
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,039
we all need to be like Liang Ying.

201
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,879
Loud voice, clear gestures.

202
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,600
We must let everyone see

203
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,159
our trades.

204
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,279
Today,

205
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,879
December 1st, 1990,

206
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,519
our Shenzhen Stock Exchange

207
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,039
officially opens for trading.

208
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,679
Quick, quick, quick!

209
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,759
Write this down first:

210
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,799
"Shenzhen Exchange opens with zero trades."

211
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,559
Not a single transaction.

212
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,399
Isn't this a joke?

213
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,519
They should've said they couldn't reach an agreement.

214
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
Who even knows if it's compliant?

215
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,759
Do you think there'll be any trades today?

216
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,759
I think it'll be tough.

217
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,360
Hello? Shenzhen Exchange.

218
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:57,919
Okay.

219
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
Shen An Da, sell.

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,759
Twenty-five yuan, seventy-three fen.

221
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,919
Shen An Da.

222
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,600
Sell at twenty-five seventy-three.

223
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,759
Shen An Da.

224
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,279
Buy two lots.

225
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,279
Good.

226
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,360
Hello?

227
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

228
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,559
Didn't we all agree on zero trades?

229
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,120
Which traitor reported it?

230
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,039
What are you doing here?

231
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,679
Get out.

232
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,039
The ones who should leave

233
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,879
are you.

234
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:08,519
Rest assured,

235
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,240
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange will ensure

236
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
everyone's rights and interests.

237
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,720
Thanks to you all,

238
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,279
for returning fairness and justice

239
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,879
to every investor and citizen.

240
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,159
It's what we can do,

241
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,519
and what we should do.

242
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,159
Miss Liang is absolutely right.

243
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,039
This is indeed

244
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,000
what we should do.

245
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,559
We must not betray

246
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,559
our own conscience.

247
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,879
You are the mastermind, Boss Wu.

248
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Please cooperate with our investigation.

249
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,960
Come with us.

250
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:49,919
Master.

251
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,600
Last time you said

252
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,080
you were looking for an answer seven years ago.

253
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,159
Have you found it now?

254
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,159
This is Shenzhen.

255
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,039
This is the answer.

256
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,159
This young city

257
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,879
will never stop moving forward.

258
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
Where are we going?

259
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,000
For coffee.

260
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,159
Where to?

261
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,360
Right here.

262
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,879
Shenzhen.
