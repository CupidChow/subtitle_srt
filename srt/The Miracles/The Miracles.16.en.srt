1
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,539
Everyone, everyone.

2
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,060
This order of ours

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,299
must be completed within ten hours.

4
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,140
My name is Wang Chong.

5
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,859
I'm an unofficial member

6
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,939
of a Shenzhen foreign trade association.

7
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,060
His name is Anthony.

8
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:04,859
He's Italian.

9
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,579
A hopeless romantic.

10
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,540
My client.

11
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,219
He

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,180
wants to buy lights.

13
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,739
Self-adaptive solar lights.

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,859
The purpose is

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,859
to get this batch of solar lights

16
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,019
delivered within five days to his

17
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,019
girlfriend, who is far away in Bangladesh,

18
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,900
providing disaster relief.

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,939
That's her.

20
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,540
Oh, my muse.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,340
Six years ago by the Seine,

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,459
God turned a ray of sunlight

23
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,060
into your face

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,140
and placed it on my canvas.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,260
Today I can finally tell you,

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,819
Adele,

27
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:28,739
I will love you forever,

28
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,099
until death do us part.

29
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,579
Not death.

30
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:34,620
It's five thousand

31
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,500
self-adaptive solar light orders

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,579
that will keep you apart.

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,980
I spent a lifetime's effort.

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,140
I booked the most beautiful restaurant in the world,

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,180
planning to propose

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,859
on our sixth anniversary.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,500
I even hired a band.

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,980
Spent a lot of money.

39
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,099
But your Adele

40
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,900
is in Bangladesh.

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,379
She's in the middle of a storm,

42
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,099
doing charity work.

43
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:00,739
She has no time

44
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,019
for your sixth anniversary.

45
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,859
You have no idea how busy I am.

46
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,939
These solar lights,

47
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,180
I need five thousand in five days.

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,180
This world is not romantic at all.

49
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,659
Okay?

50
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,580
Your romance

51
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,699
can solve my problem?

52
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,500
No.

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,099
So Adele's words

54
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:14,819
reminded you

55
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,259
to do something even more romantic for her.

56
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,460
Exactly.

57
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,099
That's the romantic thing I want to do.

58
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,099
I must complete this impossible order.

59
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,659
Wang Chong of Shenzhen

60
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,460
is pretty amazing.

61
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:30,740
Right.

62
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,979
That's also why I came to Shenzhen

63
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,219
to find you,

64
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,180
Wang Chong.

65
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,740
So,

66
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,740
can this order be done

67
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:39,860
or not?

68
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,020
Impossible.

69
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,060
Is it really an impossible order?

70
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:00,659
Giving up so quickly?

71
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,500
The so-called self-adaptive solar light

72
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,460
must automatically sense its surroundings,

73
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,659
adjusting brightness, power, color temperature,

74
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,780
like an owl in the night.

75
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,500
Therefore,

76
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,099
you need to equip it with a

77
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,539
smart brain.

78
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,300
So we have to start with him.

79
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,780
Chinese herbal tea

80
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,020
is a treasure of traditional Chinese culture.

81
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,580
Acupuncture and pulse diagnosis

82
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,340
are traditional Chinese medicine treatments.

83
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,180
Here,

84
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,180
I optimized the algorithm for you.

85
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,300
Use my formula here

86
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,020
to source the chips.

87
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:36,860
Thanks.

88
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,620
Next.

89
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,099
I understand your situation.

90
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,939
Bangladesh is between 20 degrees

91
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,060
and 26 degrees north latitude.

92
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,300
Humidity during the rainy season is over 80%.

93
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,979
Annual sunshine hours are as high as 2500.

94
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,340
Good sunlight conditions, but high operational intensity.

95
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,180
The demands on the chip

96
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,180
are quite high.

97
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,340
To put it bluntly, not enough money.

98
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,939
Can't afford it.

99
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:11,539
Your liver fire is too strong.

100
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,020
Kuding and honeysuckle tea.

101
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
Drink it continuously these two days.

102
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,340
Go to my grandpa's place

103
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,060
to get some tea.

104
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:36,420
Why are you running?

105
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,379
Why are you chasing me?

106
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,500
Didn't you say it's all settled?

107
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,100
If it's settled, why are you still running?

108
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:42,620
How do I know if your "settled"

109
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,939
is the same as my "settled"?

110
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:44,620
Boss.

111
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,939
Is it coconut water, mechanical legs,

112
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:47,019
or silk summer quilts?

113
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
So-solar panels.

114
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:53,180
Second, materials are expensive.

115
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,620
Photovoltaic panels and the power storage system

116
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,939
must be five thousand sets.

117
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,019
And they need to be right here.

118
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,899
Ouyang Fa, my childhood friend.

119
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,060
The recycling king.

120
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,060
Half of the containers here

121
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,220
are filled with his stockpiled old materials.

122
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,899
Turning trash into treasure, okay?

123
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,579
Do you understand cost-performance?

124
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
This batch of photovoltaic panels

125
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,259
and lithium iron phosphate batteries

126
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,740
I was planning to export.

127
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,620
They're all right here.

128
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,500
Can you give a discount?

129
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,100
How much of a discount?

130
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,100
Half price.

131
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,779
In your dreams.

132
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,220
Help!

133
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,220
My name is Steven Bai.

134
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,060
Because my wife's surname is Bai.

135
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,660
Third,

136
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,579
the LED beads

137
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,540
need to be manually installed on-site.

138
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,300
It's time-consuming and labor-intensive.

139
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,500
You only gave me five days.

140
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,339
I need at least

141
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,379
seventy-five skilled workers,

142
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,740
working in three shifts simultaneously.

143
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,379
We need to find Lao Bai for this.

144
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,939
Here, have some tea.

145
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,579
Pre-Ming Longjing tea.

146
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:48,500
Lao Bai,

147
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:49,699
this time I'm here...

148
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,060
I know what you want to say.

149
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,459
His story deeply moved me.

150
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,620
It reminds me of

151
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,540
the love with my wife,

152
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,379
a love that spanned thousands of miles,

153
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,660
and our youthful days in Shenzhen.

154
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,100
That's how this lamp factory came to be.

155
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,779
A real man doesn't shed tears easily,

156
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,060
unless his heart is truly broken.

157
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,540
Such a big factory,

158
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,500
with about a hundred people,

159
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,540
all with elders to support and children to raise.

160
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,579
The workers are simply too busy.

161
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,420
It's not about the money.

162
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,860
What do we do now?

163
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,180
Your friends

164
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,139
don't seem to be coming.

165
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,620
What are we waiting for?

166
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,420
We're waiting for the wind.

167
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,860
The wind?

168
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,699
What kind of wind?

169
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,100
The wind of chivalry.

170
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,420
You're pinching pennies over such a small amount?

171
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,500
Are you even human?

172
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,180
What's the difference from scavenging trash?

173
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,660
I'll sell you the five thousand photovoltaic panels

174
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,620
at half price.

175
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,779
I have a heart too, you know.

176
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,259
I stayed up an extra half hour last night.

177
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,500
The algorithm is sorted.

178
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,819
It only saved about

179
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:56,740
forty percent on costs.

180
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,180
Come here to buy, mention me for a discount.

181
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,699
You called my wife?

182
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,459
That little foreigner's love story

183
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,139
moved her to tears.

184
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,779
Two production lines,

185
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,819
ready to start anytime.

186
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:11,660
Let's start.

187
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,860
Start, start, start!

188
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:15,579
Let's go, start work!

189
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,180
Wang...

190
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,779
Why did they come?

191
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,660
Because of this.

192
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,180
Start work!

193
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:29,939
Start work!

194
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,379
Start work!

195
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,299
Now, Zhong, Fa, and Bai are all gathered here.

196
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,500
Brilliant minds are shining.

197
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,940
Five thousand sets of materials, all delivered as promised.

198
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,779
Seventy-five skilled workers, eager and ready.

199
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,259
Seventy-five skilled workers, eager and ready.

200
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,740
In short, we have everything we need.

201
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,179
We have the east wind when we need it.

202
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,379
We can throw this away.

203
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,500
Ours is better.

204
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:52,860
Come on, come on.

205
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,740
Thanks.

206
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Have an ice pop, have an ice pop!

207
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:55,379
Thanks.

208
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:56,460
How many years of experience?

209
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,139
Not much experience.

210
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,740
Pretty professional.

211
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,820
But the impossible order

212
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,059
has only just begun.

213
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,500
Time is tight.

214
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,179
Fortunately, brothers are united,

215
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,379
their strength can cut metal.

216
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,659
When all these suns

217
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,940
are torn off,

218
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,259
that's when your impossible order

219
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,139
will be completed.

220
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:17,019
Good idea.

221
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,259
Learn more Chinese.

222
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:27,980
It's useful.

223
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,379
When these lights come out,

224
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:32,419
they should make you feel like

225
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,740
a lamp waiting for the light.

226
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,379
Make you shout "Mamma mia!"

227
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:44,500
This...

228
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,659
Quick, come, come over!

229
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,220
Amazing!

230
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,980
Incredible!

231
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,299
It's just a bit... homely.

232
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,179
Who are you talking about?

233
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,500
But I really like it.

234
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,019
Truly a genius of industrial design.

235
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,620
It was your painting that inspired me.

236
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,340
On Xuanzang's little backpack,

237
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,019
there was also a lamp.

238
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,980
Although it's a bit homely,

239
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,460
this

240
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,940
self-adaptive intelligence level

241
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,259
is still quite advanced.

242
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,139
Look at this assembly and craftsmanship.

243
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,379
Precise.

244
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,019
Nice color scheme.

245
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,539
If I hadn't allocated

246
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,779
two production lines,

247
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,700
how could we possibly

248
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,940
have such good quality control?

249
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,139
Only I

250
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:33,779
could source materials

251
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:34,860
with such high cost-performance.

252
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,620
This isn't just the lamp shining,

253
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,379
it's practically me shining!

254
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,820
From now on, call me Ouyang Faguang (Ouyang the Shiner).

255
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:44,019
This lamp

256
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,019
can light up Bangladesh's

257
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:46,740
pitch-black nights.

258
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,220
This chair

259
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:50,500
can let the children study,

260
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,340
eat, get injections,

261
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,100
and even sleep for a while.

262
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,620
A major flood hit Bangladesh.

263
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,019
The cargo ships are leaving early

264
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,019
to deliver disaster relief supplies.

265
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,139
The ship we booked earlier

266
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,500
departs in ten hours.

267
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,259
There's not enough time.

268
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,259
How many sets of lights do we have now?

269
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,220
Three thousand two hundred.

270
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:47,419
To finish assembling all today,

271
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,700
we need three more teams.

272
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,460
That's impossible. Forget it.

273
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,419
Everyone, everyone.

274
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,179
Stop what you're doing for a moment.

275
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:00,820
Listen to me.

276
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,340
This order of ours...

277
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,539
must be completed within ten hours.

278
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:05,779
And loaded onto the truck,

279
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,940
and onto the ship.

280
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:08,500
So now, I'm hoping everyone...

281
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,779
can lend a hand.

282
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:10,620
Go make calls.

283
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,580
Contact your friends.

284
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,299
Get them to come help.

285
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,379
Let's all work together...

286
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,820
to finish this order, okay?

287
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:16,620
Hey, brother.

288
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:17,100
Hello.

289
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:17,940
Hey, big bro, come over here.

290
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,740
We have a few...

291
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,820
rather urgent orders.

292
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,460
Hey, you need to get over here.

293
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,220
Come on, just come.

294
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,259
There's another ship next week.

295
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,220
Maybe we should just wait.

296
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,019
I can wait.

297
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:25,980
But the children in the disaster can't.

298
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,820
Then I'll think of another way.

299
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,860
So what do we do now?

300
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,659
If we fail...

301
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:29,299
love will lose.

302
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,139
Love...

303
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,340
Why is it that everything I've said...

304
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,059
love...

305
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,179
Now, it's...

306
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,620
not about love anymore.

307
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:38,940
It's for those children.

308
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,860
Mom...

309
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,019
When I see them,

310
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,860
I think of myself.

311
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:48,379
I've experienced that kind of despair too.

312
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,100
I also wished to see a light in that moment.

313
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,139
Having been caught in the rain yourself,

314
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,059
you should help others hold up an umbrella.

315
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,220
But this...

316
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,980
is truly an impossible order.

317
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:07,700
It was from the very start.

318
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:11,980
Those children can be illuminated,

319
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,340
and they should be.

320
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,379
When they grow up,

321
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,220
they'll know the light that illuminated them...

322
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:21,820
came from Shenzhen.

323
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,259
Are you Wang Chong?

324
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,700
Over here.

325
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,820
This is Steven's arch-rival.

326
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,340
The one who makes robot vacuums.

327
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,580
What are you doing here?

328
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,620
To help.

329
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,179
I'm the fastest.

330
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,700
Welcome, my friend.

331
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,860
Let's move!

332
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,259
Everyone, hurry up!

333
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:12,659
Okay, okay.

334
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:13,860
Anthony, you hurry up too!

335
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,059
Everyone, put your backs into it!

336
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:17,940
Be careful, everyone be careful.

337
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,539
Five thousand.

338
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:25,779
Ship them out.

339
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,259
We did it!

340
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,740
We succeeded!

341
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:30,899
Excellent!

342
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,379
We made it.

343
00:14:58,259 --> 00:14:58,779
What's wrong?

344
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:00,419
Reluctant to leave?

345
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,379
I've decided something.

346
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,340
I'm going to propose to Adele.

347
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:08,940
So...

348
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,740
it's time to say goodbye.

349
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,740
Wang, thank you for everything.

350
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:15,980
Really.

351
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,179
Where there's a will, there's a way.

352
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,299
How do you know that saying?

353
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:30,940
You might not need to go to Bangladesh.

354
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,940
Adele!

355
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:36,740
How did you get here?

356
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,940
I came to see this place...

357
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,179
where miracles happen.

358
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:49,340
Listen.

359
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,059
In a few hours, I...

360
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:51,299
am heading to Africa for aid work.

361
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,139
Do you have the ring?

362
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:54,700
The ring?

363
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,019
Yes, yes, of course I do.

364
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,059
The ring, help me, help me.

365
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,299
Hey, the two foreigners want to get married.

366
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,580
Right now.
