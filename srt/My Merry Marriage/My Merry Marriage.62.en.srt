1
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,959
You're not...

2
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,729
heading out to meet someone,
are you?

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,459
Like who?

4
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,430
Did you perhaps get
a strange phone call or something?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,439
I did get a strange phone call.

6
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,510
What?

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,209
Someone called me
and hung up without saying a word.

8
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:45,249
I think it was a spam call.

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,749
But don't worry.

10
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,749
I know more about stuff like this
than you do, Grandma.

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,690
I'll be back.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,490
Wait.

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,130
Hey.

14
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,389
How long will you be away?

15
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,800
And where are you going?

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,670
Come on. Deciding all those things
in advance makes a trip no fun.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,100
All right.

18
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:09,899
Have a good trip.

19
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,039
You're letting me go this easily?
That's unlike you.

20
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:16,279
You said your head was on fire.
You need to cool it down.

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,109
But don't take too long.

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,350
I'll be back.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,919
That woman, how dare she...

24
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,490
Now, I'm sure
she's been hovering around Dan Soo.

25
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,899
And she even called him?
How gutsy of her.

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,630
I'll teach her a lesson.

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,309
Then, the person you dated
for a long time...

28
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,940
and got back together with
after the breakup was...

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,610
Yes.

30
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,919
It's Ms. Kang.

31
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
I'm going to...

32
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:08,100
marry her soon.

33
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,270
You're getting married?

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,199
Yes.

35
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,410
We're getting married in a month.

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,449
I thought you'd be shocked
if you heard it from someone else...

37
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,690
without me explaining
the situation to you first,

38
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,590
so I thought
I should tell you first.

39
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,710
You're headed to the office, right?

40
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,210
Then I'll drive you.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,350
No, I'll just go alone.

42
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,489
Why?

43
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,419
I want to walk a bit.

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,220
Get going.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,630
All right, then.
I'll see you later at work.

46
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,280
Why didn't you come sooner?

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,120
We tried calling you several times.

48
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,090
I was visiting Seoul,
so I figured I should stop by.

49
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,090
Something's wrong with me, right?

50
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,160
I'll refer you
to a general hospital...

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
so you can undergo
some additional tests.

52
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,500
What kinds of tests?

53
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,900
I told you to come
with your children.

54
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,569
Please just tell me.

55
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,039
It is my body, after all.

56
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,380
The blood work we did...

57
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,949
before your back surgery
showed some abnormality.

58
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,419
Please tell me.
What is wrong with me?

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,419
I think it may be a type of blood...

60
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,530
Is it cancer?

61
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,900
You need
to undergo some tests first.

62
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,639
So, if I get the tests done...

63
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,940
and get diagnosed with this cancer,

64
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,780
how can it be treated?

65
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,749
A bone marrow transplant
can be a solution.

66
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:40,820
A bone marrow transplant?

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,020
If one of your family members
is a match...

68
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,150
My family?

69
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,590
You mean...

70
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,119
I'd have to extract bone marrow
from one of my children...

71
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,390
and put that in my body?
Is that what you're saying?

72
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,390
First,

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,499
I suggest you go to the hospital
and get a complete examination.

74
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,499
No.

75
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,499
Forget it.

76
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,470
My gosh, Ms. Im.

77
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,470
I'm fine.

78
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,309
I don't need any of that.

79
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,979
So, please don't call me to say
that I need to undergo tests...

80
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,350
or do something else. Take care.

81
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:19,619

Now, I can't really use
my employee ID card...

84
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,410
to help you anymore.

85
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,450
For us to be strangers,

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,249
I should go to a faraway place
where there is no trace of you,

Hiding in the radiant sunlight...

89
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,179
is the needle that pokes your eyes.

90
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,950
Just like that,

91
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:22,580
life can suddenly bring you pain...

92
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,650
without any notice.

93
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,299
I failed to notice...

94
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,429
before everyone around me...

95
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,869
fell into deep sorrow.

96
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,760
I'll wait for you at the benches
in the center of Sowol Park.

97

come and meet me there.

98
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,869
I'll be there from 3 p.m. and on.

99
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,869

Would you please wish me luck?

102
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,189
How...

103
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,309
You asked him to meet
because you had something to say?

104
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,950
Why are you asking him to meet?

105
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,679
You wretched girl.

106
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,780
You dared to reach out to Dan Soo
with those dirty hands of yours?

107
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,489
Why? After all this time, why?

108
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,789
Are you trying to rip something off
from me by using Dan Soo?

109
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,260
I'm going to look him in the eye...

110
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,859
and ask for forgiveness.

111
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,470
Have you no shame? How dare you
think you can ask for forgiveness?

112
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,399
How dare you send
this sort of thing?

113
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,940
No...

114
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,239
If you killed my son,
you should live quietly.

115
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,580
Is it Dan Soo this time?

116
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,350
Are you trying to ruin
my grandson's future too?

117
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,590
I'm begging you.

118
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,259
Please let me see Dan Soo once.

119
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,489
That's all I wish for.

120
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,529
I don't want anything else.
I really don't.

122

Please.

123
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,499
Please. Just once...

124
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,570
Please, just this once.

125
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,379
I'll disappear after I see him once.

126

I won't show up for the rest of my life,
I swear. Please.

Please, just this once.

128

You're as good as dead already.

129
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,050
There's no way Dan Soo would want
to see the likes of you anyway.

00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:47,149
Ma'am.

131
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,119

when he'll be back.

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,729

00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:58,869
Where to?

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Who knows?

136
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,670
He might've sensed his dirty mother
trying to reach out to him.

137
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,940
So don't dream of seeing him again.
Just get lost.

near Dan Soo again,

139
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,379

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
That's what I do best.

185
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,139
Mom, please don't disappear
like this out of the blue.

186
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,269
My heart sinks every time.

187
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,580
Why should your heart sink?

188
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,109
When it's time to go,

189
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,249
I just leave with no regrets.

190
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,619
"Leave with no regrets?"

191
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:10,879
Are you writing song lyrics
or something?

192
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,119
I seriously can't believe you.

193
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,320
I can't leave my house empty
for too long.

194
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,790
If I had told you,

195
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,529
you wouldn't have let me go.

196
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,259
You came to my house
for the first time in a while,

197
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,399
but you only saw so much commotion.

198
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:27,499
When will I ever show you...

199
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,840
that I'm doing fine in life?

200
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,340
If you keep thinking...

201
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,109
that life is only hard for you,
you'll feel that much worse.

202
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,710
Others live like that too.

203
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,720
Do you think the world is
full of people living in comfort?

204
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,350
Everyone lives with worries.

205
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,720
The boy is so bright.

206
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:54,159
Childhood memories go a long way.

207
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,830
Be good to him
so he doesn't get hurt.

208
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,700
Okay, Mom.

209
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,800
Don't worry. Get some rest.

210
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,670
Don't get sick either.

211
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,670
Okay?

212
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:06,769
All right.

213
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,279
That's right.

214
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:15,920
I shouldn't get sick.

215
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,159
Mom.

216
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,330
Do you have
any new underpants for me?

217
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:32,529
Why are you asking me
for your underpants?

218
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,499
I was going to get some new ones,
but I kept forgetting.

219
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,409
I was kind of busy
with looking into daycare centers.

220
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,609
Goodness, you're asking
your mom for underpants...

221
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,340
because you don't even have a wife.

222
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:46,080
I hope you're proud of what
you've accomplished at your age.

223
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,550
I hope you're darn proud.

224
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,820
Mom, how did you end up there
while talking about underpants?

225
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,519
Just go and get your stuff back.

226
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,989
You said
you weren't going to live with her.

227
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,519
I figured
she wouldn't want to see me now.

228
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,090
Then go and beg her
to take you back.

229
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,989
Say you're there for your stuff...

230
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:02,830
and refuse to leave
while you're at it.

231
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,600
How could I do that?

232
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:07,670
Let's be honest. If Gong Hee said
she was marrying a guy like me,

233
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,769
would you let her? No, you wouldn't.

234
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,369
So how could you ask her
to live with me?

235
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,310
I have a conscience too, Mom.

236
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,210
And why won't your conscience
help me out at all?

237
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,649
Did you throw away
your conscience as a son?

238
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:19,710
Darn it.

239
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Good grief.

240
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,590
What did the daycare center say?

241
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,790
We have to wait a while.

242
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,529
Then what will you do?

243
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:33,830
I should raise him.

244
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,430
I'll raise No Ah.

245
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
What?

246
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,269
I'll raise him.

247
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,269
Mom, I've already made up my mind.
I'll raise No Ah...

248
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,070
I will raise him for you.

249
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,009
So you should just focus
on running your clinic.

250
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:50,840
- Goodness...
- All right. Let's go inside.

251
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,080
Let's take off your shoes.

252
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:54,609
- You're here.
- Hey, honey.

253
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,080
So, No Ah says...

254
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,249
that he's hungry.

255
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,420
Hey, No Ah. Are you hungry?

256
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,889
But where is Great-grandma?

257
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:10,430
What? Oh, he's right.
Where is Mother?

258
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:11,899
She went home.

259
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,739
She left behind a note as usual.

260
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:18,710
Was the house too rowdy for her?

261
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,609
Does that mean
I can't see Dad's grandma again?

262
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,480
You'll see Great-grandma again.

263
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,280
You'll keep seeing her
until you're all grown up.

264

266
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,219
Chicken!

267
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,490
Chicken! I'll fry some up for you.

268
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:39,560
- What?
- Order some.

269
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,290
Order it?

270
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,530
Kids like having delivery food, Mom.

271
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,740
I guess his mom only fed him
delivery food.

272
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,310
But where should we order it from?

273
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,080
How about the fried chicken place
in the market?

274
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:56,409
I'm ordering it now.

275
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,409
What?

276
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,580
There. I ordered it, No Ah.

277
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:02,449
You ordered
the non-spicy kind, right?

278
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,580
- What?
- What?

279
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:07,649
My goodness.
You even talk just like your dad.

280

Yes.

287

Do you want to hear
the baby's heartbeat?

288
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,060
I'll bump up the volume.

289
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:55,969
I can hear it.

290
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,600
The heartbeat.

291
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,669
The baby is healthy.

292
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,639
But you need to take it easy.

293
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,639
The heartbeat is weaker
than average.

Come back in a few days
with the baby's father.

This isn't something
you can do alone.

to take you back.

362
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,790
I told you that
I'd raise your son for you.

363
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,850
Why would you end it when you
went through all that to remarry?

364
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:45,129
How am I supposed to tell people
that my son has been divorced twice?

365
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,859
Don't be afraid of people
gossiping about you.

366
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,659
They turn around
and forget about it.

367
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,730
Okay. Good for you
that you can think like that.

368
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:54,429
You shouldn't decide...

369
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:57,040
something like that
when you're emotional.

370
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,340
You need to calm down
and talk it out...

371
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,310
Talk about what? It's already over.

372
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,379
Get out. Go back there
and beg her on your knees.

373
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,350
Tell her not to worry about the boy.

374
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,119
You guys should only think
about the two of you.

375
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:12,219
Only think about your happiness.

376
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:14,119
I told you
I'd raise your son for you!

377
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,119
Mom!

378
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,560
Do you think you're the only parent?
I'm No Ah's parent too!

379
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Hey!

380
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,830
I'm his dad.

381
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,530
I should stay by his side.

382
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,030
Hey.

383
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:27,830
Unbelievable!

384
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,899
Calm down. Goodness!

385
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:35,070
You punk. Good grief.

386
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,179
My gosh. What are you, her knight?

387
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
Pour me some more.

388
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
No Ah.

389
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,389
What's your wish for the new year?

390
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:57,459
I want to live with Mommy and Daddy
as a family.

391
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,070
My mom's name is Lee Soo Yeon.
She's a doctor.

392
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,540
My mom is really cool.

393
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:07,969
I see.

394
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,179
Do you miss your mom?

395
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,510
Yes.

396
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,679
But not that much.

397
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,350
Mom said to learn to hold it in
for her to come back.

398
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,100
You're such a good boy, No Ah.

399
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
Maeng Gong Hee.

400
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,520
Aren't you even wishing me
a happy new year?

401
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,790
You're a year older now,

402
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,760
so you need to start taking care
of your looks.

403
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,530
Happy New Year, Maeng Ggong.

404
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:23,350
So many things happened to me
this year.

405
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,590
You were the reason...

406
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,590
I could hold out, Gu Dan Soo.

407
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,530
How could you disappear like that?

408
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,459
You won't even answer my calls.

409
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,899
I left my favorite book...

410
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,100
on your bookshelf.

411
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,520
In that book,
there's a character named Momo.

412
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:04,260
Momo always smiles,
no matter how hard things get.

413
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,600
He unconditionally loves everyone,

414
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,929
just like you.

415
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,310
("The Life Before Us")

416
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,480
("The Life Before Us")

417
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,490
I hope Momo can help you...

418
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,260
find your direction in life again
when you feel lost.

419
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:52,469
That will be your name from now on.
Momo.

420
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:54,869
Don't worry.

421
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,010
From now on,

422
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,750
I'll become your whole world.

423
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,919
I won't rely on anyone.

424
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,520
I will hold you warmly...

425
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,419
like a sturdy fence, all on my own.

426
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,790
Let's do this together,

427
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:14,629
Momo.

428
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,550
(My Merry Marriage)

429
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,750
Me? I'm not in Korea right now.

430
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,980
I don't know if I'll ever go back.

431
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:39,719
Put the clinic up for sale?
What do you mean...

432
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,649
I'm guessing he might go to the US.

433
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:43,889
That's where
his son's mother is now.

434
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,590
I'll live my own life now.

435
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,530
I can't live off
of my family's help forever.

436
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,100
It's been a while.

437
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:50,399
Don't you remember me?

438
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,300
I'm Myung Ja's friend.

439
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:54,629
Seo Min Gi's mom.

440
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,399
