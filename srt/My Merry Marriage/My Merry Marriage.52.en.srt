1
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,860
Goodness. She kicked him out
without a penny to his name.

2
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,700
Now that Dan Soo has a job
and is making money,

3
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,700
she wants him back?

4
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,200
She stood there proud and said,
"I want my grandson back."

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
She has no shame.

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
Then I have a good idea.

7
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,020
Hey, what are you doing
with the crab marinade?

8
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,579
Don't do it.

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,120
Just watch.

10
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,870
I heard you were staying
with a happy family.

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,129
I had no idea you were living
in this shabby place.

12
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,900
I regret not stepping in sooner.

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,739
Dan Soo,
you need to move out of this place.

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,109
Grandma, don't forget what I said.

15
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,209
We're poor, okay?

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,349
Is that important now?

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,379
Do you want them to think
your grandson is a con man?

18
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,120
I told them
I was practically homeless.

19
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:22,779
All right.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,790
Also, why did you have to show up
in the middle of the night?

21
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,889
Because you kept refusing
to move back home!

22
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:30,219
Even so, this isn't right.

23
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,460
What did you say to me?

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,260
You told me
to always do the right thing.

25
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:40,799
All we have is coffee.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Here.

27
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:44,769
Thank you.

28
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,909
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

29
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,159
It'll taste amazing.

30
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,659
You should gulp it down.

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,900
This coffee...

32
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,169
tastes very unusual and delicious.

33
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,939
As I explained earlier,

34
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,409
I'm here because...

35
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,579
I didn't want to talk about it
in front of Dan Soo,

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,679
but you really are out of line.

37
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,690
What's out of line...

38
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,519
about me coming here
to take my grandson home?

39
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,760
You seem pretty well-off.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,829
What do you do for a living?

41
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,760
I sell clothes.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,769
What? At which market?

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,169
Why do you ask?

44
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,339
Well, I like your style.

45
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,380
Tell me where your shop is,
and I will...

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Oh, right. Okay.

47
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,750
It's not easy
to be a small business owner.

48
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,119
I run my own business too,
so I get it.

49
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,989
But no matter how difficult
your situation is,

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,489
it's wrong to kick out
your own grandson.

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,489
Dan Soo said
his relatives were mean to him...

52
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:12,190
even when he was little.

53
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,899
He said you took all his money
and didn't even feed him.

54
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,829
- What?
- And now that Dan Soo...

55
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,869
has a job
and gets a paycheck every month,

56
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,669
you're saying you want him back
to take his hard-earned money too.

57
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:25,810
Myung Ja.

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,549
It's getting late.
Don't raise your voice.

59
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,250
Let her leave.

60
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,619
Mom, you're still up?

61
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,989
You seem like a family elder, ma'am.

62
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,389
You tell me.

63
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,329
I am Dan Soo's only family.

64
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:48,399
They say
blood is thicker than water.

65
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,200
I can't even say
I want to take my grandson home?

66
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,669
The guest is leaving.

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,299
She should get going now...

68
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,769
if she wants
to get home by tomorrow.

69
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:04,549
Dan Soo has been living here
for several months now.

70
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,380
It took her all this time
to visit him,

71
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,419
so I'm guessing
she lives very far away.

72
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,419
Hurry up and let her go.

73
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,829
What's taking her so long?

74
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,459
(Bubble Up Laundry)

75
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,070
Oh, well.

76
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:27,669
What?

77
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:31,869
Goodness!

78
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,940
Why are you lurking around my house?

79
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,839
Who are you? Are you a thief?

80
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,779
What?

81
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,279
I've seen your face before.

82
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,320
This sly face.

83
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,990
I am not sly.

84
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,089
What? Is that so?

85
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,829
What matters is
what Dan Soo wants to do.

86
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:02,200
It is up to Dan Soo, after all.

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,039
Then let me have a talk with him.

88
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:06,709
- Let's go to my room, Grandma.
- All right.

89
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,839
- Come inside.
- Hey, seriously!

90
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,250
- Come on in.
- Let go of me!

91
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,810
- Hey.
- Honey, what are you doing?

92
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,820
Darn it.

93
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,149
What? Who is this man?

94
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,990
The man from that day.

95
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,519
My goodness.

96
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:23,190
Isn't he that stalker?

97
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,490
You know,
the stalker who came to our shop.

98
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,599
My gosh. You're right.

99
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,800
What is this stalker doing here?

100
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,570
Do you know this man?

101
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,500
No, I don't.

102
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,870
Well...

103
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,639
- Mr. Seo...
- No...

104
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,349
- Goodness.
- Darn it!

105
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,550
- Why is he so strong?
- Gosh, what is going on?

106
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,979
- It almost gave me a heart attack.
- I saw him...

107
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,789
lurking around the house.

108
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:53,289
He looked like he was up to no good.

109
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,789
It pays off
to be married to an ex-cop.

110
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,659
Anyway,

111
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,190
why do you think
he came to our house?

112
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,800
Now, it all makes sense.

113
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,070
What?

114
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm the one he's after,
not the sleepwalker.

115
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,940
Otherwise, why would he come
all the way here?

116
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,079
When I got a natal chart reading,
they said I was a man magnet.

117
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,110
I've been chased
by all kinds of jerks my whole life.

118
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:21,620
What can I do? Men just won't...

119
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,420
leave me alone.

120
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,560
Oh, boy.

121
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,539
What did Mr. Seo do?
Why did they call him a stalker?

122
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,639
What have you two been doing
behind my back?

123
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
I only asked you to do two things.

124
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,010
Getting married
and coming back to work.

125
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,120
Grandma.

126
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,180
I understand
why you're grateful to this family.

127
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,149
Everyone
including the family elder...

128
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,060
treats you
like a member of the family.

129
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,959
That's right.

130
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,389
I really feel like
I am a member of this family now.

131
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,130
To protect you,

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,060
they even messed with my coffee.

133
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
Your coffee?

134
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,670
They put in
the crab marinade with soy sauce.

135
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,399
They make
amazing soy sauce marinated crab.

136
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,010
It's way better for you
than drinking coffee this late.

137
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,170
Are you thrilled
that they pranked me?

138
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:23,539
So, why would you provoke them
when you couldn't beat them?

139
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,950
The women in this family
are way stronger than you.

140
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,680
They're full of energy.

141
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:30,420
So, don't provoke them again.
That was reckless of you.

142
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,490
Be quiet.

143
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,690
Let's go home, please?

144
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,459
In life,

145
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,690
you never know
when you might stumble and fall.

146
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,899
Don't you think you'd need something
to rely on at such moments?

147
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,570
That's why you need a home...

148
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,170
and your family.

149
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Why would I fall?
I'll be totally fine.

150
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,240
You see,

151
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,750
I don't want you
to go back to your childhood...

152
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,789
and cry for the rest of your life.

153
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,060
That's what scares me, Dan Soo.

154
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,899
I wanted to give you more,
but it's not much.

155
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,969
Help Gong Boo
with his wedding expenses.

156
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,579
Hey, we know you don't have money.

157
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,610
You don't make a lot of money
as a temporary worker.

158
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,479
Every day, I saved the money
I would've spent...

159
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,149
on a cup of coffee.

160
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,019
I saved up quite a bit that way.

161
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,349
Then I really can't take this money.

162
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,490
Just keep it...

163
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,990
and use it when you get married.

164
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,060
Well, I won't get married
for a while.

165
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,870
Why not? You should meet a nice man
and get married too.

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,300
I will get married, eventually.

167
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,140
But not for another ten years.

168
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,079
I'll work hard and save up
as much as I can until then,

169
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,579
so you don't need to worry about me.

170
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,680
I had to pay
for Gong Boo's education,

171
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,820
so I never even let you get a tutor.

172
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,320
You had to choose the college...

173
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,890
that offered you a scholarship,

174
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,690
so you couldn't choose the school
you wanted to attend.

175
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,390
You gave us all of your savings...

176
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,530
to help us out...

177
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,300
when your dad caused trouble.

178
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,109
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

179
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,969
We can't take this.

180
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,979
Goodness. We can't take your money.

181
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:37,810
Mom, please. Just take it.

182
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,790
Are you going through menopause
or something? What's with you?

183
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,150
My goodness.

184
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:50,759
Dad, what is with you? Here.

185
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,660
Gong Boo is remarrying.

186
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,700
Everything will go well
for the family.

187
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,170
Oh, dear.

188
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,499
I'm sorry, Gong Hee.

189
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,140
Come on. Don't say that.
We're a family.

190
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,570
It's okay. I have a lot of money.

191
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,440
Dad, why are you crying?

192
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,209
- You're a man.
- My goodness.

193
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,050
Gosh, what should I do?

194
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,119
Well, that intern.

195
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,959
Was her name Maeng Gong Hee?

196
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,030
I know she lost to Ji Na
in the contest.

197
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,390
I thought it was such a shame,

198
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,530
but she has proved that
she has what it takes to succeed.

199
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:34,369
She'll land a permanent position,
all on her own.

200
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,369
That's right, ma'am.

201
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,369
She'll be in charge of
the fashion show project with Holly.

202
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:41,640
If the fashion show goes well,
I'll give her a permanent position.

203
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,339
Train her and guide her well.

204
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,310
Holly is very difficult.

205
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,879
How did she manage
to convince Holly?

206
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,719
She's persistent
and doesn't give up.

207
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,890
Yes.

208
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,770
I'd like to talk to you
about something, ma'am.

209
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:06,400
What is it?

210
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,469
It's about my engagement
with Dan Soo.

211
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,839
Please cancel
the engagement ceremony.

212
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,650
Cancel the engagement ceremony?

213
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,089
What are you saying,
all of a sudden?

214
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,790
I apologize.

215
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,759
I should have told you sooner.

216
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,459
I couldn't tell you sooner
because of my greed.

217
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,599
Why are you doing this, Ms. Kang?

218
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,070
I thought long and hard
before arriving at this decision.

219
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,400
Please understand.

220
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:50,079
You should get back to work.

221
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,579
I'll take that...

222
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,879
as a yes, then.

223
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,119
Were you always this reckless?

224
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,719
I thought
you were a responsible person.

225
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,229
I hope
you can take responsibility...

226
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,930
for the consequences
of your decision, Ms. Kang Ji Na.

227
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,180
(Chairwoman's Office)

228
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,259
Do you know
what I had to give up today?

229
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,999
You heard what the chairwoman said.

230
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,930
She called me by my full name
to draw the line.

231
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,440
If she finds out
that I'm dating you,

232
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,609
how will she react?

233
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,140
She won't forgive us.

234
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,709
She'll fire both of us.

235
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,619
I'll take care of it.

236
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,890
After that,
we'll have to deal with my mom.

237
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,989
Are you sure you can do it?

238
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,790
We'll try and see.

239
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,070
Mom, you're visiting your daughter.
You should just take it easy.

240
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,940
Why must you
always look for work to do?

241
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,810
When they're big enough,
you need to move them...

242
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,249
to a bigger pot
so they can grow freely.

243
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,450
Plants...

244
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,119
are just like children.

245
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:39,089
If you keep them confined
to a small pot,

246
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:40,219
they can't grow
as much as they want.

247
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:43,060
Look at this. This is much better.

248
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,759
Mom.

249
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,430
Did you give your ring
to someone again?

250
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,700
- Goodness, no.
- What?

251
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,170
No! It feels heavy on my hand.

252
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,570
That's why I don't wear it
these days.

253
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:59,540
Seriously, Mom.
Why would you do that?

254
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,680
Who did you give it to? Myung Ok?

255
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,180
No. Also,

256
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,910
I can give it to whomever I want.

257
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,280
It's my ring.

258
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,180
Who are you to tell me
what not to do with it?

259
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,520
Mom. What's with you, seriously?

260
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,119
Why would you give it away?
Who did you give it to?

261
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,030
Mom, it's me.

(Director Maeng Gong Boo,

263
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,560
Grandma gave me money.

264
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,969
She told me not to tell you,

265
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,300
but I thought you should know.

266
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,469
She has no money.
Why did she give me this?

267
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
It almost made me cry.

268
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
What?

269
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,879
I'm debating what to do
with Grandma's money.

270
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,410
I want to...

271
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,950
do something meaningful with it.

272
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,790
Get up, Mom.

273
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,700
Why?

274
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,959
- Let's go somewhere.
- What?

275
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,570
Goodness. Where?

276
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,969
Come on. Let's get changed.

(Hong So Hee)

278
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:06,270
Matching rings
for you and your mother?

279
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:10,239
Yes, I want to get the same ring
for my mother and myself.

280
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,979
Hey, why would you do that?

281
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,180
Be quiet.

282
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,579
I've never seen a mother
and daughter get matching rings.

283
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:18,790
It's so lovely to see.

284
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,560
Let me measure your size.

285
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,160
Which finger
would you like to wear it on?

286
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,890
Mom, let's wear the ring
on the index finger.

287
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,329
My goodness.
Why would you get matching rings?

288
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,599
Oh, dear.

289
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,270
- Measure our ring sizes.
- Goodness.

290
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:41,609
Open wide.

291
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,249
Isn't it good?

292
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:51,520
It melts in your mouth.

293
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:54,589
You love meat, Mom.

294
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,020
I should buy you a lot of meat.

295
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,489
Goodness, don't bother.

296
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:01,129
Mom, seeing you enjoy good food
makes me happy.

297
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,629
Do you not want me to be happy?

298
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,129
No, I do not. My goodness.

299
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,300
I want to be happy today,

300
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
so just do as I say. Okay?

301
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:10,739

Mom.

312
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,359
I'm wearing our ring
on this finger...

313
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,129
because the index finger
is used to point in a direction.

314
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,839
You helped me
find direction in life, Mom.

315
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,570
That's why I'm wearing it
on this finger.

316
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,680
I'm still...

317
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:27,279
walking the path you showed me.

318
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,019
When I feel like I keep wobbling,

319
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,289
I'll look at this ring...

320
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,860
and pick myself up to walk straight.

321
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,959
This ring is like my promise
to walk my path...

322
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,900
just as you had shown me...

323
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,900
and to always remember...

324
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,039
everything you taught me, Mom.

325
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,069
Promise me one more thing.

326
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
What?

327
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,239
I want you...

328
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,979
to have some fun.

329
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,650
Stop worrying all the time.

330
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,420
Have fun and enjoy life.

331
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:08,519
Mom.

332
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:12,590
In the past, I thought...

333
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,529
someone else would deliver
my happiness to me.

334
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,529
So I just waited,
with my mouth wide open.

335
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:20,930
But I ended up getting hurt.

336
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,039
So, I won't be like that anymore.

337
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,870
You have to find
your own happiness in life.

338
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:28,340
I'll make it...

339
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,580
and deliver it myself, to me.

340
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,110
That's right. If you're happy,
that's all that matters.

341
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,049
Do what makes you happy,
at every moment.

342
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:40,620
Okay, I will.

343
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,319
Mom, I want you
to promise me something too.

344
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,729
What is it?

345
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,229
Stay healthy, please.

346
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,459
Stay by my side for a long time.

347
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,840
So, I have your promise, right?

348
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,140
I want us
to take walks together like this...

349
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,840

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,080
No way.

354
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,509

to prepare for the wedding?

355
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,620
I love you, darling

00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,620
Finally, it's starting to feel real.

358
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,029
How do you feel?
This is your second wedding.

359
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Does it feel different?

360
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I'm not sure.

361
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,370
Do you still feel like
marriage is difficult?

362
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,499
Are you still traumatized by it?

363
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,870
You said you were burdened
by the thought of...

364
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:07,370
having to take care of your family.

365
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,509
Yes, it's still difficult.

366
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,239
What's so difficult about it?

367
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:13,580
In the past,

368
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,019
Soo Yeon only had one condition...

369
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,920
when we got married.

370
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,049
That I should never cheat on her.

371
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,360
She said
her mother suffered all her life...

372
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,489
because her father was a cheater.

373
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,259
But I failed to fulfill...

374
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,600
that one condition.

375
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,670
Your ex-wife's name...

376
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,640
is Soo Yeon?

377
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,809
It's such a feminine name.

378
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,610
Was she...

379
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,150
your first love?

380
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
What?

381
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,850
Oh, my.

382
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,049
I guess she was.

383
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,959
We met in college.

384
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,590
Everything was fine
until we got married.

385
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,390
Although it ended very badly.

386
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,700
Don't tell me...

387
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,499
you still keep in touch with her.

388
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,029
I really hate it when men do that.

389
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:08,299
Of course,
I don't talk to her anymore.

390
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,069
I don't even know where she lives
or what she's up to.

391
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,870
She blocked me.

392
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,640
That's something to brag about.

393
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,309
Even if...

394
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,549
I do something that disappoints you,

395
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,819
please don't run away.

396
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,459
You can nag me and yell at me
all you want.

397
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,620
I don't care what you do.

398
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,090
Just don't give up on me.

399
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,459
Stay with me until the end.

400
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,729
You'll do that, right?

401
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,799
You'd better not disappoint me.

402
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,370
Your first love was an angel.

403
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,140
I will not leave like that.

404
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,410
I will bite you
and won't let you go.

405
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,739
People call me the Pungsan dog
for a reason.

406
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:51,410
Once I bite something,
I never let it go.

407
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,380
That's exactly what I want.

408
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,709
Please...

409
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,479
don't vanish from my life.

410
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,890
Don't worry, okay?

411
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,019
Even when my hair is all white,

412
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:05,759
I'll be glued to you like this
at all times.

413
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,459
You have to adore me
even when I'm a granny.

414
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,299
You're already old.

415
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,930
Hey.

416
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,299
What?

417
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Grandma, it's so pretty.

418
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,249
But aren't you supposed to wear it
on your ring finger?

419
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:30,749
The ring finger is
for your wedding ring.

420
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,289
Actually, I've always been curious.

421
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:36,620
Why must you wear your wedding ring
on your ring finger?

422
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:39,229
Mom, there's a story behind it.

423
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,130
In the old days, people believed
that the vein in your ring finger...

424
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,360
was directly connected
to your heart.

425
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,670
Also, the ring finger...

426
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,539
can't stand on its own.

427
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:52,569
Look.

428
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,039
- Like this.
- Oh, you're right.

429
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,880
I see. It means husbands and wives
should rely on each other.

430
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,450
That's why you have to wear it
on the ring finger.

431
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,519
That's right, Grandma.

432
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,950
Forget relying on each other.

433
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,420
So many married couples
fight all the time.

434
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,959
Our rings are prettier.

435
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
I'm jealous.

436
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,600
I should've gotten one too.

437
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,170
Matching rings
for three generations.

438
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,340
- How pretty.
- Yes, they're so pretty.

439
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,509
The matching rings
for me and my mother...

440
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:33,450
are like a promise to myself that
I won't disappoint my mom again.

441
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,650
They're like my confession
that I'll love my mom forever.

442
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,650
At the same time,
they're like a promise...

443
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,390
that we'll never shackle
each other down.

444
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,340
Wait.

445
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,680
I enjoyed staying here.

446
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:11,620
Meeting you again...

447
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,650
and bickering with you too.
All of it.

448
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,860
My grandma wants me
to move back home.

449
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,299
That's great.

450
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,200
Do you really want me to leave?

451
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,039
It'll be better
than renting the room here.

452
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,440
Besides, it's not like
we can live together forever.

453
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Do you really...

454
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,019
want me gone?

455
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,029
Hey.

456
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,499
I told you to stay away.

457
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,299
I don't care if you have to move in
with your grandma or your grandpa.

458
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:00,569
Do whatever you want.

459
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:13,380
You're not letting me do...

460
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,180
anything I want.

461
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,100
I was totally fine with living
with Snot Face Geon.

462
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:36,640
Can I really...

463
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:38,940
not live...

464
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,110
with Dan Soo anymore?

465
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:58,319
My gosh, Dan Soo.

466
00:25:58,930 --> 00:25:59,930
Come on in.

467
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,630
You're still working.

468
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Yes.

469
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,999
What brings you by?

470
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:07,569
Are you running an errand?

471
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,499
You said I could come and see you
if I needed someone to talk to.

472
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:12,569
You said you'd be all ears.

473
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:16,539
Oh, yes. Of course.

474
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,239
Have a seat.

475
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,719
It's late,

476
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,690
so decaf coffee would be better,
right?

477
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:30,819
My grandma...

478
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,789
came to see me.

479
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,729
What? Why?

480
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,569
She wants me to move back home.

481
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,769
She's afraid I'd approach him...

482
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:46,469
and tell him I'm his mother.

483
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:48,110
That's why she wants to take him.

484
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,779
I never thought
she'd come here looking for me.

485
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,719
So?

486
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,860
Will you move back home?

487
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
No, Geon.

488
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,499
I finally found you. Don't go.

489
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:17,600
I'm debating what to do.

490
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,539
Well...

491
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,610
Why don't you...

492
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,979
just stay here?

493
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,319
I mean...

494
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:36,719
everyone will be sad if you leave.
That's why.

495
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,459
Oh, I haven't seen that ring before.

496
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,330
Oh, this.

497
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,370
It's a meaningful ring to me.

498
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,309
But I had a bit of a situation,
so I couldn't wear it.

499
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:55,509
I guess
someone gave it to you as a gift.

500
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:57,779
Yes, someone.

501
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,110
Someone who is very cool...

502
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,920
and has a big heart.

503
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,390
Dan Soo.

504
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,190
You remind me of that person.

505
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,009
(My Merry Marriage)

506
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,910
The bride and the groom
will enter now.

507
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:36,350
I, Maeng Gong Boo,

508
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,180
will love and respect
Eom Hong Dan...

509
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,420
in plenty and in want,
in joy and in sorrow.

510
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,920
Gong Hee, are you all right?

511
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,459
Did I eat something bad?

512
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,459
Why do I feel so queasy?

513
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,660
Where are you going?

514
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,400
We have to take our picture!

515
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,459
Maeng Gong Boo.

516
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,469
I came to congratulate you.

517
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:53,529
I can give you a hug, right?

518
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,370
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
