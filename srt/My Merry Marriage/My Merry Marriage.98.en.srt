1
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,409
How could you leave Mom alone
at a nursing home?

2
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:25,709
Myung Ja, are you out of your mind?

3
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,509
I can't believe
you left Mom alone there.

4
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,409
What will people say
when they hear...

5
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,019
Mom is at a nursing home?

6
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:34,349
They'll point a finger at us and say
Mom has such horrible children.

7
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:35,919
You're afraid of
what others might say?

8
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:38,619
Did you ever call Mom
to see how she was doing?

9
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:41,790
Did you ever visit her
to check in on her?

10
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:45,299
Why are you all suddenly acting like
you're such filial children?

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,470
Hey, how could you say that?

12
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:50,329
Because of our situations...

13
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:51,700
What situation?

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,439
Must you be in the right situation
to be good to Mom?

15
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,670
Did Mom raise us because
she was in a comfortable situation?

16
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,479
Have you wondered why Mom wants
to stay at the nursing home?

17
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,750
Do you even know
why she made such a decision?

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,280
I don't want to hear it.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,449
Go back there and bring Mom home.
Then we'll...

20
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,390
Then you go there
and bring her home.

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,350
You guys, Myung Ok, and Myung Hee.

22
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,390
The four of you can go there
and bring her home.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,829
I don't like this either.
I'm scared too.

24
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:18,329
But what was I supposed to do?
Mom said it was her wish.

25
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,960
Mom asked me...

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,299
to grant her final wish.

27
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:26,669
Please, I beg you.
Can the four of you bring her home?

28
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,469
Persuade Mom and bring her home!

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,749
Granting Mom's wish...

30
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:39,279
is the only thing
I can do for her now.

31
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:40,550
What was I supposed to do?

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,990
I can't even do that for her?

33
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,460
As her daughter?

34
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,199
I see that we're on the same page.

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,240
I think we'll work well together
as business partners.

36
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,509
Oh, right. There is one condition
I'd like to add.

37
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:05,279
Please go ahead and tell me.
Whatever it may be, Holly.

38
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,749
Don't we have
something to talk about?

39
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:18,490
If it's about what happened
between me and Kang Ji Na,

40
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,719
let's give it a rest.

41
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,759
It's just something from the past.

42
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,529
It's all over now.
You know that too.

43
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:25,529
I'm not trying to
talk about the past.

44
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,400
It's still going on now.

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
You got the wrong idea.

46
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:31,099
We were just working together.
That's all.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,839
Don't use your weird imaginations
to pick a fight with me.

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,740
"Weird imaginations?"

49
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:37,480
Then what were all the things
I saw and heard?

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,240
Everything you're imagining...

51
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,180
is just a delusion, so stop it.

52
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,050
Don't say anything strange
to other people...

53
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,349
and make them misunderstand too.

54
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,580
Who would I say this stuff to?

55
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,390
The chairwoman put me in charge
of a very important project.

56
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,330
She said she'd have Gu Dan Soo
report to me now.

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,589
This is a very important time.

58
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:59,760
Please don't let the chairwoman
hear about this stuff.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,640
Are you going out again?

60
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:08,469
Where are you going?

61
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,140
It's an important call.

62
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,439
It's about work.

63
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,330
Hey, I told you not to call
whenever you wanted.

64
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,559
We should celebrate
defeating Gu Dan Soo...

65
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,730
and having
our project take priority.

66
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,529
I prepared champagne.

67
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Later.

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,930
Come right away.
I can't wait for very long.

69
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:44,039
Well, I have an urgent meeting.
I have to go.

70
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,240
Don't go.

71
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,349
My stomach...

72
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,420
It hurts.

73
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,819
Get some rest. I'll be quick.

74
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,219
It's urgent, so I have to go.

75
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,299
(Emergency Medical Center)

76
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,510
You must've been
under a lot of stress.

77
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:49,609
It could lead to miscarriage,
so be careful.

78
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,479
The food you eat
will go to your baby,

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,650
and your baby can feel
what you're feeling.

80
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,580
Try your best
to only think positive thoughts.

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,279
Never push yourself too hard.

82
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,599
I wanted to just let myself crumble.

83
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,070
I just...

84
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,909
wanted to let myself sink.

85
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,739
But I guess...

86
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,450
you could feel
what I was feeling too.

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,679
It must've been stressful
for you too.

88
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:35,150
Mom's sorry.

89
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,690
I'm so sorry.

90
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,400
I wanted us to celebrate
before the day ended.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,070
Just the two of us.

92
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:58,109
I feel like I can breathe
now that I'm with you.

93
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,239
I was feeling suffocated.

94
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,210
See?

95
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,750
Did you think
you could live without me?

96
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,979
I was going to.

97
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,089
I believed I'd be okay.

98
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,349
And?

99
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:12,089
Do you think you've succeeded?

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,260
Look at us now.

101
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,830
I wouldn't call this a success.

102
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,299
I've realized this
even though it's too late now.

103
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,770
If I can be by your side every day,

104
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,739
that's my definition of success.

105
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,710
Don't say stuff like that.

106
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,140
Why not?

107
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,250
You don't like it?

108
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,310
I should say I don't like it,

109
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,719
but I can't even push you away.

110
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:42,520
Everything is a mess.

111
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:45,620
Who cares if it's a mess?

112
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:47,589
I like that...

113
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,460
we can be here together
at this very moment.

114
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
I love this like crazy.

115
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,109
Even if this might destroy us
in the end?

116
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,839
Yes, I still like this.

117
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,739
I don't need anything anymore.

118
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,650
Without Seo Min Gi,

119
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,820
I'm nothing.

120
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,339
This little Maeng Ggong.

121
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,310
Is she still not home yet?

122
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,880
Or is she just keeping quiet
when she is home?

123
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,359
Are you just getting home now?

124
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:55,289
Why? You should just live
with your parents.

125
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,929
If you like staying
with your parents so much,

126
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,700
you should just pack up
and go live with them.

127
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm going to go upstairs
and get some rest.

128
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,599
Oh, my. I'm speaking right now.

129
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,909
She is ignoring my words
more and more.

130
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,279
Gosh, I'm so stressed!

131
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,190
Stress ages the skin so much.

132
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:22,719
Darn it!

133
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:24,989
Oh, no. My head hurts.

134
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,630
Oh, dear.

135
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,069
What are you doing up?

136
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,939
I'm making
Mom's favorite twisted donuts...

137
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,100
to bring them to her.

138
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,539
Goodness, make them in the morning.

139
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:16,640
You should get some sleep.

140
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,579
How stubborn you are.

141
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,919
Give it here. I'll do it.

142
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,230
When I...

143
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,559
left Mom at the nursing home,

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,870
she was sleeping.

145
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,169
She's a light sleeper,

146
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,610
so she normally wakes up
at the smallest sound.

147
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,709
But she just kept sleeping.

148
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,350
Well, she must've been tired.

149
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,419
Was she really sleeping
because she was tired?

150
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:02,319
Or...

151
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:05,159
was she pretending to be asleep?

152
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,890
If she was pretending,

153
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:09,890
why did she do that?

154
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,669
Did she want to...

155
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,069
finish saying goodbye sooner?

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,640
Or maybe...

157
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,709
it was because she was upset.

158
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,909
Maybe she thought
I was a heartless daughter...

159
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,779
for leaving her there on her own.

160
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,720
My goodness.

161
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,490
Come on. Don't you know Mother?

162
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,990
She's not upset.

163
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,360
I should've just carried her here
on my back.

164
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,630
I should've asked the nursing home
to give us a ride home.

165
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,699
That's what I should've done.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,199
Myung Ja.

167
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,900
Let's go now. Let's go and get Mom.

168
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,539
This won't do.

169
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,039
How could I leave Mom there alone?

170
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,779
How could I get a good night's sleep
when Mom is there by herself?

171
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,010
Gyeong Tae, let's go now.

172
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,610
Let's go and get Mom, okay?

173
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,549
All right.

174
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:12,090
Hey, we'll leave
when the sun is up, okay?

175
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,890
All right.

176
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:26,770
Goodness, I can smell something good
outside the front gate.

177
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,939
What are you making
this early in the morning?

178
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,740
You made twisted donuts?

179
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,610
They're Mom's favorite.

180
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,439
I'll take some to her
at the nursing home.

181
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,980
Oh, my.
Did you fry these all night long?

182
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,520
I couldn't sleep anyway.

183
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,490
Why did you make so many?

184
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,419
Seriously, when you cook something,
you go all out.

185
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,120
The whole village
could have a party.

186
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,429
It would be nice for the elders
at the nursing home to share.

187
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:53,329
Gong Hee likes these too,
so I'll give her some.

188
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,100
Okay. Oh, right.

189
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,569
Ssang Sook came to the shop
the other day.

190
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,640
Gosh,
I forgot to tell you about that.

191
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,270
Ssang Sook? Why?

192
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,939
She was trying to find out
what Gong Hee said to us...

193
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,439
when she came home.

194
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,380
They say a guilty conscience
is a hard thing to hide.

195
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm sure she feels guilty
about something.

196
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,520
Gong Hee looked upset
when she was here too.

197
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:18,090
- Really?
- Hey, what is this smell?

198
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,120
Mom, did you make donuts?

199
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,130
This is it.

200
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,600
I've tried twisted donuts
from famous bakeries,

201
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,329
but they're no match
for the ones you make.

202
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
Hey!

203
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,900
She made them for your grandma.

204
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,909
Stop eating them.

205
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,870
Oh, is that what they are for?

206
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,980
My goodness.

207
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,010
By the way, do you remember that?

208
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,380
When Gong Boo was little,

209
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,579
he hid these donuts
under his blankets,

210
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,289
saying others would steal them.
It was a sticky mess.

211
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,260
You gave him a huge spanking
that day.

212
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,730
You should just forget
that kind of stuff.

213
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,400
Mom, you didn't get any sleep again,
did you?

214
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,230
I'll go and see Grandma
on the weekend too.

215
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll go and check on her health,
so don't worry too much.

216
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:07,539
Hey.

217
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,809
- Get over here, you little...
- Oh, my.

218
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,409
- What?
- Hey!

219
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:11,610
- What is it?
- Darn it.

220
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,579
Hey, how could you throw away
a half-eaten popsicle...

221
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,549
under your blanket?

222
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,179
When I woke up,
I felt something sticky on my foot.

223
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,850
My gosh. It got all over me.

224
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,990
Goodness, what is this?

225
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,590
I didn't throw it away.

226
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:26,620
I hid it there
so I could eat it later.

227
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,289
Oh, my. Is that right?

228
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,900
Is hiding food under blankets
a hereditary trait too?

229
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,929
- He sure is your son, Gong Boo.
- He's my son.

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,270
It's because Mom eats everything
when I leave food.

231
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,610
What? When did I do that?

232
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,909
- Neener.
- What?

233
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,939
Hey, stop right there!

234
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,110
- Private Maeng No Ah.
- Come here!

235
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,909
- What's the situation?
- Hey, get over here.

236
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:53,120
- Gosh, what a crazy morning.
- Come here.

237
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,949
There's never
a quiet day in this house.

238
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:00,419
Here.

239
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,569
Oh, what's this?

240
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,169
Eat these with Gong Hee at work.

241
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,510
I made them for Gong Hee's grandma,

242
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,340
but Gong Hee likes them too.

243
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:25,179
I was thinking about
what food I should get for her too.

244
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:26,419
I guess moms are the best, indeed.

245
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,919
I'll be sure to deliver it to her.

246
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,289
Thank you
for always taking care of Gong Hee.

247
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,390
I try not to,

248
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,029
but I just end up
thinking about her.

249
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,829
Seriously, she's still Maeng Ggong,

250
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,529
the kid you have to
keep your eyes on.

251
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,600
I'm glad she has you.

252
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,329
Take good care of Gong Hee
at the office too.

253
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,010
She doesn't tell me about
any difficulties she goes through.

254
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:49,970
Please do me this favor.

255
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,779
Of course. You know me.

256
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,010
I'm her direct supervisor, you know.

257
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,679
I won't even blink at work
to watch her...

258
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,650
I mean, I'll take care of her,
so don't worry.

259
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,720
So...

260
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:12,429
Well, I called today's meeting
because...

261
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:17,370
It was because...
How should I say this?

262
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,740
Gosh, I don't know
how to bring this up.

263
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:24,140
The Holly project
will be put on hold.

264
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,309
But why, all of a sudden?

265
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:31,779
It's being put on hold?

266
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,150
Then, all the work we've done
is going up in smoke?

267
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,689
Come on. Let's calm down.

268
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,130
It's just for the time being.

269
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,029
The chairwoman's orders
were to focus on...

270
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,069
Mr. Seo's collaboration project
with Heirmez.

271
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:51,669
All of you in the TF Team...

272
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:54,000
just have to do your best
in your own places.

273
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:59,880
Mr. Gu, I need you to do your best
for my project from now on...

274
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,709
as per the chairwoman's orders.

275
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,419
I think we left out
one important thing.

276
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:17,159
Ms. Kang, who was previously
removed from the project,

277
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,760
will be working with me
from now on too.

278
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,400
All of you in Design
will provide support for Ms. Kang.

279
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,870
So, Ms. Kang and Mr. Seo,
just the two of you?

280
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,640
Gosh, that image is rather...

281
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,809
What's so strange about that?

282
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,850
We're just finding
our own places again.

283
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,250
We were a team...

284
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:42,490
from the beginning, anyway.

285
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:47,459
It's just for work.

286
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,429
Shall we discuss the details?

287
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:50,789
Ms. Maeng.

288
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,429
Please come and see me
after the meeting.

289
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:56,529
Pardon?

290
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,140
We should talk about our project
that's been put on hold...

291
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:00,699
out of the blue.

292
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
What?

293
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Here.

294
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
What's this?

295
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,529
Your mom made twisted donuts.

296
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,029
She asked me to give you this.

297
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:25,229
She said you liked twisted donuts.

298
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,330
How's Mom doing?

299
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,429
She must be devastated.

300
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,040
I spoke with Gong Boo on the phone.
He told me...

301
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,600
Grandma didn't come home with Mom.

302
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:38,209
She and Mr. Maeng will visit
the nursing home again today.

303
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,580
I really hope they persuade Grandma
to come home.

304
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,479
What's with your face today?

305
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,120
You look like
you got no sleep last night.

306
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
This is why
we're all worried about you.

307
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,390
Both your mom...

308
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,330
and I are worried.

309
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,030
Stop worrying about me
and start worrying about yourself.

310
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,300
What did you do to fall out of favor
with the chairwoman?

311
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,100
Why did she put the project
on pause?

312
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:08,209
My gosh. I wanted to wrap up
the Holly project nicely,

313
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:11,009
- so I've been working so hard...
- Oh, please.

314
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,580
Calm down.

315
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:14,880
It's not like
the project has been scrapped.

316
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,979
It's just been put on hold
for the time being.

317
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,150
It's only temporary.

318
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,650
Just know that this will pass soon,
and let it go.

319
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,519
Goodness.
You sure have a way with words.

320
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,590
Are you and Chairwoman Hwang
having problems?

321
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,689
The project has been put on pause
as per her orders.

322
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,459
Did something happen?

323
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,630
Don't worry.

324
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,259
I told you
to put your worries to rest.

325
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:36,469
I have a plan.

326
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,199
You're always so laid-back.

327
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,739
I'm capable,
and I'm confident I can do well,

328
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:42,739
so why would I be worried?

329
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:44,469
Those who aren't capable...

330
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:46,479
and aren't sure of themselves
are the ones who worry.

331
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,650
Gu Dan Soo,
you really are all grown up now.

332
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,280
This...

333
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,949
Thanks for the heartfelt delivery.

334
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:04,929
I guess she can't even
force herself to smile.

335
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,870
Why is it...

336
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,699
that you look so lonely today?

337
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:20,780
Welcome to Heirmez Korea.

338
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,719
Thank you. I'm Seo Min Gi,
General Manager of Jayce Fashion.

339
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,620
And this is Ms. Kang Ji Na,
our design manager.

340
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,890
I look forward to working with you.

341
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,219
Likewise.

342
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,459
But why did you bring along
your design manager?

343
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,030
What do you mean?

344
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,030
Oh, I guess
you haven't heard the news yet.

345
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,100
He should be here any minute now.

346
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,679
Holly, you came.

347
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,150
Of course, I should be here.

348
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,320
I suppose you were greeting them.

349
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,759
Why are you here?

350
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,630
I was very surprised
when you got in touch with us.

351
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,560
I thought you were busy
with a different project.

352
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,070
Why would I turn down
a better opportunity?

353
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,939
It's a chance to work
with a global brand.

354
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,870
And Jayce Fashion
just so happens to have me,

355
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,169
an internationally renowned
fashion designer.

356
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,979
Right, Mr. Seo?

357
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:34,249
And Ms. Kang?

358
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:46,830
Let's take a look at Heirmez's
sales growth rate in Korea.

359
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,269
The sales numbers keep growing,

360
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,699
but the sales growth rate
has been declining since last year.

361
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,469
And you already know the reason.

362
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:55,370
The sales are mainly generated
by specific boutiques...

363
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,909
and through specific age groups.

364
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Through the collaboration
with Jayce Fashion...

365
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
One moment, please.

366
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,249
Holly.

367
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,350
May I see that?

368
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,219
Oh, this?

369
00:21:09,449 --> 00:21:11,350
It's just a sketch.

370
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,120
It's like a doodle.

371
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,489
No.

372
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:18,659
You can't call this a mere doodle.

373
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,600
This is a work of art that shows
the essence of your design, Holly.

374
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,870
This is incredible.

375
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,409
You created a work of art like this
in just a few moments.

376
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:30,469
I knew it.

377
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:34,009
You have such a good eye,

378
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,080
as someone
leading a global brand should.

379
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,719
Holly, with you on board,

380
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,320
this project is bound
to be successful.

381
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,989
Thank you for giving us
a chance to collaborate...

382
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,390
with an internationally renowned
designer.

383
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,759
It's my pleasure. I'll be in touch.

384
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,709
From now on, please share
all of your reports with me.

385
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,419
Your proposal had nothing
but just a bunch of numbers.

386
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,519
So, the international designer,
Holly, should step in.

387
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,620
What can I do?

388
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:19,120
What is going on?

389
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,729
Why did you show up here?

390
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:25,999
Did you sleep through the meeting?

391
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,830
As Holly,
I'm in charge of this project now.

392
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:33,900
Mr. Seo and Ms. Kang,
you two will work under me now.

393
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,209
Mr. Gu Dan Soo,
I didn't think you'd be like this.

394
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,709
You're nastier than I thought.

395
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,749
Are you saying
you'll steal our project from us?

396
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,179
"Us?"

397
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,689
Who pulled a nasty trick first?

398
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,749
Goodness. They say
those without a conscience...

399
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:52,919
have no shame.

400
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,489
It's so true.

401
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,929
Sorry, I underestimated you.
You're worse than I thought.

402
00:22:58,499 --> 00:22:59,499
I give you that.

403
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
What did you say?

404
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,570
Do you think
I will let you have your way?

405
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:08,300
You'll have no choice but to let me.

406
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,140
Don't you want to stay
at Jayce Fashion no matter what?

407
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,909
I know you've prepared a lot
for the project.

408
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,919
Will you be okay if you get fired?

409
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,989
Oh, as soon as
we're back in the office,

410
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:25,919
send me all the designs
you've worked on so far.

411
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,719
Right away.

412
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,769
Why did she come back so quickly?

413
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:41,169
Didn't she say
she had a meeting with Heirmez?

414
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:42,769
She did.

415
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,780
My goodness.

416
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,820
There, you have them now.

417
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,550
Everything I've designed so far.

418
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,560
Gong Hee, why did you design it...

419
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:05,959
without my permission?

420
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,530
It's just trash.

421
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,810
What are you doing now?

422
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,090
Trash belongs in the trash can.
Am I wrong?

423
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,449
Mr. Gu Dan Soo!

424
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:33,320
Stop copying others' designs.

425
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,659
Work on becoming a better designer.

426
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,530
You're our design manager.

427
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,199
Aren't you embarrassed?

428
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
How dare you talk about my designs
in that manner?

429
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
How dare you!

430
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,310
If you want to raise your voice
in front of Holly,

431
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,840
become a better designer first.

432
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,979
Shouldn't you at least...

433
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,749
give your team some hope so that
they can trust you as their manager?

434
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,880
At this rate,

435
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,120
you might really be remembered
as the worst designer ever.

436
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,429
Darn it!

437
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,929
Oh, my goodness.

438
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,969
Gosh, what was that?

439
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,239
What was that all about?
My goodness. It serves her right.

440
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,810
It really serves her right.

441
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,110
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

442
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:27,979
That was intense.

443
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:30,610
I bet Ice Witch's pride is crushed.

444
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,979
Hey, I feel like he came in
and dropped a bomb on her.

445
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,320
My, that was just great.

446
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,929
Did something happen?

447
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,830
Hey, Gong Hee. Be careful here.

448
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,600
Just now, Mr. Gu...

449
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,669
dropped a bomb in the office.

450
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,469
What? A bomb?

451
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,070
Oh, my.

452
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,439
Anyway, didn't you say you needed
to take the afternoon off?

453
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,739
Yes. I'll leave as soon as
I'm done organizing the samples.

454
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,080
Goodness. Don't worry about it.

455
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,909
We'll do it. Just get going, okay?

456
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:07,820
Gong Hee,
you've been looking tired lately.

457
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,249
Take it easy.

458
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,019
Yes, I'm going to.

459
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:15,989
Is this what you wanted?

460
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,259
If you've done
something embarrassing,

461
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,100
you should be embarrassed.
Am I wrong, Mr. Seo?

462
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:25,870
You'd better do a good job too.

463
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:27,969
If things go wrong,
it'll be all on you.

464
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:31,669
You said you'd be in charge
of the project from now on.

465
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:33,979
If it goes well,
it's all thanks to me.

466
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,580
If it doesn't go well,
I should blame you.

467
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,280
Mr. Seo,
I know you really like to...

468
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,050
take responsibility.

469
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:00,600
Hey, what are you doing
all by yourself?

470
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:06,709
Oh, I felt that
I'd been neglecting Momo.

471
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,850
I'm going to eat well from now on.

472
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:12,650
So, you made all this food
just for yourself?

473
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,479
Yes.

474
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:17,850
Would you like to join me?
The meat is grilled to perfection.

475
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:20,390
I'm fine.

476
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,689
I don't want to get an upset stomach
from eating in front of you.

477
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:27,199
I told you to quit your job
since it would be hard on you,

478
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,330
but you didn't even listen.

479
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:36,439
Goodness.
Hey, are you getting a phone call?

480
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:37,939
Oh, this?

481
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,679
It's music for the baby.

482
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,409
My gosh.

483
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:45,719
Fine. Eat well and enjoy the music.

484
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:50,790
I'll leave now
so I don't disturb your peace.

485
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:02,729
Momo.

486
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,929
Are you okay?

487
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,269
Don't worry.

488
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:09,209
I will protect you.

489
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:12,979
I'll become stronger. I won't waver.

490
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:16,249
Let's hang in there.

491
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,150
We can do it.

492
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:32,530
(My Merry Marriage)

493
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:34,060
Mom.

494
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,870
Right now, I'm preparing
for my last days as a mother.

495
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,269
- Are you okay?
- No.

496
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,640
I nearly lost Momo.

497
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,140
"Quit your job
for the sake of the baby."

498
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,509
Is that all you can say?

499
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:44,870
I told you not to get so sensitive.

500
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,179
Go to the office in France.

501
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:47,739
If I succeed within a year,

502
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,409
you will accept her as family, right?

503
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:51,050
I'll show you...

504
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,479
who the heir of Jayce Fashion is
for certain.

505
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:55,150
So, open your eyes wide
and watch me.

506
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,919
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
