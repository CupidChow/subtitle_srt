(Episode 82)

3
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,840
Your collar is crooked.

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,939
You're such a klutz.

5
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,030
There you are.

6
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,430
I've been looking for you.

7
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,729
Yes, we had to talk
about the project.

8
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,670
You don't think something is
going on between us, do you?

9
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,409
What could be going on?

10
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,509
Do you feel guilty about something?

11
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,509
Why would I?

12
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,379
We're working, you know.

13
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,379
Yes, exactly.

14
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,549
So, why did you ask me
such a question?

15
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:27,759
Let's go.

16
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
What's up?

17
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,259
I think Mother is upset
because of me.

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,830
I wanted to ask you what I could do
to lift her mood.

19
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,900
I see. Well...

20
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,839
What does she like?

21
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,210
(Sunny Daycare Center)

22
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:49,880
Before you take him,

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,509
I must speak with No Ah's mother.

24
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,249
I'm No Ah's mom.

25
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:57,350
One moment, please.

26
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,830
Mom!

27
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,199
No Ah!

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,969
- Mom.
- No Ah.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,410
No Ah, Mom is sorry.

31
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,139
Mom...

32
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:26,279
I missed you so much.

33
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:27,949
What about you, No Ah?

34
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,150
Did you miss me too?

35
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,490
Yes, I missed you too, Mom.

36
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,089
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,289
Mom...

38
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,900
- Mom is sorry.
- Mom...

39
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,129
I'm sorry...

40
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,930
What?

41
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:47,140
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon.
Why would you take No Ah?

42
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,839
Don't overreact.

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,909
I'm his mom.

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,909
Am I not even allowed
to feed my own son?

45
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,339
Hey, where are you now?

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,950
My gosh.

47
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:06,689
I feel like I can finally live now
that I have you right by my side.

48
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,689
Mom, did you feel like
you were dying...

49
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,990
when you couldn't see me?

50
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,860
That's right. You know,

51
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,230
Mom can't live without you, No Ah.

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,969
What about you, No Ah?

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,569
For me...

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
Oh! Dad is here.

55
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:37,890
Seriously, what is your deal?

56
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,760
Who are you to pick up No Ah
from the daycare center?

57
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,390
Why don't you sit down?

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,960
I can't be sitting here,
laughing with you.

59
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Get up, No Ah.

60
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,069
Why?

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,939
No Ah said he wanted pizza,
so I brought him here.

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,240
Just let him finish his pizza.

63
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,240
If you keep doing
whatever you please...

64
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,010
Must you stand there
and keep making that face?

65
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,279
Our son will be hurt.

66
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,080
Who's the one
that's hurting my son here?

67
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,689
Mom, Dad. Are you fighting?

68
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,520
No, why would we fight?

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,760
No Ah, go on and finish your pizza.

70
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,469
No Ah, go on and eat.

71
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:45,950
My goodness. Were you that hungry?

72
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,089
Yes, Mother. I was craving
this home-cooked meal so much...

73
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,289
that I ran home.

74
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,560
It looks like
your baby will be a big eater.

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,000
I know, right?
I should earn a lot of money.

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,770
No Ah will be home soon.
I'll set the table for you quickly.

77
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,270
Sit down and eat
so you won't get indigestion.

78
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,370
Okay.

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,200
- We're home!
- We're home!

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,210
What?

81
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:05,469
My gosh!

82
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,609
No Ah, you're home!

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,250
Hey, you're home early.

84
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,810
You're home early.

85
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,219
Yes, that's right. You're so cute.

86
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,120
Wasn't it nice that
Daddy came to pick you up?

87
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,489
It wasn't Dad. My...

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
What?

89
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,390
He was so happy to see me.

90
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,029
I should pick him up
from time to time.

91
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,659
They all swarmed around me,
saying a handsome dad came.

92
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:30,729
It was amazing.

93
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,400
Really?

94
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,500
Go and wash your hands quickly
so we can eat, okay?

95
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,839
- Oh, yes. We should eat.
- Yes.

96
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,940
My gosh, I'm hungry.

97
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,239
You must be starving too.

98
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,810
Did you guys eat something?

99
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,580
Oh, did we snack
on something earlier?

100
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,719
What? What did you guys eat?

101
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,820
- Pizza.
- Tteokbokki... I mean, pizza.

102
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,659
What? Did you have pizza
or tteokbokki?

103
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,729
Goodness. We stink.
Let's wash up, No Ah.

104
00:05:58,729 --> 00:05:59,960
- Come on!
- What?

105
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,460
My goodness.

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,099
Wait, they had pizza and tteokbokki
right before dinner?

107
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,339
What about me? My gosh.

108
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:14,039
Ssook Ssook likes
pizza and tteokbokki too!

109
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,339
Darn it.

110
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,880
I told you not to tell her
that you had pizza with Mom.

111
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:24,089
It's a secret.
A secret between me and Dad.

112
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:28,419
That's right. It's a secret
we'll take to the grave, okay?

113
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,760
But why does it have to be a secret?

114
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,070
I heard you only had to keep secrets
when you'd done something bad.

115
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,099
What? Who said that?

116
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,640
Mom told me so.

117
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:46,469
Right.

118
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,779
What am I doing to my child?

119
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,210
I shouldn't do this to you, No Ah.

120
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,320
Dad is sorry, all right?

121
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,419
No Ah has a new mom now.

122
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,589
You should've seen it coming
when you decided to leave.

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,260
I guess I was confident.

124
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,330
That I'd always be his mom
even if someone else was in the picture.

125
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,839
When I heard No Ah
calling another woman his mom,

126
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,409
it hit me.

127
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,239
I thought, "This is wrong."

128
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,940
Gosh, you fool.

129
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:24,549
Did you just realize that?

130
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,380
So?

131
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,979
You'll give up your studies
and come back?

132
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,849
I haven't decided yet,

133
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,659
but I'll work here...

134
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,190
as I stay in Korea
for the time being.

135
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:41,330
I've been needing a family doctor,

136
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,429
so it's great for me.

137
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,900
But you should think things through.

138
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:47,969
You know you'll never get a chance
to study abroad again, right?

139
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,299
Yes.

140
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,169
I need time to think.

141
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:57,779
I don't know
if I can live without No Ah.

142
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm not sure.

143
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:09,690
Why did your family say
they received food from me...

144
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,729
when I didn't even send anything?

145
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,630
I'm sorry, Mother.

146
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,929
I wanted to take the burden off...

147
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,299
since I thought
it would be hard on you.

148
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,969
Is that how you take
the burden off for me?

149
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,039
More than anything else,

150
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,870
it bothers me that you did this
because you only cared...

151
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,940
about your family.

152
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:27,310
Are you happy to look down
on your in-laws like that?

153
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,310
I was the one who suggested it.

154
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,950
It didn't seem like
you'd do it anyway.

155
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,320
Be quiet.
Do you think I don't know you?

156
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,849
Would you do something like this
without discussing it with me?

157
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,390
Mom, you keep acting...

158
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,620
so harsh toward Gong Hee.
That's why she can't...

159
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,489
bring things up like this easily...

160
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,489
What?

161
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,830
What do you mean, I'm acting harsh?
What did I do?

162
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,829
Do you want me to show you
what it means to be really harsh?

163
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:57,069
I'm sorry. I think I acted
without thinking it through.

164
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,740
I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again.

165
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,110
Gosh, what a headache.

166
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,380
Goodness, I'm burning up inside.

167
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,860
Mom must've found out
about everything.

168
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,260
She must've been upset.

169
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,650
(Bubble Up Laundry)

170
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,350
Hey, aren't you getting up?

171
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,750
You drank and came home
in the middle of the night.

172
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,990
You're sleeping until the afternoon.

173
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,520
Aren't you going to the shop?

174
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,529
The kids have all gone to work,

175
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,429
and No Ah has gone to daycare.

176
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,799
Why are you acting up again?

177
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:57,970
What on earth is the problem?

178
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,140
(Audrey)

179
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,539
What?

180
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Yes?

181
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,850
Yes, right away.

182
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,010
I'll be right there. Yes.

183
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,760
My goodness.

184
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,909
Have a seat.

185
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Okay.

186
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,579
I called you here...

187
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,150
to ask you something.

188
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,360
Right.

189
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,220
Whatever it is,

190
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,090
please ask me.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,500
Was that the day...

192
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:05,569
when Hae Joon gave you...

193
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,699
the letter and the ring?

194
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,110
Stay with me.

195
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,390
Please give this to my wife for me.

196
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:29,360
Please do this for me.

197
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,990
Yes.

198
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:33,429
Until his last moment,

199
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,470
he wouldn't let go of
that letter and the ring.

200
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,799
And he asked me to take them.

201
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,909
He said to make sure you get them.

202
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:52,279
So, you had those for 20 years?

203
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,449
I thought I should do that,
at least.

204
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,289
So, for 20 years,

205
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,520
I scoured every nook and cranny
of the country...

206
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:07,429
to find you.

207
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,900
I thought about it over and over
all night long,

208
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,110
but I just can't forgive you.

209
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,240
I am...

210
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,439
so ashamed to face you.

211
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,209
Ever since that day,

212
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,289
I've only been waiting
for the day...

213
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,620
when I could atone for my sins.

214
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,520
A dead man can't come back to life.

215
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,090
How will you atone for your sins?

216
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,100
None of it matters.

217
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,470
Even if it takes me
the rest of my life,

218
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:53,039
I will atone for my sins
for certain.

219
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,909
You should leave.

220
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,380
It's too hard for me to face you.

221
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,490
I...

222
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,529
killed a man.

223
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,630
I did.

224
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,569
Gyeong Tae, come on out.

225
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,779
We caught Kim Chi Seung!

226
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,809
Kim Chi Seung should be paying
for his crimes.

227
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,620
Why are you in here like this?

228
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,279
I...

229
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,720
How am I any different...

230
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,220
from that jerk?

231
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,329
Is he still doing that?

232
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,699
It was his next-door neighbor.

233
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,270
He was the one who called him
to the intersection.

234
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,939
Throughout your career as a cop,

235
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,750
you'll see hostages getting hurt
right before your eyes pretty often.

236
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,779
Will you do this
every time that happens?

237
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,220
Forget about it.

238
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,730
It's not like
this is a debt you can repay.

239
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:21,429
Debt...

240
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,100
Even if you say,
"I was wrong, and I'm sorry,"

241
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,539
the victim can't hear you
in the skies,

242
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,569
and the victim's family
won't want to listen.

243
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,610
Just forget about it, okay?

244
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,760
Goodness gracious.

245
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,020
(Dear Jung Eun)

246
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,949
I know that you left us
because of me.

247
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,760
There wasn't any proper proposal
between us, let alone a wedding.

248
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,789
We never had much to our names,

249
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:28,659
and whenever my mother
would approach us,

250
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,130
we couldn't even pack up
what little we had...

251
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,100
and had to move from place to place.

252
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,150
How dare you come here again?

253
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,500
You can have this darned money back.

254
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,529
I haven't used any of it.

255
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,770
I didn't even look
at this dirty money.

256
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,699
You signed that pledge yourself.

257
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:11,370
Why are you changing your tune now?

258
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,640
It's because you threatened me.

259
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,640
You're nothing but a fraud
who's greedy for money.

260
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,049
You're just a heartless mom
who abandoned your child...

261
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,350
because of money.

262
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,179
Is there anything else besides that?

263
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:26,949
Does framing me like that
make you feel better?

264
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,789
It's all for Dan Soo's sake.

265
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,059
That's what Dan Soo knows,

266
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,529
so don't even dream of
hanging around him.

267
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,699
Is that really...

268
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,829
for Dan Soo's sake?

269
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,329
How?

270
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,400
How could you do that?

271
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,299
What about Hae Joon,
who died because of you?

272
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:44,539
What do you expect Dan Soo...

273
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,010
to think of the woman
who killed his dad?

274
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,980
I didn't kill Hae Joon.

275
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,049
It wasn't any one of us.

276
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,179
You made that happen.

277
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,819
What? What did you say?

278
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,449
Even when everyone in the world
lives with guilt,

279
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,689
you don't even bat an eye.

280
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,159
You don't admit it.

281
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,929
What you did to my family.

282
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:07,230
You don't even think about
owning up to that.

283
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,100
Who do you think you're blaming?

284
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,029
You're the one who killed Hae Joon!

285
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,640
You can say that all you want.

286
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,970
But I can't leave like this.

287
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,970
I can't do as you want
like 20 years ago!

288
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,809
Are you saying you'll show yourself
in front of Dan Soo?

289
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,810
Yes. You don't think I can do it?

290
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,060
Try it all you want.

291
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,090
Whose words do you think
Dan Soo will believe?

292
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,400
His mom who abandoned him
when he was little?

293
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,969
I've been his only family
since then!

294
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:48,040
Dan Soo is my son.
I gave birth to him.

295
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,300
If you're truly his mother,

296
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,070
you ought to make a decision
that will help him.

297
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,239
Your lowly blood.

298
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,909
Do you want Dan Soo to get caught up
in that vicious cycle?

299
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,719
Drag her out.

300
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,580
Get her out of my sight.

301
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:06,489
Ma'am.

302
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,489
Ma'am, please listen...

303
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:10,090
Please hear me out!

304
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,259
Let go!

305
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,969
Let go. Ma'am!

306
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,739
Please! Stop this.

307
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,340
You said you'd send
the revised design by today.

308
00:18:58,939 --> 00:18:59,939
Mr. Gu.

309
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:03,509
Hey, Gu Dan Soo!

310
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,419
What should I do?

311
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,259
What?

312
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,290
I keep thinking of that person,

313
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:20,429
and it makes me so mad.

314
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,630
I thought
I had forgotten all about her.

315
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,840
I told myself
to erase all the memories,

316
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,140
and I did erase them all.

317
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:35,340
I couldn't even remember her face.

318
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,150
I remembered nothing about her.

319
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,850
Because I erased her from my mind,

320
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,989
I could go on with my life.

321
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,620
With everything faded into mist.

322
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,259
I just lived like that.

323
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,429
You didn't erase her from your mind.

324
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,100
You only pretended like you did.

325
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:02,100
If you truly forgot,
why did you name yourself...

326
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,199
after the heroine
of your mom's favorite movie?

327
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,540
If you really forgot all about her,

328
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:09,679
why did you keep the doll
she made for you all these years?

329
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,179
You never actually erased her
from your mind.

330
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:15,650
You've missed your mom.

331
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,820
They say that a sense of longing...

332
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,719
is like a photograph.

333
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,659
If you keep looking at it,

334
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,689
it may get worn out to the point
that you can't even remember...

335
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,130
the face of the person,

336
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,929
but never deny your emotions.

337
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,370
Gu Dan Soo, I learned this...

338
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,509
from Holly.

339
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,209
"Always express your emotions
in an honest manner."

340
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,310
Whether you're doing it
through your designs...

341
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,050
or yourself.

342
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,620
You should meet your mom.

343
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,259
Meet her...

344
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,659
and whine to her, at least. Okay?

345
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:12,009
Yes, Grandma.

346
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,709
Okay, got it.

347
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,219
Gu Dan Soo.

348
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:32,860
Your situation...

349
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:35,759
looks so precarious right now.

350
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,870
Yes.

351
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,610
You're here.

352
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,509
Grandma.

353
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,219
Are you all right?

354
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,679
Yes.

355
00:21:58,489 --> 00:21:59,550
I'm all right.

356
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,060
I called you here
to tell you something.

357
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,489
I know what you're going to say.

358
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:09,830
I already know...

359
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,330
who my mom is.

360
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:15,370
Did that woman go to you...

361
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,409
and tell you?

362
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,640
No.

363
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,239
I happened to see you meeting her.

364
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,080
She doesn't know that I know.

365
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,650
So, you heard everything?

366
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,919
What exactly did you hear?

367
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,790
That she's my mom...

368
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,060
and that she abandoned me and left.

369
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:41,729
I hoped...

370
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,669
you'd never find out.

371
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,900
I know you're all grown up now,

372
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,209
but all of this
would still hurt you.

373
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,110
The things I heard.

374
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Are they really true?

375
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,650
Did she use me...

376
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,150
to threaten you for money?

377
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:12,189
You've found out everything anyway,
so I can say this now. Yes.

378
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,199
She hovered around you...

379
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,300
and tried to extort
more money from me.

380
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:24,570
That's why I had her
sign this agreement.

381
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,709
So, she abandoned me...

382
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,239
for money?

383
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,120
This too.

384
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,820
She left this.

385
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,249
Maybe she thought it wasn't enough.

386
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,719
She threatened me,
using you as an excuse.

387
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,659
Was it...

388
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,330
just money that she wanted?

389
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
Yes.

390
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,969
Why do you think she showed up
in front of you again?

391
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,140
It's all because of money.

392
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,810
In the past,

393
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,209
she approached Hae Joon
and took money.

394
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,979
Now, she wants to use you
as an excuse...

395
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,650
to extort money from us.

396
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,280
But how...

397
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:12,219
How could she do such a thing?

398
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:14,919
Why did Dad fall
for someone like her?

399
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,259
She seduced your naive father.

400
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,790
My poor son, Hae Joon.

401
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,400
Your dad went out...

402
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,540
to look for her
and ended up like that.

403
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,439
That woman got your father killed.

404
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,679
Dan Soo.

405
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,249
Just think that she doesn't exist
and move on with your life.

406
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,890
I'll take care of everything,

407
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,989
so just forget her.

408
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,830
I thought maybe...

409
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,159
she came back because
she wanted to see me as my mom.

410
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,040
I thought that was why she kept
looking at me with such eyes.

411
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,209
But she came back for money?

412
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,179
Dan Soo,
I'm doing what's best for you.

413
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,650
Dan Soo, don't try to find out more.

414
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:18,280
You must cut all ties with her
right here and now.

415
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,080
What did I tell you, Geon?

416
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:49,249
You said you were going out
to find Mom.

417
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:51,989
You told me to listen
to Gong Hee's mom and dad.

418
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:53,249
That's right.

419
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,519
Mom and I will come back together,
holding hands.

420
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,729
Mom got lost.

421
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:02,659
I will...

422
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,130
come home with Mom, okay?

423
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,739
Mom!

424
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,150
Mom!

425
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,580
Mom!

426
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:28,759
Mom...

427
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,790
Mom!

428
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,439
Dan Soo, what brings you here?

429
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:54,909
That day,

430
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,979
it rained.

431
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,459
I fell over in the rain,

432
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,429
but she just left.

433
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,360
"Don't go."

434
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,030
Even though I kept calling out
for Mom like that.

435
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,769
- Dan Soo.
- "Why did she do that?"

436
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:22,080
That question gave me nightmares
all my life.

437
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,550
"What reason..."

438
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:28,050
"could I accept?"

439
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,249
I thought about it
thousands of times.

440
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,120
Your mother...

441
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:39,689
must've been in a lot of pain too.

442
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
But...

443
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,269
it turns out...

444
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,769
that there was no acceptable reason.

445
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,209
The fact that
she abandoned me and left...

446
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,439
doesn't change.

447
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,679
Dan Soo...

448
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,650
What use is it now?

449
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:10,659
It's you.

450
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,659
The person who abandoned me
in the rain.

451
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,030
It's you.

452
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,479
(My Merry Marriage)

453
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,719
"Mom?" Don't even dare
to speak that word out loud.

454
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:42,019
I've never once considered you
my family.

455
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:44,219
I came back to take care of No Ah.

456
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:46,290
What? Take care of No Ah?

457
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,060
Wait. Why are you...

458
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,729
What are you doing?

459
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,330
It's because you're cute. Why?

460
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,630
Hey, Maeng Gong...

461
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:54,870
Maeng Gong Hee!

462
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,070
