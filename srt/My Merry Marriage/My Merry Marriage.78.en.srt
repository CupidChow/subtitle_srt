1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,949
Come on. It's a gift.
Your birthday is coming up.

3
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,850
Try it on.

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,180
Please?

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,299
Oh, no. The stitching here
needs a little more work.

6
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:53,709
I'll fix it right away.

7
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,810
Oh, okay.

8
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,319
(Hwang Ik Sun, Oh Jung Eun)

9
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,090
Oh, my.

10
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,160
Why is my grandma's name
on that thing?

11
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,630
What did I just see?

12
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:22,399
It looked like
some sort of agreement.

13
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,869
But why would you and my grandma...

14
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,140
Well...

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,580
You must be mistaken.

16
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,380
I don't even know
your grandmother's name.

17
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:42,619
Really?

18
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,929
I'll fix it up quickly for you.

19
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm glad this fits you well.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Yes.

21
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,240
It fits perfectly,
just like that shirt you made.

22
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,009
It's as if you've known me
for a long time.

23
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,580
The way you make my clothes.

24
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,449
I guess I've still got it.

25
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,319
I'm relieved
I can give this to you...

26
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,130
before it's too late.

27
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,390
"Before it's too late?"

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Why?

29
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:28,169
Are you going somewhere?

30
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,299
Oh, no.

31
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,910
I meant to say,
before the winter ends.

32
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,079
It's a winter coat.

33
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,880
You can't wear it
once spring begins, you know.

34
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:43,449
That's why I said it.

35
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,600
(Cashier's Check, 10,000 dollars)

36
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,639
This is an emergency fund,
not a money gift.

37
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,109
Use it when you crave
spicy tteokbokki.

38
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,280
You're not alone.

39
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,819
Never forget that.

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,819
Mom is asking for you.

41
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,660
Oh, okay.

42
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,139
(Cashier's Check, 10,000 dollars)

43
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,509
(You're not alone.
Never forget that.)

44
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,389
Did you ask for me?

45
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,859
What is all this?

46
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,799
Oh, it's the food my family sent.

47
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,470
I divided them into smaller portions
and put them away.

48
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,840
As for the ones in the freezer,

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,669
you can reheat them one by one.

50
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,370
And the ones in the fridge
should be eaten within a week.

51
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,639
Look here.

52
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,479
Is that what I told you to do?

53
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,479
I told you to either throw them out
or give them away.

54
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,750
Why did you do something
I never told you to do?

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,319
Well, Mother. These dishes...

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,289
My mom, grandma, and aunt...

57
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,919
worked very hard to make these
and only used fresh ingredients.

58
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,359
If you try them, you'll know...

59
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,359
I told you...

60
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,429
I didn't want to eat them.
What's with you?

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,330
I already knew you were stubborn,

62
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,970
but I didn't think
you'd be this stubborn.

63
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,340
Do you think
you can ignore me like that?

64
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,070
Then...

65
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,739
I'll eat them all, Mother.

66
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,510
What?

67
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,379
Mother, even when I pestered my mom
to cook me these things,

68
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:58,919
she never did
because she couldn't afford it.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,049
So, I can't throw these away.
It'd be such a waste.

70
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:02,989
I'll eat these, Mother.

71
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,160
That's okay, right?

72
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,189
I'd like some too.

73
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Oh, gosh.

74
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:13,830
Well, shall we see
how good a cook your mother is?

75
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,340
Yes, sure.
Father, I'll fix it up quickly.

76
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,340
All right.

77
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,780
Father likes all the food
my family sent.

78
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,749
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

79
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,789
Come downstairs and join us.
It's delicious.

80
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,359
I'll pass.

81
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,989
I'll just eat them all, then.

82
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:42,989
Why did Gu Dan Soo...

83
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,330
give you such a big amount
as a money gift?

84
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,629
Your bag was open.

85
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,439
It's way too much
for a money gift for our wedding.

86
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,609
I know.

87
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,640
I guess he wanted to brag
about his wealth.

88
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,150
But...

89
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,780
I don't like that
you touched my things...

90
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,590
without my permission.

91
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,689
I only looked
because your bag was open.

92
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:14,960
Was it something
I wasn't supposed to see?

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,830
No, it's not that.
That's not what I meant.

94
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Then it's all good, right?

95
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,869
You said we should tell each other
everything.

96
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,840
Is Gu Dan Soo an exception?

97
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,410
I should go and tidy up the kitchen.

98
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Okay.

99
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,989
It was such a nice wedding.

100
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:43,289
It wasn't loud
or anything like that.

101
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,090
It was perfect. Very good.

102
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,289
Are you saying this to insult me?

103
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,359
Did you think
my wedding was too loud?

104
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,100
I also liked what you wrote
in your invitation.

105
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,600
Instead of making people
feel obligated to come,

106
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,770
you wrote, "We're getting married."

107
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,939
"Please congratulate us
wherever you are."

108
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:03,439
Are you saying that
to criticize me too?

109
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,710
Because I kept saying
you had to come to my wedding?

110
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,410
- Did that make you uncomfortable?
- Come on.

111
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,950
Honestly, your wedding was a bit...

112
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,379
You made a huge fuss about it.

113
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,419
It was quite chaotic.

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,859
Well, we put it together
in such a hurry.

115
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,520
Thank you all for coming.

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,590
Thank you all.

117
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:22,929
But I have to say,

118
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,760
you two work in the same office.

119
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,470
How come no one knew
that you two were dating?

120
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,470
When did it all start?

121
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,970
When did you fall for each other...

122
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,109
and start dating?

123
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,669
Right? My gosh.

124
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,179
Gong Hee, I'm hurt.

125
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,850
I know every office couple
tries to keep it a secret, but...

126
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,979
Yoo Ra, you bigmouth.
Thank goodness you didn't know.

127
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,320
We wanted to tell you
once we had it all planned.

128
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,419
We had a situation,
so we couldn't tell you...

129
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:50,489
until we started planning
our wedding.

130
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,890
Congratulations.

131
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
The two of you...

132
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:56,189
look lovely together.

133
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,629
Thank you.

134
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,700
(Executive Director, Gu Dan Soo)

135
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,450
I'm here to discuss
a personal matter.

136
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,080
Could you spare me a moment?

137
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,150
You're already in my office.

138
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,249
I came to thank you.

139
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,220
When did you sneak it into my bag?

140
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,489
I was so surprised
when I opened my bag.

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,629
You gave me too much
for a money gift.

142
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:30,960
I know how much you eat.

143
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,330
Order some tteokbokki.

144
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,169
I could order tteokbokki every day
for the rest of my life.

145
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,439
So, about my note...

146
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,369
I hope you don't misunderstand.

147
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,939
You know it too.

148
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,869
You're not alone.

149
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,280
You have a family
who's cheering you on too.

150
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,780
I'm jealous.

151
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,780
Gu Dan Soo.

152
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,450
You're not alone either.

153
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:55,389
Me?

154
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
I don't know about that.

155
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,090
So...

156
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,190
about Ms. Audrey...

157
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,470
She'll be really lonely
since I moved away.

158
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,470
I was her best friend.

159
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:13,540
You should go to see her often.

160
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,070
I'm already doing that.

161
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,009
She even gave me a present,
saying my birthday was coming up.

162
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,609
By the way, how did she know
when my birthday was?

163
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
Did you tell her?

164
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,690
No, I didn't tell her.

165
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,249
That's odd.

166
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,790
Is that right?

167
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,960
Then how did she find out?

168
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,359
Why don't you ask her
how she found out?

169
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,100
Dan Soo,
you have someone by your side too.

170
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,470
A family that loves you.

171
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,710
All right. I'll ask her myself.

172
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,009
Be sure to do that, okay?

173
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,779
Okay.

174
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:56,580
Then I'll be going.

175
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,379
The money gift...

176
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,590
I mean, the money you gave me...

177
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,649
Thanks again.

178
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:06,460
Are you okay?

179
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,790
What?

180
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,729
You left home.

181
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,129
Are you doing all right?

182
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:15,629
Of course.

183
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,170
I'm Maeng Ggong.

184
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:20,909
Right.

185
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,509
You're Maeng Ggong, the toad that
cries in the mountains and fields.

186
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,590
You're still wearing it.

187
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,220
I don't know about anything else,

188
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,759
but I'm going to brag
about this ring even after I die.

189
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,600
Look, King of the Underworld.
My daughter gave me this ring.

190
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,940
Goodness, Mom.

191
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,670
You should wear it in this life
until it's old and worn.

192
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,139
My goodness.

193
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,779
Well, then.

194
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,149
I should get going now.

195
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,409
If I keep sitting here like this,

196
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,850
my feet might just get stuck here.

197
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,850
Mom,

198
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,989
shall we watch a movie together
at the terminal?

199
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,090
Just the two of us. What do you say?

200
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,629
A movie? Which one?

201
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,029
Is there a good one in theaters?

202
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,499
It doesn't matter which movie it is.

203
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:20,830
All that matters is that
we go on a date to the movies.

204
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,999
Come to think of it,

205
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,670
I haven't gotten to do
so much with you, Mom.

206
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,340
We haven't been on a trip together
or even a picnic.

207
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,779
I have so much
I want to do with you.

208
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,109
Then,

209
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,149
let's do what you want today.

210
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,649
Okay, Mom.
Let's watch a movie together...

211
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,019
and eat popcorn too, okay?

212
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,190
Let's do that.

213
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,229
Hey, what is it?

214
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,830
Mother,

215
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,040
could you pick up No Ah
from daycare?

216
00:11:58,869 --> 00:11:59,869
What?

217
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,940
One of the kids has
hand-foot-and-mouth disease.

218
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,479
They're sending all the kids home
since it's contagious.

219
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,379
But Gong Boo says he's busy,

220
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,810
and I'm about to
go into a meeting too.

221
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,920
Gosh, why now of all times?

222
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,119
Hang on, then.

223
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,590
My goodness.

224
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,100
Why isn't this man picking up?

225
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,129
(Waiver of Parental Rights)

226
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:35,509
I don't think
Dan Soo saw the details.

227
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,639
I didn't know what to say,

228
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,109
so I just pretended
not to know anything.

229
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
What should I do?

230
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,979
Don't you have any intention...

231
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,420
to reveal who you are to Dan Soo?

232
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,320
If the chairwoman finds out,

233
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,090
she won't leave me alone.

234
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,129
I promised not to do that...

235
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:00,659
when I asked
for three more months with him.

236
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,800
But what if Dan Soo finds out?
Doesn't that change things?

237
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,440
If he sets out to find his mom,

238
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,340
how could anyone stop him?

239
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,009
You know,

240
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,040
ever since I found out
that Dan Soo was my son,

241
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,050
I've wanted to tell him
that I'm his mom...

242
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:22,519
and cry my eyes out
while holding him in my arms.

243
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,029
But the more I keep seeing Dan Soo,

244
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,359
the more afraid I get.

245
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,830
I'm worried
I might hurt Dan Soo more.

246
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,300
And that I might ruin his life
even more.

247
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,180
What? Gyeong Tae?

248
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,920
I haven't seen a glimpse of him.

249
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,850
Gosh, is he fishing
on some beach again?

250
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:01,330
All right. I'll man the shop.
Don't worry.

251
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,690
Bye.

252
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:04,899
Goodness.

253
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:11,200
Why do you keep stealing glances?

254
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,239
Well...

255
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:15,269
It sounded like
she was looking for Gyeong Tae.

256
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,680
Do you know where my brother is?

257
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,850
No, it's not that
I know where he is, but...

258
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,320
Could you please back away?

259
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,119
I have a weak heart.

260
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,119
Come on!

261
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,249
My goodness.

262
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,960
You and my brother
went fishing together all the time.

263
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,460
Are you acting like strangers now?

264
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,129
All you do is come to eat dumplings
every day.

265
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,300
Do you think I come here every day
just to eat dumplings?

266
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,479
Well, I guess you can stay.

267
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,450
I might just bring you
some freebies.

268
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,609
There seems to be...

269
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,649
quite a lot of food.

270
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,519
Would you like to eat with me?

271
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,420
Oh, please.

272
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,430
You look like you could eat
5 or 6 servings on your own.

273
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,859
All right, then.

274
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,879
Mom, don't go anywhere.
Wait here, okay?

275
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,810
I'll be right back with No Ah.

276
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,879
Okay. All right.

277
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,320
Gosh, that girl, Hong Dan.

278
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,989
She should take responsibility
if she said she'd take care of him.

279
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:37,859
How could she always call me
whenever she's in a rush?

280
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:39,389
Mom, I'll be back soon.

281
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:40,389
Okay.

282
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:01,009
Goodness, look at this mess.

283
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,609
With more family members
in the house,

284
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:06,180
there's so much stuff.

285
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,820
Oh, dear.

286
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,759
What a mess.

287
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,859
Oh, boy.

288
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:27,239
Goodness.

289
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,509
Oh, my. What is this?

290
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:43,190
(For Mom when she goes home)

291
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,220
"For Mom when she goes home?"

292
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,290
My gosh.

293
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:49,290
She's worried...

294
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,330
about her old mother not eating.

295
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,499
Oh, dear.

296
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,609
I'm the biggest burden on you.

297
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,489
I'll make sure
to take that burden with me.

298
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,229
I'll take care of that for you.

299
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,429
Don't resent me later on.

300
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,560
Don't try so hard.

301
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,230
Please live a comfortable life,
Myung Ja.

302
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,709
My daughter.

303
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:45,679
The only way to get Dan Soo out
of that house is marriage.

304
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,590
Call Ms. Kang's mother
and tell her I want to meet.

305
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,689
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,990
What is this, all of a sudden?

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,129
I came to ask you something,
Grandma.

308
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:04,469
Ask me what?

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,270
Tiffany Alterations.

310
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,969
Do you know Ms. Audrey?

311
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,510
I saw something
at the alteration shop.

312
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:17,550
A pledge with your name on it.

313
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,590
Why would you and Ms. Audrey
sign a pledge together?

314
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,790
It's a promissory note.

315
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,629
She borrowed money from me,
so I had to put it in writing.

316
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,330
So, you wrote it.

317
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,830
Yes. What about it?

318
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,840
I don't even know
your grandmother's name.

319
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,409
Is there a problem?

320
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,080
No. If that's the case,
it's none of my business.

321
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,090
That's right.
You don't need to worry.

322
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,119
If she keeps her word,

323
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,060
we will have no problems.

324
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,560
All right. I'll be going, then.

325
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,030
Okay, get going.

326
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,199
This is weird.

327
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,169
You haven't seen me in a while.
I'm saying I'm leaving,

328
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,709
but you won't even stop me?

329
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,010
Oh, well...
I know how stubborn you are, so I...

330
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,409
I was just kidding.

331
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,750
I'll come by again soon, Grandma.

332
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,119
Why are you just standing there?

333
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,230
Call that woman right now.

334
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,600
Tell her I want to meet now.
I must meet her now!

335
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:49,209
I'm sorry I took up
so much of your time again.

336
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,310
Don't be sorry.

337
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:55,550
I'm sorry
I couldn't be of much help.

338
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:58,719
Thank you for listening to me.

339
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,250
I've always wanted to tell you...

340
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,590
how grateful I am to you.

341
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:06,520
For giving me Hae Joon's ring...

342
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,959
and for helping me
see Dan Soo often too.

343
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,500
Thank you for everything.

344
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,030
Without your help,

345
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,240
I would've had a really hard time.

346
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,840
I'm relieved to know...

347
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,240
that Dan Soo has
someone so wonderful by his side.

348
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:31,919
Well, I'll be going then.

349
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,719
Yes, bye.

350
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Yes.

351
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,270
Chairwoman Hwang wants to see you.

352
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:54,969
What is this about now?

353
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,379
Dan Soo came to see her
and said something weird.

354
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:00,709
Pardon?

355
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:04,480
Did you show him the agreement?

356
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,449
Your grandma left alone.

357
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,320
I wanted to take her to the movies
and do things with her today.

358
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,189
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:16,830
You said you'd be fine with No Ah.

360
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,929
Is this fine to you?

361
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,359
You're too busy at work
to even take care of your child!

362
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,500
I couldn't leave the clinic,
you know.

363
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,240
You know I couldn't go
to the daycare center at that hour.

364
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,300
What? Why, you...

365
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,209
Hey! Then why did you move in here?

366
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Come on, Mom.
Isn't it nice to live with us?

367
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,449
Other sons would never do this.

368
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,850
Only I can do this, taking care
of you and Dad like this.

369
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:44,590
You are taking care of us?
You've got to be kidding me.

370
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,520
I am taking care of you guys.

371
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,689
I never asked you
to move in with us.

372
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:50,260
I don't like this one bit,
so get out. Move out.

373
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,159
Move out! Get out now.

374
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:54,429
My gosh! Mother!

375
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,070
Mother, please stop.

376
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,439
I know he's your son,

377
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,540
but he's my man now.

378
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:06,109
What?

379
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Honey.

380
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:11,109
This man...

381
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,080
is mine now.

382
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,219
Only I can hit him.

383
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:19,119
Only I can touch him.
Mother, with that said,

384
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,260
I ask you not to mistreat my man
from now on.

385
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,469
My goodness.
You were nowhere to be seen all day.

386
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:32,939
Where have you been?

387
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,869
Do you know that Myung Ja
kept looking for you earlier?

388
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:37,510
You're in trouble now.

389
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,310
Well, I was...

390
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,340
Gyeong Tae.

391
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:45,320
What did you do all day that
you didn't even answer your phone?

392
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:48,490
What? Oh, well...

393
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,020
I guess my phone was turned off.

394
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,119
You expect me to believe that?

395
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:55,590
The daycare center called,

396
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,760
but you didn't even pick up.

397
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:59,330
Mom went home alone again!

398
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,730
Are you really her son-in-law?

399
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,169
Are you really my husband?

400
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:06,969
Oh, boy. Why would you say that?

401
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,669
Whatever, forget it. Do you know
what Hong Dan said to me?

402
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,609
She told me
never to hit her husband.

403
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:14,310
She said I couldn't even touch him.

404
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,550
She said Gong Boo was her man.
My goodness.

405
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:19,750
Well, she's right about that.
Why are you so upset?

406
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,320
He's my son.
I can't even lay a hand on him?

407
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,119
Of course, you can't.
Now, you can just...

408
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,389
touch your man.

409
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,590
Your man is right here.

410
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:31,859
Touch me.

411
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,969
Goodness, I refuse.
Why is he my man?

412
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:37,699
Oh, dear.

413
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Here.

414
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Open wide.

415
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,980
Eat it yourself.

416
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,649
You have hands, don't you?

417
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,480
Oh, come on.

418
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,119
Now that you have a son,
you won't even look at me.

419
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,090
But earlier,
you said this to my mom.

420
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,850
"This man is mine.
Don't mistreat him!"

421
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,090
You said that.

422
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,790
Goodness. Must you say that
in front of your own son?

423
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,290
Don't forget that you're a father.

424
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,730
I am a son before I am a father.

425
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Then eat with your mom.

426
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,369
Ask her to put a side dish
on your spoon for you.

427
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:13,340
Pick your side.

428
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,869
Is it me or your mom?

429
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,510
How childish.

430
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,840
It's like asking kids if they like
their mom or dad better.

431
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:23,480
You have to side with your wife
in a situation like this.

432
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,850
For peace in the family.

433
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,189
What? Why are you talking
like an old, insightful man?

434
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,790
Between Grandma and Mom,

435
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,119
you must choose Mom, no matter what.

436
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,359
I saw it on TV.

437
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,830
Oh, my! You are so smart,
my dear son.

438
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
- I want more rice, Mom.
- Okay.

439
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,510
Hey, it's so natural for you
to call her Mom now, No Ah.

440
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:53,139
Eat this.

441
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,750
You're eating so well.

442
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,020
- How adorable.
- I'm eating well too.

443
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:03,290
I bet he didn't see the agreement
by coincidence.

444
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:06,490
You must've waved it in front of him
for him to see, right?

445
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:10,560
It was my mistake.

446
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,030
"Mistake?"

447
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,699
Do you think I wouldn't know
what you're after?

448
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,300
You want to tell Dan Soo
that you're his mom.

449
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,270
If you tell Dan Soo
that you're his mom,

450
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,609
do you think he'll welcome you
with open arms?

451
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,409
He knows it was your fault
that his father died.

452
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:30,409
Do you really think
he'll accept you back?

453
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,619
It was my fault that Hae Joon died?

454
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:36,419
No.

455
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:39,820
It was your fault
that Hae Joon died.

456
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:41,889
You...

457
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,929
killed your son.

458
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,139
If only...

459
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,240
you had let us stay together,

460
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,109
we wouldn't have ended up like that.

461
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,580
If only you hadn't kicked me out...

462
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,419
No matter where I was hiding,

463
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:10,649
Hae Joon always found me.

464
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,959
So, what was I supposed to do?

465
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,429
And what did you do
every single time?

466
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,659
You hired people
to follow us wherever we went...

467
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,669
and made us suffer.

468
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,169
It was all your fault.

469
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,869
You were the one
who caused this tragedy!

470
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:32,879
So?

471
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:37,580
Are you saying you'll tell Dan Soo
that you're his mother?

472
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,990
I said nothing weird to him.

473
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,590
I really am trying my best
to hold back now.

474
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,219
What?

475
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,530
You're holding back?

476
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,169
I want to tell Dan Soo now
that I'm his mom,

477
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,600
but I'm clenching my teeth
so hard...

478
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,969
that I can almost smell blood.

479
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:02,270
That's how hard I'm trying
to hold myself back.

480
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,510
Now, you're showing
your true colors.

481
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:10,379
You said you'd leave
in just three months.

482
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,649
That was a ruse too, wasn't it?

483
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,689
As if you ever listened to me.

484
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,129
To you, I was always just...

485
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:26,330
a parasite who existed
to extort money from you.

486
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,300
Think about what your father did.

487
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,730
He showed up to threaten me
whenever he pleased...

488
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,399
and extorted money from me.
That con man was your father!

489
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,409
Right.

490
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,840
That filthy blood is flowing
in my veins.

491
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,179
How much can you give me?

492
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,909
On the condition that I give up
being Dan Soo's mom...

493
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:48,080
and that I'd never show myself
before my son again.

494
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,550
How much will you give me?

495
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:07,139
So, it was you?

496
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:10,270
The woman who
ruthlessly abandoned me and left?

497
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,290
(My Merry Marriage)

498
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:29,030
I guess you'll visit us soon
with food from your in-laws too.

499
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,429
Oh, right.
I have to bring food in return.

500
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:32,100
Bring me some proper results.

501
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,899
Please make your decision
once you see the outcome.

502
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:35,699
A collaboration with Hermes?

503
00:28:35,699 --> 00:28:36,699
I can help.

504
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:37,929
Leave the designs to me.

505
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:39,540
It might be good
for getting the word out...

506
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,070
about Holly's good influence.

507
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,439
I wish you'd take your hands off
of that project.

508
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,139
Gu Dan Soo, are you okay?

509
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:48,379
What if I say I'm not okay?

510
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:49,980
Can you handle that?

511
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:51,480
What do you think you're doing?

512
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:53,719
