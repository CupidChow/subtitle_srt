1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,259
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,989
(Episode 51)

3
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:26,999
Is this your answer...

4
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,429
to what I said to you last night?

5
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:31,429
Are you turning me down?

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,099
Should I take it that way?

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,939
Should I stop interfering
in your business...

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,040
and just disappear from your life...

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,680
as if I don't exist?

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,579
What's there to turn down?

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,290
We're friends.

12
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:54,019
Hey, you know
that is not what I meant.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,119
I confessed my feelings. I like you.

14
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,589
Why do you have to be like this too?

15
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:02,100
I am struggling even without you
adding to my stress.

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,799
Just answer this question.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,939
Can't you...

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,439
like me romantically,

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,740
not just as a friend?

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,509
I haven't even recovered
from the breakup yet, so please...

21
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,619
stop this.

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,119
Stay away from me.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,889
Is Seo Min Gi...

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
that important to you?

25
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:36,229
Hey, what are you going to do
if you're still not over him?

26
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,169
Hurry up and forget him, okay?

27
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,839
If you keep thinking of him,
it'll only hurt you more.

28
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,570
Why would you let him
break your heart even more?

29
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:46,309
Hey, are you saying this
because you know something?

30
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:51,410
It's just obvious.

31
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:53,749
Don't talk like that.

32
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,520
What do you know anyway?

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,290
This is between Mr. Seo and me.

34
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,699
Take this back.

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Fine.

36
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,080
I get what you mean.

37
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,599
Oh, you're here.

38
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,069
Have a seat.

39
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,270
Yes.

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,710
So...

41
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,809
These flowers are very pretty.

42
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,050
They're calla lilies.

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
Do you know
what calla lilies stand for?

44
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,020
I don't know anything about flowers.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,789
Calla lilies have
so many different meanings.

46
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,289
A single calla lily means pure love.

47
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,900
And when you give someone
a bouquet of them,

48
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,830
it means, "You are my good fortune."

49
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,740
And five calla lilies...

50
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,240
stand for a love
that lasts for a thousand years.

51
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,150
Love that lasts
for a thousand years?

52
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,080
Hae Joon loved calla lilies.

53
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,860
"They have a good meaning,
so they're often used in bouquets."

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,289
"So, later on,"

55
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,960
"if we get to have
a proper wedding,"

56
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,770
"we should use five calla lilies
for our wedding bouquet."

57
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:54,999
That's what he used to say.

58
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,510
He said we should love each other
for thousands of years,

59
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,680
but he had to leave so soon.

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,589
So...

61
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:15,559
I came to give you something.

62
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:24,869
Here.

63
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,700
What's this?

64
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,670
These are...

65
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,339
the items that
Mr. Gu Hae Joon left with me...

66
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,450
before he passed away.

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
What?

68
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,120
I should've given them to you
earlier on,

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,589
but it took me a while.

70
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,229
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,859
(Tiffany Alterations)

72
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,890
I'm sorry
I can't tell you everything now.

73
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,029
When your health improves,

74
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,200
I will get down on my knees...

75
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,400
and ask for forgiveness.

76
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,219
Hae Joon.

77
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:54,419
You left this behind
in case I came back.

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,390
I kept running away
because I felt so guilty.

79
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,510
Honey. Geon's mom.

80
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,250
If you're reading this letter,

81
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,150
that would mean
you came back to me and Geon.

82
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm writing a few words...

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,719
in case we miss each other.

84
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,630
I know that you left us
because of me.

85
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,900
There wasn't any proper proposal
between us,

86
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,400
let alone a wedding.

87
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,669
We never had much to our names,

88
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,810
and whenever my mother
would approach us,

89
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,210
we couldn't even pack up
what little we had...

90
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,210
and had to move from place to place.

91
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,049
If I get to meet you again,

92
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,049
I want to start over.

93
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,419
I'll take you to the theater
we used to frequent,

94
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,859
and we'll watch a movie you like.

95
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,159
Then, I'll confess my love to you
under a beautifully clear sky.

96
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:13,099
I still love you.

97
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,099
And...

98
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,539
I don't resent you.

99
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,039
I miss you.

100
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,450
I'll run over to you
to see you soon.

101
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,330
Hae Joon.

102
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:49,469
Hae Joon, I'm sorry.

103
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,810
I'm sorry, Hae Joon.

104
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,120
Did he ever celebrate
our anniversary before?

105
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,330
Did he ever bring me joy?

106
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,599
I was a fool to expect a gift...

107
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,870
when he wasn't even thinking
about giving me one.

108
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,630
What do I expect from him?

109
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,039
Now, I'll treat myself
to my own joys in life.

110
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:26,339
Why aren't you sleeping?

111
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,880
Well, I'm going to bed soon.

112
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:31,779
I'm so upset.

113
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,020
What did I do all day?

114
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,069
(Maeng Dumplings)

115
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,370
Oh, my. Myung Ja, you're here.

116
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,039
Hey, you're here early.

117
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,140
- Yes.
- Oh, my.

118
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,610
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

119
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,150
I haven't seen that ring before.

120
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,480
Oh, this?

121
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:12,419
This ring...

122
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,789
Why do you have this ring?

123
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,329
What are you two doing?

124
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,029
You haven't even opened up shop.

125
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,240
What about my ring?

126
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,299
Your ring?

127
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,370
Oh, my.

128
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,409
Why is this ring
on Sleepwalker's hand?

129
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,110
Isn't this...

130
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,409
the ring that Gyeong Tae got
for your anniversary?

131
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:45,090
It is, right? The ring that
Gyeong Tae hid in the closet.

132
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,720
Oh, this?

133
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,329
I had lost this ring before.

134
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,329
But Mr. Maeng had found it...

135
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,669
and was holding onto it.

136
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,039
I went to the police station
to report it missing,

137
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,510
and I ran into him there.

138
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,679
Goodness,
I'm sorry if you got the wrong idea.

139
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,120
Gosh, I should've repaid him
for his help.

140
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,679
I'm so grateful.

141
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,850
There's no need to repay him.

142
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,819
I mean, where did you...

143
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,059
suddenly get this ring and lose it?

144
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,730
I've never seen you
wear this before.

145
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,600
I only kept it at home before,

146
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:31,970
but I'm going to
start wearing it now.

147
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,140
Let's get ready for business.

148
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,770
We'll head inside.

149
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,679
(Maeng Dumplings)

150
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,929
Goodness, hello.

151
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,860
- You're here.
- Yes.

152
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,659
My wife saw the ring?

153
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,400
Yes, I gave an excuse for now.

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,340
I told her that you found the ring
that I had lost.

155
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,909
But Myung Ja didn't seem
very happy about it.

156
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,439
I see.

157
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,380
My goodness.

158
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,110
That was why
she was acting like that yesterday.

159
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,419
What? What about yesterday?

160
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,289
She kept asking me
if I had anything to give her...

161
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,750
or if I had forgotten anything.

162
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:29,490
She kept saying such odd things.

163
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,789
I just couldn't understand
what she meant.

164
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,799
Oh, my. That must be why.

165
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,270
She thought it was a present
for your wedding anniversary.

166
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,470
Gosh, an anniversary present?

167
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,409
I have never given her such a thing.

168
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,079
Here's the thing
about anniversary presents.

169
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,779
You might think
a reciprocal exchange is a must,

170
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,449
but you should give her a gift
as her husband.

171
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:58,449
Women tend to sacrifice more
in marriage.

172
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,449
Well...

173
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:04,459
I did take her out
for some ox bone soup.

174
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,459
You took her out for ox bone soup,
and that's it?

175
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,829
Well, she likes that place.

176
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,029
She says a bowl of ox bone soup
at that restaurant...

177
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,470
melts her stress away.

178
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,470
My goodness.

179
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,240
What about things like flowers
or a ring?

180
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,740
I bought her flowers
a little while ago,

181
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:27,880
but she said, "You should've bought
some spinach with that money."

182
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,279
She got all angry at me.

183
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,260
My gosh. It's a different story
with a wedding anniversary present.

184
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,120
You really don't know
what women want.

185
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,029
Women are like roses.

186
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:44,730
Their husbands' affection
makes them bloom beautifully.

187
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,000
But without it, they wilt and die.

188
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,840
Instead of just talking here,

189
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,480
why don't you prepare something?

190
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,480
But how?

191
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,120
What should I prepare?

192
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Oh, boy.

193
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,390
My goodness. She'll make a hole
through the table at this rate.

194
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Call her name sweetly...

195
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,439
just like you used to
when you two were dating.

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Myung Ja.

197
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,169
Like the time
when you proposed to her,

198
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,640
get down on your knees...

199
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,209
and give her flowers.

200
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,500
Tell her how you really feel,
in the sincerest manner.

201
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,029
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,100
I love you.

203
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,279
Am I a beggar?
Are you doing this out of pity?

204
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,039
I don't need a belated present.

205
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,809
Did I ask you to get me flowers?

206
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,850
My goodness, I'm...

207
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,549
I know it's too late,

208
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,120
but I also bought a ring for you.

209
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:14,220
Oh, boy. Here.

210
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,289
Here.

211
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,130
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

212
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,000
I was wondering...

213
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,470
what was up with you.

214
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,569
Why did you hide someone else's ring
in the closet?

215
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,569
And why did you pick up
a random ring on the street?

216
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,679
Well, I was just...

217
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,209
I have 15-15 vision.

218
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,049
- What was I supposed to do?
- As you know,

219
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,850
Gyeong Tae can spot a suspect
4km away even without a telescope.

220
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,549
- He's Detective Maeng, you know.
- That's right.

221
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,059
Everyone knows
that he has the eyes of a beast.

222
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,289
You two are making my blood boil!

223
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:55,059
I'm sick of hearing that beast talk.

224
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,959
I hope a tiger shows up
and snatches you away.

225
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,970
Come on.
I can catch a tiger with one hand.

226
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,939
Years ago,
Gyeong Tae caught a wild boar...

227
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,770
- with one hand...
- Tell me!

228
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,039
What? Tell you what?

229
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,779
That ring. Are you sure?

230
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,679
Am I sure? About what?

231
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,890
Are you sure
you found it on the street?

232
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,120
Yes. What?

233
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,490
You said you found that scarf
on the street too,

234
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,059
but it wasn't true.

235
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,500
Are you lying to me again?

236
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,699
Goodness. Why would I lie to you
about something like that?

237
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,110
If you're keeping anything a secret,

238
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,409
tell me now.

239
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,939
I don't have any secrets.

240
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,079
You'd better tell me.

241
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,750
You can't take it back later.

242
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:52,990
I really don't have any secrets.

243
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,789
Okay, fine.

244
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:02,029
My goodness.

245
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,260
Oh, dear.

246
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,870
My gosh.

247
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,400
- Hey, seriously.
- Oh, boy.

248
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,669
Did you buy this for ten dollars
from a street vendor or something?

249
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:13,970
No.

250
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,039
I paid 50 dollars.

251
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,380
Darn you.

252
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,750
Oh, dear.

253
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,890
I blurted it out...

254
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,529
after keeping it bottled up
for years.

255
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,189
After I asked him if he was keeping
any secrets from me,

256
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,299
my heart began racing.

257
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,529
"Trust him no matter what."

258
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:40,900
My survival tactic
is getting shaken up.

259
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,199
Hey, husband. If there's anything
you're hiding from me,

260
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,039
don't tell me until the end.

261
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,709
I want to live a little too.

262
00:16:58,549 --> 00:16:59,549
My gosh.

263
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,289
No way.

264
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,990
- Oh, look!
- What? Why? What is it?

265
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,689
Gong Hee,
did you see a bug or something?

266
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:08,699
It worked.

267
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,929
Holly.

268
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,429
Holly said yes!

269
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:12,630
- What?
- What?

270
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,939
What?
Holly wants to collaborate with us?

271
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,470
For real? Let me see!

272
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,470
- Oh, my.
- My gosh!

273
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,069
Holly emailed the company too.

274
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,679
Holly's answer is yes.

275
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,309
Holly accepted Gong Hee's proposal.

276
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:27,280
I just opened my inbox
and saw the email too.

277
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,719
A collaboration with Holly!
Who knew this day would come?

278
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,189
- My goodness.
- Yes!

279
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,620
You're the only one in the world
who has managed to convince her.

280
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,830
Gong Hee, I'm so impressed.

281
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,560
Congratulations, Gong Hee!

282
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,400
Seriously, amazing job.

283
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,269
- You rock!
- Maeng Gong Hee!

284
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:46,429
- Maeng Gong Hee!
- Maeng Gong Hee!

285
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:47,429
Maeng Gong Hee!

286
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:49,969
You told Gu Dan Soo to stay away,

287
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,540
but I can still help you as Holly.

288
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,870
(Seo Min Gi)

289
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,580
I refuse to disappear
from your life.

290
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
What do I do?

291
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:00,449
My gosh. I feel crazy right now.

292
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,919
Hey!

293
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,060
I still find it so hard to believe.

294
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,130
Ms. Eom, pinch my cheek.

295
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,390
- Pinch you?
- Yes.

296
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,729
This isn't a dream!

297
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:23,269
This is amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

298
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,610
Hey, even that Ice Witch
couldn't do it.

299
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,570
But you did it, Gong Hee!

300
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,340
Do an amazing job
with the project...

301
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,580
and put that snobby Ice Witch...

302
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:34,209
in her place.

303
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,479
I really want to do well.

304
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:39,350
Yes, you got this. You can do it.

305
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,459
Gong Hee.

306
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,459
You're now officially in charge
of the collaboration with Holly.

307
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,590
Oh, yes!
I'm so happy for you. Well done.

308
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,330
What?

309
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,429
- Let's go.
- What?

310
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,070
You look very excited.

311
00:18:56,939 --> 00:19:00,640
Well, it's all thanks to you
and your trust in me.

312
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:01,979
What?

313
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,479
You said...

314
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,310
it was an opportunity for me
to become a permanent employee.

315
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,880
Thanks to you,
I could pluck up my courage.

316
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,780
Are you being sarcastic with me?

317
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,590
No, I really am grateful to you.

318
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,350
Please help me out, Ms. Kang.

319
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:16,189
All right, then.

320
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,300
Maeng Gong Hee
keeps getting on my nerves.

321
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,969
From how she keeps hovering
around Min Gi...

322
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,140
to how she keeps getting cheeky
with me.

323
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,179
Hello, Reporter Park.
How have you been?

324
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,419
I think I should be able to tell you
something interesting soon.

325
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,090
Would you be interested?

326
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,229
Congratulations, Gong Hee.
You did it.

327
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,030
Thank you.

328
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,699
I'm really rooting for you,
Gong Hee.

329
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,070
I can keep rooting for you, right?

330
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,769
Thank you for rooting for me
as my manager.

331
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,540
And thank you
for congratulating me too.

332
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,249
You two broke up.

333
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:19,890
Stop lurking around.

334
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,290
Just leave her alone.

335
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,320
Stop confusing Gong Hee.

336
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,860
You.

337
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:28,630
You keep poking your nose
into her business.

338
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,729
Be honest with me. What's going on?

339
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,900
Are you dating Gong Hee
or something?

340
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,870
Who are you to Gong Hee?

341
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
A roommate.

342
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
What?

343
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,969
I'm her roommate.

344
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,709
The room is so small...

345
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,850
that I can barely fit in.

346
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
So...

347
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,689
I want her ex-roommate
to move out as soon as possible.

348
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,259
What was that?

349
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,009
Thank goodness the business
is doing pretty well these days.

350
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,350
We can at least help Gong Boo
pay for the wedding venue.

351
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,860
Well, if I...

352
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,459
If I cancel my insurance policy...

353
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:36,560
Why would you do that?

354
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,600
You spent all the money
in our savings account,

355
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,570
took our house deed,

356
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,110
and even sold the land
your parents had given you.

357
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,870
The insurance is all you have left.
Will you use that up too?

358
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,080
Why not just take the deposit
on the shop and use it up too?

359
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,509
You're the expert
at blowing our savings, aren't you?

360
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,550
Goodness. I only brought it up
because we need money...

361
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,489
for Gong Boo's wedding.

362
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:01,390
Forget it. If they don't have money,

363
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,959
they'll figure something out
on their own.

364
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,290
What more can I do?

365
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,489
I don't need any of it!

366
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,600
Oh, dear. Hey...

367
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,540
Goodness, Gyeong Tae. Seriously...

368
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,739
You're a master at ruining the mood.

369
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,110
Why do wedding anniversaries exist?

370
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,610
It's the best opportunity
to win some points.

371
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,280
But you just had to go
and ruin that too. Oh, boy.

372
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,719
Goodness.

373
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,390
That's because I'm a fool.
I think my nose is bleeding.

374
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
Oh, my.

375
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,890
Oh, yes.

376
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,159
What about this?

377
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,169
As thank-you gifts
for our wedding guests.

378
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,969
- Towels?
- Yes.

379
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:49,600
Towels make nice presents.

380
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,640
They wipe down your weary body,

381
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,840
and they feel soft.

382
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:54,469
We could have them
embroidered with...

383
00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:57,209
"Congratulations, Eom Hong Dan
and Maeng Gong Boo's Wedding."

384
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,179
People could look at it and think,
"Yes, we got this from them,"

385
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,550
and remember us.

386
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:05,150
Well, you do have to switch out
your towels regularly. That's nice.

387
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:06,449
Yes.

388
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,919
Just like...

389
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,830
how you switch out...

390
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,590
your wives regularly?

391
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,699
So, when is the next switch period?

392
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,130
Since it took you five years,

393
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,469
will it be in another five years?

394
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,669
When did I switch out my wife?

395
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,769
Strictly speaking,
I was the one who got dumped.

396
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,080
And I barely lived with her,
so I'm practically like new.

397
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:34,110
Well, but you do have
some wear and tear.

398
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:35,519
What?

399
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,989
Let's hurry up and buy
the thank-you gifts.

400
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:40,650
Then we'll go
and look at some dishes.

401
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,989
We should get
a whole new set of dishes.

402
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:43,590
Why get new ones?
Yours seemed perfectly fine.

403
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,790
Are you saying you want me to have
a used husband, a used house,

404
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,259
and even used dishes too?

405
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,600
Will you keep calling me
a used husband?

406
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,330
What else would I call you, then?

407
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,870
It's not like you're a new husband.

408
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,140
You shouldn't be like that
at your age.

409
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:01,040
I saved you right before menopause,

410
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,110
so you should be bowing to me
and thanking me...

411
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,439
Why, you...

412
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,380
This mouth.

413
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,380
(Grandma)

414
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,679
What? Hush.

415
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,550
Hi, Grandma. Nice timing.

416
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,850
At home?

417
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,090
Why?

418
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Okay.

419
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,860
Here. I wanted...

420
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:23,199
to do something for you,
even if it isn't much.

421
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,669
Don't tell anyone else
that I gave you this.

422
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,499
Use it for whatever you need.

423
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,110
But how can I accept this, Grandma?

424
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,409
Goodness, it's not much.

425
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,840
Just take it. Here.

426
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,479
Then, I'll use it well.

427
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,280
All right. My precious grandson.

428
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,550
You were always so smart that...

429
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,159
I only had to teach you one thing
for you to figure out the rest.

430
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,719
You were such a good student...

431
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,330
that even your name means
"to study."

432
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:54,429
Well, I was a good student.

433
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:55,729
Yes, that's right.

434
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:59,269
You know, I had a hard time
holding myself back...

435
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,169
from boasting about you.

436
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:02,439
Why hold yourself back?

437
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,699
Don't hold back. Just boast away.

438
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,239
I should be considerate
of those with grandsons...

439
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,840
who aren't good students.

440
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:12,310
It may be hard,
but I should hold back.

441
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,479
Goodness, Grandma.

442
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,219
I respect you so much.

443
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,320
Goodness. All right.

444
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,959
- Grandma.
- Oh, my grandson.

445
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,070
I gave you all this time.

446
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,929
How does it make sense
that you haven't found her yet?

447
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,610
I apologize, ma'am.

448
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,780
It seems like
she keeps her identity a secret.

449
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,640
She hasn't told anyone
her real name,

450
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,650
so it's hard to track her down.

451
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,580
And what if she goes near Dan Soo?

452
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,890
If you can't find her,
bring Dan Soo home.

453
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,890
I need to keep an eye on him
for me to relax.

454
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,090
I'll go tomorrow...

455
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,219
Tomorrow? Why wait?

456
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,360
Go over there this instant
and bring Dan Soo home.

457
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:03,030
Yes, then I'll go now...

458
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,959
No, I'll go.

459
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,570
Where did you say he was staying?

460
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,439
If you go there,

461
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,400
Dan Soo will be put
in a very difficult position.

462
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,709
He told people
that he grew up in a poor household.

463
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,979
It'll look like he tricked
the family he's staying with.

464
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,249
He told me over and over
never to come back to that house...

465
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:23,280
I'm going to bring my grandson back.
So what?

466
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,019
Get the car ready!

467
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,360
(Bubble Up Laundry)

468
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,390
This way, ma'am.

469
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,459
Is this the house?

470
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:36,699
Yes, ma'am.

471
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,870
You should wait in the car.

472
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,439
I'll deal with this.

473
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:53,979
(Onju Rice Cakes)

474
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:55,419
Who are you?

475
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,650
Oh, you must be
the lady of the house.

476
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,890
Yes, I am.

477
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:08,360
I'm Dan Soo's grandmother.

478
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,860
Dan Soo's grandmother?

479
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,900
I came to take Dan Soo home.

480
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,699
Didn't you kick him out before?

481
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:16,900
Why do you want him back now?

482
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,040
Do you want to get Dan Soo back...

483
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,540
since he has a job now
and is making some money?

484
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,009
What did you say?

485
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,209
Leave. How can a grandmother
take her grandson's money,

486
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,120
starve him, and kick him out?

487
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,719
Goodness,
even a stranger wouldn't do that.

488
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,320
How can you be so shameless
as to come looking for him?

489
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,489
Look here.

490
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,259
I had my reasons...

491
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,360
- for doing...
- Grandma?

492
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,199
Dan Soo.

493
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:48,939
What...

494
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,570
(My Merry Marriage)

495
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,739
You kicked him out
without a penny to his name.

496
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:24,800
Now, you want him back?

497
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,040
What are you doing
with the soy sauce?

498
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,040
It'll taste amazing.

499
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
You should gulp it down.

500
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,350
Mom, you have to find
your own joy in life.

501
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,509
I'll make it and deliver it myself.

502
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,620
That's right. If you're happy,
that's all that matters.

503
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,519
My grandma wants me
to move back home.

504
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,019
That's great.

505
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:44,419
Do you really want me to leave?
