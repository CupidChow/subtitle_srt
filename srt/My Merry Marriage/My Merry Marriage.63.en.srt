1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,219
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,260
Cheers.

3
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,100
So, what did you gain this year?

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,499
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

5
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:30,470
I've gotten better at flattery
and reading the room,

6
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,169
and I've gained weight
and more responsibilities.

7
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,470
Then what did you lose this year?

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
My pride.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,709
My account balance, my freedom,

10
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:43,779
and my stamina.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,579
My goodness, brother. Cheer up.

12
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:53,049
Hey, seriously. Why is life so hard?

13
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:55,259
Don't make me laugh.

14
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,229
Is he Socrates or something?
Why would you ask your brother?

15
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,030
She's right. Don't ask me.

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,869
I mean, even Socrates had no idea.

17
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,500
How would I know?

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,100
That's right. Why would you ask him,
knowing he's failed in life?

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,470
It's always the dumb ones
who cheat in exams...

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,809
by copying answers
from even dumber ones.

21
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,579
Why are you so quiet today?

22
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,949
Oh, I was just...

23
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,889
asking my buddy, Fka,
for some answers.

24
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,859
What? Who? Fka?

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,490
Who's that?

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,130
Franz Kafka.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,759
He said,

28
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:35,930
"If you feel like someone..."

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,070
"has pierced through your heart,"

30
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,469
"and if your heart utterly aches
because of it,"

31
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:46,139
"that means..."

32
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:49,139
"you truly love that person."

33
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,050
Right now, at this moment,

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,889
there's this person
who is piercing through my heart.

35
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,490
Oh, boy.

36
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,830
This is helping me realize again...

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,300
just how much I love her.

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,999
Because I hurt her,

39
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:13,100
I'm hurting like this now.

40
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,469
Why would you seek revenge?

41
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,469
When you stab someone with a knife,

42
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:22,080
the spine of the knife
points at you.

43
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:30,450
You and your drunken nonsense again.

44
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,089
I have no idea what he's saying.

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,490
Where did you get the cucumber?

46
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,400
(Contacts)

47
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,439
I pity my life.

48
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,569
I have no one to vent to.

49
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,839
Ssook Ssook.

50
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,180
Mommy is so lonely.

51
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Oh, right.

52
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
(The Seduction of
Spicy Chicken Feet)

53
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,119
Hello?

54
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,119
Oh, right. Yes.

55
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,830
Yes. I want it extra spicy, please.

56
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:12,689
I see.

57
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,659
You don't deliver?
I have to come and pick it up?

58
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:17,499
Right.

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,129
Oh, my husband
always picked it up for me,

60
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:21,770
but he's not here now.

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,039
No, he's not sick.

62
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,980
The truth is,

63
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,309
we've split up.

64
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,210
As soon as we got married.

65
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,849
Right after our honeymoon.

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,680
Does it make sense to you?

67
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
No, right?

68
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,730
Well, he said he had to leave me
because he loved me, but...

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
What?

70
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,529
Hello?

71
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,069
Unbelievable. My gosh.

72
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,740
People have no sympathy.

73
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,309
Right, I guess everyone is busy...

74
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,510
and happy.

75
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,150
Everyone except for me.

76
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,089
Hae Joon.

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,159
Another year passed by,

78
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,400
and I thought about you
all day every day...

79
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,439
without forgetting you
even for a moment.

80
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,939
Thank you...

81
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,240
for staying alive in my heart...

82
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,710
and in my memories...

83
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,080
for another year.

84
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,190
And I'm sorry.

85
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:47,890
For...

86
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,159
not being able to forget you.

87
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,700
I'm really sorry.

88
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,810
Mom, did you have some tteokguk?

89
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:12,279
I wanted to spend the first morning
of the new year with you,

90
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:15,179
but I have a new burden now,
you know.

91
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,549
A tiny and adorable burden.

92
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,520
He's not a burden.

93
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,859
He is life's gift to you.

94
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,719
I hope that boy...

95
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,760
can motivate you to stay strong
and have a great year.

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,200
You haven't had tteokguk yet, right?

97
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,500
I left some rice cakes
in your freezer.

98
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,870
You'll find a batch of
frozen beef bone soup next to it.

99
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,000
Bring the soup to a boil
and throw in some rice cakes.

100
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,839
So, I get to have tteokguk...

101
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,609
on New Year's Day
and again on Lunar New Year?

102
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,239
Then...

103
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,810
I'll get two years older. How nice.

104
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,650
Don't get any older.
Just enjoy the tteokguk, Mom.

105
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
Okay.

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,589
All right.

107
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Yes.

108
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,039
I should start...

109
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,940
tying up the loose ends, one by one.

110
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:30,159
All right. You need
to warm up your joints like this.

111
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,989
- Hug me.
- What?

112
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,760
- Goodness.
- Hug me.

113
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,429
Is this morning or night?

114
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,099
- Hug me.
- Oh, boy. This won't do.

115
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,539
- Hug me...
- Grandpa is your private plane!

116
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,770
One more time?

117
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,950
Higher!

118
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,650
Hey, Dad.

119
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,179
Why did you drag me out
to join your morning exercise?

120
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:59,150
You punk. The new year has begun,

121
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,820
so you have to exercise with me
every day.

122
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,929
Do you think
raising a child is a joke?

123
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:05,690
You need to build physical strength!

124
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,299
How many times have I told you?

125
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,200
I believe sleep is more important
than exercise...

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,099
Dad, how come
you have no muscles at all?

127
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,270
- What?
- What? Muscles?

128
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,900
What are you saying? Look here.

129
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,010
I mean, I used to have some here.

130
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,870
Where did my muscles go?

131
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,109
Ji Hoon's dad is very muscular.

132
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,250
Who is Ji Hoon?

133
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,320
Come on!
You don't know my friend, Ji Hoon?

134
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,060
Ji Hoon's dad exercises every day.

135
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,690
His dad is very cool.

136
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,260
I guess I should exercise too.

137
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,190
Fine. Let's exercise, Dad.

138
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,599
Great. Watch me and do
exactly what I do, both of you.

139
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,700
All right. Move your arms and legs
as if you're walking. One, two.

140
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,070
Stop. Arms, up and down like this!

141
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,140
One, two.

142
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,779
- Up.
- Next, the sides.

143
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,010
One, two.

144
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,779
One, two. You're good.

145
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:03,549
I feel like I'm about to pass out.

146
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,849
Hey, it really is not easy
to be a dad.

147
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,089
Where's No Ah?

148
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,159
He's washing up with Dad.

149
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:14,359
Dad said, "You, rascal,"
and No Ah quietly followed him.

150
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,400
Hey, I'm surprised you exercised.
It's so unlike you.

151
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,599
Hey, every child thinks
their dad is Superman.

152
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,270
I'm so weak. How am I suddenly
going to become his Superman?

153
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,279
Because I couldn't bear
the heavy weight of my life,

154
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,049
I never once bothered
to lift weights.

155
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:32,049
My gosh.

156
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,750
Good for you.

157
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,219
No Ah doesn't have
any allergies, does he?

158
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,789
Oh, Gong Boo couldn't eat carrots
when he was little.

159
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,520
What? Gong Boo? Really?

160
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,130
He was just faking it.

161
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,289
You're right!

162
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,859
Gong Boo didn't want
to eat carrots as a kid,

163
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,000
so he'd pretend to eat them...

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,730
and scratch his arms so much
to make them red.

165
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,730
Why, you little...

166
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,900
I told you to keep it a secret
for life, didn't I?

167
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,740
I think No Ah's allergies were
in the notebook Soo Yeon gave me.

168
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,510
I'll take a look.

169
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,880
Gong Boo, I'll look into
a daycare center for No Ah.

170
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,980
There are many
that take online registrations.

171
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:09,319
I thought you were busy.

172
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:11,919
He's my nephew.
I should do that much as his auntie.

173
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,590
That's because Gong Hee...

174
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,659
grew up with such a great auntie.

175
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,390
My goodness.

176
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,159
Gong Boo, make sure
you run the clinic well from now on.

177
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,600
Of course. He has two kids now.
Am I wrong?

178
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
That's right. I'm a father of two.

179
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,409
I really have to work hard
to earn more money.

180
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:34,809
I'll look into the daycare center.

181
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:35,880
I'm his dad.

182
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,679
I'll live my own life now.

183
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,750
I can't live off
of my family's help forever.

184
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:45,789
What's up with him?

185
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,350
He's acting so strange.

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,319
Is he finally coming to his senses?

187
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,059
He is a father of two.

188
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,689
He should become mature now.

189
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,039
What's wrong with you lately?

190
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,409
Tell me
if you're not happy about something.

191
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,480
I told you it was nothing.

192
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:15,679
Mother said something to you again,
didn't she?

193
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,789
Can I ask you something?

194
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,990
My friend became pregnant
when she didn't want to.

195
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,529
I guess the guy doesn't know.

196
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,500
She should hurry up and tell him.

197
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,000
The man is engaged to someone else.

198
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,939
Still, he should take responsibility
if there's a child between them.

199
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,169
Then what about the fiancee?

200
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,240
Does she have to lose her man
to someone else?

201
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,539
Well, a baby is...

202
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,549
much more important
than being engaged.

203
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,380
Is the baby
the only thing that matters?

204
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,220
How can you be so old-fashioned?

205
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,520
Then, if a woman likes a man,

206
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,059
should she just sleep with him
and have his baby?

207
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,590
Why are you putting it like that?

208
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,329
That's exactly what you're saying
right now!

209
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,529
Is the responsibility for a child
the only important thing?

210
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,669
What about the love they shared?

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,470
Could you let that just fizzle away?

212
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,970
What's up with you?
You're acting weird.

213
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Kang Ji Na.

214
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,179
What on earth is wrong with you?

215
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,990
I am sure
Min Gi will choose his child.

216
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,959
I know him all too well.

217
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,130
After everything it took me
to come all this way?

218
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,829
Maeng Gong Hee.

219
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,699
How dare you try to ruin my plan?

220
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,510
A mere girl like you?

221
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,010
This tastes good.

222
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,419
No Ah, you must be so happy.

223
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,850
You get to eat
as much tteokguk as you want.

224
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,959
You should eat up too, Uncle.

225
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
He's getting so old now too.

226
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,059
Tteokguk? He can't get himself
to eat it at his age.

227
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,630
If you ask for another serving
like No Ah did...

228
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,630
as you eat tteokguk,

229
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,970
it means you're still young.

230
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,939
If you gobble up a bowl of tteokguk,

231
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,539
you're still youthful.

232
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,039
If you feel lousy as you eat
tteokguk, you're middle-aged.

233
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,380
And if you complain...

234
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,209
about indigestion
while eating tteokguk,

235
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,949
you're already old.

236
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Not me.

237
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,689
Is anyone here happy to grow older
other than No Ah?

238
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:39,329
Of course.

239
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,959
You're at the age where you can't
stomach tteokguk either.

240
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,559
Don't eat too much.

241
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,400
My mom said...

242
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,770
the beginning of a new year
was a good thing.

243
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,970
- What?
- Why?

244
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,409
That's because you can start fresh.

245
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:56,579
- Oh, goodness.
- My gosh.

246
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,980
- Whose son is this?
- I know, right?

247
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,319
You sure are right. You are.

248
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,730
Has this sofa always been so big?

249
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,730
When we were lying here,
it felt so crowded...

250
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,370
that I always had to
tell him to move...

251
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,439
and tried to kick him off the sofa.

252
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,309
Goodness.

253
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,079
He was so stubborn
about buying these,

254
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,409
but he didn't even finish them.

255
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,819
I don't even like cheese.

256
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,390
Why did he leave it all behind?

257
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,529
Why did he leave me here
all on my own?

258
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,370
Mom, I did as you told me to.

259
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,309
Mom, when are you coming back?

260
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,709
I can't go back right away.

261
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,110
That was why I asked Daddy
to look after you.

262
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,319
To take care of you
for a little while.

263
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,020
Mom, you're busy
because you're an adult, right?

264
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,919
Yes.

265
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,020
I want to become an adult soon too.

266
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,689
Then I can be busy with you.

267
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,699
How do you become an adult?

268
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,370
Great-grandma told me...

269
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,169
that you can become an adult
once you become a parent.

270
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:33,010
She said not all older people
were actually adults.

271
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
No Ah.

272
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,689
Can you wait outside for a minute?

273
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,799
What is this?

274
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,669
Have you been keeping in touch?

275
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:07,439
What's wrong with me
keeping in touch with my son?

276
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,179
Do you call yourself a parent?

277
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,409
You ran off to the US,
leaving your young son behind.

278
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:14,720
You try raising him too.

279
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
What?

280
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,919
Have you ever run
to the Emergency Room...

281
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,949
in your slippers
because of his fever?

282
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,890
They can't give him
any more medicine or IV drips.

283
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,360
All they tell you is to wait
until his fever breaks.

284
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,990
Have you ever cried on the ground
after hearing such things?

285
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,929
You don't even know how that feels.

286
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,100
How dare you talk about
being a parent to me?

287
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:32,230
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon.
Listen to me carefully.

288
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,299
I'm going to raise No Ah,

289
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,840
but consider yourself warned.

290
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,970
I will never send No Ah back to you.

291
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,779
Don't ever say
that you'll take him back.

292
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:44,880
I'll raise him.

293
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,150
Even if you come back and beg me,

294
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,150
I will raise him.

295
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:49,449
I'm sure you were ready for this
before sending him to me.

296
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,760
Do you even have the right
to say that?

297
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,689
And do you have the right
to take the kid back?

298
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,490
You left the kid with me
and left to fulfill your own greed.

299
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,630
Don't you dare say anything else.

300
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,130
That is...

301
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,299
our atonement for Maeng No Ah.

302
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,370
That's how we act as his parents.

303
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,069
Keep that in mind.

304
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,630
No Ah.

305
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:33,559
Why were you hiding to talk to her?

306
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,260
You can call her freely.

307
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,760
Really?

308
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,470
Who told you to call her in hiding?

309
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,299
Mom did.

310
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,909
Mom told me to call her in secret.

311
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,539
You don't have to do that anymore.

312
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,809
Gosh, kid.

313
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:52,579
Here.

314
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,319
- Hello.
- Hey.

315
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:03,659
Come on in.

316
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,059
I'm sorry to call you
on your day off.

317
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,929
Goodness, don't be.

318
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:11,400
I'm always happy to see you,
Gong Hee.

319
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,069
You needed to use
the sewing machine, right?

320
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,470
Use it as much as you need.

321
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,900
Thank you.

322
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,510
This is Holly's design collection.

323
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,610
Goodness,
you're collaborating with Holly?

324
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,380
It must be a dream come true.

325
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,850
Yes, but I'm in a tight spot
because of that.

326
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,689
There have been rumors that
Holly will appear for the finale.

327
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,790
Really? Is Holly coming?

328
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,159
No.

329
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,489
Holly has never revealed their face.

330
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:43,199
I don't even know
where that rumor got started.

331
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,169
There were news articles about it,

332
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,999
so I sent an email.
I'm still waiting on an answer.

333
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:51,040
I see.
I'm looking forward to it too.

334
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,209
I'm curious to see
if Holly is a woman or a man.

335
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,280
Well, everyone said Holly was a man.

336
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Holly is probably a man, right?

337
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,320
I think Holly is a woman.

338
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,350
Holly is the name of the female lead
in a movie I like.

339
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,060
Holly is the female lead's name
in "Breakfast at Tiffany's."

340
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,659
Oh, you must like that movie.

341
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,830
That's where I got the name
for my alteration shop too.

342
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,959
Tiffany Alterations.

343
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,729
Oh, that's fascinating.

344
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:22,400
Dan Soo likes that movie too.

345
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:24,939
Dan Soo?

346
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,979
Yes, he talks about that movie
every now and then.

347
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:29,409
Last time,

348
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:33,409
he was talking nonsense
that he was actually Holly.

349
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,050
You haven't heard from Dan Soo,
have you?

350
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,519
No, he won't answer my calls.

351
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,620
I think he might be
somewhere abroad.

352
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,259
I think I need
to leave this place soon.

353
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,030
What? Why?

354
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:52,469
I have a bit of a situation.

355
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:54,939
I was...

356
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
hoping to see Dan Soo before I left.

357
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,509
I see.
I don't know what your situation is,

358
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,380
but I hope you can stay.

359
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,850
When Dan Soo is back,

360
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,280
he'll be so sad.

361
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,120
I know he was very fond of you.

362
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,590
My gosh.

363
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,229
Dan Soo, see you later.

364
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:22,759
Yes, see you.

365
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,360
Hey, it's been a while.

366
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,900
Do you happen to know
any reporters in Korea?

367
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:02,040
I was just wondering.

368
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,469
I need to take care of something.

369
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,409
Yes, look into it for me.

370
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,209
Me?

371
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,380
I'm not in Korea right now.

372
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,590
I'm not sure.

373
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,120
I don't know...

374
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:26,689
if I'll ever go back.

375
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,939
My goodness.

376
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:39,310
Are you advertising to the world
that you're pulling an all-nighter?

377
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,340
Because of all the preparations
for the fashion show,

378
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
I have to work nonstop even at home.

379
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:46,050
You aren't the only one.

380
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,479
I'm working just as much.

381
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,820
Come on. You just got married.

382
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,620
I bet you can't focus on work
the moment you get home.

383
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,120
Gosh, you have someone
to welcome you when you get home.

384
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,790
I don't have anyone either.
No one welcomes me at home.

385
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:01,699
What?

386
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,229
I don't have anyone either.

387
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:04,929
As soon as we got back
from our honeymoon,

388
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,929
my husband's ex-wife
sent their child to our house.

389
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:08,999
What?

390
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,769
He said he had no idea
about the child either,

391
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,709
but he can't say he didn't know
and get away with it.

392
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:15,909
I kicked out both of them.

393
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,040
So, I live alone now.

394
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:22,080
Oh, no. What are you going to do?

395
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,019
I mean, you even had your wedding.

396
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:27,120
Wait, then what about the baby?

397
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,689
Will you have the baby by yourself?

398
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,959
Yes, then what else can I do?

399
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,900
My gosh.
Won't that just help his ex-wife?

400
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,330
Why do you say that?

401
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:41,330
I mean, think about it.

402
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,140
They got a divorce.

403
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,409
So, why did she send the kid
to her ex-husband?

404
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,439
Don't you think she pulled the trick
to get back together with him?

405
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,509
My goodness.
I have no idea who this woman is,

406
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,979
but she's really something.

407
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,080
How did she even come up
with such an idea?

408
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,650
My gosh, I bet
she's got an ulterior motive...

409
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,120
What? Where did she go?

410
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,090
Goodness.

411
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,560
Holly has read my emails
but isn't getting back to me.

412
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,429
My gosh. I asked Holly
to show up for the finale.

413
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,070
Of course, it was too much to ask.

414
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,840
What should I do?

415
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,769
Hey, Gong Hee.

416
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,570
Hey.

417
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,880
What's her name?

418
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,280
I swear, I heard it,

419
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,640
but I can't remember.

420
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,150
"Her?" Who?

421
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,249
Your brother's ex-wife.

422
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,650
Oh, Soo Yeon? Lee Soo Yeon.

423
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,659
I see. She's a doctor, right?

424
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:36,820
Which hospital?

425
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,229
I don't know either.

426
00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:40,759
She cut off all contact
with everyone in the family.

427
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:43,199
Here, is it her?

428
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Yes.

429
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,499
Why is a doctor so pretty?

430
00:22:52,469 --> 00:22:54,239
Did she get
multiple plastic surgeries?

431
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,040
No, Soo Yeon is all natural.

432
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,650
Hey.

433
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:03,120
I'm all natural too.

434
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,989
Of course, I know that.

436
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:07,989
Yes.

(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

439
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,330
Did Dr. Maeng go somewhere?

440
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,630
He went to meet his realtor
to put the clinic up for sale.

441
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,370
Put the clinic up for sale?

442
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:22,999
What do you mean...

443
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,699
I'm not sure.

444
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:27,110
I'm guessing he might go to the US.

445
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,209
The US?

446
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,709
That's where
his son's mother is now.

448
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,719
I don't know
how this will sound to you,

449
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,489
but I'll be honest.

450
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:47,729
Your mother isn't qualified
to be my in-law.

451
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:50,459
No, not just as my in-law.

452
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:53,269
I don't want to cross paths
with her again, ever.

453
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,100
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,040
I know she was rude to you.
I apologize on her behalf.

455
00:23:58,509 --> 00:23:59,509
"Rude?"

456
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:01,709
She was beyond rude.

457
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,340
I'm deeply conflicted as to...

458
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,709
whether or not I should accept you
as my daughter-in-law.

459
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,449
I'm sorry.

460
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,290
Please don't be so angry, Mother.

461
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Here.

462
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,159
I got you this.

463
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,630
Ji Na.

464
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:24,330
I read over a hundred poems
by my favorite poet,

465
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:26,969
but I'm still fuming mad.

466
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,699
Do you think this little gift
will make my anger go away?

467
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,340
Please, Mother.

468
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
My goodness.

469
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,580
Oh, my. This is...

470
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,219
It's a special limited edition.
I went through hoops to get it.

471
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,419
It is beautiful.

472
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,790
How precious.

473
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,800
We'll soon schedule a family meeting
for our wedding.

474
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,870
You should wear this
to the meeting, Mother.

475
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,840
Well, it's all good as long as
things work out in the end.

476
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,610
We've been through
such a long, roundabout journey...

477
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,840
to celebrate a day like this,
after all.

478
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,479
Oh, I'm sorry.

479
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,209
What kind of tea would you like?

480
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,219
Oh, I'm good.

481
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,390
Actually, I came to talk to you
about something.

482
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,620
What? What is it? Go on and tell me.

483
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:27,959
Min Gi...

484
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,830
has a child.

485
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,800
What? A child?

486
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:37,969
Yes.

487
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,009
My goodness.
Ji Na, does that mean you are...

488
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,479
No, not me.

489
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,850

490
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,050
I see.

491
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,050
What?

492
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:06,669
It's candy
for your morning sickness.

493
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,900

your morning sickness.

Thank you.

It must be hard to prepare
so many things all by yourself.

496
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:19,179
Since I'm doing this alone,
I should work twice as hard...

497
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:20,810
to be prepared.

498

anxious, or worried,

506

your baby can feel everything too.

Yes, it's Momo.

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,150

00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:36,949
so I thought he went to the shop.

537
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:37,949
What?

538
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,749
You took him,
saying you'd look after him.

539
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:41,590
Mom.

540
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,019
Where has he gone?

541
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,290
I searched all the playgrounds
in the area but couldn't find him.

542
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,030
What?

543
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,259
