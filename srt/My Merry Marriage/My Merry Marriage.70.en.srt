1
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,619
Seo Min Gi, you jerk!

2
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,789
How could you do that
to Maeng Gong Hee?

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,030
Gong Hee is...

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,700
Maeng Gong Hee is...

5
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,009
To me, Maeng Gong Hee is...

6
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,620
like my own life.

7
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,359
Everyone says this.

8
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,459
(Episode 70)

9
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:58,230
"Just work for the department store
your parents own."

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,830
"Why work
for someone else's company?"

11
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,029
I wanted to do something creative
instead of working in distribution,

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,929
and Jayce Fashion was...

13
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:07,870
the perfect company
to make my dream come true.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
And...

15
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,940
that was where I met you,
Seo Min Gi.

16
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,580
You were like
the perfect piece of the puzzle...

17
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,349
I needed for the life
I had planned for myself...

18
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,419
until you proposed to me.

19
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,919
Why would you say that?

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,590
You know...

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,559
I betrayed what I had believed in
and chose you.

22
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,100
I used to hate the idea of marriage,

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,269
but I decided to get married
because of you.

24
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,570
My parents wanted me
to marry someone else,

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,999
but I persuaded my mom.

26
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:44,769
And what? Because of Maeng Gong Hee,
who is a nobody,

27
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:45,909
you want to break up with me?

28
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,510
Do you really mean it?

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,950
You see, I...

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,290
I admit that I'm desperate
to become successful.

31
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,859
What?

32
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,730
It's because...

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,829
success always ended up
slipping away from me...

34
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,329
when I thought
I could finally taste it.

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,100
That's why I became so desperate.

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,680
Aren't you sick of it? I'll help you
get out of that dark place.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,749
I'll do it. I will help you.

38
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,180
No.

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,919
I can never get out of this rut.

40
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,089
What?

41
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,190
This is my limit.

42
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,089
Like you said,

43
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,500
I've hit rock bottom,
and it's where I belong.

44
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,000
Like your mother said,

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm a petty-minded loser.

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,070
From the very beginning,
we weren't right for each other.

47
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,209
You were wrong.

48
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:54,839
Seo Min Gi.

49
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,679
I'm sorry...

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,850
for letting things drag on.

51
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,030
(Bubble Up Laundry)

52
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,260
You woke up?

53
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:46,429
Hey, don't tell me...

54
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,100
Did you sleep here?

55
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,230
I was fuming mad,

56
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,470
so I had to cool down.

57
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,369
Then you should've slept inside.

58
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,380
You went ahead and locked the door.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,209
I'm freezing right now.

60
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,109
Oh, no.

61
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,220
Hey, what happened to your hand?

62
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:16,919
I boxed
for the first time in a while.

63
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,760
Hey, you're not athletic at all.

64
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,169
The punching bag
isn't a drum or something.

65
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,100
Hey, it hurts!

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,799
Be gentle, will you?

67
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,169
Be caring like Florence Nightingale,
the nurse.

68
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,209
Gently blow on it first.

69
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,480
Treat it with all your heart.

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,849
Goodness. Be quiet.
You and your mouth.

71
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,779
There, it's done!

72
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,120
Right. Forget Florence Nightingale.
You're more like Joan of Arc.

73
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,829
Hey, did you cry all night?

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,300
Your face looks like
you were crying all night.

75
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,399
Why would I cry all night?
I'm not you, Snot Face.

76
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,300
Why would you bring up
my old nickname again?

77
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,469
I didn't cry.

78
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,709
Well, I'm glad
to hear that you didn't cry.

79
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,050
What do you plan to do now?

80
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,219
Kang Ji Na is going all out,
like a mad woman.

81
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,719
What are you going to do?

82
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:19,589
I...

83
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,889
I'm only thinking about one thing.

84
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,800
I want to protect my baby.

85
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,260
But how?

86
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,670
Do you think
you can win against Kang Ji Na?

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,899
You probably don't know this.

88
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,570
A toad can beat any beast.

89
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,880
But I don't care about winning.

90
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,909
I just want to hold out.

91
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,779
Until the end, for my baby.

92
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,550
And I'll love my baby
with my everything.

93
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:59,659
I haven't told you
why I came here, have I?

94
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,899
Let's do it together.

95
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,430
I'll become your baby's dad.

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,070
Are you insane?

97
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,269
No, I'm more sane than ever.

98
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,279
Get out.

99
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Hey, Maeng Gong Hee.

100
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,810
Hey.

101
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,579
Don't come here again
if you're going to say stuff like that.

102
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,120
Did you think I was joking
when I said we should be strangers?

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Get out!

104
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,120
You only said that
because you were worried about me.

105
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,860
I won't believe anything you say.

106
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,089
So, you need to trust me this time.

107
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,399
Get out. I told you to get out!

108
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,700
- Wait, but...
- Get out. Don't come here again.

109
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
- Hey.
- Go.

110
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,070
Hey, Maeng Gong Hee. Wait.

111
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,670
Darn it.

112
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,209
Oh, Mr. Maeng.

113
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,310
Hello.

114
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,849
Hey, Dan Soo.

115
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,920
It's been a while.

116
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,920
What brings you here?

117
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,420
Oh, I stopped by to see Gong Hee.

118
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,659
I'll visit you sometime soon.

119
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:04,760
All right.

120
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Gong Hee.

121
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,649
Dad.

122
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
I...

123
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,219
What is wrong with me?

124
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,260
How did I end up in this mess?

125
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:41,800
My gosh, Gong Hee. What happened?

126
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,769
I...

127
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,139
I like Dan Soo.

128
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,510
I like him so much
that I can't bring myself to stop.

129
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,339
I know I shouldn't like him.
I know I really shouldn't, but...

130
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,050
Gong Hee.

131
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,620
I'm really scared now.

132
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,789
I shouldn't fall for anyone now.

133
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,420
But I keep wanting to see him.

134
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,229
I want to be with him.

135
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,360
I feel so at ease
when he's next to me.

136
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,570
I know it's wrong
to like him so much,

137
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,469
but it's too late.

138
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,010
It's too late now.

139
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,880
I want to hold his hand.

140
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,079
As my feelings for him grow,

141
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,050
I...

142
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,550
I hate myself that much more.

143
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,019
I...

144
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,959
What am I supposed to do, Dad?

145
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,260
My goodness.

146
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,599
It's okay.

147
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,099
It's okay, kiddo.

148
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,140
Oh, dear. Gong Hee, it's okay.

149
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,109
It's okay. Yes.

150
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,930
What is it?

151
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,410
I'm going to ask you something.

152
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,640
You can avoid me or run away.

153
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,839
Just don't lie to me.

154
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,609
You punched me
without any warning before.

155
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:39,079
What is it this time?

156
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,320
What do you want
to find out so badly?

157
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,589
Do you like Maeng Gong Hee?

158
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,089
Why are you asking me that?

159
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,520
I have to know.

160
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,430
I need to know what you're thinking.

161
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,400
Does love matter at this point?

162
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,499
If I say that I like Gong Hee,

163
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,270
what will change?

164
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,270
Would that change
this darned situation?

165
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:07,910
I also...

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,640
feel like my head is about to burst.

167
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,349
It's important to me.

168
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:20,690
Tell me if you love her or not.

169
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,530
Do you still have feelings
for Gong Hee?

170
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,060
It was just that one night,
and it was a mistake.

171
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,259
A critical mistake.

172
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,599
A mistake I want to go back
and rip to shreds.

173
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,599
You're the worst.

174
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,509
I thought
you couldn't disappoint me anymore.

175
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,770
Gu Dan Soo, I'm warning you.

176
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,440
Don't step out of place
and interfere.

177
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,479
What?

178
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,979
I've always taken care
of your problems.

179
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,219
And I will take care...

180
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,219
of my own problems.

181
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,849
I don't need your advice.

182
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,430
It's a problem
he needs to take care of?

183
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,499
It was a mistake?

184
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,440
What do I do with you,

185
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,339
Maeng Gong Hee?

186
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm done confirming the facts,

187
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,390
so you should stop caring
about Gong Hee now.

188
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,520
You're overstepping the bounds.

189
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,859
This is my problem.

190
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:32,030
What I can't understand the most...

191
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,499
is that you're angry right now.

192
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm sure you don't get how I feel.

193
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,300
The mountain top was
right before my eyes,

194
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,170
but I feel like
I'm tumbling down a cliffside now.

195
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,469
I can't even stop on my own.

196
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,410
I'll grab onto Maeng Gong Hee.

197
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,249
I won't let her
tumble down with you.

198
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,469
Hey.

199
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:19,869
Why aren't you getting in?

200
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,849
The doors are closing.

201
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,349
Did you eat breakfast?

202
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,430
What about your iron supplements?
Did you take those?

203
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,759
Let's just go quietly.

204
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:43,729
My goodness.

205
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,869
Hey, are you praying at a temple
or something?

206
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,200
Why should we be quiet?

207
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,910
You have to eat well.

208
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,180
And be careful when you walk too.

209
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
All right?

210
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,079
My gosh.

211
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,219
(Together with Jayce Fashion)

212
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,640
I saw a great show
because of you yesterday.

213
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,479
How did it feel to see
two guys get into a brawl...

214
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,680
because of you?

215
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:34,650
Doing this to me...

216
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,420
doesn't change anything.

217
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,190
What?

218
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,950
Please discuss your issues
with Mr. Seo...

219
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,060
with him.

220
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,129
I don't think
those issues will be solved...

221
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,030
just by keeping me here.

222
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,910
I think you've found
the wrong person to give advice to.

223
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,979
The person
who actually needs advice...

224
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,489
is watching from a step back.

225
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:25,300
What a mess we're in.

226
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,800
You created this nightmare,

227
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:31,969
Seo Min Gi.

228
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,349
Gyeong Tae, what's wrong with you?

229
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,020
You're going to fall ill
at this rate.

230
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
One more bottle.

231
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,290
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

232
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,959
Seriously,
do I need to call Gyeong Bok?

233
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,229
My gosh.

234
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,060
- Oh, my.
- Hello.

235
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,629
Mr. Maeng told me to come here.

236
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,170
Yes, Audrey. I'm glad you're here.

237
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,239
Please stop my brother.

238
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,469
He has been drinking
since this morning...

239
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:06,209
without saying why.

240
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,479
I'm worried he'll ruin his health.

241
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,180
You're here.

242
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,180
Mr. Maeng, what are you doing here?

243
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,349
You're drunk.

244
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Are you okay?

245
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,719
You should go inside.

246
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,989
I need to talk to Audrey.

247
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:23,989
My goodness.

248
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:27,290
Please look after my brother.

249
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,560
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

250
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,739
You should consider your health.

251
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,869
Goodness, why did you drink so much?

252
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,339
About Dan Soo...

253
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,349
I asked you here
to talk to you about him.

254
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,050
About Dan Soo?

255
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,690
Your in-laws.

256
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:54,219
I mean...

257
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,060
Please tell me about
Mr. Gu Hae Joon's family.

258
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,369
The reason
you couldn't meet Dan Soo...

259
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,839
and had to live on the run
all these years.

260
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,469
The reason you can't help...

261
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,979
but do the same even now.

262
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:22,379
Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

263
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,450
I am...

264
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:28,589
a powerless sinner.

265
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:35,430
I can't tell my daughter
to let go of her feelings.

266
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,369
And I can't tell you
anything either.

267
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:45,410
I can't choose to do anything.

268
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,509
A coward.

269
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,209
I'm a sinner.

270
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:53,450
Mr. Maeng.

271
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,820
Gong Hee likes Dan Soo.

272
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,890
Apparently,
Dan Soo asked Gong Hee...

273
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,959
to marry him.

274
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,060
He told her he'd raise...

275
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,599
her child.

276
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,829
Gong Hee is pregnant?

277
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,170
Yes, my dear Gong Hee...

278
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,249
Gong Hee is pregnant.

279
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,719
Of course, it's not Dan Soo's child.

280
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:40,090
You know very well too.

281
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:45,170
Gong Hee shouldn't live...

282
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:50,840
a painful life like you...

283
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,209
and Mr. Gu Hae Joon.

284
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,590
Having fried chicken
with beer or soda after work...

285
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,529
is the truth of life.

286
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,229
Goodness,
I wanted to have chicken feet.

287
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,269
They're both chicken anyway.

288
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:22,069
And No Ah can't eat spicy food.

289
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,640
Gosh, how could he take after
his dad so much?

290
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,709
You both have big eyes
and small mouths.

291
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:29,009
Gosh, how annoying.

292
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,880
She means we're good-looking.

293
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,850
Oh, gosh. Scoot over. All right.

294
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:41,420
- Oh, that's nice.
- Mom said...

295
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,630
I'd turn into a cow
if I lied down right after eating.

296
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,059
Why did Soo Yeon say such a thing?

297
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,870
Moo.

298
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,440
Kid, I had to work like a cow
all day anyway.

299
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,170
What's wrong with being a cow?

300
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,269
You see,
these small moments of joy...

301
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,680
make life worth living.

302
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:06,650
I'm full, and the house is warm.

303
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,880
I feel so comfortable now.

304
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,450
Who is it?

305
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,289
- Mother?
- Mom?

306
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,759
Did you give her the door code?

307
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,430
- Yes, so she could drop off No Ah.
- My goodness.

308
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,330
This should be here.

309
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,069
- My gosh.
- Mom...

310
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,440
Hello, Mother.

311
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,870
Oh, boy.

312
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,110
I made some side dishes
for you guys.

313
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,180
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

314
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,610
No, we haven't eaten yet.
Thank you so much.

315
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,549
Mom, you should've called us
to let us know you were coming.

316
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:45,450
Please respect our privacy.

317
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,850
Privacy, my foot.

318
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:51,259
Don't order in all the time.

319
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,360
You now live with No Ah.

320
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,160
It's very important
for a growing child to eat well.

321
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,430
Hong Dan, you're pregnant.

322
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,799
You need to
take good care of yourself.

323
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:01,569
Right, I will.

324
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,340
Moo.

325
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,709
What? What did you say, No Ah?

326
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:08,309
I'm a cow.

327
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,340
Moo.

328
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,350
A cow?

329
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,549
Well...

330
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:16,519
I guess he was very touched
by the book he read yesterday.

331
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,650
It was a story about many cows.
Right?

332
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:22,090
Yes, that's right. No Ah loves cows.

333
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,130
Moo.

334
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,360
You love cows? You quirky boy.

335
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,940
Sir.

336
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,209
I'll escort you
to the meeting with the reporters.

337
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Cancel it.

338
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,350
Pardon me?

339
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,580
I have somewhere to be
as soon as I leave the office.

340
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,850
- But it's a very important meeting.
- This is more important.

341
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,289
Something very important
has come up.

342
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,299
What's more important
than the meeting with the press...

343
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:04,299
about your inauguration ceremony?

344
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:08,440
I believe this is my last chance...

345
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,600
to be with her.

346
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,650
Gu Dan Soo!

347
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,819
Director Lee called me.

348
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
What are you doing?

349
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,459
Are you here to stop me?

350
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,090
The meeting with the reporters...

351
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,600
is very important for the company.

352
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,769
Since when did you speak
on behalf of the company?

353
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,769
Gu Dan Soo.

354
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,440
Isn't it a good thing for you?
Me misbehaving like this.

355
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,170
It'll give you more opportunities.

356
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,239
I'll tell Chairwoman Hwang
about this.

357
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,479
I'd appreciate that.

358
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,610
I wasn't sure
how to tell her anyway.

359
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,410
What?

360
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:56,380
I'm on my way
to propose to someone now.

361
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:01,090
I don't have to tell you
who that "someone" is, right?

362
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,690
I'm going to marry Maeng Gong Hee.

363
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,989
Not everyone will listen to you...

364
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:08,459
just because
you're being so reckless like this.

365
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,999
But isn't it better
than being so wishy-washy like you?

366
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,769
You.

367
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,870
Do you realize
what you're getting yourself into here?

368
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,870
No, I don't.

369
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,110
I don't know
why you're being like this...

370
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,469
and why it has to be so complicated.

371
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,110
Honestly, I have no idea.

372
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:23,940
But I know this one thing.

373
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,209
That I will go to Maeng Gong Hee.

374
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Hello?

375
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,979
Come to the Moonlight Hill.

376
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,479
I'll wait until you come.

377
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,799
He'll get himself
into trouble today.

378
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,269
Oh, boy. Look at those angry eyes.

379
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,539
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

380
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,580
Have a seat.

381
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,279
Sure.

382
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,660
Here.

383
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,370
So, you came here
because I called you.

384
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,680
I guess you've made up your mind.

385
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,920
Father.

386
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:19,559
I'm really sorry.

387
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,059
Who said you could call me "Father?"

388
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,999
You can't call me like that...

389
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,969
unless you have
Gong Hee's permission to do so.

390
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,509
I told her I'd take responsibility.

391
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,410
I will keep my word.

392
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,110
"Responsibility," you say?

393
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,019
Do you really understand
what that word means?

394
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,289
You see, all my life,

395
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,330
I struggled because of
the weight of responsibility...

396
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:55,860
bearing down on me.

397
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,069
It's a painful choice.

398
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,569
Can you really handle the pain?

399
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,920
I'll set a date to get married.

400
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
You'll marry her?

401
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,489
Ssang Sook said...

402
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,299
you were planning a wedding
to marry someone else.

403
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,069
That was...

404
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:38,840
before I found out
Gong Hee was pregnant with my child.

405
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,269
The situation has changed.

406
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,009
It's my turn
to take responsibility now.

407
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,350
"Responsibility?"

408
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,390
You say you understand
what "responsibility" means.

409
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,700
Then why did you let
something like this happen?

410
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,069
It was my fault,

411
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:07,999
but...

412
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,209
I think fixing it now
is the right thing to do.

413
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,940
Before I make a bigger mistake,

414
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
that is.

415
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:21,809
Mark my words.

416
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,920
Then you are now responsible...

417
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,749
for my daughter's life...

418
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,120
and her future.

419
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,130
It's not a promise
you can take lightly.

420
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,029
Don't ever forget that.

421
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,100
Hurry up, Maeng Gong Hee.

422
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,219
- Go on in.
- Be careful, Father.

423
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:32,319
- Let's go inside.
- My gosh, Dad.

424
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,459
How much did you drink?

425
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,690
I'm sorry.

426
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,430
What are you doing here, Mr. Seo?

427
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,269
Were you with my dad?

428
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,739
Yes. Are you going out?

429
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,610
Yes, I'm meeting someone.

430
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,610
Don't go.

431
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:04,450
Let's get married, Maeng Gong Hee.

432
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,979
(My Merry Marriage)

433
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,279
It's not right to get married
just to be responsible.

434
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,420
You shouldn't do that,
even for the child's sake.

435
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,620
- Are you crying?
- Gong Hee should get married.

436
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:41,190
I met him.

437
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,789
The daycare center is
too easy for me.

438
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,930
I want to go to
an English kindergarten.

439
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,459
"Propose?" What do you mean?

440
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,930
There's someone I want to marry.

441
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,400
Can't you take my side, Grandma?

442
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,299
Ms. Maeng Gong Hee?
The chairwoman wants to see you.

443
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,370
