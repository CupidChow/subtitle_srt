1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,209
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,309
Is that how your mother raised you?

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,550
If you're going to do this,
just quit your job.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,679
Stop getting in Min Gi's way.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,649
Mom.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,160
Oh, my. When did you...

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,239
Why did you come
without even calling ahead?

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,670
This is just bad manners,
don't you think?

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Oh, gosh.

10
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,710
Mom, let's go to my room.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Come on.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,119
That scared the wits out of me.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,789
Why would she barge
into my house at this hour?

14
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,469
(Episode 87)

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,130
Hey, what was that about?

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,769
What did you do wrong that
you let her scold you like that?

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,739
It's normal for newlywed brides
to be scolded...

18
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,480
by their mothers-in-law
for not doing housework properly.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,140
Why was she saying
you should quit your job?

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,879
Oh, you heard that?

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,579
You won't quit, right?

22
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:17,680
Of course, I won't.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,120
I worked very hard to join
the company and get promoted.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,019
Exactly. You shouldn't quit.

25
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:24,459
It's not like your life disappears
once you become a mom.

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,189
Are you feeling all right?

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,129
Yes, of course. I feel great.

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,099
Anyway, what brings you here?

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,599
This is carp extract.

30
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,010
Your dad got this made for you.

31
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,609
It's good for pregnant women.

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,980
We never did anything...

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,250
to help you with your recovery
after your accident.

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,519
Dad didn't have to do this.

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,420
Even if it was a minor accident,
it still was an accident.

36
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,549
It must've given you a scare
even if you don't realize it.

37
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,959
Don't ignore it.
Eat well, rest well,

38
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,420
and take good care of yourself.
All right?

39
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:00,659
Okay, I will.

40
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,260
Right. I saw your manager out front.

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,770
You know, the one
who had dumplings at our shop.

42
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,340
That female manager.

43
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,400
Right.

44
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,580
Why was she here at this hour?

45
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,009
Oh, that's...

46
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,849
What is it?
Is something going on at work?

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,550
Oh, no.

48
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,919
It's not that. Well...

49
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,789
Then what is it?

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,860
My goodness. Why are you curious
about nothing important, Mom?

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,000
Anyway, why are you here?
You didn't even call.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,270
What? Am I not even allowed
to visit my daughter?

53
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,740
It's not that.

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,669
I know you have a lot to do.

55
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,310
You have to work at the shop too.

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,969
You don't need to worry about me.

57
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:51,210
Unlike your brother,
you never caused trouble,

58
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,740
so you never once worried me.

59
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,280
You got along with everyone
and were always brave.

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,120
I may have worried about you
falling over and hurting your knee,

61
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,319
but I never worried
you might get your heart broken.

62
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,520
Yes. That's exactly how I am,

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,990
so don't worry about me.

64
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,689
I shouldn't add to your stress, Mom.

65
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,530
As your mom,
I feel like I owe you an apology.

66
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,360
Come on.
Dad kept saying stuff like that too.

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,930
Why are you being like this too?

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,199
I'm doing great,

69
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,900
so please don't worry.

70
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,810
Seriously, Mom.

71
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,610
Anyway, this is nice.

72
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:28,979
Oh, dear.

73
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,750
My gosh.

74
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,689
Why did Kang Myung Ja burst in here
on her own?

75
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,330
Goodness, it's as if
I'm a wicked mother-in-law.

76
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,599
Oh, my.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,270
What? Do you have something to say?

78
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,550
You.

79
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,719
I'll leave Gong Hee...

80
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,729
in your favor.

81
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,629
Well, what...

82
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,569
I'm sure she's not good
at keeping the house yet,

83
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,209
and you must think
she's lacking in many ways.

84
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,579
Still, look kindly upon her...

85
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,050
and take care of her.

86
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,300
Mom, you should stay for dinner.

87
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,300
It's fine.

88
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,870
I should go and make dinner
for No Ah.

89
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:06,709
Take a taxi home.

90
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,110
Why? I can just take the bus.

91
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,350
- Come on.
- No, it's fine.

92
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:12,819
Bye.

93
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,860
Mom, take a taxi, okay?

94
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,860
My knee is no big deal.

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,100
If it's for my kids,

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'd be fine...

97
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,910
even if my knee wears away
a hundred or a thousand times.

98
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,180
When I heard that Mom had knelt
before my mother-in-law for me,

99
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,819
I thought I'd never be able
to do such a thing,

100
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,819
and I couldn't even dream
of understanding how she felt.

101
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,560
But...

102
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,629
Mom was right.

103
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,660
If only my child could live
in comfort,

104
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,430
I would kneel 10 times or 100 times.

105
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,970
It was no big deal.

106
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,800
Go inside. It's cold.

107
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,689
Enjoy.

108
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,290
What is going on?
Am I the only one who didn't know?

110
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:33,699
You know,
Sleepwalker cleaned out her shop...

111
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,899
and disappeared into thin air.

112
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,639
What?

113
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,639
Tiffany Alterations has a sign
that it's up for lease.

114
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,180
Gosh, the shop is totally empty.

115
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,410
It looks like she ran off overnight.

116
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,050
Oh, my.

117
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,220
Goodness. Why is he in such a rush?

118
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,060
(Tiffany Alterations)

119
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,089
(For lease)

120
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,129
My son.

121
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,329
I will live in regret.

122
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,139
Please live...

123
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,269
a pure and happy life,

124
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,870
as if you've never been abandoned.

125
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,439
That's all I wish for.

126
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,120
I hope the love inside your heart
always shines.

127
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,120
Your smile is the brightest gift
in the world.

128
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,529
Did I ever ask...

129
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,769
for these birthday presents?

130
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,670
I just...

131
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,509
wanted a mom
who would wish me a happy birthday.

132
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,879
Just like other kids,

133
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,410
I wanted to thank my mom
for giving birth to me.

134
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,389
I just needed a mom...

135
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,090
who'd light birthday candles
and blow them out with me.

136
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,059
Dan Soo, are you home?

137
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,470
Hey, have you had dinner?

138
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
I have.

139
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,409
Why? You should eat at home.

140
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,940
You keep going to work
without eating breakfast too.

141
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,509
You need to eat well...

142
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,620
for your wounds to heal quickly.

143
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,850
I'm all better already.

144
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,159
You...

145
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,960
Do you know?

146
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,830
Pardon?

147
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,129
Audrey...

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
cleaned out her shop and left.

149
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,500
I mean your mom.

150
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,809
I guess you all know...

151
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,950
that she's my mom.

152
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,379
I do.

153
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,220
Actually,
I've been looking around for her.

154
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,120
I'll keep looking tomorrow too.

155
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,820
How will you find her?

156
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,960
I should check some places
she might visit.

157
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,330
Goodness.

158
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,730
You must be...

159
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,370
resenting your mom.

160
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,509
Yes.

161
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,679
It shouldn't be like this.

162
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,110
She can't abandon me twice.

163
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,049
I want to find her
and end things on my own terms,

164
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:10,980
whether I resent her or not.

165
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,590
I'll find her.

166
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,519
What? Why would you do that?

167
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,860
Well...

168
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:27,700
I used to be a pretty good cop
back in the day.

169
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,100
I'd be better at it than you.

170
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,169
You must be busy with work too.

171
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,740
Don't worry.

172
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,179
Focus on your work.

173
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,279
I'll look for her.

174
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,429
Hey, you're home.

175
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,659
Come here.

176
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,970
There's big news.

177
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,240
Audrey has disappeared
into thin air.

178
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,870
What? Audrey?

179
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,840
Yes, I was passing by,

180
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,779
and it said
her shop was up for lease.

181
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,080
Why, all of a sudden?

182
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,779
How would I know?

183
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,220
It looks like she ran off
in the middle of the night.

184
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,590
Did something happen
after her relationship...

185
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,820
with Dan Soo became known?

186
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,759
Still, Dan Soo is
in this neighborhood.

187
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,889
She said she would never leave.

188
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,029
What do you think
has gotten into her?

189
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,899
- My goodness.
- What?

190
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,399
Oh, dear.

191
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,700
Why do you look so glum?

192
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,139
Did you have another fight
with Ssang Sook?

193
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,440
I'm just so upset.

194
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,379
Why?

195
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,379
Their front door was open,

196
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,409
so I went in
without ringing the doorbell,

197
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,879
but I heard a commotion,
so I looked inside.

198
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,549
Ssang Sook was about to bite
Gong Hee's head off.

199
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:59,059
What?
She was yelling at her that loudly?

200
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,759
Are we still living in
the Joseon Dynasty or something?

201
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,029
Seriously, that Jung Ssang Sook.

202
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,799
She's so behind the times.

203
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,529
These days,
mothers-in-law are the ones...

204
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,970
who cater to their daughters-in-law.

205
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,470
My gosh.

206
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,299
So?

207
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,309
Did you pull out Ssang Sook's hair
or something?

208
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:19,039
I wanted to, of course.

209
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,580
This won't do.

210
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,379
I should take out a loan
to help Gong Hee move out.

211
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,350
I can't watch her living
in the same house as Ssang Sook.

212
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,350
My goodness.

213
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,919
- We're home.
- Hey, there.

214
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,820
- We're home.
- What about dinner?

215
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,490
Of course, we haven't eaten.

216
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,259
Give me some food, Auntie.

217
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,100
What about No Ah?

218
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,299
He's been fed and washed.

219
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,669
He's playing in his room now.

220
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Hey.

221
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,740
About that female manager
at your office...

222
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,580
The female manager?

223
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,679
Do you mean Ms. Kang Ji Na?

224
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,679
That's right.

225
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,179
How do you know her, Mother?

226
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,779
Oh, that manager who came
to eat dumplings at the shop?

227
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,419
Oh, my. Ms. Kang came to the shop?

228
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,090
That's right.
But I saw that manager...

229
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,029
leaving Gong Hee's in-laws' house.

230
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,330
Why would she go there?

231
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,269
What? Why did Ms. Kang go there?
That's strange.

232
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,169
Gong Hee wouldn't say why.

233
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,539
I was wondering
if you knew about it.

234
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,409
Did something happen at work?

235
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,740
No, nothing happened.

236
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,679
Back when she came to the shop,

237
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,850
she creeped me out.

238
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,379
I got bad vibes from her.

239
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,320
My gosh. Don't get me started.
Her personality is...

240
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,549
She has a bad temper.

241
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,490
Oh, she must be the manager
you told me about.

242
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,990
Isn't her nickname Ice Witch?

243
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,799
That's right. My goodness.

244
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,570
But what was Ms. Kang doing
at their house?

245
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,330
It's odd.

246
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,639
("The Life Before Us")

247
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,509
Momo.

248
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,049
This world...

249
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,779
is like this book.

250
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,620
It's complicated
and difficult to understand.

251
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,019
There are times
when you just feel so lost.

252
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,190
But even in such a world,

253
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,389
some people manage
to find their way.

254
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,360
Some find love...

255
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,830
and live on.

256
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,299
Mommy will try
to live like that too.

257
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,279
I feel like having you by my side
will make that journey easier.

258
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,379
Momo, so...

259
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,250
take your time and get ready.

260
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:44,659
The world is waiting for you.

261
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,090
Oh, hey.

262
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,429
You're getting in late.

263
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,370
Yes. I'm working alone
on the project now, you know.

264
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,070
I should work twice as hard.

265
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,970
Ms. Kang was here.

266
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,539
Yes, Mom told me just now.

267
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:07,809
I heard Mother was here too.

268
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Yes.

269
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,580
About Ms. Kang,

270
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,350
don't get the wrong idea.

271
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,320
She came to drop off Mom's phone.

272
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
You know,

273
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,200
I told you that
I'd trust you as Momo's dad.

274
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,700
I know you're a responsible person.

275
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,279
About you leaving the company...

276
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,350
Think about it.

277
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,919
The accident too.

278
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,120
If you hadn't had to go to work,

279
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,350
it wouldn't have happened.

280
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,159
Why are you bringing it up again?

281
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,990
I'm saying this for you
and our baby.

282
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,600
No, that's only an excuse.

283
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,870
You should be rooting for me
if you really care about me.

284
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,899
Is this because of Ms. Kang?

285
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,440
Do you really think
I'm trying to get in your way?

286
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,570
I didn't want you
to get the wrong idea,

287
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,340
so I told Ms. Kang
to take her hands off my project.

288
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,850
I did it even though
I really needed her for the project.

289
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,649
But what can you do for me?

290
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:22,590
I never told you to do that.

291
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,059
I just wanted you
to keep your boundaries clear.

292
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,090
Well...

293
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,889
If you need her help,
go ahead and work with her.

294
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,100
I'll do my best at my job too.

295
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,529
Are you saying
you'll drag me down...

296
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,669
so that Dan Soo can be promoted?

297
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,139
Is that your way of saying
that is your intention?

298
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,039
I was just saying
I would do my best at my job.

299
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,779
That means the same thing!

300
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,269
Starting today, I, Eom Hong Dan,

301
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,269
will take No Ah to daycare
and pick him up too!

302
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,009
What's up with you?
What's gotten into you?

303
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,410
It's because of Soo Yeon.

304
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,250
Because of how Soo Yeon
took him the other day.

305
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,210
This way, Mother doesn't have to
run around every day,

306
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,779
and it'll also help me and No Ah
bond even more.

307
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,650
No Ah, aren't you happy...

308
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,750
that I'll take you to daycare
and pick you up from now on?

309
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,119
Your mommy here will do that.

310
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,390
My weird mommy
is getting even weirder, Dad.

311
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,700
So, she's your weird mommy now?

312
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Oh, boy.

313
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,730
No, I am not weird.

314
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,670
I bet he meant to call me
his ideal mommy.

315
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,470
Right, No Ah?

316
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:51,279
From now on,
your ideal mommy here...

317
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,509
will take care of everything.

318
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,750
You can count on me.
I will take great care...

319
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,750
of you and Ssook Ssook!

320
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,049
Okay?

321
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,980
What's all this noise about?

322
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,359
Mother, I'll take No Ah to daycare
and pick him up too.

323
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,990
You just do what you need to do.

324
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,730
Let No Ah's mom take care of him.

325
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,059
What about your work?

326
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,660
Work isn't important.

327
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,700
This is the most important thing
in my life.

328
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,339
I will protect my No Ah. I got this.

329
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:22,509
It's not about protecting
the country or something.

330
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,109
You don't need
to be so serious about it.

331
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,349
What are you talking about?
This is a wartime situation.

332
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,319
So, is that what Ms. Lee Soo Yeon
is going to do?

333
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,950
Sure, fine.

334
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,089
I, Eom Hong Dan,
can be spiteful too.

335
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,660
Oh, dear.

336
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,130
Goodness.

337
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,460
I'll just have you
handle the rest, No Ah.

338
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,700
Forgive your incompetent dad here.

339
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Oh, dear.

340
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,799
My gosh.

341
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,470
Oh, dear.

342
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,869
Anyway, where is Gyeong Tae?
Is he not eating?

343
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,880
I don't know.
He disappeared at dawn.

344
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,380
I thought he might be exercising
on the rooftop, but he wasn't there.

345
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,880
Goodness. Is his fishing addiction
back in full swing?

346
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,049
Oh, boy. Everyone has issues.

347
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,119
My goodness.

348
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,130
What would a five-year-old boy like?

349
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,589
A five-year-old boy?

350
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm not sure.

351
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,900
What kinds of things does he like?

352
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,910
Don't tell me you don't know.

353
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,039
Storybooks?

354
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,539
He likes it
when I read books to him.

355
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,309
He says
I make it sound so realistic.

356
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,849
Come on. It'd be so boring
to buy him a book.

357
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,220
You think so?

358
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,319
Gosh, you two. Shouldn't you prepare
for the meeting?

359
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,190
How come you don't look busy at all?

360
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,089
Oh, right.

361
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,289
Director Lee.

362
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,500
What? What is it?

363
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:56,700
I need you
to bring back your memories.

364
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,700
Okay. All right.

365
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,640
Now, you will go back in time.

366
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,609
Go all the way back in time.

367
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,609
Back to before you even joined
Jayce Fashion.

368
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,279
Yes. Back to the time
when you were an innocent child.

369
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,450
Back to your childhood.

370
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,920
Come on.
What on earth are you doing now?

371
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:19,960
She wants to win some points
with her son.

372
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,730
She wants to know what boys like.

373
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,130
- My gosh.
- Boys?

374
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,660
Playing with spinning tops...

375
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,430
or pasteboards...

376
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,569
- Goodness.
- Director Lee.

377
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,799
I guess you're older than I thought.

378
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,839
That's enough. Hurry up
and get ready for the meeting.

379
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,039
Stop slacking off!

380
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Goodness.

381
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
"Stop."

382
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,950
Anyway, why are you trying so hard
to win points with him?

383
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,819
You said the ex-wife
wasn't planning to take him.

384
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,720
Who knows?
She might change her mind.

385
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:55,430
The important thing is that
I feel very anxious...

386
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,390
because I don't really know
what No Ah is thinking.

387
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,230
Has any man made me feel
this confused in the past?

388
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,539
Oh, dear Lord.

389
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,039
Come on. You never dated anyone.

390
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,809
It's not like you ever had a man.
What do you mean...

391
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,049
Oh, right.

392
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,759
Ms. Kang, did you visit
Mr. Seo's home last night?

393
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,859
Yes. Why?

394
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,190
My mother-in-law said
she ran into you.

395
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,359
She asked me about it,

396
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
so I was wondering
why you were there.

397
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,630
I went to see
my ex-boyfriend's mother.

398
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:38,269
What?

399
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,539
What an absurd joke.

400
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,569
Did it sound like a joke?

401
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,690
What was that?

402
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,359
Hey.

403
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,630
Mother said she ran into Ms. Kang
in front of your house.

404
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,440
I mean, what was Ice Witch doing
at your house?

405
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,339
It was nothing.

406
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,769
I think Mother is worried about it.

407
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,940
She had a gut feeling as a mother...

408
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,710
that something was wrong about it.

409
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,609
Tell me.

410
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,220
What was Ms. Kang doing there?

411
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,619
Goodness.

412
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,789
I asked Ice Witch about it,

413
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:35,589
and she told a joke that
she was Mr. Seo's ex-girlfriend.

414
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,029
My gosh.
I was so flustered when I heard it.

415
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,240
Oh, no.

416
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Is it true?

417
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,710
It's all in the past.
Why bother talking about it now?

418
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,880
Oh, my. I don't believe this.

419
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,250
- Spare me a moment.
- What?

420
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
Come on. Let's go.

421
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,690
Hey.

422
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,359
Hold on. Is it really true?

423
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,029
What are you doing?

424
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:11,759
I told you not to cross the line.

425
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,069
I don't really know
how far that "line" extends.

426
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,000
Maeng Gong Hee said
she'd been very patient.

427
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,539
She doesn't know
who's being really patient here.

428
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,579
Goodness.

429
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,049
Are you trying to steam
the dumplings with your sighs?

430
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,349
You don't have to take
No Ah to daycare anymore.

431
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:36,549
Shouldn't you feel relieved?

432
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,319
It's because your brother
is nowhere to be seen again.

433
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:44,029
Gong Boo and Hong Dan said
they'd book our health checkups.

434
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,630
It would be nice for him
to drive down and bring Mom up.

435
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,569
Good grief.

436
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,369
When you mentioned
throwing out his fishing poles,

437
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,539
you should've just snapped them
all in half.

438
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,009
I should've.

439
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,140
He was quiet for a while,
but he's at it again. Dear me.

440
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,380
By the way, I hear...

441
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,809
it's Dan Soo's birthday
in a few days.

442
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,049
- Really?
- Gong Hee asked me...

443
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:07,880
to make sure
to cook him a birthday meal.

444
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,849
I should go grocery shopping
for some seaweed and meat.

445
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,690
All right. Sleepwalker...
No, I mean,

446
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,490
Dan Soo's mom is gone now.

447
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,630
We should be sure to look after him.

448
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,000
I have to go to Mom's house
tomorrow too.

449
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,269
I'll go grocery shopping now
and leave it at home.

450
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,140
- Watch the shop for me.
- All right.

451
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,710
- Be back soon.
- Okay.

452
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,410
Goodness.

453
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,779
So, before I came by,

454
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:40,519
this man kept asking
about her whereabouts.

455
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,250
This business card...

456
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,990
I think your grandmother's people...

457
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,960
are looking for Audrey.

458
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,099
He's a nasty man.

459
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,059
He came to Audrey's shop before...

460
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,069
and turned the whole place
upside down too.

461
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,069
He's an informant.

462
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,710
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

463
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:06,740
Still, he's Gyeong Tae's in-law.

464
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,420
Audrey has been living in hiding
and running away all her life.

465
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,460
She couldn't even have a wedding
with your dad...

466
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,220
and had to live on the run.

467
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,230
I'm sure...

468
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,430
there is a reason
why she had to leave...

469
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,900
as soon as you guys arrived
in Kkotsan.

470
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,500
What other reason could there be...

471
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,500
for abandoning her own child?

472
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,740
You're mistaken about something.

473
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:39,809
You should meet Audrey
and resolve this misunderstanding.

474
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,180
She's still your mother.

475
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:46,519
- Then, I'll be going now.
- Sure.

476
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:49,519
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, thank you.

477
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,289
Goodness. First,
I took a look around the factory...

478
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,299
and the neighborhood
where she used to live and work.

479
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,569
After she left you, she worked...

480
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,599
at a bunch of clothing factories
and dressmaker's shops.

481
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,670
I'm sure at least one of them...

482
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,910
will say that they've seen her.

483
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:13,640
Don't be so anxious.

484
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,579
Detective An is helping too.

485
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,220
Mr. Maeng.

486
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,119
You've gone looking for her
in the past too, right?

487
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,730
You seem used to this.

488
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,859
You know all about
how she used to live.

489
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,670
You know something more
about her past, don't you?

490
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,170
Please tell me.

491
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,809
Why did you go around
looking for Ms. Audrey?

492
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,079
You've been working
with Detective An for a long time.

493
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,950
Why on earth
did you have to do that?

494
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,519
Well...

495
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:59,690
Goodness.
Let's talk about this later.

496
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,730
I heard that your mom left.

497
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,400
Are you trying to find her?

498
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,839
Yes.

499
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,869
Of course, you should.

500
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,910
Be sure to find her
and bring her back.

501
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,349
Thank you for saying that.

502
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,549
It's your birthday this weekend.

503
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:27,079
Gong Hee told me to prepare
a nice birthday meal for you.

504
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,849
Is there a type of seaweed soup
you like in particular?

505
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,119
What should I add to the soup?

506
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,390
Anything is fine.

507
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,920
I like whatever you cook for me.

508
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,529
All right.

509
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,299
What did I hear earlier?

510
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,440
What... What do you mean?

511
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,210
I heard you went looking for Audrey.

512
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,940
Well, the thing is...

513
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,180
You know about Audrey's past,

514
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,049
and you've been looking for her
for a long time.

515
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:00,319
That's what I heard.

516
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,700
(My Merry Marriage)

517
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,599
- No Ah.
- No Ah.

518
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,069
Mommy is here.

519
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:19,099
What do we do about Gong Hee?

520
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:20,599
She seems to be so downhearted...

521
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,109
from dealing with people
both at work and at home.

522
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,769
Don't do things
others might disapprove of.

523
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,710
You're driving a wedge
between my son and me.

524
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,650
Clear your schedule tomorrow.
Let's go to my mom's house.

525
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,180
- I'm sorry.
- What are you getting up to?

526
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,519
I wanted to ask you something.

527
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,680
This is a formal question,
not a personal one.
