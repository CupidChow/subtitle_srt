1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:06,509
Mr. Maeng.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,419
You've gone looking for her
in the past too, right?

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,919
You seem used to this.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,160
You know all about
how she used to live.

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,960
You know something more
about her past, don't you?

7
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,429
Please tell me.

8
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,170
Why did you go around
looking for Ms. Audrey?

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,299
You've been working
with Detective An for a long time.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,140
Why on earth
did you have to do that?

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,909
Well...

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,950
Goodness.
Let's talk about this later.

13
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,829
I heard that your mom left.

14
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,700
Are you trying to find her?

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,100
Yes.

16
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,069
Of course, you should.

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,170
Be sure to find her
and bring her back.

18
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,609
Thank you for saying that.

19
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,840
It's your birthday this weekend.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,510
Gong Hee told me to prepare
a nice birthday meal for you.

21
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,150
Is there a type of seaweed soup
you like in particular?

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,409
What should I add to the soup?

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Anything is fine.

24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,219
I like whatever you cook for me.

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,790
All right.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,560
What did I hear earlier?

27
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,769
What... What do you mean?

28
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,540
I heard you went looking for Audrey.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,239
Well, the thing is...

30
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,439
You know about Audrey's past,

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,340
and you've been looking for her
for a long time.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,579
That's what I heard.

33
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,349
Come on.
Why would I have done such a thing?

34
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:54,620
Dan Soo asked me about it,
but he was mistaken.

35
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,689
Don't let it bother you.

36
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,019
My goodness.

37
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,599
What... Wait, hey.

38
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,969
I thought Ms. Kang and Mr. Seo
were mortal enemies,

39
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,439
but what's this?

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,969
How serious was their relationship?

41
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,409
That's not important.

42
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,740
Not important?

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,479
Don't tell me they even thought
about getting married.

44
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,090
Oh, my gosh.

45
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:31,919
I can't believe it.

46
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,629
And I thought I was the only one
stressed out about the ex-wife.

47
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,460
Please don't tell Mom.

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,729
She already has a lot going on.

49
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,069
It'll only worry her.

50
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,039
Goodness. It's eating me up inside.

51
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,949
(Sunny Daycare Center)

52
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,849
Hello.

53
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,750
No Ah, come here.

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,180
No Ah, come to Mommy.

55
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,689
No Ah, Mommy's here.

56
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
What?

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,099
Why are you here again?

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,169
And who are you?

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,270
Me?

60
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,169
No Ah's stepmom.

61
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,469
Maeng Gong Boo's current wife.

62
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,310
I see.

63
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,349
"I see?"

64
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,849
I'll take No Ah with me today.

65
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,180
While I'm staying in Korea,

66
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,020
I plan to spend
as much time as possible with him.

67
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,819
Unbelievable.

68
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,560
Who gave you permission
to spend time with No Ah?

69
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,530
He's coming with me.

70
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,860
You can leave.

71
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,560
Let's ask No Ah.

72
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,629
Let him decide
who he wants to go with.

73
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,599
No Ah, come here. Come with Mommy.

74
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,669
No Ah. Let's go home, okay?
Come home with Mommy.

75
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,979
What the...
Stop calling yourself his mom.

76
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,280
No Ah, let's go home. Oh, right.

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,050
I'll read you a book, okay?

78
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,090
Wait!

79
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,219
Hold on.

80
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,229
No Ah. Ta-da.

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,399
I got you a 128-color crayon set.

82
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,399
Oh, my.

83
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,529
How petty.

84
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,670
Are you trying
to lure him with a present?

85
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,699
Let's say I'm well-prepared.

86
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,250
No Ah,
why don't we get fried chicken?

87
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,550
Fried chicken?

88
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,069
Killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

89
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,379
All she did was talk.

90
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,819
So technically, I've lost.

91
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,990
No Ah likes crayons?

92
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,160
Since when?

93
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,399
I had no idea.

94
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,199
Even though I'm his mom.

95
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,470
My gosh, No Ah.

96
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,110
When did you learn
such a difficult phrase?

97
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,439
Because you take after me,

98
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,240
you're a fast learner.

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,209
Pretty Mommy and Weird Mommy.

100
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,449
I have two mommies.

101
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,420
"Weird Mommy?"

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,069
(Chief Secretary Seo Deok Soo)

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,569
This business card...

104
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,899
I think your grandmother's people...

105
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,740
are looking for Audrey.

106
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,079
Audrey has been living in hiding
and running away all her life.

107
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,079
She couldn't even have a wedding
with your dad...

108
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,079
and had to live on the run.

109
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,050
I'm sure...

110
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,259
there is a reason
why she had to leave...

111
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,720
as soon as you guys arrived
in Kkotsan.

112
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,600
Grandma...

113
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,129
is looking for her?

114
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,639
(Chief Secretary Seo Deok Soo)

115
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,509
Grandma.

116
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,410
What on earth
are you hiding from me?

117
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,550
Gosh, it smells amazing.

118
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,389
Everyone worked hard today.

119
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,389
You must be hungry.

120
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,259
"Gosh, it smells amazing.
They look great."

121
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,230
You only ever talk.
Help us prepare dinner from now on.

122
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:06,529
Okay.

123
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,170
I went to the daycare center today,
and guess what.

124
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,769
Lee Soo Yeon was there again.

125
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,370
What?
What is she thinking, seriously?

126
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,410
I made it very clear to her again.

127
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,779
Honestly,
what is the matter with her?

128
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,379
I must say,
Soo Yeon is really something too.

129
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,649
But I, Eom Hong Dan,
am also seasoned in life.

130
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,889
I've been aging gracefully
with life lessons.

131
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,259
I'll use all my experience...

132
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,930
and beat her.

133
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Just wait and see.

134
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,769
Mom, about that manager.
Ms. Kang or whatever.

135
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,199
The Ms. Kang I bumped into
at Gong Hee's place?

136
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,370
What about her?

137
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,610
She and Seo Min Gi dated...

138
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,540
For goodness' sake! Seriously.

139
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,879
You really have a loose tongue.

140
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,050
I told you it was a secret.

141
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,180
How come? Mom should know about it.

142
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,319
What was that?

143
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,689
Are you saying
that woman used to date Min Gi?

144
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,220
My goodness. That means...

145
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,990
Right, Ssang Sook
used to brag about it nonstop...

146
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,860
at our school reunions.

147
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,600
So that manager's family
owns Dodo Group?

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,970
Yes, she's the only daughter
of the Dodo Group family.

149
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,910
But why is the only daughter
of the Dodo Group family...

150
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,980
working at your company?

151
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,480
It seems she has a clear plan.

152
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,920
And the two families
know each other well.

153
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,279
Didn't Ssang Sook brag about how...

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,649
the wedding would be held
at a hotel...

155
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,950
and that the date was already set?

156
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,429
I guess the wedding fell through
when Gong Hee got pregnant.

157
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,200
Good grief.
No wonder Jung Ssang Sook...

158
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,429
is so hard on Gong Hee.

159
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,740
Mother, Gong Hee wanted
to keep it from you...

160
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,169
as you'd worry.

161
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,169
What can we do?
Gong Hee and Min Gi are married now.

162
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,440
Don't worry too much, okay?

163
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,250
Goodness. The stew...

164
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,309
- has simmered down too much.
- Oh, no.

165
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,419
Good grief.

166
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,289
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

167
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,720
- Hey, that mouth of yours!
- Hey, it hurts.

168
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,460
- Seriously.
- Auntie?

169
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,330
- Come here. Your mouth...
- Hey!

170
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,330
Is your son getting married?

171
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,769
Yes.

172
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,870
He's marrying the only daughter
of the Dodo Group family.

173
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,370
- What?
- Dodo Group? Oh, my.

174
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,110
The company that owns
Dodo Department Store?

175
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,809
Goodness, I'm so jealous.

176
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:37,980
My future daughter-in-law gave me
a facelift voucher as a gift.

177
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,220
She said she wanted to help me
get back my youth,

178
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,789
which I lost
while taking care of my son.

179
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,360
Their daughter was following
my son around so much.

180
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,720
What else could we do?

181
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,220
I had to let them get married.

182
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,360
If they were already talking
about marriage back then,

183
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,230
they must've dated for a while.

184
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,100
Oh, my.

185
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,840
Hello.

186
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,769
Who...

187
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,240
Don't you remember me?

188
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,639
I work with Gong Hee.
I'm her manager.

189
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,450
But what brings you here?

190
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,289
I just had some business here.

191
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,220
Then you should head inside.

192
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,059
Just quit your job.

193
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,159
Stop getting in Min Gi's way.

194
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,039
Mom.

195
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,740
When I called Mom...

196
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,940
while going through a rough patch,

197
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,409
she always knew right away
that something was up...

198
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,509
no matter how hard I tried
to sound cheerful.

199
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,610
Mom, what's up?

200
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,350
But...

201
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,820
now that my daughter is married
and has moved out,

202
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,320
I, too, can tell right away...

203
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,559
the moment I hear her voice.

204
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,230
I know everything
since I'm a mom too.

205
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,299
I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

206
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,330
Of course, I'm fine.

207
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,399
Have you eaten yet?

208
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,269
Oh, I was just about to eat.

209
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,809
Make sure you eat well, okay?

210
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,440
Okay, I will.

211
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,539
You need to eat well too, Mom.

212
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,710
All right.

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,889
Oh, boy.

214
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,389
Hey, why are you standing there
like that?

215
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,460
You said you'd set the table.

216
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,159
What do we do about Gong Hee?

217
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Why?

218
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,759
She seems to be so downhearted...

219
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,600
from dealing with people
both at work and at home.

220
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,539
She's pregnant on top of that.

221
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,799
What should we do about Gong Hee?

222
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,909
Goodness.
What exactly is the matter?

223
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,110
If Gong Hee's marriage fails...

224
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,379
What on earth...
Why would you say such a thing?

225
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,820
If that happens,

226
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,549
it's all on us.

227
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,860
We're her parents,

228
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,460
yet we didn't even look carefully
into the situation...

229
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,490
and forced her to marry him,

230
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,899
so it's all our fault.

231
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,450
I have to eat well for Momo.

232
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,519
- Hi, Gong Hee.
- Father, you're home.

233
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,389
Yes. How come
you're eating all alone?

234
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,860
Well... Did you have dinner, Father?

235
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,299
Yes, I've eaten. Where is Min Gi?

236
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,970
He's working late.

237
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,600
Mother is on a diet,

238
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,970
so she's skipping dinner.

239
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,940
Is that so?

240
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,009
Go ahead and eat, all right?

241
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,279
Okay, Father.

242
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,529
"The leaves that looked radiant
in midsummer..."

243
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,830
"scream and fall in autumn."

244
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,269
"How is it any different from life?"

245
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,700
"How is it any different from love?"

246
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,039
"Life is short."

247
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,679
"And sadly, love is even shorter."

248
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,279
"No, love is fleeting."

249
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,049
Mr. Ryu's poems
are heart-wrenchingly sad.

250
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,019
Goodness, seriously.

251
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,029
Hey, honey.

252
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,230
Hey.

253
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,659
Gong Hee is eating alone.

254
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,399
Why can't you join her
and eat with her?

255
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,730
You're on a diet? How random.

256
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,169
Do you think that's the real reason?

257
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,940
When I eat with just her,

258
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,340
I can't digest anything.

259
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,509
Why can't you digest anything?

260
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,080
How can I eat with her
when I can't stand the sight of her?

261
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,350
I think she's sweet and adorable.

262
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,720
Why can't you stand
the sight of her?

263
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,149
She's your daughter-in-law who is
carrying your grandkid in her belly.

264
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,419
That's what makes me so angry.

265
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,490
After Ji Na's visit, I can't help
but compare her with Ji Na.

266
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,059
If Ji Na were my daughter-in-law,

267
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,000
I'd be so happy now.

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,669
I'd be smiling
and laughing with her.

269
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,840
What's the point
of holding that poetry book?

270
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,309
Stop reading poems about love.

271
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,840
Read some philosophy books!

272
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:35,909
Good grief.

273
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,419
What do you even know about poetry?

274
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,120
Poetry is the only hope I have
in this tough life of mine!

275
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
What is the matter with you?

276
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,690
My goodness.

277
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,429
You see, I'm upset too.

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,629
I married a man
who wasn't right for me,

279
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,039
and he completely destroyed
my fantasies about marriage,

280
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,039
so I just waited for the day
when I'd get a daughter-in-law,

281
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,340
dreaming of going shopping
with my daughter-in-law...

282
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,679
and getting spa treatments with her.

283
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,980
I wanted to go to art galleries
and the opera with her.

284
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,679
I wanted to live elegantly
like that.

285
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,049
But what is this?

286
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,620
Seriously, life never goes...

287
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,759
the way you want it to go.

288
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,460
(New Message)

289
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,240
Mother, would you like to go
to the opera with me tomorrow?

290
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,500
These tickets are very hard to get.

291
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Oh, my.

292
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,710
It's as if she can read my mind.

293
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,919
My gosh. What should I do?

294
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,320
It's not a good idea
to keep spending time with Ji Na.

295
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:50,820
Well, what's wrong with it?

296
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,059
If I just think of her
as Min Gi's friend,

297
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,330
there's nothing wrong with it.

298
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,590
No, I shouldn't.

299
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:59,860
This is wrong.

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, boy.

301
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,919
I heard you asked for me.

302
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,750
I wanted to ask you something.

303
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,620
This is a formal question...

304
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,490
for Chairwoman Hwang's
chief secretary,

305
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,159
not a personal one.

306
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,429
About my mom.

307
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
You're looking for her, aren't you?

308
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,139
Why are you looking for her?

309
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,309
It's because...

310
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,679
Chairwoman Hwang is concerned
that she might show up again...

311
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,549
and negatively influence you.

312
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,049
Hello?

313
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,029
The chairwoman is waiting.

314
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:07,230
Please come with me.

315
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,099
Gosh, it's okay.

316
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,900
It's all right. I'll be right back.

317
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,750
I remember...

318
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,720
seeing you when I was little.

319
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,990
I thought
I had forgotten everything,

320
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,960
but I remember now.

321
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,359
It was the day we moved to Kkotsan.

322
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,430
Before we even finished unpacking,

323
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,329
you showed up.

324
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,339
She stepped out with you.

325
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:50,009
And that night,
she left me in the rain and ran off.

326
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:53,880
You see,

327
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:58,849
I simply follow
Chairwoman Hwang's orders.

328
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,519
That day,

329
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,190
what did Grandma do to her?

330
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,660
What on earth did Grandma do
that she left her young son...

331
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,089
in the rain and ran off
in the middle of unpacking?

332
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,099
Did she really extort money
from Grandma...

333
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:14,700
and run off with that money?

334
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,269
Do you know what really happened?

335
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,170
I...

336
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,980
I have nothing more to tell you.

337
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,309
Please excuse me.

338
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,359
This is something
I can handle on my own.

339
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,470
I've sent you
the revised proposal back.

340
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,599
Yes, please take a look
and get back to me.

341
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,980
The people at Heirmez must be saying
they won't proceed without me.

342
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,950
I'll try to convince them.

343
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,650
Your mother is very worried too,

344
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,089
knowing you have to walk
on eggshells around Gong Hee.

345
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,859
You need to stay focused
on your goal now.

346
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,000
Why would you tell my mom
about what's going on at work?

347
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,660
Be careful from now on.

348
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,299
I'm going to the opera
with Mother in the evening.

349
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
Why would you do that?

350
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,309
What do you mean, why?

351
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,509
She complained that
she hadn't been able to go out...

352
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,740
to enjoy cultural events,

353
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,180
so I wanted to take her out.

354
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,410
Shouldn't you thank me?

355
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Fine. You do that, then.

356
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:42,519
Gong Hee, Mom will be home late.

357
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,819
How about we visit Mother's shop
for some dumplings in the evening?

358
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:46,859
Sure, let's do that.

359
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,730
Please take good care
of my mother-in-law.

360
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,460
Buy her a nice meal.

361
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:06,509
Here.

362
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,210
We've brought you
all the dumplings we had left.

363
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,210
Dig in.

364
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,519
I didn't know there were
so many different types of dumplings.

365
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,150
Come on.
Don't look down on dumplings, okay?

366
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,789
You can dump
all sorts of fillings inside.

367
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,019
Hence the name, "dumpling."

368
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,859
Don't take her seriously.
She's just joking around.

369
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,299
What? Shall I make
all sorts of dumplings...

370
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,200
to prove myself? Wait here.

371
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,970
- Auntie! Stop. Hold back.
- Gong Hee...

372
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
- Thank you for the meal.
- No problem.

373
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,339
Work must be really busy.

374
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:42,349
You seem to have lost weight.

375
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:43,349
Well, yes.

376
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,920
I'm in charge of a project.

377
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:48,819
What...

378
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,950
I know work keeps you busy.

379
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,089
But please take good care
of Gong Hee.

380
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,089
Right.

381
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,230
It's natural...

382
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,599
for a pregnant woman to get edgy
over the smallest matters.

383
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,430
I see.

384
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,539
I'm guessing the visit
to our house yesterday...

385
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,140
got you worried.

386
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,839
There's nothing to worry about.

387
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,849
How can I not worry?

388
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,710
The woman
you almost got married to...

389
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,319
visits your home.

390
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,349
And I even witnessed your mother
yelling at Gong Hee.

391
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,789
There was a reason
she had to drop by.

392
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,220
And I'll have a talk with my mother.

393
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,289
I also heard your mother...

394
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,430
telling Gong Hee to quit her job.

395
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:43,039
Help Gong Hee so that
she can continue to work.

396
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,710
You two work in the same company,
so you must've seen her at work.

397
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,309
Then you must know
how much she loves her job.

398
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,180
Think about it.

399
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,349
If I told you to quit your job
because you're married now,

400
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,250
would you say yes and quit?

401
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,619
So why should she,
just because she's a woman?

402
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,430
I'll keep that in mind.

403
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm well aware
of your mother's personality.

404
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,829
I also know
how she'd treat Gong Hee.

405
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,299
Please take good care
of Gong Hee, Min Gi.

406
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,809
Things that upset you
during pregnancy...

407
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,170
stay with you forever.

408
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,079
Sit.

409
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,339
- My gosh.
- Here.

410
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,980
We can't finish all this food.

411
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:25,950
Come on.
You aren't the only one eating.

412
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,420
Momo needs to eat too.

413
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,420
My, they look so good.

414
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,190
- Dig in.
- Okay.

415
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,730
Oh, my.
I feel like it's been so long.

416
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,500
Yes, Ji Na.

417
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,710
The opera was incredible.

418
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Thanks to you,
I had such a great time.

419
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,279
Dinner was great too.

420
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,910
Okay. Thank you.

421
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,049
- We're back.
- Hey, you guys.

422
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,190
Did you enjoy the opera?

423
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,890
I did.

424
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,160
As expected from Ji Na.

425
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:09,029
She knows so much about opera
on top of everything else.

426
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,829
That girl has class.

427
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:12,329
Mom!

428
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:14,230
That's enough.

429
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,599
Hey, you scared me.

430
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,700
You shouldn't meet up with Ji Na
even if she invites you.

431
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,240
Do you know how ashamed I was
in front of Mother?

432
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,339
Why did you have Ji Na over...

433
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:25,940
and make Gong Hee hear those things?

434
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,410
My goodness.
Did Myung Ja nag at you in person?

435
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,349
Don't meet Ji Na from now on.

436
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,950
Don't do things
others might disapprove of.

437
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,670
Did you tell your mom again?

438
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,799
That Ji Na visits our house.

439
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,640
Well done. Way to go.

440
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,910
Are you satisfied now?

441
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,049
You're driving a wedge
between my son and me, aren't you?

442
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,619
Hey.

443
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,130
Clear your schedule tomorrow.

444
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,490
Let's go to my mom's house.

445
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm too worried
to sit still and do nothing.

446
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,069
You see, tomorrow, I'm...

447
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,170
"How's Gyeong Tae?"

448
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,640
She asks about you all the time.

449
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,500
But you don't care about her
once she leaves?

450
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,009
I never asked you to treat her
like I treated your parents.

451
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,440
Pretend to be concerned about her,
at least.

452
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,779
You're coming with me tomorrow.

453
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,109
We're taking my mom to the hospital.

454
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,480
Well, but...

455
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,859
What on earth is this?

456
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,829
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,160
I'll be there even if it's late.

458
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,559
Good grief.

459
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,599
What? Oh, no. What's wrong?

460
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Did Gyeong Tae leave again?

461
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,670
After leaving this note?

462
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:10,549
My gosh. I told him we'd go
and see my mom together.

463
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:11,750
How could he do this?

464
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:16,089
Oh, dear. They say
all humans repeat the same mistakes.

465
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:19,190
As if not answering his phone
and vanishing on the day...

466
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,490
of your mom's surgery wasn't enough.

467
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,329
Seriously,
when will my brother grow up?

468
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,230
But he at least left a note
this time, you know?

469
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,329
Forget it.

470
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm going alone.

471
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,839
No...

472
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:35,809
Goodness.

473
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,079
Why do I keep getting the chills?

474
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,079
Why can't I shake off
this bad feeling?

475
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,980
Maeng Gyeong Tae.

476
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,220
What are you getting up to?

477
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,420
Goodness, what do I do?

478
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,799
I can't understand
the man I've lived...

479
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,599
half of my life with.

480
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,869
I didn't ask him
to get me a star in the sky...

481
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,509
or the moon.

482
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,509
I simply wanted him...

483
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,109
to come along with me.

484
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,359
Do they say the one closest to you
hurts you the most?

485
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,599
Or that your family is the one
that breaks your heart the most?

486
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,950
But without realizing it,
I was also...

487
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:55,720
breaking the hearts
of my loved ones.

488
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Mom.

489
00:26:58,819 --> 00:26:59,819
Mom?

490
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,519
Mom.

491
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,529
Little did I know,
my exhausting life...

492
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,740
was breaking my mom's heart...

493
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,769
and being a burden on her.

494
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,950
My shabby life made my mom
go into hiding forever.

495
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:43,029
Mom.

496
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,299
Where are you, Mom?

497
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,329
(My Merry Marriage)

498
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:11,859
Myung Ja.

499
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,660
- Just once more.
- Mom...

500
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,069
Would you please forgive
your foolish mother?

501
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,630
Why buy one already?

502
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,200
It's like a lucky charm for Momo...

503
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,769
to stay healthy
until the day we meet.

504
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,509
You said you were going
to your brother's clinic.

505
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:25,279
Did you hear some bad news?

506
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,210
- Really?
- Mom, I'll go on a blind date.

507
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,009
But it has to be tonight.
