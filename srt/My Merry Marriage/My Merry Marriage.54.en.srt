1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,359
- Ta-da.
- Oh, my.

2
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,359
Nice.

3
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,570
Do I have indigestion or something?

4
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,239
My stomach is upset.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,880
You normally eat marinated crab
with the shell.

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,950
What's with you?

7
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,049
I've been feeling queasy too.

8
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,279
Home-cooked meals are the best.

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,650
Mom. We have more soup, right?

10
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,189
I should just have
the soybean paste soup.

11
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,559
Here.

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,970
Gosh, it's so weird.

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,079
Their marriage vows were amusing.

14
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,079
Goodness. Amusing, my foot.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,879
Has he already become
a henpecked husband?

16
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,990
"I will be her faithful servant
for the rest of my life."

17
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,990
What was that?

18
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,690
Actually,
I wouldn't call Gong Boo...

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,729
a henpecked husband.
He's a petrified husband.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,630
His wife's words...

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,330
make him tremble in fear
because he's petrified.

22
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,570
"Petrified?"

23
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,070
When a woman is mean
to her husband, it's his fault.

24
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,469
Ms. Eom has a good reason...

25
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:45,969
for needing to be controlling
in the relationship.

26
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,839
Stop calling her like that.

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,710
"Ms. Eom?"
She's your sister-in-law now.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,880
Come on. Give me some time.
I'm not used to it yet.

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,119
Anyway, how come
Gyeong Tae isn't home yet?

30
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,089
He said he wanted
to take the elders out for a beer.

31
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,960
Whenever the Maeng family
gets together,

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,119
they drink and talk all night.

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,059
Hold on.

34
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,430
Shouldn't we go there
and bring him home?

35
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,630
He should just send them home
and call it a night.

36
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:14,999
By the way, isn't it hard to book
a wedding hall at a hotel?

37
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,800
I hear most of them
have long waiting lists.

38
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,669
I used all of my connections,
Mother.

39
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:23,410
My gosh.
You used your connections, Ji Na?

40
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,479
Of course, you know a lot of people.

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,580
I guess
I'll spot many famous people...

42
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,319
among the guests at the wedding.

43
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,219
Yes, I know some celebrities.

44
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,219
Many of them will be there.

45
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:37,760
My gosh. It'll be so different
from Myung Ja's son's wedding.

46
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:40,599
Oh, hi.

47
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,360
- Honey.
- Dad.

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,999
Hello, Father.

49
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,069
What are you doing now?

50
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,110
Honey, I should tell you now.

51
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,439
Their wedding venue...

52
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,080
Can you not think?

53
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,349
Are you in your right mind now?

54
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,580
You still haven't given up
on that vain dream of yours.

55
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,980
You are still trying...

56
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,689
to have Min Gi marry Ms. Kang?

57
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,119
"Vain dream?"
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
They made up and got back together.

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,089
They want to get married.

60
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:14,629
Why should I stop them?

61
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,159
Dad.

62
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:18,529
We want to get married.

63
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:19,599
Seo Min Gi!

64
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,140
Let's talk in the room.

65
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,360
You cannot marry Ms. Kang.

66
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,099
Break up at once!

67
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:49,460
Why are you being like this,
seriously?

68
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,270
You can just quietly root for us,
can't you?

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,700
Do you know what the chairwoman
told me to do today?

70
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,779
She told me to look into the man
Ms. Kang is seeing.

71
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,349
I'm sure you know
what the chairwoman is like...

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,879
because you've known her
long enough.

73
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,520
She totally takes care of those
who are loyal to her...

74
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,960
but slays those who betray her.

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,529
She cuts off their limbs
so they can't come near her again.

76
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,159
So, if she finds out that my son...

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,700
snatched up
her future granddaughter-in-law,

78
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,869
how do you think she will react?

79
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,999
The company...

80
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,770
isn't everything in life.

81
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,380
She won't just kick you out
of the company and stop there!

82
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,620
She still hasn't given up
on Ms. Kang.

83
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,719
What? You'll marry Ms. Kang?

84
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,060
Do you think
she'll let your wedding take place?

85
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,859
I'll meet with Chairwoman Hwang
and tell her everything.

86
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,570
I'll make sure
you're not affected in any way.

87
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,770
Seo Min Gi!

88
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,669
If I can be with Ji Na,

89
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,169
I can give up everything I have.

90
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,870
- Hey, are you serious?
- I...

91
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,409
will marry Ji Na.

92
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,479
Don't try to change my mind.

93
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,310
Min Gi!

94
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,849
Darn it.

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,060
- Gyeong Sol.
- Yes?

96
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Isn't your wife coming?

97
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,960
- No, she's in Canada.
- That's why...

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,130
- Enjoy.
- you need a good daughter-in-law.

99
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,630
- Canada?
- They learned that the first time,

100
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,500
so I'm sure they considered
everything carefully this time.

101
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,640
Gyeong Tae. Your mother said this...

102
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,440
over and over again
until the day she died.

103
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,109
"My son is suffering..."

104
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:43,539
"because he married
the wrong woman."

105
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,609
Hey.

106
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:50,320
My goodness. Why bring up
his late mother on this happy day?

107
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:52,320
Come to think of it,

108
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,820
your mother wasn't wrong.

109
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,260
Natal chart compatibility...

110
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
does matter.

111
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,900
She broke my wife's heart
until the day she died.

112
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,700
I still regret that
I let her treat my wife like that.

113
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,739
Don't even think of
bringing that up again...

114
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,940
in front of my wife!

115
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,039
Goodness gracious.

116
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,710
You never said a thing about it
when your mother was alive.

117
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,080
Why are you raising your voice
at me?

118
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,950
Did I mistreat your wife?

119
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,219
Your mother did!

120
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,719
You had crossed the line back then.

121
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,219
You were all so mean to my wife.

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,890
You shouldn't have made
my mother-in-law...

123
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,960
get down on her knees!

124
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,570
Well, her family was out of line.

125
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,969
They had no shame.

126
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:41,969
She got married empty-handed.

127
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,710
Do you know what your mother
had to do to raise you?

128
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,010
That's right!

129
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,210
If she'd had
a better daughter-in-law,

130
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,510
she might have lived longer.
Who knows?

131
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
My gosh.

132
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,320
How could you say that?

133
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,650
How?

134
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,120
My wife supported the entire family.

135
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,659
She took care of my siblings...

136
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:04,630
and even took care of
my parents' funerals!

137
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,429
She worked herself to the bone
to take care of the family.

138
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,560
Who is the one that has no shame?

139
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,799
When my mother-in-law got down
on her knees in front of Mother,

140
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,870
I couldn't say anything.

141
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,310
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

142
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,539
If Myung Ja had found out,
she would've cried even more.

143
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:26,210
That would be like
hammering a nail...

144
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,580
into her heart,
which is already broken!

145
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,120
What did you say?

146
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,659
Mom got down on her knees
because of me?

147
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,460
What do you mean?

148
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,900
Oh, dear.

149
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,529
Goodness. This will turn
into another big fight.

150
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:48,299
What did I do so wrong?

151
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,570
Is it because
I got married empty-handed?

152
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Is that why you made my mom...

153
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,710
apologize on her knees?

154
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,719
Honey.

155
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,380
Myung Ja.

156
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:05,150
Myung Ja.

157
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,760
- I'm sorry, Myung Ja.
- I...

158
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:10,989
- I really did my best.
- Myung Ja.

159
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,390
Why did you have to do that
to my mom too? Why?

160
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,400
Why? My mom...

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,529
Gosh, seriously!

162
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,270
Why did you have to
run your mouth like that?

163
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,239
- Why?
- Don't you raise your voice!

164
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,640
Gosh, Myung Ja.

165
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,239
My mom...

166
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,179
Why did my mom have to apologize?

167
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,339
Why?

168
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,779
Calm her down.

169
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:32,779
Be quiet.

170
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,380
Why...

171
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,620
- I'm sorry.
- Why...

172
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,390
Seriously! What's wrong with you?

173
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,770
Hey, Gong Boo.
Are you enjoying your honeymoon?

174
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,600
Yes, it's nice.

175
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,270
Anyway,
is something going on at home?

176
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,079
Mom and Dad didn't pick up,
so I called Auntie Gyeong Bok,

177
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,340
but it was very noisy.

178
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,610
Really? Mom went to
Uncle Gyeong Sol's pub to get Dad.

179
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,049
Oh, boy. I guess
they got into another fight.

180
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:13,220
Anyway, tell Mom and Dad
we arrived safe and sound.

181
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,720
Gong Hee. No, my sister-in-law.

182
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,789
We'll have a good time here.

183
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,559
Hang up and come here!

184
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,299
My gosh, hey!

185
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,970
Gong Hee, we'll see you in Seoul.

186
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,740
Okay, have a good time.

187
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:34,480
My gosh. They're so in love.

188
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,679
Hold on.

189
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,150
Did something happen to Mom and Dad?

190
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,819
- My goodness.
- Hey!

191
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,750
- Oh, no.
- Hey, Gong Hee.

192
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,860
Oh, boy.
Things are a total mess over here.

193
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,919
- Mom! What's going on?
- How could you say that?

194
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,429
- Mom, are you okay?
- Hang on, Gyeong Tae.

195
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,059
- Stop it.
- Go ahead! Have it out today!

196
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,699
Fine, I never got married.
What are you going to do about it?

197
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,770
You shouldn't do that, Gyeong Tae.

198
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,799
You're right. I was dumped
because I couldn't have kids.

199
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,669
So what? Darn it!

200
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,809
- Auntie!
- Hey, stop it!

201
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,110
- Stop!
- How could you...

202
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,110
What is this?

203
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,549
Oh, this is bad.

204
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,449
Gosh, I can't believe this.

205
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:27,260
I must've really hit it hard.
My goodness.

206
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,299
So why did you throw that kick?

207
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,360
My gosh.

208
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,370
Will you call the cops
when you meet your relatives?

209
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,000
That's enough.

210
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,970
You were crying nonstop.

211
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,840
That's why
Gyeong Tae went overboard.

212
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,909
And why would he call the cops?

213
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,610
You have a husband
who used to be one.

214
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,209
Just know that I let this slide
because Gyeong Bok was here.

215
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,350
How could she make my mom
get on her knees?

216
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:52,549
It makes me shudder with anger.

217
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:56,490
I have no excuses for myself.

218
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,189
And how could you not tell me...

219
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,459
anything about it for decades?

220
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean, even if he told you,

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
you'd only feel hurt. That's why.

222
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Oh, Mom! Dad!

223
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,539
- Mr. Maeng.
- Hey.

224
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,169
- Oh, dear.
- Hey, what's wrong?

225
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:14,010
- Did you get hurt, Dad?
- No.

226
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,209
Gosh, he's fine.

227
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,750
He'll be fine once he goes home
and puts on pain relief patches.

228
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,809
- Yes.
- It happens all the time.

229
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,750
Whenever there's a family event,
a huge fight breaks out.

230
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,490
This is why
I don't like family gatherings.

231
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,159
Hey, it's not just our family.

232
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,919
I hear every family is like this.

233
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,090
As if. My family isn't like that.

234
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,659
Hey! To be honest, your family...

235
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,100
doesn't even meet up.

236
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,230
You always have
family meetings online.

237
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,640
We all live apart,
like in the US and on Jeju Island.

238
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,140
What else can we do?

239
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,709
Hey, do you think...

240
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,340
I haven't seen you fight
during your online meetings?

241
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,779
You threw your phone away
during so many of those meetings,

242
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,650
and I picked it up for you.

243
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,220
Hey, that's enough already.

244
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,750
Dad, shouldn't you go
to the hospital?

245
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,750
No.

246
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,419
Why did you have to hurt your back?

247
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,819
Your dad's uncle was sorry
and offered to pay hospital fees,

248
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:05,159
but I managed to send him home.

249
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,990
You should've just accepted it
and spent it on some good food.

250
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,529
Why did you have to go
and send it back with him?

251
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,500
Hey, it's not easy
to open that man's wallet.

252
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
You have to accept money
when he offers it. Right?

253
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,140
Gyeong Tae, did we ever get
pocket money from him...

254
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,799
when we were kids?

255
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,240
- Never.
- See?

256
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,270
Goodness gracious.

257
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,439
Mr. Maeng, let me carry you.

258
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,110
- What? No.
- Come on. Let me carry you.

259
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,250
Oh, dear. It's fine.

260
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,949
- What? But I feel bad...
- Just go on.

261
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,319
Gosh, I'm sorry.

262
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:30,990
- Bring my jacket.
- Goodness.

263
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,049
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

264
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:35,789
- Oh, gosh.
- Hey, are you okay?

265
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,959
Hey, I'm not okay.

266
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,159
You should clean up and go home.

267
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,100
Even if you're not okay, come here.
I can't clean this by myself.

268
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,959
- Let go.
- Come on!

269
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,159
Why, you little...

270
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,400
- Come on.
- Oh, dear.

271
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:49,400
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

272
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,970
Mr. Maeng, did you get hurt?

273
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,970
Well...

274
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,970
He's just being a big baby.

275
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,539
He was acting like one
and got into a fight.

276
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,309
Oh, my.

277
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,679
Goodness.
You must be tired, Dan Soo.

278
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,020
Oh, don't worry.

279
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,350
He doesn't even work out.
This is good for him.

280
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,990
Carry him properly. He's my dad.

281
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,360
All right. He's your dad.
I'm so jealous.

282
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,630
Dan Soo, be careful, okay?

283
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,630
Okay.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,730
I weigh quite a lot, don't I?

285
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,169
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

286
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,039
Mom, are you asleep?

287
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,689
Mom, are you asleep?

288
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,230
I...

289
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,970
Why did I only hear about that now?

290
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,010
Why did you have to
get on your knees because of me?

291
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:08,449
Was it such a big crime...

292
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,120
not to bring wedding gifts?

293
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:23,860
I thought living with my in-laws
was only hard on me,

294
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:27,500
but you had a harder time
because of me.

295
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,439
But...

296
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,840
Mom...

297
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,380
Your heart must have ached so much.

298
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:41,679
You must've been so upset.

299
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,689
Why didn't you...

300
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,490
say anything to me?

301
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:54,659
You were always smiling.

302
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,299
You only asked how I was doing.

303
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,470
Why did you do that?

304
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,909
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:08,980
I'm sorry, Mom.

306
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:16,919
(Bubble Up Laundry)

307
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:41,779
What?

308
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:45,279
Where has she gone
this early in the morning?

309
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,049
You're up, Mother.

310
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,390
Yes, where did Myung Ja go?

311
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,559
I'm sorry, Mother.

312
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,559
What?

313
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,299
I should apologize to you now
although it's late.

314
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,740
About the time...

315
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:13,840
you got on your knees
before my mother...

316
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,209
Goodness. What?

317
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,010
Why are you bringing up something
from way back when?

318
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,150
Don't do that.

319
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,289
I shouldn't have stayed quiet
as your son-in-law.

320
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,890
It may be late, but I am...

321
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,090
sincerely sorry.

322
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,260
Then,

323
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,029
has Myung Ja found out?

324
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,770
Has Myung Ja...

325
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,770
found out about it?

326
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,579
Tell me, Gyeong Tae.

327
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,569
Myung Ja.

328
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,299
Mom.

329
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,240
Why did you come out here?

330
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,079
And what's wrong
with the way you walk?

331
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,509
Is something wrong
with your back again?

332
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,280
Does your knee hurt?

333
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,650
Do you want to hear something funny?

334
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,019
An old woman went to see a doctor...

335
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,360
and said, "I hurt here and there..."

336
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,860
"and all over."

337
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,530
"What's my diagnosis?"

338
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:48,040
Then, the doctor gave
a simple answer.

339
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,800
"It's old age."

340
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,580
I'm just getting old. That's all.

341
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,179
When you get old,
your body aches all over...

342
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,320
and feels uncomfortable.
That's a natural thing.

343
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:06,189
You upset me so much.

344
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,560
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

345
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,259
When I got married,

346
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,759
you went to my mother-in-law...

347
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,499
and got on your knees.

348
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,300
And if I had told you,

349
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,640
would you have called off
your wedding?

350
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,100
It makes me so mad.

351
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,070
Why would you get down
on your knees?

352
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,810
Getting on my knees is no big deal.

353
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,150
If it's for my child,

354
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,989
I could do it a hundred times.

355
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,890
I wouldn't even care
if my knees wear away.

356
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,060
But you haven't done anything wrong.

357
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,530
All you did was
struggle all your life...

358
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,499
to raise your daughter.
Why would you do that?

359
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,310
Mom.

360
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,739
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,810
Good grief.

362
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,280
Haven't you been listening to me?

363
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,390
It's nothing.

364
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:14,290
It's all in the past.

365
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,459
Why would you relive it
and go through such a heartache?

366
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,090
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:23,100
I'm so sorry.

368
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,400
Why do you keep crying?

369
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,610
There are worse things in the world.

370
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,979
Don't cry.

371
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,880
When you got married,

372
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
we couldn't afford
to send any wedding gifts.

373
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,820
I barely managed to send
some pickled plums.

374
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,290
I still regret it so much...

375
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,159
when I think about
how they treated you.

376
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,239
You...

377
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,870
shouldn't become
a mother-in-law like that.

378
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:09,040
What makes someone an adult?

379
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,409
Don't compare yourself to others.

380
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,919
If others brag about...

381
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,949
their wealthy daughters-in-law,
just congratulate them.

382
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,719
We aren't rich, you know.

383
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,519
And Hong Dan is
your daughter-in-law now,

384
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,489
so just be grateful.

385
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,070
That's why you yelled at me...

386
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,739
when I complained about Hong Dan
not getting us any gifts.

387
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,780
My gosh. I have no shame, Mom.

388
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,509
I've done nothing for them,

389
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,449
but I compared her to others.
How petty of me.

390
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:48,580
Gosh, when will I grow up?

391
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,249
Even at this age...

392
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:52,449
I feel so pathetic.

393
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,860
It's not easy to be a decent adult.

394
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,769
I know I nag you,

395
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,499
but I'm still immature too.

396
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,969
Come on, Mom. That's not true.

397
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,409
It is true.

398
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,509
They say, "You finally become mature
lying in your coffin."

399
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,150
You know that saying, right?

400
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,509
What?

401
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:56,050
Gosh, why am I so sleepy?

402
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,290
Go to the rooftop and take a nap.

403
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,019
This is not good.
I should go and wash my face.

404
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,340
- My gosh.
- I was like that...

405
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,509
when I had my first child.

406
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,739
I kept dozing off all day.

407
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,610
So, before I found out
I was pregnant,

408
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,239
I drank coffee nonstop.

409
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:25,909
No way.

410
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:28,880
I did feel queasy.

411
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:30,719
That must be it, then.

412
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,749
Check your cycle.

413
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,290
There's no way I'm pregnant.

414
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
What?

415
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,530
Goodness.

416
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:49,239
(December, Christmas)

417
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:55,380
No way. That can't be.

418
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,219
What's with that look on your face?

419
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,360
You look like a thief
who got caught in the act.

420
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:10,689
It's nothing.

421
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,030
(Mir Home Produce)

422
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,509
I knew it. This is your shop.

423
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,150
The owner of Tiffany Alterations,
Audrey.

424
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,679
No. Oh Jung Eun.

425
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,060
The last time I visited your shop,

426
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,169
you weren't here.

427
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,739
That's why I went
to that dumpling shop,

428
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,310
but they treated me like a stalker.

429
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,509
What? Why...

430
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:06,150
Look.

431
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,150
Geon... No.

432
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,419
I know that you're here
because of Dan Soo.

433
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,850
So, you know everything now.

434
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,060
Including the fact
that Dan Soo is Geon.

435
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,030
Yes.

436
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,330
That said, I must ask you
to please understand.

437
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I...

438
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,900
cannot leave Dan Soo.

439
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,409
You won't get anything
out of pleading with me.

440
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,179
You know that.

441
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,280
I couldn't even see him once
for 20 years.

442
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,890
I never once cooked him
a warm meal...

443
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,320
or sent him to school.

444
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:51,219
I never once got to praise him...

445
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,360
or scold him
when he did something wrong.

446
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,590
I never once got to give him...

447
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,499
a compliment
or any advice for that matter.

448
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:00,800
Now,

449
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,600
even if
I can only live one more day,

450
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,669
I want to live as Dan Soo's mother.

451
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,909
If you have a child too,
you must know...

452
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:14,550
how any parent would feel
in this situation.

453
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,519
Please understand
and give me some time.

454
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:22,320
I promise you I'll leave
before Chairwoman Hwang finds out.

455
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,360
Give me just a little more time.
Please?

456
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:27,489
Please?

457
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,699
Could you take a look
at the printout in front of you?

458
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,040
Holly will send me a few designs.

459
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,140
When I get them,
I'll consult the design team,

460
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,679
and we'll decide on the design
for the collaboration.

461
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,919
Then can we see Holly's designs
at our next meeting?

462
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,689
Yes, I'll keep communicating
with Holly to make it happen.

463
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:57,659
You're amazing, Gong Hee.

464
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,130
You can contact Holly personally.

465
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,860
We'll have to wait and see.

466
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,800
Also, I suggest...

467
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,040
we keep this confidential
for the time being.

468
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,509
Holly also wants
to keep it confidential for now.

469
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,110
Then we'll discuss later on...

470
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,150
and decide when to send out
the press release.

471
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,519
Please keep it confidential
so it doesn't get leaked.

472
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
With projects like this,

473
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:28,120
we'll have a problem
if it gets leaked.

474
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,469
Why are you so slow these days?

475
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,699
You say you still don't know
who Ms. Kang is seeing,

476
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,769
and you still haven't tracked down
Audrey or Oh Jung Eun.

477
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,009
What if she approaches Dan Soo?

478
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,050
Then what will you do?

479
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:55,820
I am trying to track her down.

480
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,120
So? Have you found her?

481
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:03,259
(Chairwoman Hwang Ik Sun)

482
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:05,019
It's been a while since she vanished
from the hospital.

483
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,130
You still haven't found her?

484
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,459
Well, ma'am.

485
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,570
You found her, right?

486
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,169
Where is she now?

487
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:26,679
My goodness.
That man was here again?

488
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,620
Tell me what happened.
What did he say?

489
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,050
He told me to leave.

490
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:37,689
Quietly, before Dan Soo finds out.

491
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:41,459
You are Dan Soo's mother.

492
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,659
Who is he to order you to leave?

493
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,070
I...

494
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,939
I'm going to tell Dan Soo.

495
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,669
What?

496
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,249
I must tell him...

497
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,519
that I'm his mom.

498
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,729
(My Merry Marriage)

499
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,630
How much time do I have left?

500
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,239
I'll tell Dan Soo later.

501
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:25,469
Pretend you know nothing.

502
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,570
- Do you need folic acid?
- Pardon?

503
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,540
I don't feel comfortable
around you anymore.

504
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,780
Why do you keep crossing the line?

505
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,850
Does that mean
I can't even take your side anymore?

506
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,620
Dan Soo moved out.

507
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,449
It really is all over now.

508
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,090
