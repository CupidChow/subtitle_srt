00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
(Episode 80)

2
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,140
Why didn't you come with Gong Hee?

3
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,579
You two should've come together.

4
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,610
I had to work late today,

5
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,220
but I thought
I should come here too.

6
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,620
I came so that Gong Hee and I
could go home together.

7
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:00,349
Have you eaten?

8
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,650
Yes, I've eaten.

9
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,259
Where is Gong Hee?

10
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,119
She went upstairs
to see Dan Soo before going home,

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,130
but I'm not sure
if Dan Soo is home yet.

12
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,029
Then I'll take Gong Hee and go home.

13
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,630
You came all the way here.

14
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,669
Come inside with Gong Hee
for a cup of tea, okay?

15
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,740
Sure, we'll do that.

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,920
Did something happen?

17
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:35,320
Ms. Audrey...

18
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,390
I met her.

19
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,360
She...

20
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,900
ruined everything.

21
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,270
My dad...

22
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,809
and my life too.

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,109
Don't say that.

24
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:02,150
She's your mom, whom you missed
even in your dreams.

25
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,490
You told her not to go,
not to leave.

26
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,960
I know you've always missed her.

27
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,790
What do you think you're doing?

28
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,529
Why, you little...

29
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,130
Gu Dan Soo!

30
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,940
Gu Dan Soo.

31
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,639
She's my wife now!

32
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:35,109
You're right.

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,080
You two are married now.

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,290
Can you wait downstairs
for a moment?

35
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,259
Dan Soo and I need to talk.

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,589
No.

37
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,190
You're coming with me.

38
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,559
My gosh!

39
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,699
Leave, please.

40
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,339
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,569
Dan Soo and I need
to talk about something.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Maeng Gong Hee.

43
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,309
Just go.

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Gu Dan Soo.

45
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,819
I'm sorry...

46
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,490
for leaning on a married woman.

47
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:21,529
Thank you...

48
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,730
for lending a friend...

49
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,499
a shoulder.

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,360
Hey, Gong Hee.

51
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,930
I made some jujube tea.
Come in with Min Gi.

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,740
Mom, we'll just be going.

53
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,670
What? He said he already had dinner,

54
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,909
but you guys should
at least have some tea.

55
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,670
And have some of the rice cakes
you brought too.

56
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,279
We're already in the car.

57
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,050
Mom, please take care of Dan Soo.

58
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,710
Is Dan Soo back?

59
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,719
Yes, it didn't seem like
he had dinner.

60
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:19,689
Look in on him, okay?

61
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,089
Okay, I will.

62
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,029
He said he was coming in
for some tea.

63
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,129
Why did they just leave?

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,029
They just left?

65
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,230
Yes, my son-in-law
isn't affectionate at all.

66
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,569
I just don't like him.

67
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,969
Come on.
Did you even listen to your mother?

68
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,010
She said to keep looking at him
with kind eyes to grow to like him.

69
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,510
Gong Hee said Dan Soo was home.

70
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,180
She asked me
to prepare some dinner for him.

71
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,010
Hey, could you put the stew
on the stove?

72
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,510
- I'll go and get him.
- Okay.

73
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,950
My goodness.

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,990
Gosh,
this jujube tea is so delicious.

75
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,719
Why did they leave
without tasting it?

76
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:07,599
Oh, that's hot.

77
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,179
Dan Soo. Come and eat.

78
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,390
Gong Hee said you hadn't eaten yet.

79
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,159
Have some dinner
before you go to bed, okay?

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,659
Is he asleep?

81
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,210
I was abandoned too, you see.

82
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,419
By my own mother.

83
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,919
How would a parent feel
after abandoning their own child?

84
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,260
I'm curious.

85
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,630
Tell me.

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,469
Did you abandon your son?

87
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,219
("Leaves in Your Heart")

88
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,359
"Snow piles up high enough
to cover a telephone pole,"

89
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:39,159
"but it melts away in spring."

90
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:40,830
"That is love."

91
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,000
"And life."

92
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,200
Mr. Ryu's sentimentality
is literally like a glass marble.

93
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,839
Oh, hey.

94
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,770
You're coming home together.

95
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,609
We're home.

96
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,210
Did you two fight?

97
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,380
How can you already fight
when you just got married?

98
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,620
I'll head upstairs now.

99
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,890
When an elder asks you a question,
you should answer.

100
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,489
I'm asking you if you two fought.

101
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:12,729
Yes.

102
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,890
"Yes?"

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,630
Why did you fight?

104
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,700
There was a misunderstanding.

105
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,370
What kind of misunderstanding?

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,940
Hey, you know Min Gi is
too good for you, don't you?

107
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:26,039
Then you should cater to him.

108
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,109
How dare you fight with him?

109
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,739
Don't worry too much.

110
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,919
What's up with her?

111
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,719
She doesn't even bat an eye
when I scold her.

112
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:44,190
Even her personality is
just like Kang Myung Ja's.

113
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,359
What on earth did they fight about?

114
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,830
- My gosh.
- Hey.

115
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,830
Honey.

116
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,400
Is something going on at home?

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,799
Min Gi and his wife must've fought.

118
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:01,039
Newlyweds are supposed to fight.

119
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,539
Think about how it was for us.

120
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:05,279
Was there a single day
when we didn't fight as newlyweds?

121
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,479
Anyway, they're not a good match.

122
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:11,179
Min Gi and Ji Na were like
two peas in a pod.

123
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,690
Gosh, those two are... Anyway,

124
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,719
they don't have good chemistry.

125
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,190
I think they're a great match.

126
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,700
It's a shame for Gong Hee, though.

127
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,830
What? What are you saying right now?

128
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,070
- She's too good for us.
- Goodness.

129
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:29,440
Give me some food.

130
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,200
Does your boss not even feed you
as she works you to the bone?

131
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,239
I remembered the soy sauce
marinated crab from our in-laws,

132
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,080
so I said I'd eat at home.

133
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,710
Get that out for me.

134
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,380
Set the table yourself.

135
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,950
Right. Soy sauce marinated crab
is as classy as you'll ever be.

136
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,020
Don't look down on
soy sauce marinated crab.

137
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,589
Or else, I'll marinate you.

138
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:55,729
What was that?

139
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,099
Why do I hear Kang Myung Ja's voice?

140
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,169
I'm even hallucinating now.

141
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,500
Oh, my gosh.

142
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,479
Explain to me.

143
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,679
I explained to you
the whole way home.

144
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:15,479
All I heard was...

145
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,250
that Dan Soo needed comforting.
That was it.

146
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,620
Fine. Let's say that Dan Soo needs
someone to comfort him now.

147
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:28,689
But does he have to lean on you
and cry?

148
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,069
I know that situation was enough
to make you mad.

149
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:36,169
But we've known each other
since we were so little...

150
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,069
that I only did what I was used to.

151
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,569
We've always lent each other
our shoulders...

152
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:41,270
whenever the other
needed comforting.

153
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:44,539
Did I interfere
in that moment of comfort?

154
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,449
Mr. Seo, you said you'd known him
since you were young.

155
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:52,650
Then, you must know
how sad his life has been.

156
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,289
Dan Soo lost his mom and dad
when he was young,

157
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,559
and he's still in pain
because of it.

158
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,559
Dan Soo isn't a young child anymore.

159
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,590
I think you're going overboard.

160
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,130
It's not that.
Right now, Dan Soo is...

161
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:13,270
Is there a secret
that you can't tell me?

162
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,610
No, there's nothing like that.

163
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,250
I'll be careful from now on.

164
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,850
I think I got too angry...

165
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,459
all of a sudden.

166
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,959
I'll be careful too.

167
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,510
Did you check his vitals?

168
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,709
He has a stab wound in the abdomen.

169
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,079
He has lost a lot of blood.

170
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:00,789
Hurry.

171
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,130
Geon.

172
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Geon.

173
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,809
Geon.

174
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:42,860
- Bring the defibrillator.
- Yes, doctor.

175
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,329
- Dad.
- One, two, three.

176
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:49,400
One, two, three.

177
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
- Dad.
- Charge to 120 joules.

178
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,470
- In 1, 2, 3. Clear!
- Dad.

179
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,840
- Charge to 150 joules.
- Dad.

180
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,610
- Dad!
- In 1, 2, 3. Clear!

181
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,150
- Charge to 120 joules.
- Dad!

182
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,120
- Charging to 120 joules.
- Dad!

183
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,220
In 1, 2, 3. Clear!

184
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,150
Dad!

185
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,260
Dad!

186
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,459
Time of death, 4:01 p.m.

187
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,090
- Due to intra-abdominal bleeding,
- Dad!

188
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,400
- Mr. Gu Hae Joon is deceased.
- Dad!

189
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,699
Dad!

190
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:23,970
Dad!

191
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,309
Dad!

192
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,299
Hey, Dan Soo. You're up.

193
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,470
How about we exercise together?
It's been a while.

194
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,809
Go and put on the gloves.

195
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,350
By any chance, that day...

196
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,179
Were you at the hospital?

197
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:11,949
"That day?" When?

198
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,689
The day when my dad passed away.

199
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,860
I just couldn't stop thinking
that it was so odd.

200
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,689
I was very young back then.

201
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,230
How did I go to the hospital
after the accident?

202
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,400
And how did I come home after that?

203
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:31,799
Someone was there.

204
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,669
Someone who held me up
when I collapsed.

205
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,539
Was that...

206
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,650
you, Mr. Maeng?

207
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,049
The day we met again,
you asked me...

208
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,049
if I missed my mom.

209
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,159
Do you know something, Mr. Maeng?

210
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,459
In the end,

211
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,669
you're asking me about my sin,
Dan Soo.

212
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,069
Please tell me the truth.

213
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,010
That day, your dad...

214
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,220
There's someone
who must hear what happened...

215
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,079
before I tell you.

216
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,789
Let me talk to that person first.

217
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:25,819
Could you...

218
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,360
give me some time?

219
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,179
(General Manager Seo Min Gi)

220
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,289
- What's this?
- The proposal.

221
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,659
I just spiced up
what you already had.

222
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,659
I made it look really good.

223
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:04,329
This is nice.

224
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,159
How would you rate me
as your partner?

225
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,240
All right, let's do this together.

226
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,840
If it goes well,
give me some credit too.

227
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:16,740
Okay.

228
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:23,779
How come you two
didn't come to work together?

229
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,279
Are you really a newlywed couple?

230
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,039
This is weird. I keep calling,
but Mom's not picking up.

231
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,970
Didn't you call her last night?

232
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:47,010
You set an alarm
and have been calling her every day.

233
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:48,909
Oh, boy.

234
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,679
I've been so busy and worried about
Gong Boo's situation and Gong Hee...

235
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,909
that I don't even hear the alarm
when it goes off.

236
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,110
I keep missing the alarm.

237
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:00,289
Last night, I was bathing No Ah,
so I couldn't hear the alarm.

238
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:03,120
I can't call Mom too late
because I don't want to wake her up.

239
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,919
Don't worry.
I'm sure she's doing fine.

240
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,429
Where did she go
that she's not picking up?

241
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,000
My husband passed away unexpectedly,

242
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,340
so we didn't have a proper picture
to use as his funeral portrait.

243
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,110
We had to edit a group photo
and use that.

244
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:23,809
I want to take a proper one
in advance...

245
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,709
so my children won't be flustered
in such a situation.

246
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,350
You've made a wise decision.

247
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,610
It'd be good to take one in advance.

248
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,090
All right, please look here.

249
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,929
Ma'am, you have such a nice smile.

250
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,929
Everyone who comes here...

251
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:45,500
to take their funeral portrait
looks so sad.

252
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,299
What's sad about it?

253
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,439
It's good. I'm happy.

254
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,870
My late husband
will come and greet me.

255
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,169
I also have many friends
I can finally meet again.

256
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,740
We'd still be catching up...

257
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,350
even after staying up
and talking all night.

258
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,350
Go ahead and take it.

259
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,049
All right, I'll take it now.

260
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,919
My, look how adorable he is.

261
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,429
Lee Soo Yeon, that woman...

262
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,360
What if she's lost it because
I told her not to call him again?

263
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,400
She won't suddenly come back, right?

264
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,900
She abandoned her child
and left to study abroad.

265
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,400
She won't come back.

266
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,650
You look like
you've been doing well.

267
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,919
You look better than I expected.

268
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,079
Hey.

269
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,350
What's going on? Why are you here?

270
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,860
Am I not allowed to come here?

271
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:46,419
You look so flustered right now.

272
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:48,730
I mean,
what are you doing at my clinic?

273
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,400
There's nothing
for you to take here.

274
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Maeng Gong Boo.

275
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:54,229
Yes.

276
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
What?

277
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:57,840
When we got divorced,

278
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,070
I never asked for anything.

279
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,509
That apartment?

280
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,709
You voluntarily gave it up
because of your pride.

281
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,650
When it comes to our marriage,

282
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,749
I was the victim.

283
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,179
What?

284
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:13,650
Why would you
suddenly bring up the past?

285
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
No Ah...

286
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,090
I'll take No Ah back.

287
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,030
What?

288
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,090
Hey, why are you suddenly
talking about No Ah?

289
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,259
You left No Ah with me and left.

290
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,630
Hey, is No Ah a parcel or something?

291
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,199
You left him
when you didn't need him.

292
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,439
Now, you need him and want him back?

293
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,040
I've realized...

294
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,870
that I can't even live a day
without No Ah.

295
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:40,179
Are you going crazy because
you've been studying too much?

296
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:43,320
You were the one who left him
in front of my door.

297
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:46,350
That day,
I felt like I was hit by lightning.

298
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,949
How could you hide him for so long?

299
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:52,090
As if that wasn't enough,
you abandoned him.

300
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,689
I never abandoned him!

301
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,959
I just left him with you for a bit.

302
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,100
Is that so?

303
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:03,370
The pickup deadline has passed,
so you can't take him back now.

304
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,540
He's no longer a burden.

305
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,739
He's my family now.

306
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,610
Forget it.

307
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,550
Today, I just came here to say hi.

308
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,890
What?

309
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,719
You're not saying
you'll come back here again, right?

310
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:27,159
Hey, what about your training
in the US?

311
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,489
I'll see you soon.

312
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:31,229
No Ah too.

313
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,370
Hey.

314
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Hey!

315
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,939
Darn it.

317
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,249
Why didn't he come to work?

318
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,320
What is he up to?

319
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,630
- My gosh!
- Goodness.

320
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,330
- What?
- What are you doing here?

321
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,259
Hey, you were inside?

322
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,199
I thought
you didn't come to work today.

323
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,830
Well, I just needed some time
to think about something.

324
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:12,540
What's with your face?

325
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,269
Did something happen?

326
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,310
What's wrong with my face?

327
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:19,409
To comfort you,

328
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:21,580
I should be Snot Face Geon,

329
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:23,949
your perfect childhood friend.

330
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:30,659
You were always smiling like this
after you got your promotion.

331
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:32,620
Why the sad face again?

332
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,030
Hey, it hurts.

333
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,600
Smile, all right?

334
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,959
Like you always do.

335
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:40,729
Oh, come on.

336
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Are you okay?

337
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
With what?

338
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,409
I'm sorry about yesterday.

339
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,310
I couldn't even comfort you.
I only caused...

340
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,979
Hey, I'm embarrassed.

341
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,350
I let my friend see how weak I am.

342
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,790
Don't think like that.
What's embarrassing about it?

343
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,060
Did you have a talk with Ms. Audrey?

344
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
No.

345
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:10,530
I figured
it wouldn't be worth my time.

346
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,499
I don't know that person.
She's a stranger to me.

Don't waste your time
worrying about me.

If you keep doing this,
your husband will punch me again.

Goodness.

352
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,449
He can punch harder than I thought.

353
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,890
I can tell you're faking that smile.

354
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,320

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,790
What are all these balloons
doing here?

360
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,959
It's a gender reveal party
for the baby, Mother.

361
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:16,560
My goodness. Did your doctor
already tell you the baby's sex?

362
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,130
Come on. I don't need to wait
until the doctor tells me.

363
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,229
I can just have Gong Boo
take his pick.

364
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:24,969
- Right?
- Let's do it now!

365
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,169
If he picks blue,
it means I'm having a boy.

366
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:29,269
If he picks pink,
I'm having a baby girl.

367
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,580
It's that simple.

368
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,380
Must you make all this fuss?

369
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,209
Oh, boy.

370
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:36,409
What is all this?

371
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,949
Is it someone's birthday today?

372
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,150
Honey, Gong Boo.

373
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,689
Surprise!

374
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,390
What's this now?
You're making me nervous.

375
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,030
She wants to know
if she's having a daughter or son.

376
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,159
She's curious.

377
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,469
I can't tell you now.
I'll tell you later on.

378
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:58,540
What? I'm not saying
I need a straight answer from you.

379
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,939
All you have to do is
choose the color of the balloons.

380
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,409
Do you like the blue ones...

381
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,050
or the pink ones?

382
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,719
What is this? Am I choosing
the blue pill or the red pill?

383
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,719
- Come on.
- My goodness.

384
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,019
Just tell us.

385
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,890
We need to put these balloons away
before we can eat.

386
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,330
Here.

387
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,060
This color looks better on you.

388
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,300
Oh, really?

389
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,800
You're sure it's pink, right?

390
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,640
It's pink, right?

391
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:37,709
Are you that happy?

392
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:39,810
Of course, I'm so happy.

393
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:43,949
I told you about
my dream family portrait.

394
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:46,479
I thought it was too late...

395
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,519
and that I'd cut everyone else
out of that picture.

396
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:51,290
But now,
I have a fine-looking husband,

397
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,419
a son who looks like my husband,

398
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,229
and a daughter
who will look just like me.

399
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,159
Oh, my.

400
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,929
Gosh, what do I do?
I feel like I'm going to cry.

401
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,600
Still, isn't it cute
to watch them like this?

402
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,509
Cute? As if.

403
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,409
Oh, come on.

404
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:16,650
I'll see you soon.

405
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,880
No Ah too.

406
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,429
By the way, why do you act like that
with Hong Dan?

407
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:31,030
You can just go along
with what she wants.

408
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:34,830
What?
Just because I smacked Gong Boo,

409
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,130
she said to me, "Don't hit my man."

410
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,840
How cheeky of her.

411
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:40,939
I couldn't dare to talk like that
to my mother-in-law back in my day.

412
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,110
My goodness. Seriously?

413
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
You're acting like
such an old fogey.

414
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,449
I mean, you said
you hated my mother so much...

415
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,280
and that you'd never be
a mother-in-law like her.

416
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,150
Why are you worried about Gong Hee?

417
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,219
Is Gong Hee the only one
who's living with her in-laws?

418
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:58,820
Hong Dan is in the same position.

419
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,429
Am I the same as that brat,
Ssang Sook?

420
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,159
Goodness, whatever.

421
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,840
Mom isn't picking up again.

422
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,140
Maybe she went to bed early
because she was tired.

423
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,179
And where did your brother go again?
It's time for dinner.

424
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,350
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all day.

425
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,989
He's practically invisible.

426
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:29,320
He's been doing this a lot lately.

427
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:33,090
(Tiffany Alterations)

428
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:36,729
Oh, my.

429
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,929
You're here.

430
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:44,769
I actually wanted to meet with you
and discuss something.

431
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:47,810
I feel like Dan Soo
has figured something out.

432
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,469
He keeps saying weird things,

433
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:51,209
and I have a bad feeling about this.

434
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,679
Oh, my.

435
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:00,590
What... Why are you doing this?

436
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,019
Please hear me out.

437
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,259
I have sinned.

438
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:11,100
What? What do you mean
you've sinned?

439
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,499
You've been so good to me.

440
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:15,769
- Don't do this. Please get up.
- No...

441
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,999
No.

442
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,640
No.

443
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,140
Why on earth are you doing this?

444
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,610
What are you trying to say?

445
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:56,340
Mr. Gu!

446
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,880
Oh, my!

447
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:03,650
Oh, dear. Mr. Gu!

448
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,719
Mr. Gu.

449
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,749
Detective Maeng.

450
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:13,419
Stay with me.

451
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,570
Please give this to my wife for me.

452
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,009
Please do this for me.

453
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:30,239
What? But...

454
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,880
Oh, no.

455
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,820
No... Mr. Gu.

456
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:41,919
Mr. Gu!

457
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,120
No!

458
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,189
No. Mr. Gu! Don't die!

459
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:48,689
No!

460
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,800
Don't die!

461
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:02,310
I...

462
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,780
killed Mr. Gu Hae Joon.

463
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,419
I...

464
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,749
killed him.

465
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,100
(My Merry Marriage)

466
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,769
Please leave.

467
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,499
I'm sorry, Hae Joon!

468
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,739
Are you moving?

469
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:37,009
I won't be taking everything with me
to the grave.

470
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,780
- I have to eat organic food.
- He's so smart and bright.

471
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,580
Both of his parents are doctors...
Oh, my.

472
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,709
Thank you
for the food you sent in return.

473
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:45,050
Is that what your daughter said?

474
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,850
Look how cheeky she is.

475
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,489
I was going to tell you, but...

476
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:50,090
I don't want to hear it.
Let's talk when you get home.

477
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,890
That sweet girl got pushed
into marriage.

478
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,689
What if she lives an unhappy life?

479
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,330
