1
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:22,810
I...

2
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,609
I'm going to tell Dan Soo.

3
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,409
What?

4
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,989
I must tell him...

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,290
that I'm his mom.

6
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:46,000
What kind of mother does this?

7
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,529
He is my child,

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,799
but I can't even tell him
that I'm his mom.

9
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,009
I have to keep living in hiding.

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,180
At this rate,
they'll make a move first.

11
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,220
Before someone else tells Dan Soo,

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,720
I want to tell him myself...

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,960
and beg for forgiveness.

14
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,829
No, it's fine
even if he doesn't forgive me.

15
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,500
I want to embrace
his resentment too.

16
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:22,699
I am his mother.

17
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,570
I'll help you.

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,880
(Episode 55)

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,790
It's been a while since she vanished
from the hospital.

20
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,949
You still haven't found her?

21
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,259
Well, ma'am.

22
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:50,529
You found her, right?

23
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:52,160
Where is she now?

24
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,900
The thing is...

25
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:00,969
What?

26
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,440
If you have a child too,
you must know...

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,139
how any parent would feel
in this situation.

28
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:10,050
Please understand
and give me some time.

29
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,919
I promise you I'll leave
before Chairwoman Hwang finds out.

30
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,020
Give me just a little more time.
Please?

31
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,089
I think we lost her.

32
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:23,690
It seems that she has left Seoul.

33
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,630
You should've made her promise
that she'd never come back.

34
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,029
Will you let her come and go
as she pleases?

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm sorry, ma'am.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Mr. Seo.

37
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,279
How long has it been
since you started working for me?

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,010
Now that you're getting older,

39
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,680
you're losing your touch.

40
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,050
Perhaps,
you should consider retiring soon?

41
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:49,289
Yes.

42
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:57,760
I was frustrated with the situation,
so I called her here.

43
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,999
You can go.

44
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,599
Yes, ma'am.

45
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,610
Why did you want to see me,
Ms. Hwang?

46
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,980
I figured we should talk.

47
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,379
Please have a seat.

48
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,689
Ms. Kang came to see me and said...

49
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,830
she had decided
not to marry Dan Soo.

50
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,830
I beg your pardon? Ji Na said that?

51
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,830
No way. Why would she do that?

52
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,499
I guess she didn't consult you
before coming to see me.

53
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,969
Of course, she didn't.

54
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,379
Had I known about it,

55
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:46,379
I would've stopped her at all costs.

56
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,080
My gosh.
It must've really upset you.

57
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:51,619
There must have been
some kind of misunderstanding.

58
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,119
She says she has decided against it,
so what can I do?

59
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,390
Let's forget
we ever discussed this marriage.

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,189
My goodness, ma'am.

61
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,099
Please don't be like that.

62
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,960
Please don't be mad.

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,900
Ji Na is my daughter.

64
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,700
I know that girl better
than she knows herself.

65
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,610
I'm sure it was because
she got overly ambitious about work.

66
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:18,839
If it's because of
her ambition for work,

67
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,150
I will be sure to give her
everything she wants.

68
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,680
I have no intention of keeping her
holed up at home.

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,450
Of course, I know that.

70
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,849
Goodness,
why did she do such a thing?

71
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:31,490
Don't worry, ma'am.
I will be sure to talk to her.

72
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,159
Can I really leave it up to you?

73
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,629
Of course, ma'am.

74
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,159
You should set a lucky date
for their wedding,

75
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:39,729
and please wait for Ji Na.

76
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,479
Hey, it's tteokbokki.

77
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,409
You should eat while you work.

78
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,690
What's up with her?

79
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,529
Excuse me.

80
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,729
Yes?

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
How can I help you?

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,669
Oh, well...

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,479
Some pain relief patches, please.

84
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,179
My dad has a bad back.

85
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,020
That'll be four dollars.

86
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,260
Oh, please give me
some artificial tears too.

87
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,760
- That'll be seven dollars.
- So...

88
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,029
And some moisturizing cream.

89
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,669
Your total is 15 dollars.

90
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,900
Right.

91
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,380
Well...

92
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:05,419
A pregnancy test...

93
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,150
(Easy Pregnancy Test Kit)

94
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,520
That's five dollars.

95
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:14,630
- Do you need folic acid?
- Pardon?

96
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,060
Pregnant women must take folic acid.

97
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,700
Oh, I'm not pregnant.

98
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,239
Well, since you were buying
a test kit...

99
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,039
This isn't for me.

100
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,370
It's for a friend.

101
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,710
Okay.

102
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,049
You're home early.

103
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,419
Oh, yes.

104
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,419
Hey, what are you looking for?

105
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,260
Oh, some digestive medicine.

106
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,560
Gong Hee must have
some digestion issues.

107
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,799
She does?

108
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,370
But that has never happened before.

109
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:57,940
I think it's because
she's been stressed at work lately.

110
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,299
Even if that's the case, Gong Hee...

111
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,140
has fallen over,

112
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,580
bumped into things, and gotten hurt,

113
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,940
but she's not one to get sick
over small things like indigestion.

114
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,179
Well...

115
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,479
Then I should go
and prick her finger for her.

116
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:14,390
That's a quick cure
for a case of indigestion.

117
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,089
I see.

118
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,130
Please.

119
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:23,789
Please.

120
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,330
It can't be.

121
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,330
I'm sure I'm not.

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,570
I can't be.

123
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,380
No way.

124
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I am...

125
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,089
pregnant?

126
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,440
Here, let me see.

127
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:12,310
- Go on.
- What...

128
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,979
Why are you all here?

129
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,109
Oh, I went downstairs
to look for digestive medicine,

130
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,380
but your mother and grandma
got worried.

131
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,880
Yes, have a seat.

132
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,549
A prick in the finger is
the best cure for indigestion.

133
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,690
You'll feel better soon.

134
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,659
Hey, why did you do such a thing?

135
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,690
I'm fine, Grandma.

136
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,900
As if you are.

137
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,630
You're as white as a sheet.

138
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,469
- Grandma has magic hands.
- Right.

139
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,070
We should prick your finger
to get your circulation going.

140
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,599
Well...

141
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,370
You should have a seat too.

142
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,380
Goodness. Hey, give me your hand.

143
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,940
You'll feel better soon
after I prick your finger.

144
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:50,049
I went and bought some medicine.
I'm really okay, Grandma.

145
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,849
Are you sure you're okay?

146
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,189
Have you ever seen me
get an upset stomach?

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,350
My stomach is no ordinary stomach.

148
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,360
I've trained it rigorously,
you know.

149
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,559
Sure, you're right, but...

150
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,059
It's no big deal. I have to work,

151
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,500
so you should get going now. Go.

152
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,169
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

153
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,039
Goodness, I wish
you'd just let me prick your finger.

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,569
I'm totally fine.
I'll take my medicine.

155
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:15,939
- Go on.
- All right.

156
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,579
Are you really okay?

157
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,819
Please, just stop!

158
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,319
Can you stop caring about me?

159
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,689
Why do you go out of your way
to worry...

160
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,860
and get my family involved? Why?

161
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,860
Do you not know why I'm doing that?

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,630
I don't want you to be sick,

163
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,299
and I want you to be okay.

164
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know. I don't want to know.

165
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,439
And I don't want to know
how you feel either.

166
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,770
I don't feel comfortable
around you anymore.

167
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,679
Seeing you morning and night...

168
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,079
is uncomfortable and awkward.

169
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,679
So why do you keep
crossing the line?

170
00:09:58,819 --> 00:09:59,819
Does that mean...

171
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,990
I can't even take your side anymore?

172
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,059
I'm not a little kid.

173
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:06,990
Please just leave me alone!

174
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,380
Gosh, seriously...

175
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:53,740
This is between Mr. Seo and me.

176
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,470
Take this back.

177
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:27,199
Goodness. Gu Dan Soo.

178
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,309
Hey, what's with the suitcase?
Are you going somewhere?

179
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:32,579
Oh, yes.

180
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:34,880
Where are you going?

181
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,809
It's time to eat soon.

182
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,779
I'm going to go back home now.

183
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,390
To my grandma's house
where I used to live.

184
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,590
Goodness,
will you go back to her house?

185
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,159
Right, don't say that
you'll give me back my rent.

186
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,630
I gave it to you upfront
because I wanted to.

187
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,299
By the way, have you told
Gyeong Tae and Myung Ja about this?

188
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,470
They didn't seem to know.

189
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:02,909
I'll tell them some other time.

190
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,209
Goodbye.

191
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:08,150
All right. Oh, dear.

192
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,610
Goodness.

193
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Oh, boy.

194
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:25,299
I've missed this so much.

195
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,970
Not bothered by anyone else,

196
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,569
and just being alone with you.

197
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,140
We can enjoy it for our whole lives.

198
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,270
Don't get tired of it, okay?

199
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,939
You'll have to think about it
starting right now.

200
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,110
I'm the type that gets easily bored.

201
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,610
Really? But seeing how
we've been doing this...

202
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,809
for over three years,

203
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,880
- I don't think that's true.
- Well...

204
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,120
That must mean I'm addicted to you.

205
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,520
My goodness.

206
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,860
I knew it.

207
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Is it you again?

208
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,600
You should've backed off quietly...

209
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
when I explained things nicely.

210
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,199
You had to go and cause trouble?

211
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:08,569
Mom.

212
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,880
What are you doing right now?

213
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,779
And what about you?
Get your act together, will you?

214
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,279
I can't believe you've been seduced
by some lowlife.

215
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,120
Please speak with me.

216
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,449
I was going to go and see you.

217
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,189
How shameless of you.

218
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,689
Do you think I'll even meet
with the likes of you?

219
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,559
Ji Na and I...

220
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:33,429
will get married.

221
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:34,829
We won't break up anymore.

222
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,610
What do you think you're doing, Mom?

223
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,709
Do you want to see me die
from humiliation?

224
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,279
"Humiliation?"

225
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,750
Is this humiliating to you?

226
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,020
You're even more humiliating.

227
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,059
Why must you waste your time
with this good-for-nothing?

228
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,189
Tell him to leave this instant!

229
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,699
We will not break up.

230
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,069
What is this,
the love story of the century?

231
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:19,309
Shall I wait and see
when you'll let that hand go?

232
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,279
I will never let her hand go.

233
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,380
If you're not going to kick him out,

234
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,650
I'll go ahead
and say everything right here.

235
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:30,819
Can I do that?

236
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:32,919
Are you just going to
stand there like that?

237
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,459
If you won't end it...

238
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,400
until he sees you
at your lowest point...

239
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,130
Sure, okay. Let's do that.

240
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,209
Go home.

241
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,380
I'll call you.

242
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:57,909
Ji Na, you...

243
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,620
It's nothing.

244
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,720
And you shouldn't step in, Min Gi.

245
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,020
Just give us some time.

246
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,770
The two of you have no choice
but to break up anyway.

247
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,689
How far will you push this?

248
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,360
Do you want to see me
hit rock bottom?

249
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,029
"Rock bottom?"

250
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,500
You'll hit rock bottom
if you stay with him.

251
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,429
Do you need a wake-up call?

252
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,970
How far...

253
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,699
do you think you can go with him?

254
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,970
Mom,
if you're going to keep doing this,

255
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,970
I will cut all ties with you.

256
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,539
You'll cut ties with me?

257
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,480
Then how will you support yourself?

258
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,480
Both Min Gi and I have come this far
on our own.

259
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,319
You think you did it on your own?

260
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,419
Do you actually think
you've come this far...

261
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,319
without the help of Dodo Group?

262
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,620
Wake up.

263
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,289
Do you think
you can keep your job...

264
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,429
after breaking off the engagement?

265
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,529
And what about other companies?

266
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:23,230
What if Chairwoman Hwang makes sure
you can't get a job in the industry?

267
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,840
Then you'd have to do things
you don't want to do...

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,169
and curry favor with your superiors
to earn money.

269
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,169
You'll have to live
in a small rental apartment...

270
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:30,909
and struggle each month.
You want to live like that?

271
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,579
You can't,
because that's not how I raised you.

272
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,220
You can't live like that.

273
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,590
If that's something I have to endure
to be with Min Gi,

274
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:44,449
I will do it.

275
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,559
Is that so?

276
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,990
Then what about his family?

277
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,529
Do you think
his mother will be okay with it?

278
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,900
Do you think
his family will welcome you...

279
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,529
even if you're not the daughter
of the Dodo family?

280
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,199
That's right.

281
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,970
His chauffeur father
will get fired too.

282
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,970
Fine. Then go ahead
and take care of his entire family.

283
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,010
Go ahead and live like that!

284
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,140
Mom!

285
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,150
I want to marry him. Can't you
please support my decision?

286
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,079
You do not want to do this.

287
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,480
You don't even know
what you really want!

288
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,059
My gosh, Ji Na...

289
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,059
Even if you do end up marrying him,

290
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:26,699
you'll split up
in less than three months.

291
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,570
Then you will...

292
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,239
blame me for not stopping you.

293
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,499
You'll lash out at me.

294
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,509
I know you very well.

295
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,390
Well, just wait here.

296
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,199
I'll go and get him.

297
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,929
Thank you,
for letting me use this space too.

298
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:05,600
I sent Gyeong Sol somewhere,

299
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,900
so don't worry. Just wait here.

300
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:11,679
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

301
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,989
It looks like me.

302
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:26,459
Looking lonely,

303
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,259
standing there all alone.

304
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,300
I couldn't even stop him...

305
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,939
because he looked so upset.

306
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,769
I don't think it's a good thing
that he's moving back home.

307
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,540
He should've at least waited
to say goodbye to us.

308
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,140
Will he be okay there?

309
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,080
He eats two bowls of rice
at every meal.

310
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,280
He'll have to
walk on eggshells there.

311
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
He said he'd visit us later
to say goodbye.

312
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,219
What are you talking about?

313
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,759
Someone moved?

314
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:03,429
Who?

315
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,530
Dan Soo. He's moving back home.

316
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,229
He already packed up and left.

317
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,479
Hey, Dan Soo.

318
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,040
Earlier,

319
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,679
I was dealing with something,

320
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,949
so I was on edge.

321
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,419
It's not your fault.

322
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,860
It had nothing to do with you.

323
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:33,519
It's just...

324
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm just going through something.
That's all.

325
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Hey, are you listening?

326
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,249
Gu Dan Soo.

327
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,150
What is this?

328
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:23,310
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

329
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:25,939
He's not coming.

330
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,949
He won't come.

331
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,820
Who'd want to see
such an awful mother?

332
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,249
Don't cry for me

333
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:09,150
Don't be sad for me

334
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:14,090
Don't look at me like that

335
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:17,489
You look like
you've lost all meaning to life

336
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,060
That look on your face

337
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:25,939
Don't love me

338
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,640
It's too late

339
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,749
Don't wait for me with bated breath

340
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,689
Our love has come to an end

341
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:48,530
Why did you

342
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,659
Just let me leave

343
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:57,469
Had I known
I would regret it once again

344
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,120
He refused to come, didn't he?

345
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:17,890
His awful mother...

346
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,890
I'm such an awful mother.

347
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:27,759
Dan Soo moved out.

348
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:31,499
What?

349
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:36,469
I think he went back
to his grandmother's place.

350
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,280
Then it really is all over now.

351
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,550
As his mother...

352
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,189
and as a neighbor too.

353
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,919
I'll never see Dan Soo again.

354
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,300
How could this happen?

355
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:05,300
How?

356
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,040
I met him again after 20 years,

357
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,540
and we have to be separated again
like this.

358
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,479
How could this happen? How?

359
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,350
How is this possible?

360
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,650
Even so,
how could you ditch me and leave?

361
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,749
How rude.

362
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,550
Since when did you listen to me?

363
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:01,219
Where are you, Dan Soo?

364
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,850
How much time do I have left?

365
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,550
Well...

366
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:31,419
If you just control your temper,

367
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:32,919
you could live to be 100.

368
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:35,530
Mr. Seo.

369
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:37,830
We should find a new doctor.

370
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,530
All he knows...

371
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,999
is to say sweet words in my ear.

372
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,699
This man is getting old too.

373
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,140
I should get Dan Soo
to do his part...

374
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:54,840
and hand over my position to him.

375
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,409
I've been in this position
for too long.

376
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,479
My position as the chairwoman.

377
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,489
You will be all right, ma'am.

378
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,919
Forget it.

379
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,120
Don't let on to Dan Soo.

380
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,360
Pretend you know nothing.

381
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,159
I'll tell him in due time.

382
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,030
Grandma, I'm home!

383
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,939
- Go.
- Yes, ma'am.

384
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,080
What is this?
Why isn't anyone coming?

385
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,679
Weren't you waiting for me, Grandma?

386
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:33,550
Oh, goodness.

387
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,189
What brings you here at this hour?

388
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:37,489
You told me to come home.

389
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,360
I, Gu Dan Soo, am back as of today.

390
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:42,229
I came to grant Grandma's wish.

391
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:45,360
Where is she, by the way?
I want to tell her in person.

392
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:49,630
Oh, she just fell asleep.

393
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,169
Even if someone
were to shake her awake...

394
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:52,499
or carry her away,
she wouldn't know.

395
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,239
Oh, that's fine.

396
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
What?

397
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:14,519
Of course. You wouldn't go anywhere.

398
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,330
Hey, did you...

399
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,340
It wasn't him.

400
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,870
Yes, this is it.

401
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,600
A bed should be big and cozy,
indeed.

402
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,949
It was such a bother...

403
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,610
to get up and turn off the lights
each time too.

404
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,749
Civilization is a great thing.

405
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:21,060
Oh, good.

406
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,280
I'm comfortable, for sure.

407
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,979
So why am I like this?

408
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:51,350
Will Gong Hee be okay...

409
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:53,560
on her own?

410
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,019
(My Merry Marriage)

411
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:22,290
Grandma, we will bow to you.

412
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,219
Live happily on your own.

413
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,019
- Gosh, of course.
- Oh, my.

414
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:27,360
If you get divorced twice...

415
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,860
Why are you saying
such a ridiculous thing?

416
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,330
Who are you?

417
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:33,659
How could you leave like that
without saying anything?

418
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,130
Why would you skip work too?

419
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:39,169
There's someone I don't want
to run into for the time being.

420
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:41,269
Who on earth is it
for him to act this way?

421
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,110
