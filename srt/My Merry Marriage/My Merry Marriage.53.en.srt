1
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,919
Why don't you...

2
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:26,130
just stay here?

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,129
Oh, I haven't seen that ring before.

4
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:32,799
Oh, this.

5
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,670
It's a meaningful ring to me.

6
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,610
But I had a bit of a situation,
so I couldn't wear it.

7
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:42,610
I guess
someone gave it to you as a gift.

8
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:44,909
Yes, someone.

9
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,119
Someone who is very cool...

10
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,990
and has a big heart.

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,789
Dan Soo.

12
00:00:58,529 --> 00:00:59,630
You remind me of that person.

13
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,660
I remind you of that person?

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,999
Then he must be very handsome.

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,539
May I ask you who this person is?

16
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,249
Dan Soo, you must be really popular
among women.

17
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:19,350
Is it that obvious?

18
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:22,920
My gosh.
My popularity knows no bounds.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,160
But why is it
that she won't fall for my charms?

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,729
To be honest,

21
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,259
I didn't come here
to talk to you about my grandmother.

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,330
I told Maeng Gong Hee
how I really feel about her.

23
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,839
My gosh, really?

24
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,110
She rejected me without hesitation.

25
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,110
So, she's awkward around me now.

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
She keeps avoiding me.

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,149
That's why I'm even more torn.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,649
Maybe I really should move out.

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
Dan Soo.

30
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,160
Don't be like that.
Just wait patiently.

31
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,589
They say
there's a right time for everything.

32
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,030
Some are destined to part ways,

33
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,000
while some are meant to meet again.

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,869
Everything is predetermined,

35
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,470
but everyone struggles
because it's not the right time yet.

36
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,100
Dan Soo.

37
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,679
Your time will come too.

38
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,410
I'm sure of it.

39
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,479
Do you think so?

40
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,549
I hope you're right.

41
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,519
Yes.

42
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,620
For you...

43
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,519
and me both.

44
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,729
The right time will come. Trust me.

45
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,479
Gong Hee gave it to me
and said to use it...

46
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,910
to help you
with your wedding expenses.

47
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,949
I think it's about 2,000 dollars.

48
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,680
Oh, my. Everyone is so kind to us.

49
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,590
How modest.

50
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,019
So modest.

51
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,759
And this right here.

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,400
I terminated my insurance.

53
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,269
But it's not much.

54
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,400
I gathered
all the money I could get.

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,139
It's about 3,500 dollars.

56
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,199
My, I will gladly accept this.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,569
How little and precious.

58
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,139
So little.

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,979
Thanks.

60
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,449
He was greatly hurt
by his first marriage.

61
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,060
I never thought
he'd want to get married again.

62
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,329
I'm truly grateful you helped him...

63
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,090
change his mind.

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,470
I had a lonely life.

65
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,739
I'm really happy that
I finally have a family, Mother.

66
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,269
I will also consider you
as another daughter of mine.

67
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,180
Thank you.

68
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,810
Even so, you're not allowed
to barge in on us whenever you want.

69
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,350
Gosh, stop it.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,220
If you want to drop off food for us,

71
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,789
there are many ways you can do it.

72
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,789
Leave it at the security office,
or use the delivery service.

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Stop.

74
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,729
Hong Dan, don't worry.

75
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,460
I'm not the type of mother-in-law...

76
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,199
who visits without any notice.

77
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,560
Oh, I'm not worried.

78
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,169
My goodness.
Visit us without any notice?

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,199
You surely shouldn't do that.

80
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,940
I get that it's not a lot of money,

81
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,410
but she won't even thank me?

82
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,609
And what's wrong with me
visiting my son's place?

83
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,350
I brought it up
without thinking much.

84
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,280
She could've just told me
to visit anytime.

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,689
It's a good thing
that she's not pretentious,

86
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,619
but it won't hurt to act coy
at times.

87
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,520
I don't like her one bit.

88
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,129
Gosh, Mother.

89
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,799
I don't plan to live...

90
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:58,970
under the same roof as my in-laws,
with a once-married man.

91
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,470
Let's live as far away...

92
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,809

What is it? What's wrong?

101

It is you, Ms. Eom!

102
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,970

the wrong bridal room.

103

You're too good for Maeng Gong Boo.

107
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:50,179
Shall I do that?

108
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,489
Will you hold my hand...

109
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,559
and run away with me?

110
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,429

111
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,859
You look like a real bride
in that dress.

112
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,600
They say every bride is beautiful.
It must be true.

113
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,169
I'm jealous.

114
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,770
You should get married too, Yoo Ra.

115

Oh, remember you promised
to catch my bouquet today?

116

You have to throw it to me
at pinpoint, okay?

117

But you still came.

120
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:30,960

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,499
Myung Ja. Congratulations!

182
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,509
It's a relief that...

183
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,409
your eldest son is getting married.

184
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,409
Thanks.

185
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,509
I didn't invite you.
Why are you here?

186
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,720
I came because of Gyeong Tae.

187
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,680
Gyeong Tae's eldest son
is getting married.

188
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,550
Of course, I should be here
as his sweet friend.

189
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,259
"Sweet friend?"

190
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,489
Did you invite her, honey?

191
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,960
It's a happy occasion
for Gyeong Tae's family.

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,129
Must I be invited to be here?
That's so cold.

193
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,800
Gyeong Tae.
Aren't you happy to see me?

194
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,369
She must've lost her mind.

195
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,340
Stop being silly.
Leave after the meal.

196
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,210
Do you have to ruin this happy day?

197
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,479
Hey, am I some evil spirit or what?

198
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,680
- Enough. Let's go inside.
- Gosh, come on.

199
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,119
- Goodness. Cut her some slack.
- What's her problem?

200
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,979
Gyeong Tae. I'm here.

201
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,649
- My gosh, Detective An.
- Congratulations.

202
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,759
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

203
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,930
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Myung Ja.

204
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,960
- This really is no joke.
- Is it?

205
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm all over the place.

206
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,670
Once is more than enough.

207
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,940
- Finally, he's getting hitched.
- That's right.

208
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Oh, my.

209
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,009
What?

210
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,409
It's good to see you.

211
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
- What?
- You scared me.

212
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,609
Hey, what's with your face?
Did you put on something?

213
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,320
No, nothing at all.

214
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,590
My skin has always been fair
like a peach.

215
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,190
And my cheeks are always rosy,
you know.

216
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,830
Gyeong Tae, aren't I right?

217
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,090
No.

218
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,560
You look sick, in the head.

219
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,269
It was a long way here, right?

220
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,940
Have you been well?

221
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

222
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,720
- Dan Soo.
- Oh, hi.

223
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,779
You made it.

224
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,889
Isn't this job tough?

225
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,519
You may not believe me,

226
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,889
but I used to handle big money.

227
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:01,629
Someone upright like me
should handle money.

228
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,869
Why do you look so pretty today?

229
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,570
Stop being silly.

230
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,109
When will they be here?

231
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,540
The wedding ceremony
will soon begin.

232
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Guests, please take your seat.

233
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,450
The bride and the groom
will enter now.

234
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,119
Bride and groom, please enter.

235
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:34,999
How pretty!

236
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,600
If I lose my footing and stagger,

237
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,139
you have to hold me tight, okay?

238
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,700
Why is the almighty Eom Hong Dan
so nervous?

239
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,670
I didn't think I'd get nervous.

240
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,879
But I'm a nervous wreck right now.

241
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:51,749
By the way,
do we really have to get married?

242
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,080
What are you saying now?

243
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,850
I had another nightmare last night.

244
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,279
It was about serving
in the military twice.

245
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,249
Would you like to get beaten up
by your bride at your wedding?

246
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,759
Can't you just hold my hand tight?

247
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:10,460
Before the groom walks down
with the bride while holding hands,

248
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,129
let's have him shout...

249
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,040
how happy he is today.

250
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,070
Shout with all your might!

251
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,580
I want...

252
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,649
to go back!

253
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,850
What was that?

254
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,889
- Seriously.
- Nice one.

255
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,019
He's in trouble now.

256
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,389
- Goodness.
- What?

257
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,389
Good grief.

258
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,889
What was that about?

259
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:42,899
What was that?

260
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:45,729
That little...

261
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,800
- That fool.
- Go back, where?

262
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,210
How embarrassing.

263
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,909
- It's okay.
- No, don't mind him.

264
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,210
Doors are closing.

265
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,019
(We're getting married.)

266
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:30,710
"One. Maeng Gong Boo will only love
Eom Hong Dan forever."

267
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:35,350
"Two. Maeng Gong Boo will obey
Eom Hong Dan no matter what."

268
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,550
"I, Eom Hong Dan,
sternly warn Maeng Gong Boo..."

269
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,759
"that he will not be forgiven
if he violates any of the above."

270
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:46,989
"And I, Eom Hong Dan,
promise that I will do my best..."

271
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:50,759
"to protect our love
and our marriage."

272
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,899
"From time to time, I will cook
your favorite dishes for you."

273
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,940
"I will do my best to make sure
that you can end your day..."

274
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,109
"with a smile on your face."

275
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,909
"Your forever life partner,
Eom Hong Dan."

276
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,359
"I, Maeng Gong Boo,"

277
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,229
"will love and respect
Eom Hong Dan..."

278
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,989
"in plenty and in want,"

279
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,399
"in joy and in sorrow,
in sickness and in health."

280
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,700
Here are my additional vows.

281
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
"First."

282
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:30,170
"I will quit drinking
and start exercising regularly..."

283
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,609
"to improve my strength
and stamina..."

284
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:35,239
"so that we can enjoy
some passionate nights!"

285
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,739
Nice!

286
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,210
- Very cool.
- Go for it!

287
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,609
Let's see
how long you can keep up with it.

288
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:41,420
- "Second."
- Good luck!

289
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,220
- "Three times a month,"
- That fool.

290
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,749
"I will take care of
all the house chores..."

291
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:46,489
"so my bride can fully rest."

292
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,759
"For three days of each month,"

293
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,889
"I will be her faithful servant."

294
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,029
I am at your command, ma'am!

295
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,800
How romantic!

296
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,330
"I will keep these vows
deeply engraved in my heart..."

297
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,629
"and will always stay..."

298
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,170
"by Eom Hong Dan's side."

299
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,970
"Together, we will build..."

300
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:17,350
My gosh. Did I eat something bad?

301
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,090
Why do I feel so queasy?

302
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:25,989
Bride and groom.

303
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,800
Put your marriage
before anything else.

304
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,060
Even before your parents
and children.

305
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,970
Your spouse comes first.

306
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:35,940
"You're always right."

307
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,570
"Oh, my. You look so dashing today."
Like this.

308
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,580
Listen up.

309
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,810
Give compliments
to boost each other's confidence.

310
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,050
- He's funny.
- That's my advice for you.

311
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,379
Last but not least,

312
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,720
here's my advice for the bride,

313
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,389
which is like my gift to you.

314
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,259
Bride, even if your husband...

315
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,489
does something silly
from time to time,

316
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,560
don't scold him harshly.

317
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,470
- I'll be right back.
- As I've always said to you,

318
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,700
try to nag him...

319
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:11,869
in a polite manner
to help and guide him.

320
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,249
(Restroom)

321
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:22,649
Why are you out here
instead of watching the ceremony?

322
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,249
I was collecting cash gifts
for them.

323
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,149
It looked like I'd already missed
all the important parts.

324
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,960
Anyway, why did you
suddenly run out of there?

325
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,129
I thought something happened.

326
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,060
Oh, it's nothing.

327
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,560
My stomach is a little upset.

328
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,269
I thought you could digest anything
and everything.

329
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:41,869
Well, should I step out
and pick up some antacids for you?

330
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,440
No, it's fine. I'm okay now.

331
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,239
Gong Hee.

332
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Thank you for coming, Mr. Seo.

333
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,550
Of course, I should be here.

334
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,129
Can you give us some privacy?

335
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,359
Am I...

336
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:12,369
crossing the line...

337
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
by just standing here now?

338
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:35,419
Are you all right?

339
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,429
You don't look so well.

340
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,090
Are you feeling sick?

341
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,100
I believe
showing interest like this...

342
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,830
is inappropriate if you only
think of me as a co-worker.

343
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,570
Thank you for rooting for me
as my co-worker,

344
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,510
but please do not show
too much interest.

345
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,480
Okay, I'm sorry.

346
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:04,480
Don't apologize to me.

347
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:06,290
Come to think of it,

348
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,090
it wasn't solely your mistake.

349
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,760
I misunderstood your intention,

350
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,129
so I made a mistake too.

351
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,429
Stop looking at me
as if you pity me.

352
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,639
It makes me so uncomfortable.

353
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm doing great.

354
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,179
Thank you again for coming today.

355
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,010
Applause!

356
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,419
Darling, I love you

357
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,179
My love

358
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,719
- You are
- Only you!

359
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,260
The only one for me

360
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,230
I love you, honey

361
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,500
- Oh, my.
- A life without you

362
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,800
What a lovely couple.

363
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,340
- Is completely
- Nice!

364
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,199
Meaningless

365
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,080
It is so odd.

366
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,679
I'm talking about Ji Na.

367
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,649
Why do you think
she suddenly changed her mind?

368
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:48,959
Look into it.

369
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,629
Find out
if she's seeing another man.

370
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,490
When a woman changes her mind
like this,

371
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,260
it's always because of another man.

372
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,570
But we can't be sure
that she has another man...

373
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,570
There's another man involved.

374
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,040
I'm sure of it.

375
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:08,280
She's smart.
The reason she suddenly lost...

376
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,879
her rational thinking
and is being like this.

377
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,980
She has another man.
It's the only reason.

378
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,709
We should be expediting
the wedding...

379
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,580
and making sure
Dan Soo moves back home,

380
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,350
but Ji Na is causing trouble now.

381
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,459
I must know
why Ji Na is doing this...

382
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,389
and who this guy is.

383
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:27,929
Find out.

384
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,959
I will teach them a lesson.

385
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,129
Yes, ma'am.

386
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,270
All right.
We'll take the picture now.

387
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,909
Sir, could you move closer?
Yes, that's better.

388
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,379
I see that she's ready
to catch the bouquet.

389
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,649
All right.
When the bride tosses the bouquet,

390
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,449
- please give her a big hand.
- Okay.

391
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,619
Okay, throw it
on the count of three.

392
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:51,719
Catch it.

393
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,250
One, two, three!

394
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,060
- What?
- What?

395
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,530
- Gong Hee caught it?
- What happened?

396
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,030
- Hey, Gong Hee caught it.
- Nice.

397
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,800
- She should get married.
- Hey!

398
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,030
Oh, no.

399
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,969
What is this?

400
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,540
Gong Hee,
I can't believe you caught it.

401
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,780
Well, I guess my sister-in-law
is getting married next.

402
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:19,379
What?

403
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,919
- We can collect cash gifts again?
- What?

404
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,679
Hey, Dan Soo. We'll need you
at the cash gift booth again.

405
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,219
No way. I won't do it.

406
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,560
Find someone else.

407
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,230
Okay, we'll take it again.

408
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:34,889
Look at the camera.

409
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,740
Honey, what is it?

410
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
What?

411
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
One moment.

412
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,409
Where are you going?

413
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,209
We have to take our picture!

414
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,280
(Groom: The son of Maeng Gyeong Tae
and Kang Myung Ja, Maeng Gong Boo)

415
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,250
(Groom Maeng Gong Boo,
Bride Eom Hong Dan)

416
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:01,990
Was I mistaken?

417
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,090
Yes, there's no way she came.

418
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:08,129
Maeng Gong Boo.

419
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,679
What are you doing here?

420
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:26,510
You must be flustered
since you never invited me.

421
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:29,050
I came to congratulate you.

422
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,949
Congratulations.

423
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,689
I can give you a hug, right?

424
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,429
Hey.

425
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,669
- What are you doing?
- Oh, sorry.

426
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,840
It must've gotten caught
in my button.

427
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,740
How did you find me here?

428
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,810
I can find out anything
if I set my mind to it.

429
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,810
Hey, you...

430
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:03,580
Who attends
their ex-husband's wedding?

431
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,290
That's why I'm leaving quietly.

432
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,090
But you chased after me.

433
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,919
Oh, right.
I'll soon send you a gift...

434
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,830
to congratulate you.

435
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:15,330
I don't need a gift.

436
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,030
How have you been?

437
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,669
You blocked my number
and broke off all contact.

438
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,469
All I heard was that
you transferred to a local hospital.

439
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,240
Your wedding isn't over yet.
Am I wrong?

440
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
Go back inside.

441
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,340
Your bride must be waiting.

442
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,270
You two are now in the same boat.

443
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,570
Paddle hard together, okay?

444
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,639
It's a small boat that will wobble
if even one side misses.

445
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,409
Make sure to work together
to paddle forth. Got it?

446
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:02,480
Okay, Grandma.

447
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,639
Thank you.

448
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:07,209
Gosh, my sweetheart.

449
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,780
Goodness.

450
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:17,060
Everyone, thank you.

451
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,530
We'll have fun.

452
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,790
- Have a safe trip.
- Yes.

453
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,859
Enjoy, okay?

454
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,500
Always be safe
and take care of yourself.

455
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,929
Yes, and have
the most romantic night.

456
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:30,399
Of course.
We'll have a steamy night.

457
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,510
- My goodness.
- Oh, dear.

458
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,679
- Steamy hot.
- You, come with me.

459
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,310
I'll make your back
as hot as highway blacktop.

460
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,719
I was just giving him a massage.

461
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,260
Does it feel good?

462
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,959
You had a long day.

463
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,260
- A massage.
- I see.

464
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,500
She gives me a message
every single day.

465
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,730
It's hitting the spot.

466
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,300
Goodness.
The wedding was too small in size.

467
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:05,369
But the ceremony was fun.

468
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,510
You call that fun?

469
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,679
It lacked class.

470
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:15,480
Mother, we chose
this wedding hall at a hotel.

471
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,619
Would you like to have a look?

472
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,649
Gosh, why would I?

473
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:20,850
It's your wedding.

474
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,060
It's yours to look at.

475
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,419
But you have great taste, Mother.

476
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:26,760
And this wedding isn't just for us.

477
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:29,159
The family elders
will make the venue look classier.

478
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:30,899
Is that so?

479
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,129
My goodness.
Will it be held at a hotel?

480
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,570
Of course.

481
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,439
Only then is it not embarrassing
to invite guests.

482
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:39,909
That's what I'm talking about.

483
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,240
You're fine with it, right?

484
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,750
Mother likes it too.

485
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:48,449
As long as you two
are happy with it,

486
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
I'm in.

487
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,219
I rarely say this,
but don't you think...

488
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,389
Min Gi would make
the best husband in the world?

489
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,859
I only approved this marriage
because it's you, Ji Na.

490
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,600
My son is so amazing.

491
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,030
Anything less than this...

492
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,530
does not meet our standards.

493
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,969
Luxurious.

494
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:13,669
Gorgeous.

495
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,139
It's right up my street.

496
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,580
Oh, boy.

497
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:23,480
It really isn't easy
to marry off your children.

498
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,020
People come in crowds.

499
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,790
There are many important guests
to take care of.

500
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,050
Goodness.

501
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,490
At least
you got a load off your chest.

502
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,060
She's right.
Now that Gong Boo is married,

503
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,959
you've got nothing to worry about.

504
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,730
Remember you said the same thing
when Gong Boo...

505
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,169
- married Soo Yeon five years ago?
- Right.

506
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:41,070
I thought I'd be done
once he got married.

507
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,639
Gong Boo will do better, Mom.
Don't worry.

508
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:46,510
Gong Hee is right.
The wedding went well.

509
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,409
I'll go home tomorrow.

510
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,439
How come, Mom?

511
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,649
Leave after you see Gong Boo...

512
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:54,379
when he comes back
from his honeymoon.

513
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:57,379
No, Grandma.
Stay a little longer, okay?

514
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:58,379
Please do that.

515
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,290
If you leave,
Myung Ja will be really upset.

516
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,490
I don't need to see them again.

517
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,959
I already saw them at their wedding.

518
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,560
Why do you think about leaving...

519
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,959
the minute you're at my house, Mom?

520
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,000
You don't need to work
in your garden anymore.

521
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,469
Come on, Mom.

522
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:13,469
My goodness.

523
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,669
Myung Ja has changed.

524
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,399
The older she gets,
the more stubborn she becomes.

525
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,139
I take after you, Mom.

526
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,179
Was the meal at the wedding hall
a bit greasy?

527
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,780
Auntie. Do we have
soy sauce marinated crab?

528
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,209
- Soy sauce marinated crab? We do.
- Yes.

529
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:31,149
I was craving it too. Hold on.

530
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,790
Is Dad having dinner over there?

531
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,219
He didn't have to take...

532
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,919
the family elders to Uncle's place.

533
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,590
Dad must not want to part with them.

534
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,990
And he must've wanted
to treat them too.

535
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,669
She's right. They congratulated
Gong Boo on his second marriage...

536
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,629
because Gyeong Tae...

537
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:50,000
takes such good care of them.

538
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,040
But they get into a fight
whenever they get together.

539
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:54,469
I wonder
if they'll let him off easily today.

540
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:55,780
I can't help but feel anxious.

541
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,280
Here. It's soy sauce marinated crab
that I, Maeng Gyeong Bok,

542
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,980
- made with all my heart.
- Yes.

543
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:04,919
Would you like to try it?

544
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:05,919
Let's have a look.

545
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:07,649
- Ta-da.
- Oh, my.

546
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:08,649
Nice.

547
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,740
(My Merry Marriage)

548
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,740
Gyeong Tae. Your mother said,

549
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,909
"My son is suffering..."

550
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:35,520
"because he married
the wrong woman."

551
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,719
You had crossed the line back then.

552
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:39,919
You shouldn't have made
my mother-in-law...

553
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,550
get down on her knees!

554
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,159
What did you say?

555
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:45,159
You're amazing, Gong Hee.

556
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,859
You're in contact with Holly?

557
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,929
I'm going to tell Dan Soo.

558
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,169
I must tell him that I'm his mom.

559
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,369
