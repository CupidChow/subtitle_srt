1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,280
I'll make myself clear
right here and now.

3
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,080
I'm strong enough without you.

4
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,080
And now,

5
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,250
I will choose my own path
to protect myself.

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,250
So...

7
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,460
I refuse the responsibility
that you speak of, Seo Min Gi.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,589
You didn't protect me,

9
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,460
and I have absolutely no intention
of falling apart by your side.

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,170
Let's get divorced.

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,750
Let's not do this
in front of the elders.

12
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,090
We'll talk in private.

13
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:12,219
It doesn't matter
where or when we talk.

14
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,590
I won't change my mind.

15
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,759
What about our baby
who has already been born?

16
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,299
Don't use Momo just so you can say
you'll take responsibility.

17
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:19,859
It's despicable.

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,239
Gong Hee, what does this all mean?

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,040
Something must've happened
between you two.

20
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,409
Hey, tell us!

21
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,079
What is it?

22
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,540
Why is she acting like this?

23
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:36,609
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,319
I think we should discuss this first
in private.

25
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,019
You're being too emotional
right now.

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,890
Let's talk again when you're calm.

27
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,659
I'm too emotional?

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,430
You kept saying I was too sensitive
while I was pregnant,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,469
and you're still saying
the same thing.

30
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,930
No.

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,640
I've never been emotional
about this.

32
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,269
All I did was endure things
with Momo the whole time.

33
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:01,640
And now,

34
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,480
I'm more rational than ever.

35
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,409
I'll be going for now.

36
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,549
I apologize for intruding so late.

37
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,950
Hey, you can't leave just like that.

38
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,659
Explain everything before you go!

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,829
Just let him go.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Oh, gosh.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Gong Hee.

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,009
Are you all right?

43
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,849
Oh, my. What is all this about?

44
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,250
Hey, why did you just let him go?

45
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,090
He has something to hide,
doesn't he?

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,389
I'll explain everything.

47
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,930
My gosh.

48
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,680
I was wondering when you'd stop by.

49
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,879
And here we are.

50
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:16,949
Did you finish everything...

51
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,449
you had to do in France?

52
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,889
Of course. Why drag things out?

53
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,620
It's better
to get things done quickly.

54
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,759
Unlike someone,

55
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,520
I don't take months
to wrap up a single project.

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,860
A project I had practically finished
before my departure, at that.

57
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,330
There were things
that required careful consideration.

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,030
I shouldn't decide things
on a whim like you do.

59
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,569
Decide things on a whim?

60
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:38,669
Isn't that what you've been doing,
Seo Min Gi?

61
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,469
Both at work and at home?

62
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,379
Have you heard something?

63
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:46,009
Why?

64
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,509
Do you feel guilty about something?

65
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,849
Did you get Gong Hee worked up
about something?

66
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,550
Like telling her to get divorced
and stay with her family?

67
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:58,960
So, you're saying Gong Hee...

68
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,289
is back home now, right?

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,030
And she asked you for a divorce.

70
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,199
Don't act like you don't know.

71
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:07,930
Are you saying
it's a coincidence that...

72
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,469
you shortened a year-long work trip
to a few months?

73
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,569
And especially
while this is going on?

74
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,909
You'll find out...

75
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,439
if it's a coincidence or not.

76
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,439
But...

77
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,449
unlike someone,

78
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,310
I don't trick people
and act shamelessly.

79
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,520
You're fooling
everyone around you...

80
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:26,280
for your love of the century.

81
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,050
You don't even care to consider...

82
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,860
how you're hurting other people.

83
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,430
That finally answers my questions.

84
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,259
She isn't one to ask for a divorce
over something like this.

85
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,300
And this must be the reason
you returned from France so soon.

86
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,449
So,

87
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,519
there was a woman
Seo Min Gi used to date,

88
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,750
but he kept seeing her
even after you two got married?

89
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,759
My gosh.

90
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,430
It's the woman I saw
when I went to your house.

91
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,160
Your manager or something.

92
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,529
Am I right?

93
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,430
Oh, dear. You mean that sly fox
who came to our shop?

94
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,899
Hong Dan also said...

95
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,339
she was suspicious
of that woman and Seo Min Gi.

96
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,779
My gosh.
I didn't want to believe it, but...

97
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,410
Oh, dear.

98
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,189
- Oh, boy.
- Goodness, what do we do?

99
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,819
Seo Min Gi
or whatever his name is...

100
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,060
He looks like
a skinny dried-up fish.

101
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,360
And he's utterly shameless too.

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,829
How could he do such a thing?

103
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:44,029
Hey, Maeng Ggong.

104
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,600
Why did you let him
get away with it until now?

105
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,199
You know what people say.

106
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,230
"Marry carefully
and divorce quickly."

107
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,199
If he seemed unlikely to change
and like a bad guy,

108
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,040
you should've divorced him
as soon as you could.

109
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,970
I knew you'd all be upset like this.

110
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,040
I thought it would be okay...

111
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,579
if I just endured it on my own.

112
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,750
But I was wrong,
even for Momo's sake.

113
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,490
I shouldn't have done this.

114
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,360
Hey, there are some things
you should never endure, you fool.

115
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,199
I'm sure she was trying
to make things work...

116
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,269
in case it hurt her parents.

117
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,839
Goodness, Gong Hee.
You've been through so much.

118
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,339
You couldn't even tell us
until now...

119
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,310
or come to visit us at home.

120
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,310
You've had to suffer
so much heartache on your own.

121
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,889
I should've thought more carefully
before I decided to get married.

122
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,230
I regret...

123
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:50,129
my decision from back then.

124
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:53,459
I wasn't able
to look into my own heart.

125
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,699
I was swept along
by everyone's expectations...

126
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,139
and thought
that was what I should do.

127
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,980
I wanted you to see me
living a happy life.

128
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,610
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,910
What are you saying?

130
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,750
Why should you be sorry?

131
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,319
Just blame your parents instead.

132
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,149
Ask why we left you there
on your own...

133
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,850
and why we pushed you
into a marriage you didn't want...

134
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,759
and had to hurt you like this.

135
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,899
Goodness.

136
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Maeng Ggong.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's been a while.

138
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,269
You didn't forget
what I looked like...

139
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,939
because we were apart
for a few months, right?

140
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Come here.

141
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:15,980
Let's see how tall you've gotten.

142
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,930
When did you get here?
You didn't even let me know.

143
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:35,899
It's been a few days.

144
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:37,769
You seemed...

145
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:39,870
to have a lot going on.

146
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,439
I should ask you
if you've been doing well,

147
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,279
but I ran into Seo Min Gi
out front...

148
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,550
and heard what was going on.

149
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,680
Why do you always show up
in these situations?

150
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,049
Gosh, I knew I wanted
to come back sooner for some reason.

151
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,419
So, I worked really hard.

152
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,659
You know
how I don't like to work so hard.

153
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,289
But I even pulled all-nighters.

154
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,629
Maybe I knew Maeng Ggong
would be here like this.

155
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,269
I'll go inside and get some rest.

156
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:15,340
It's not your fault.

157
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
I know...

158
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,340
that you tried your best.

159
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:23,309
So,

160
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,049
don't beat yourself up and suffer.

161
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,740
Stop crying.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,470
I'm going to make...

163
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,279
the people who hurt you...

164
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,480
regret what they did.

165
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Hey.

166
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,990
You're home.

167
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,389
Are you done with the work trip?

168
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,730
And what on earth
is this girl doing?

169
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:43,460
Gosh, she packed her bags
and went to her parents' house,

170
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,929
but she kept saying
such strange things.

171
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,399
Did she discuss things with you?

172
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,299
The baby is still in the hospital.

173
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:51,940
Let's talk about this later.

174
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,240
What is going on, though?

175
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,039
She didn't move out for good,
did she?

176
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,710
Why, that little...

177
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,850
Will you please stop?

178
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,450
Gong Hee is...

179
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:04,580
asking for a divorce.

180
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,480
Don't make things any worse.

181
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:08,690
A divorce?

182
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,960
Who gave her the right
to ask for a divorce?

183
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,629
Was she that upset
about going to the hospital alone?

184
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,960
What a ridiculous girl.

185
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,799
- What in the world did I just hear?
- Oh, no.

186
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,600
Well, Gong Hee...

187
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,039
packed her bags and left
without discussing it with us.

188
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,309
Min Gi said she asked for a divorce.

189
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,940
I can't believe this.

190
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,610
What on earth did you do...

191
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,250
that she's saying
she wants a divorce?

192
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,250
Now that your baby has been born,

193
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,750
your family should be your priority!

194
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,049
Come on. What did he even do wrong?

195
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,220
Is it wrong that...

196
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,559
- he's been working hard...
- That's enough.

197
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,730
I already have a lot on my mind.

198
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,659
Why, that brat...

199
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,529
My goodness.

200
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:57,440
Oh, dear. What if they actually
end up getting a divorce?

201
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,500
What do we do?

202
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,340
You should've been good to her
before she packed up and left.

203
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,710
These days, no one...

204
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,970
picks on their daughter-in-law
like you did.

205
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,820
What? Gong Hee didn't even
have anything to put up with.

206
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,190
I've been putting up with so much.

207
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,490
I've done so much for her.

208
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:18,590
How dare she bring up divorce?

209
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,090
My gosh. What should we do?

210
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,830
Seriously.

211
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,629
What should we do
about this situation?

212
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,129
(Ji Na)

213
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,409
Marriage is about
taking responsibility.

214
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,710
What more do you need?

215
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,080
You should meet with Ssang Sook.

216
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,379
We should hurry up
and pick a date for their wedding!

217
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,389
Dad, what is with you?

218
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:26,389
Oh, dear.

219
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,690
My gosh.

220
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,759
I'm so angry
that I can't even sleep.

221
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,330
Honey, you can sleep now?

222
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,470
We knew...

223
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,039
Min Gi was practically engaged
to someone.

224
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,210
Ssang Sook...

225
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,940
kept bragging about how her son
would marry into a wealthy family.

226
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,779
I knew all about it,

227
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,149
yet I forced Gong Hee...

228
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,149
to marry him.

229
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,450
Min Gi said he'd totally end things
with the other woman...

230
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,789
and take responsibility,
and I believed him.

231
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,629
That was a mistake.

232
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,960
We shouldn't have done that.

233
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,000
Gong Hee,

234
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,730
that sweet girl,

235
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,169
wanted to make her parents happy,

236
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:13,299
so she let us force her
into this marriage.

237
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,710
Surrounded by hurdles,

238
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,980
she decided to just embrace it all.

239
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,610
With the baby in her womb,

240
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,850
she must've been so heartbroken
all alone.

241
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:30,389
Think about how stressed and hurt
she must've been.

242
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,259
This is all our fault.

243
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,929
What is Gong Hee going to do now?

244
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,700
What should she do now?

245
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,039
Oh, dear.

246
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,370
Maeng Gong Hee, are you up?

247
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:24,809
Maeng Gong Hee.

248
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,610
Hey, Maeng Gong Hee!

249
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,350
You're okay, right?

250
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,279
I'm going to open the door.

251
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,669
At the hospital,

252
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,309
she probably couldn't really have
any seaweed soup all by herself.

253
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,879
She had no one.

254
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,409
She gave birth all by herself...

255
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,149
and had seaweed soup alone.

256
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,019
When I think about that, I feel...

257
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,860
I know. I was so upset and angry...

258
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,289
that I couldn't sleep a wink.

259
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,090
We have to make sure...

260
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
Gong Hee eats well from now on.

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,230
Hold on, Gong Hee...

262
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,600
She used to love marinated crab.

263
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,539
She just gave birth,

264
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,309
so she should stay away
from spicy, salty foods.

265
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,009
All right, then...

266
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,980
Then should I pick up some trotters
and boil them?

267
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,019
It'll make breastfeeding easier,
you know?

268
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:43,320
Oh, no.
Her baby is still in the hospital,

269
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,759
so she can't breastfeed her baby.

270
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,960
What am I saying?

271
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Mom.

272
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,929
Mom, Hong Dan is on the phone.

273
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,129
- What?
- Okay.

274
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,029
Mother.

275
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,000
Look how much
my Ssook Ssook has grown.

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,169
How adorable.

277
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,710
Yes, she looks like an angel.

278
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:06,309
Hong Dan, are you feeling all right?

279
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,980
Yes, of course.

280
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,409
I'll take good care of myself here
to recover quickly...

281
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,179
so I can go home soon, Mother.

282
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,350
Breastfeed her, okay?

283
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,190
It's better for the baby...

284
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,820
and for you as well.

285
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,019
Yes, I am breastfeeding her.

286
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,190
Mother, I can't wait...

287
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,029
to have your seaweed soup.

288
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:27,130
I already cooked a batch for you.

289
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,869
I'll make sure
Gong Boo brings it over to you.

290
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,200
Mother.

291
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,900
You must be really upset.

292
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,869
I heard about
what Gong Hee is going through.

293
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,180
You know,

294
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:44,480
even if Gong Hee gets chewed out
at work,

295
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,079
she lets it go and comes to work
with a smile the next day.

296
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,920
That's how strong she is.

297
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:52,660
So, don't worry too much.
And besides,

298
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,059
divorce is no big deal.

299
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,759
Hey, honey.

300
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,200
I'll be there as soon as
I drop No Ah off at daycare.

301
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,839
Okay. Honey, I miss you.

302
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,049
Mom.

303
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,849
Hong Dan likes her seaweed soup
with beef, not clams.

304
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:20,549
- Goodness.
- Don't you worry.

305
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,819
There's another batch
made with a ton of beef over there.

306
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:24,990
Oh, I see.

307
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,390
I'll be back.

308
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,460
Grandma, see you later.

309
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,930
Yes, all right.

310
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,670
No Ah, it looks like you've gotten
even more mature overnight.

311
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:39,039
No Ah is a big brother now.

312
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,869
You're right.

313
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,579
A big brother should look
and act more mature, of course.

314
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,509
Let's go, No Ah.

315
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,349
Seriously, though.

316
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:53,849
I was up all night
worrying about Gong Hee.

317
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,490
I won't let that punk, Seo Min Gi,
get away with this.

318
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,059
Stay home and try
to comfort Gong Hee today, Mom.

319
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,900
Oh, boy.

320
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,630
You have to comfort your daughter,

321
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,869
who packed her things
and came home to get a divorce,

322
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:13,869
on top of looking after
your daughter-in-law...

323
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:15,410
who just had a baby...

324
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,410
and taking care of your ill mother.

325
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,839
Who will comfort Kang Myung Ja?

326
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,250
None other than me!

327
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,079
What is that? A song?

328
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:30,519
When you are

329
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,190
In distress

330
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,059
I will comfort you

331
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,730
My goodness.

332
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,000
When you

333
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:51,579
Feel sad

334
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,140
I'm worried about Gong Hee.

335
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,710
She had a premature baby.

336
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,220
She must be devastated now.

337
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,089
She's a strong person,

338
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,119
and I'll help her get through this.

339
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,529
Yes, try to comfort her
as much as possible.

340
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:10,390
What are friends for, after all?

341
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,930
I heard...

342
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,500
you'd go to Grandma's house
tomorrow.

343
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:18,839
I'll come by before work.
Let's go together.

344
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,839
I'll just go alone.

345
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,240
Let's go together.

346
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,509
Who knows what could happen?

347
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,279
Look, you're trembling.

348
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,819
Do you really have to
move in with her?

349
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,589
Just go ahead and tell her now
that you can't do it.

350
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:41,829
No, Dan Soo.

351
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,660
I'm ready now.

352
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:46,859
All my life,

353
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,130
I've been running away...

354
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:51,940
from my parents' shadow...

355
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,440
and from your grandma too.

356
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,910
But...

357
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,880
I don't want to do that anymore.

358
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,680
I won't run away.

359
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,049
And I have you now.

360
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,650
I didn't know this,

361
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,019
but I guess I take after you, Mom.

362
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,720
I'm cool and strong
because I take after you.

363
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,599
But you have to
keep running this shop, okay?

364
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,369
It's something you want to do,

365
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:22,569
and you like working here.

366
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,740
Yes, I'm going to.

367
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,940
And I have to come here...

368
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,369
to see you.

369
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Gong Hee.

370
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:55,769
Dad.

371
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:57,470
I'm okay.

372
00:21:58,069 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm here to become even better.

373
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,839
I am...

374
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,539
sorry.

375
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,849
Why would you say that?

376
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,880
I pushed you too much...

377
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,019
into getting married.

378
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,589
You just thought
it'd be best for my sake.

379
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,119
I've done...

380
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,490
so much...

381
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,130
to hurt you.

382
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,369
Dad, what are you saying?

383
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:29,970
Why do you keep acting like this?

384
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,839
Well, I wish I could spar with you
since it's been a while,

385
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,470
but I have to get going.

386
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,880
Why don't you
just get some rest today?

387
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,849
I should meet with him
and sort things out.

388
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,910
I'll be back, Dad.

389
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,920
Hey.

390
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:46,920
Will you be okay?

391
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,519
Should I come with you?

392
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,619
Gosh, no.

393
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,019
We should talk things through
between us.

394
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,630
I'll be back
once I sort everything out.

395
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,029
Hey, but...

396
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,130
Gong Hee.

397
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,069
Gong Hee, I made some seaweed soup.
Eat some before you go.

398
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:04,170
Mom, I'll eat after I get back.

399
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,599
You should eat now.

400
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,809
You have to take care of yourself
and find your strength first.

401
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:10,670
You're a mom now.

402
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,309
Okay? Come on.

403
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,710
- Wait, Mom...
- Go on in.

404
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,160
Come on in. Have a seat.

405
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Auntie.

406
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,400
My goodness. For what?

408
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,269
Hurry up and eat. Here.

409
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,740
Go on.

410
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,579
You must miss your baby so much.

411
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,849
Don't worry about the baby.

412
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,819
The baby will get all the treatment
in the hospital...

413
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:55,450
and come home in good health.

414
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,990
We just have to wait a while.

415
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,519
Can't you do that much as a mom?

416
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,329
Did you think
becoming a mom would be easy?

417
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,359
You're right.

418
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Momo must be enduring so much,

419
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,430
so I'll find my strength too.

420
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,730
Don't get down on yourself.

421
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,700
Whether it's divorce
or something else,

422
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,599
you can do anything you want.

423
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,210
Things must've been so hard...

424
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:17,240
for you to decide to get divorced.

425
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,309
You're my daughter. I know you.

426
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,410
I'm sure you've endured enough.

427
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:23,009
I know you've done your best...

428
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,049
and wanted to deal with things
in a wise manner.

429
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:28,690
You've done nothing wrong.
Be confident.

430
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:41,099
This tastes good.

431
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,920
I've heard the report
on how you two have been doing...

432
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,519
while I was gone.

433
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,420
But you know...

434
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,160
Strangely enough, you two
had quite the flashy record...

435
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,289
of business trips.

436
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,089
You must've gone
everywhere in the country.

437
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,470
We went to the new Heirmez stores
in other regions.

438
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,839
Right. So you went to Jeju Island
and Busan several times?

439
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,640
I thought you were just traveling
for fun, not for work.

440
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:26,509
We had meetings regarding
duty-free shops in airports,

441
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:28,309
so they were necessary.

442
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:30,380
Don't you just need results from us?

443
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,380
Must we report every single reason
for each trip?

444
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Is that so?

445
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:37,119
Just how great a result
will you show me?

446
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,259
While I was opening up the boutique
in France,

447
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:42,559
the Heirmez project
just gobbled up money...

448
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,460
with no real results to show for it.
Am I wrong?

449
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,859
And I had arranged everything
for you before I left.

450
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,230
What on earth have you done?

451
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,230
Once the stores open,

452
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
the sales figures
will speak for themselves.

453
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,609
Then, have fun with that.

454
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,940
By the way,

455
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,210
how have your design skills
not improved a bit, Ms. Kang?

456
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:05,380
I'm asking out of pure curiosity.

457
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,180
That's enough.

458
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,589
You're just doing this
out of personal feelings.

459
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:12,660
Me?

460
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,289
You think I'm tormenting you two
out of personal feelings?

461
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,200
Aren't you?

462
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
I am.

463
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:25,839
But what about that?

464
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:28,240
Honestly,
even if you two had done a good job,

465
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,009
I would've nitpicked and bitten
your heads off about something.

466
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:33,710
But thankfully,
you've done such a lousy job.

467
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,619
You said you'd prove yourself
through results, right?

468
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,220
Those results better be good,

469
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:45,420
unless you really want me
to bite your heads off.

00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:58,500
Seriously! He's driving me crazy.

472
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,200
Ever since I heard he was back,

473
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,769
I've been boiling up on the inside.

474
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:05,910
Should I recommend
a great pill for that?

475
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,519
You'll feel that way often
from now on,

476
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,880
so you should be prepared for that.

477
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:19,460
Oh, maybe you should look into
stress management programs together.

478
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,230
It's good for teamwork,
and it'll calm you down too.

479
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:24,930
Relax.

480
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:32,000
My gosh.

Sorry for my late greeting, Mother.

- "Mother?"
- What should I do first?

489
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,240
You know that Min Gi and I
are seeing each other again, right?

490
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,539
He had an affair?

Even if they get divorced,

492
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,740
I should show my full support
for Gong Hee.

493
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,210
We're here to put an end...
