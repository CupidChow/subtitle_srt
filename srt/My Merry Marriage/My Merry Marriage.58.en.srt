1
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,240
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,680
Can't you do your job better?

3
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,709
Does it make sense to you...

4
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,750
that you still don't know
who Ms. Kang is seeing?

5
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,519
What Dan Soo said was very strange.

6
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:36,450
What Ji Na said too.

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,330
Given how Ms. Kang
joined you for dinner today,

8
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,330
I am sure
she isn't seeing anyone else, ma'am.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,729
Stop guessing.

10
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,770
Bring me some evidence.

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,200
Solid evidence.

12
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:53,670
Can't you do your job better?

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,639
If you can't, just quit!

14
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:58,539
I apologize, ma'am.

15
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,789
What a mess.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,870
Ms. Eom must be so upset.

17
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,110
(Pregnancy Journal, Maeng Gong Hee)

18
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,880
"Pregnancy Journal, Maeng Gong Hee."

19
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,979
Pregnancy.

20
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,819
If I tell Mom this
amid all this chaos,

21
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,419
she might collapse.

22
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,720
I should keep this to myself
for the time being.

23
00:02:03,169 --> 00:02:04,240
No...

24
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Don't go.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,149
Don't go.

26
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,959
Don't go!

27
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,539
Tonight,

28
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,840
I don't see a single star.

29
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,410
Without you here,

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,289
I don't have anyone
to eat late-night snacks with!

31
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:49,789
This voice...

32
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,460
Hey, Gu Dan Soo!

33
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,759
Maeng Gong Hee?

34
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,729
Why do I have to order so much...

35
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:03,169
just to have some tteokbokki
delivered?

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,100
I don't have anyone to go
to the convenience store with...

37
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,870
even when I'm scared
to go out alone at night!

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,639
You said to lean on you
when things were hard!

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,949
You said
you'd always stay by my side!

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,979
So why did you leave?

41
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,049
You should be by my side, at least!

42
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,419
How could you leave like that...

43
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,220
just because I got a little angry?

44
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,530
Why do I feel so frustrated...

45
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:35,169
no matter how much I yell?

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,039
Gu Dan Soo!

47
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,009
Hey! You jerk!

48
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,250
Gu Dan Soo, you total fraud!

49
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,780
- Hey!
- Why are you calling me?

50
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,569
Gu Dan Soo, you...

51
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,329
I'm right here.

52
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,940
Why are you worried about
ordering too much tteokbokki?

53
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,680
I know you can eat everything
by yourself.

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,319
Who are you? Do I know you?

55
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,949
Why are you acting like you know me?

56
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,759
Is that it?

57
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,359
Are you angry
because you don't have someone...

58
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:35,960
to eat tteokbokki with?

59
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:38,799
Are you fine except for that?

60
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:42,869
No.

61
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:44,669
I'm not fine.

62
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,109
I could tell you stuff...

63
00:04:48,109 --> 00:04:49,539
that I couldn't even tell my mom.

64
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,379
Even when I was stressed
or exhausted,

65
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,939
I felt okay when I was with you.

66
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,609
But that friend disappeared
overnight.

67
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,249
How could I be fine?

68
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,150
"Friend?"

69
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,119
Yes, a friend.

70
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,689
You and I are best friends
since childhood.

71
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,859
I can't give any other excuse...

72
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,400
than the fact that we're friends.

73
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,830
I need you.

74
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,830
Can't you just stay by my side?

75
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm sorry,

76
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,869
but I don't need a friend.

77
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,879
Hey, Gu Dan Soo.

78
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,879
There's something you don't know.

79
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,850
Even when we lived in Kkotsan,

80
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:32,679
I wasn't just friends with you.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,549
You were my first love.

82
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
What?

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,059
If you didn't know,
keep it in mind from now on.

84
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,830
Hey, Gu Dan Soo. You...

85
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,160
If I keep staying with your family,

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,729
I'll always be your friend.

87
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,330
Snot Face Geon.

88
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,729
Rude Gu Dan Soo.

89
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,929
Your childhood friend
and roommate...

90
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,039
who's always on your side.

91
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,439
That won't cut it for me.

92
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,439
I want to become more than that.

93
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,510
Can't we just stay friends?

94
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:02,809
No.

95
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,919
I have no intention
of staying friends.

96
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,919
If what you want is...

97
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,989
your childhood friend,
Snot Face Geon,

98
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,090
I can't be that for you.

99
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,400
I told you to dress more warmly.

100
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,510
Don't catch a cold.

101
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,510
I'm too far away
to buy you cold medicine.

102
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,879
Bye.

103
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,220
Then what do you want to do?

104
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,460
What else can we become...

105
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,460
other than friends?

106
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,249
Is everyone asleep?

107
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,989
Gosh, seriously.

108
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
My gosh.

109
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,989
Did you just get home, son?

110
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:23,999
Mom, hold on...

111
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,470
Wait!

112
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:30,330
Wait! Put down the weapon!

113
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,999
- Mom! Stop.
- How could you do this to me?

114
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,499
How?

115
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:36,669
How can you
constantly make me worry?

116
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,710
Answer me if you can. Go on!

117
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,379
You said I did my duty as a son...

118
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:41,979
on the day I got accepted
to medical school.

119
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,249
You said going to medical school
was enough.

120
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,379
You call that an excuse?

121
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,179
But you told me to answer you,
so I did.

122
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,650
Gosh, you punk!

123
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:05,999
Oh, my.

124
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,939
How could you do this?

125
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:13,080
How could you not know...

126
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,650
until your son turned
five years old?

127
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,650
Soo Yeon hid it from me on purpose.
What could I do?

128
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,090
I'm flabbergasted too.

129
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,119
What will you do about Hong Dan?

130
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,720
What will you do? You just got back
from your honeymoon.

131
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:27,859
It's no better than a marriage scam
in my eyes too!

132
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:29,530
What do you plan to do?

133
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,530
That's why marriage is the problem.

134
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,859
Mom, I must not be cut out
for marriage.

135
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:35,600
That's why I said
I wouldn't get married...

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,999
You fool! Are you serious right now?

137
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,210
I'll take care of everything.

138
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,439
How will you take care of things?

139
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,910
What did Soo Yeon say?

140
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,910
Did you get in touch with her?

141
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,280
I did get in touch, but...

142
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,850
You got in touch, but what?

143
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,519
She's going to study in the US
for two years.

144
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,889
You know how she likes to study.

145
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,220
She should take my name
since it means "to study."

146
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,460
My gosh!

147
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,090
- My gosh! You...
- Come on, Mom.

148
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,200
Just hit me instead.
That would make me feel better.

149
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,629
Right. I really don't want
to become a mom...

150
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,340
who hits her grown-up child.

151
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:16,139
But you asked for it.

152
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,210
- You deserve a beating.
- Wait, not with this.

153
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,350
You! My goodness!

154
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,180
Why do you live like this? Why?

155
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,550
When there's something
you shouldn't hear,

156
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,619
- these are the best.
- You punk!

157
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:32,989
- My gosh!
- Here. Let me see your ears.

158
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,989
- Mom.
- My gosh!

159
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,090
There. You can't hear, can you?

160
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,859
There you go.

161
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,800
Oh, goodness. My baby.

162
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,840
Right. It's okay.

163
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,040
Relax.

164
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,779
Ssook Ssook.

165
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,649
It's no big deal.

166
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,979
Mommy got a little worked up, right?

167
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,290
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:04,519
It's fine.

169
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,790
You know, Daddy...

170
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
No!

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,029
That jerk isn't your daddy.
Daddy, my foot.

172
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,899
Ssook Ssook,

173
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,570
you don't have a daddy anymore.

174
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:24,609
Mommy will do...

175
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,749
everything a daddy would do for you.

176
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,519
What do I do?

177
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:41,129
Mom, what do I do?

178
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,700
All right.

179
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,700
Well, do these fit you?

180
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:53,100
Do you wear these to bed?

181
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,269
Okay. Arms in the air.

182
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:57,979
Arms in the air.

183
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,509
Arms in the air.

184
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,379
Hey.

185
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,080
What did your mom tell you?

186
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,019
I am Maeng Gong Boo's son.

187
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,489
Right, and I am Maeng Gong Boo.
That's me.

188
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:13,989
Daddy.

189
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,060
I'm your dad...

190
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,600
Yes, you're right.

191
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,800
Didn't your mom
tell you anything else?

192
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Why?

193
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:24,340
Hey, you'll be living apart
from your mom.

194
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,570
Aren't you even crying?

195
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,570
- Why?
- Goodness.

196
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,869
Hey, I'm asking the questions here.

197
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,210
What do you mean, "Why?"

198
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,350
Hey, he's just like you as a kid.

199
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,720
Your nickname used to be Why Man.

200
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,889
Well, you do...

201
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,519
look like me. My gosh.

202
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:48,889
Come here.

203
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:50,859
You should get changed.

204
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,300
I can change myself.

205
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,340
Mom told me
that I should get changed on my own.

206
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,499
Oh, goodness.

207
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,869
Oh, my. What?

208
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,009
Oh, my.

209
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,180
- Hey.
- My goodness.

210
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,749
Oh, my.

211
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,249
He knows what he's doing.

212
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,420
He's better than I am.

213
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,850
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

214
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,720
He knows how things go.

215
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,159
He is better than you.

216
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,489
Goodness.

217
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,290
That's it.

218
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,999
Gong Boo isn't at fault either.

219
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:33,040
He didn't know this would happen.

220
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:37,409
Gong Boo is the one
who's the most shocked right now.

221
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,210
Don't yell at him so much.

222
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,810
I know.

223
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:44,279
I know that too.

224
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,019
But my heart...

225
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,690
It's just burning up. That's all.

226
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,820
I thought
I had gotten him married...

227
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,590
and that I was finally free
from being his mom.

228
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,259
But he came back with a kid.

229
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,369
I mean, he's old enough now.

230
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,840
Can't he just take care
of himself now?

231
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,710
I can't be there as his mom forever.

232
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,810
How much longer
do I have to do this?

233
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:13,739
Do you think it ends?

234
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,379
It never ends
until you end up in your coffin.

235
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,519
You're right.

236
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,149
Even at this age,

237
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,190
I'm whining to my mother.

238
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,629
You still have to be there for me
as my mom too.

239
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,259
At least you know that.

240
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,930
Mom.

241
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,430
What if Gong Boo
gets divorced again?

242
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,239
I don't even want to think about
that time. It was like a nightmare.

243
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,680
Back then,
Gong Boo was completely distraught.

244
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,109
He quit his job at the clinic
where he used to work.

245
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:49,580
He was a wreck.

246
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,050
I gave him all my money
and whatever I could borrow...

247
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,479
to help him open up his own clinic,

248
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,420
and he barely managed
to pull himself together.

249
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:59,320
I thought
he could finally live a stable life.

250
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,859
Mom, does he have
a cursed fate or something?

251
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,070
My goodness.

252
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,670
Oh, dear.

253
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,220
Even if it's just once.

254
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,090
I want to see him again,
even just once.

255
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,190
My son, Dan Soo.

256
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,300
(Son)

257
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,340
(Son)

258
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,210
(Son)

259
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,009
Hello?

260
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,350
Hello?

261
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,220
Who is this?

262
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,960
I'm hanging up. No more prank calls.

263
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,889
Wait.

264
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,259
Dan Soo. It's me, your mom.

265
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,700
I'm your mom.

266
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:23,170
I...

267
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:25,979
want to tell the whole world
that I'm your mom,

268
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,879
hold you in my arms
even if it's just once,

269
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,850
and apologize to you.

270
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,149
Dan Soo.

271
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,259
Dan Soo, my son.

272
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,290
Dan Soo.

273
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,310
Yes, a friend.

274
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:59,909
You and I are best friends
since childhood.

275
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,310
She had to call me a friend again.

276
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,279
All she has to do is
take just one more step toward me.

277
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,519
Is it that hard, Maeng Ggong?

278
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:30,909
Son.

279
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:35,080
You met Ji Na's mom, didn't you?

280
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,279
At Chairwoman Hwang's place.

281
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,249
You knew?

282
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,220
Yes, Dan Soo told me.

283
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:47,859
Do you know how I was treated today?

284
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,859
Ji Na's mother...

285
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,129
treated me like a housemaid...

286
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:54,800
and outright belittled me.

287
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:56,830
And you know what?

288
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:01,170
Ji Na walked in,
holding Chairwoman Hwang's hand.

289
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,379
What is the matter with Ji Na?

290
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:09,879
She says she will marry you...

291
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,379
and does these things.

292
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,790
My pride?

293
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:18,290
Fine, they can go ahead
and stomp all over it.

294
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
But...

295
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,930
thinking that
you might get your heart broken...

296
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,959
makes me so sad...

297
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
and miserable.

298
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,570
Mom.

299
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,609
Min Gi.

301
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,379
I'll put things right.

302
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,820
I'll...

303
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,780
put everything back
to where they should be.

304
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,020
Don't worry about a thing, Mom.

305
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Where are you?

306
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:10,869
Home.

307
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:13,609
Why do you sound upset?

308
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,350
Did something happen?

309
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,919
Did you perhaps hear something...

310
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,449
from your mother?

311
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,760
No, she didn't say anything.

312
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:28,389
I'm just tired.

313
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,399
Really? Then I'm relieved.

314
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,629
Oh, right. I can't go
to work with you tomorrow.

315
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,030
My mom will sleep here tonight.

316
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,740
I think she wants to stay with me
to watch me 24-7.

317
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,439
How much longer
do you plan to avoid this problem?

318
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,240
Just until tomorrow.

319
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,010
My mom will go home
in a couple of days.

320
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,350
Sleep well.
I'll see you tomorrow at work.

321
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,310
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

322
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,480
Hey, I haven't eaten anything
all day.

323
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,909
I've been running around
to get things sorted out...

324
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,179
since I got back from my honeymoon.

325
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,050
And as soon as I got home today,

326
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,290
Mom started yelling at me.

327
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,219
Give me a minute.

328
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Thank you.

329
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,359
Don't you think
you owe Soo Yeon an apology?

330
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,929
An apology?
Why should I apologize to her?

331
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:45,939
Regardless of how it happened,
she had to raise him all by herself.

332
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,439
She couldn't even tell you.

333
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,439
Get your facts straight.
It's not like she couldn't tell me.

334
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,480
She chose not to tell me
to mess with me.

335
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,510
I mean, for five years...

336
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,709
She's so mean. She's spiteful.

337
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Hey.

338
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,379
Things are completely over
between you and Soo Yeon, right?

339
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,219
Hey.

340
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,159
It's not that simple, you see.

341
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:08,060
To me,
Soo Yeon is a spiteful woman...

342
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,429
and my ex-wife,

343
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:12,230
but she's that kid's mother.

344
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,060
And I'm his father.

345
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:18,300
But what about Ms. Eom?

346
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,899
I do not want to see her get hurt.

347
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,609
I feel so bad
when I think about Hong Dan.

348
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,109
But I don't think
I can go back to her...

349
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:28,409
and ask her to forgive me, you know.

350
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,209
How am I going to ask her
to raise a child who isn't hers?

351
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,719
I'm not that shameless.

352
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,820
What would you do if you were me?
Would you ask her...

353
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,449
or not? Should I leave her?

354
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,790
Should I go back to Hong Dan?

355
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:41,959
Gosh, I don't know either.

356
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,359
Just eat your food. Good grief.

357
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,159
You asked me first.
Why are you mad at me?

358
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,439
I wonder if Hong Dan is eating well.

359
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,639
She kept crying nonstop earlier.

360
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,109
She's pregnant.
What if she collapses or something?

361
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,310
My goodness.

362
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Food is the best remedy,
Ssook Ssook.

363
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,899
We have to eat well.
Okay, Ssook Ssook?

364
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:25,770
The two of us...

365
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,169
will cheer up and stay strong,
Ssook Ssook. Yes.

366
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,379
(Quack)

367
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I will not answer your calls.

368
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,250
(Quack)

369
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,689
Can we meet tomorrow?

370
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,959
Gosh, I don't know.

371
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,429
No one understands...

372
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,330
how I feel now.

373
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:56,929
No one.

374
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,639
(Eom Hong Dan, Read)

375
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:12,550
She read my message
but isn't replying.

376
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,590
They even have
the exact same sleeping posture.

377
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,560
He does resemble Gong Boo so much.

378
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,699
(Pregnancy Journal, Maeng Gong Hee)

379
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,030
(Congratulations, Gong Hee!)

380
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,909
Hey. It's not that simple, you see.

381
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:14,540
I have a kid.

382
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,909
To me,
Soo Yeon is a spiteful woman...

383
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,619
and my ex-wife,

384
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,580
but she's that kid's mother.

385
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,490
And I'm his father.

386
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,490
To you,

387
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,959
I'm your mom.

388
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,800
And Mr. Seo...

389
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:37,929
is your dad.

390
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,139
What?

391
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,080
I guess I left these in this drawer.

392
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,030
Hey. Gu Dan Soo, Snot Face.

393
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,399
So,

394
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,929
what do you want to become
other than my friend?

395
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:12,540
I'm in over my head now too.

396
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:14,969
My heart is so full...

397
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,369
that it's even hard to breathe.

398
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,850
You never beat me
when we were kids either,

399
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,419
whether it was in running...

400
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:34,520
or in catching bugs.

401
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,159
So,

402
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:43,230
just lose to me again this time,
Gu Dan Soo.

403
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,830
What? I'll go and see who it is.

404
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,800
Oh, Min Gi.

405
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,439
What's this?

406
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:30,209
Min Gi, what are you doing?

407
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,619
Please consider me
as Ji Na's match just once, Mother.

408
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,389
Do you think...

409
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:38,419
this will soften my heart?

410
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,290
You were mistaken.

411
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:41,889
Do you really think...

412
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,230
Gu Dan Soo will inherit Jayce Group?

413
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,199
What?

414
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:51,939
If I promise you that I'll become
the chairman of Jayce Group,

415
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,439
will you give me your permission?

416
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
What?

417
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,280
How does it taste?

418
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,389
It's pretty good.

419
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,659
He says it's pretty good.

420
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,990
No Ah, I'm your aunt.

421
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,359
Auntie Gong Hee.

422
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,300
I've heard a lot about you
from my mom.

423
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,169
What did your mom tell you?

424
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,840
That you're better than my dad.

425
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,540
Goodness, she was right about that.

426
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,340
She taught you so well.

427
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,939
- She insulted me to my own son.
- Just hold it in.

428
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,480
Gosh, how can you be so cute?

429
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,980
You're so adorable.

430
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,119
Hurry up and get married
so you can have your own kid.

431
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,560
What? No way.

432
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,590
What do you mean?

433
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,459
You're old enough
to be a mom already.

434
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,830
- Oh, try this too.
- Yes.

435
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,399
- Thank you.
- Of course.

436
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:13,449
Oh, dear.

437
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,990
- Gosh, what's wrong with her?
- Eat up.

438
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:28,129
What's wrong with you?

439
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,129
What do you mean?

440
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,199
Why do you keep getting
an upset stomach?

441
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,139
Are you perhaps...

442
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,310
pregnant?

443
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,209
Mom...

444
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,179
My daughter.

445
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,490
Please tell me
that nothing is wrong.

446
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,959
At least you...

447
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,090
Please tell me nothing is wrong.

448
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,840
(My Merry Marriage)

449
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,080
I could...

450
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:15,980
have Jayce Group become
a part of Dodo Group.

451
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,280
I can't talk to anyone
with the surname Maeng...

452
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,179
for more than three seconds.

453
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,419
"No one from the Maeng family
is allowed inside."

454
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,459
Hang on a minute.
Who doesn't have that surname?

455
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,459
Me?

456
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:28,159
Gong Hee, did you see this article?

457
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,889
Did Holly agree to this?

458
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:31,429
What... No.

459
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,699
How did this...

460
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,330
Was it perhaps Kang Ji Na?

461
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,530
Mother.

462
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,330
My surname isn't Maeng.

463
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:40,699
