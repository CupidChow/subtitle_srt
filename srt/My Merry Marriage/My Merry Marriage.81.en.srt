1
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,859
(20 years earlier)

2
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,400
(Episode 81)

3
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,970
Goodness. It's cold.

4
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:41,139
- Here.
- Thanks.

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,880
Eat up. Oh, boy.

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,209
Gyeong Tae, are you sure
this is the right spot?

7
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,679
How many days
have we been staking out here?

8
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,620
I'm about to get a heat rash
on my butt.

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,819
And I'm sick of cup noodles.

10
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,859
Fishing is the art of patience.

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,590
Don't you already know that?

12
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:00,899
If the culprit were a fish,

13
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,529
I'd just go to the fish market
and get one.

14
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,399
This guy is nowhere to be seen.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,969
We've waited long enough.
Let's get going, okay?

16
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,109
This guy is a murder suspect.

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,209
What if we lose the guy,
and there are even more victims?

18
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,039
Will you take responsibility
for that?

19
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,109
I can't do that.

20
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,289
- Detective Maeng.
- Yes?

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,789
This is Geon's dad.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,289
Right, hello.
Did you need me for something?

23
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,330
There's something
I want to leave in your care.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

25
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,709
You see, my wife might come back.

26
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,809
If she does,
could you give it to her?

27
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,649
Please do this for me.

28
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:59,350
I heard Geon's mom disappeared
on the day of their move.

29
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,259
He didn't even report her missing.

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,360
Is something going on?

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,839
Hey. Are you perhaps...

32
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,009
Hey! Kim Chi Seung!

33
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,550
Stop right there!

34
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,650
Hey, you punk!

35
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,620
Why, you... Hey, stop right there!

36
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,160
You little jerk.

37
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,229
Hey, what's going on?

38
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,699
My gosh.

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,370
- Oh, my goodness!
- Stop!

40
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,340
- Stop, you punk!
- Oh, no.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I told you to stop!

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,870
- Stop!
- Oh, goodness.

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Hey, punk!

44
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,780
Hey. Give up, Kim Chi Seung.

45
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,280
Why, you little... Hey.

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Stop!

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,250
Hey, Kim Chi Seung!
Stop right there, punk! Stop!

48
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:15,859
You little punk. I told you to stop!

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,769
Kim Chi Seung!

50
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,090
Oh, my.

51
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,690
- Hey, Gyeong Tae.
- Detective An.

52
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,989
- I found him.
- What?

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,789
He's on the run in the alleys now.

54
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,430
You can't bring the car in here.

55
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,030
I'll chase him
toward the intersection.

56
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,400
Go and wait at the end
of that alley now. Hurry!

57
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,639
- Freeze!
- Darn it.

58
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,889
Detective Maeng told me
to meet him here.

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,289
Is he running late?

60
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,359
Stop right there!

61
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:20,960
I told you to stop!

62
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,530
Come here, you punk.

63
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:28,739
Get up!

64
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,870
Kim Chi Seung.
You're done for, punk.

65
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,679
No!

66
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,350
Hey, Kim Chi Seung!

67
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:42,249
Get him! Get that man!

68
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:43,749
Get him!

69
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,890
Get him! Go!

70
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
Darn it.

71
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:08,939
Who are you?

72
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,400
You don't even look like a cop.

73
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,210
Stop bothering me and just leave!

74
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,809
If you've committed a crime,

75
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:16,780
you should pay for it.

76
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,879
- You should just give up now!
- Darn it.

77
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,479
Hey.

78
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:24,989
Don't move!

79
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,489
Darn it!

80
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Why, you...

81
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,460
Darn it!

82
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:00,989
Kim Chi Seung! Freeze!

83
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,710
You punk. I will catch you today,
no matter what.

84
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,350
Stop right there!

85
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,850
- Kim Chi Seung, you punk!
- Darn it!

86
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,390
Get up, punk!

87
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,570
You have the right to an attorney...

88
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,039
and the right
to remain silent, jerk.

89
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,640
Lucky you, punk.

90
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,539
Let me go!

91
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,510
Blood?

92
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,080
Why, you little...

93
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,090
So why did he have to butt in
on other people's business?

94
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,189
You got him killed, Detective.
You got that?

95
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,260
You dragged an innocent civilian
into this...

96
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:16,629
and killed him. Darn it!

97
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,200
Mr. Gu!

98
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,909
Oh, my!

99
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,580
Oh, dear. Mr. Gu!

100
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,649
Mr. Gu.

101
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,580
Detective Maeng.

102
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,420
Stay with me.

103
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,470
Please give this to my wife for me.

104
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,970
Please do this for me.

105
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,170
What? But...

106
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,879
Oh, no.

107
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,749
No... Mr. Gu.

108
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,879
Mr. Gu!

109
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,050
No!

110
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,989
No. Mr. Gu! Don't die!

111
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,190
No!

112
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,820
Don't die!

113
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,310
I...

114
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,379
I killed him.

115
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,680
I couldn't tell my wife or my kids.

116
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,790
This is my sin.

117
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,489
Why? Why did you do that?

118
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:29,700
I quit my job as a detective
because of this.

119
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,100
And since then, I've lived...

120
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,340
with handcuffs around my own heart.

121
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,509
Why are you
only telling me this now? Why?

122
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:45,379
You were barely going on
with your life...

123
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,609
as you watched Dan Soo.

124
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,619
I thought...

125
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,590
this might only
hurt you again, so...

126
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,590
- Oh, dear! Audrey!
- No!

127
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,259
Don't touch me.

128
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,229
My gosh. That day, I...

129
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,940
Please leave.

130
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:12,710
Get out.

131
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,479
Please leave now.

132
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Why...

133
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,930
Why did that happen to Hae Joon?

134
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,899
Why?

135
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,670
What do I do?

136
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,840
How could this... I'm sorry.

137
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,479
I'm sorry, Hae Joon.

138
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,550
Hae Joon...

139
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,600
No Ah, you're going to have
a younger sibling soon,

140
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,269
so you have to become mature.

141
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,540
What's wrong, No Ah?

142
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,440
Is the tangerine too sour?

143
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,340
It tastes awful.

144
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:24,710
My mom only bought
organic tangerines for me.

145
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,680
What? Your mom is right here.

146
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,519
Oh, no.

147
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,519
Organic, my foot.

148
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:35,190
All tangerines taste the same.

149
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,330
I was taught to only eat
organic fruits and veggies.

150
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,759
My gosh. He's so smart and bright.

151
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,830
Who do you take after?

152
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,470
Right, both of his parents
are doctors, so...

153
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Oh, my.

154
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,970
Well, anyway...

155
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,940
How come your dad isn't home yet?

156
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,310
He wasn't home for dinner either.

157
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,210
Did he go fishing again?

158
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,749
Yes. Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine.

159
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,159
What?

160
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,889
Gyeong Tae is there?

161
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,529
My gosh.

162
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,430
Hey. Slow down, will you?

163
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,529
You need to eat something. Here.

164
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,499
Hey. What the...

165
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,239
If I didn't have my children,

166
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,409
I would've cuffed myself...

167
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,279
and turned myself in long ago.

168
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,850
I'd be in jail now!

169
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,690
What on earth
are you talking about now?

170
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:44,560
You have no idea. You know nothing.

171
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm a murderer.

172
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
Oh, boy.

173
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,470
Hey.

174
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:55,399
I killed someone. I'm a murderer!

175
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,739
- Go ahead and arrest me!
- My gosh.

176
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,909
Goodness.
What is the matter with him?

177
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,609
How long
has my brother been like this?

178
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,979
I have no idea!

179
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:05,509
He walked in out of the blue
and asked for booze.

180
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,550
And he's been drinking nonstop
all by himself.

181
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,649
What is it now?

182
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,979
What's the problem now?

183
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,920
Oh, dear.

184
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,159
You can't tell me what's going on?

185
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,190
You'll keep it to yourself again?

186
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,430
Even when you quit being a cop
20 years ago,

187
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,129
you said you should be arrested
every time you drank.

188
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,930
When I decided to leave Kkotsan
because I was sick and tired of it,

189
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:29,800
I told myself to wait
until you were ready to tell me.

190
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,509
But what is this?

191
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,810
What is this grand secret
you can't tell anyone?

192
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,310
Why is it that
you still can't get out of this rut?

193
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,999
- Goodness.
- Oh, boy.

194
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,830
Seriously, Dad!

195
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,600
Do I really have to piggyback you
at this age...

196
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,570
when you're way more muscular
than I am?

197
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,340
Seriously, what is it that
you're keeping bottled up inside?

198
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,139
What is it that
you can't even tell Mom?

199
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,509
I'm dying over here. Oh, boy.

200
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,019
My goodness.

201
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,450
- Be careful not to hurt your back.
- Wait up!

202
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:21,050
- Oh, no.
- Wait! My gosh.

203
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,830
Dad, seriously. Get up!

204
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,600
Mr. Maeng!

205
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,259
What? You...

206
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,170
What?

207
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:38,909
What?

208
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,540
Please... I...

209
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,680
I have sinned.

210
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,249
Just arrest me.

211
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,489
Go ahead and put me behind bars!

212
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,090
I have sinned.

213
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,529
That's enough, all right?

214
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,960
Aren't you embarrassed
in front of Dan Soo?

215
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,869
(Sowol Library)

216
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:13,639
("Leaves in Your Heart")

217
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,040
Your brother didn't eat breakfast.
He's bedridden now.

218
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,909
I feel like I shouldn't be here now.

219
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:20,149
Goodness. Then what do you think
you should be doing?

220
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,149
Do you want to go home
and cook him some hangover soup?

221
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:25,820
He was fine for a while.

222
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,259
I wonder what triggered it again.
I'm so upset.

223
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,859
You get upset too easily.

224
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,430
Hey, don't worry.
He'll snap out of it soon.

225
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,930
By the way,

226
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,570
I tried calling Audrey,
but she didn't pick up.

227
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,729
Will she come alone?

228
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,739
- She'll be here.
- All right.

229
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Oh, my.

230
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,560
My goodness. What is he doing here?

231
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,499
Here?

232
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,060
My goodness.

233
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,139
Well...

234
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:53,209
Hello, everyone.

235
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,780
Doesn't the classroom
feel cozier today?

236
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:02,419
I hope we can share our warmth
as if we're all sitting together...

237
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,520
and having a good conversation
by the fireplace.

238
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,119
Oh, my.

239
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,090
Rilke, right?

240
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,159
Well, it looks like...

241
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,530
we have someone new
joining us today.

242
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,899
Let me introduce him.
What's your name?

243
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:21,469
Oh, right.

244
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,399
Hello.

245
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,909
I'm An Sang Ho.

246
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:30,340
Please look kindly upon me.

247
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,850
Yes.

248
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,149
Welcome. We're happy
to have you join us.

249
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,379
Oh, my.

250
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,689
He's here to learn to write poetry?
Oh, dear.

251
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,859
Come on. Anyone can learn
how to write poetry.

252
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,429
Can't you see
what his hidden agenda is?

253
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,230
"Hidden agenda?"

254
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,469
He's clearly here to see me.

255
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,600
My gosh. He gives me the creeps.

256
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,340
(Your...)

257
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,780
The first time...

258
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,219
is always exciting and thrilling,

259
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,689
and it's remembered beautifully.

260
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,659
What about when you do something
for the last time?

261
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,090
If you were about to
have your last meal,

262
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,929
what would you like to eat?
Could you all tell us?

263
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,129
Mr. Ryu, I'll go first.

264
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,300
Yes, Ms. Jung Joo Ri.

265
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:30,639
You see,

266
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,740
I hate soy sauce marinated crab
and braised short ribs.

267
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,280
I really hate
such sweet and salty foods.

268
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,149
I'm on a low-sodium diet these days.

269
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,919
What? She's criticizing
the food we sent.

270
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,320
Is she messing with us now?

271
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,560
For my final meal, I'd choose...

272
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,800
lobster or caviar.

273
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,570
I'd be wearing an elegant dress,

274
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,439
linking arms with a romantic poet.

275
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,310
We'd go to
a fine dining restaurant...

276
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,280
and have caviar
while listening to piano music.

277
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,209
"Oh, my. I could die now."

278
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,379
That's how I'd feel.

279
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,689
Right.

280
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:20,949
All right.

281
00:20:20,949 --> 00:20:21,959
Yes.

282
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,189
Okay, then...

283
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,730
Ms. Maeng Gyeong Bok.

284
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,459
Would you like to tell us?

285
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,100
Oh, me?

286
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Sure.

287
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,399
Well...

288
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,969
For me...

289
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,310
I'd like to have
dried radish green soup.

290
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,869
Dried radish green soup, seriously?

291
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:44,480
She's just as lame as Kang Myung Ja.

292
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,709
Dried radish green soup?

293
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,550
Yes. One that my mom makes.

294
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:55,790
Whenever the vegetable truck
was parked by the underpass,

295
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:01,490
my mom held my tiny hand
and took me there.

296
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,330
She'd pick up the dried radish greens
on the ground...

297
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,100
to feed my brother...

298
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,639
and me.

299
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,609
I keep longing
to taste that broth...

300
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,439
with chunks of fat floating around.

301
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,419
No matter how expensive
some foods may be,

302
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,830
they can't be
as valuable as our memories.

303
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,859
Thank you for that.

304
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,929
Well, then...

305
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,399
Ms. Kang Myung Ja.

306
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,570
Oh, me?

307
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
For me,

308
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,409
it would be an ordinary meal...

309
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,310
with the whole family
around the table.

310
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:56,580
We'd all fall asleep
in the same house at night...

311
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,090
and gather around the table
in the morning so naturally.

312
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:01,520
On a table full of dishes
out of the refrigerator,

313
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,619
we'd all eat
with smiles on our faces.

314
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,230
I hope the last meal in my life...

315
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,600
can be an ordinary meal like that.

316
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,369
A meal as peaceful
as the spring sunshine...

317
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:16,600
that comes
with no trouble or worries.

318
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:23,639
(I'm going to the poetry workshop.)

319
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:56,080
- Come on in.
- Oh, my.

320
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,510
What is this? Are you moving?

321
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,919
Did Myung Ja ask you...

322
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:04,550
to come and live with her in Seoul?

323
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:06,189
No.

324
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,389
Why would I go there?

325
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:11,060
What? Then why is a frail old woman
as yourself...

326
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,189
going through all this stuff?

327
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,859
I won't be taking everything with me
to the grave.

328
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,959
I should sort through things
while I have the time.

329
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,669
- My gosh.
- This is all just baggage.

330
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,669
Wait, but this is new.

331
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:25,840
This looks like a nice comforter.

332
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,669
Oh, that?

333
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:31,379
- Myung Ja bought me that last year.
- I see.

334
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:32,810
You can take it if you want.

335
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,810
What?

336
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:38,080
Oh, my! I got lucky today.

337
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:42,659
Bye.

338
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:47,790
Wait, Myung Ja.

339
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,730
I'll get the car running
and wait outside.

340
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,439
- What? We're so close to home.
- Let's go.

341
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,070
Why did you bring your car?

342
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,109
It's a cold day.

343
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:00,740
You're so frail.

344
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,340
I don't want you to catch a cold.

345
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,609
I mean, I am pretty delicate.

346
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,550
- Well, then.
- What...

347
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:17,959
Hey, in-law.

348
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,730
Thank you
for the food you sent in return.

349
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,959
What food?

350
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,800
Come on. Why are you acting dumb?

351
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,300
Gong Hee brought it over.

352
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,699
Food is supposed to be
all about the effort,

353
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:33,669
but it was wrapped nicely, at least.

354
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,010
Still, it tasted all right. Thanks.

355
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,050
Is that what your daughter said?

356
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,449
That I prepared food
to send back to you?

357
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,919
What are you saying?

358
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,260
My, look how cheeky she is.

359
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,530
I was planning on
preparing something for you.

360
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,260
So why would she go ahead
and make something up like this?

361
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,600
What? Then...

362
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:05,040
You didn't send it?

363
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,109
No. She must've bought food
from somewhere.

364
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,939
I can't believe it.

365
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,149
Is that
how you raised your daughter?

366
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,250
How could she tell
such a cheeky lie?

367
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:17,020
What does she take her in-laws for?

368
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,520
- Well...
- My gosh.

369
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:24,260
My goodness.

370
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,459
How dare she lie like that?

371
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:29,230
(Jayce Fashion and Heirmez,
The Classic Edition)

372
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,859
Ms. Kang and I came up
with this proposal.

373
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:32,969
Please take a look.

374
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:35,669
What is this?

375
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,369
When did you prepare all this?

376
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,240
And with Ms. Kang?

377
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,709
Mr. Seo looked like
he was struggling on his own.

378
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,109
With Heirmez's name value,

379
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,879
this would need a high-end strategy.

380
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,219
Who else could handle this
from our end other than me?

381
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,850
A high-end strategy?

382
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:55,320
That's a totally different strategy
from the Holly project.

383
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,919
A collaboration with Heirmez.

384
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,389
As long as you can make it happen,

385
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:01,530
it would be great for the company.

386
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,199
The chairwoman would be pleased too.

387
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,169
But will you be all right?

388
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:12,669
You'd be facing
Mr. Gu's Holly project head-on.

389
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,280
Of course. A head-on match.

390
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,750
That's interesting, Mr. Seo.

391
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,230
Oh, hello, Mother.

392
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,929
Who told you to take food
to your family in return?

393
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,070
And without even telling me?

394
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:42,100
Oh, that was...

395
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,639
I met your mom
at the poetry workshop today.

396
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,540
Do you know how taken aback I was?

397
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,480
I was going to tell you,

398
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,080
but I thought
you might be busy, so I...

399
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,449
I don't want to hear it.
Let's talk when you get home.

400
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,629
Gosh, how could Ssang Sook
speak so harshly?

401
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,500
Gong Hee must've felt
so uncomfortable around her to do that.

402
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:16,699
I mean, she'd never
make anyone feel like a fool.

403
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,270
She was lying when she told us
that she was doing fine...

404
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:20,969
and that everyone
was being nice to her.

405
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,980
She was faking that smile.

406
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,649
I shouldn't have had her
marry that guy.

407
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,480
Come on.
What good is it to say that now?

408
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,050
I could tell
she didn't want to marry him.

409
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,449
I could see it clearly,
but I still let her go.

410
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,260
That sweet girl got pushed
into marriage.

411
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:41,859
What if she lives an unhappy life?

412
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,659
Your collar is crooked.

413
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,909
(My Merry Marriage)

414
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,449
I didn't kill Hae Joon.

415
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,179
You made that happen.

416
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,879
Who do you think
Dan Soo will believe?

417
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:38,350
Before you take him,
I must speak with No Ah's mother...

418
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,689
I'm No Ah's mom.

419
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:41,090
Why would you take No Ah?

420
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,189
Wasn't it nice that
Daddy came to pick you up?

421
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:45,389
A secret between me and Dad.

422
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:47,590
She threatened me,
using you as an excuse.

423
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,730
Dan Soo.

424
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,100
Was it just money that she wanted?

425
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,570
What should I do?

426
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,969
I keep thinking of that person,
and it makes me so mad.

427
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,469
