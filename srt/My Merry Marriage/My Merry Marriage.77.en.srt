1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,140
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,009
Min Gi...

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,550
was with me...

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
last night.

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,919
At my place, in my room.

6
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,660
He was with me last night.

7
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,829
You've made such a foolish choice.

8
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,170
You'll soon realize everything,
one by one.

9
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,000
The price for ignoring my advice.

10
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,710
You'll surely pay the price now.

11
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,409
You're always so concerned about me.

12
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,049
Thank you.

13
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,990
Do you not understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

14
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,359
If you're here to congratulate us,
please just applaud.

15
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,060
And make sure you have some food
before you go.

16
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,429
The food here is very good.

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,609
At my place, in my room.

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,420
He was with me last night.

19
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,919
Should we...

20
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:48,889
run away?

21
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,430
Why aren't you coming in?

22
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,479
We're late. Let's get going.

23
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,409
Let's go.

24
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,199
May the path you've chosen...

25
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,669
not be a thorny one.

26
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,169
May the path ahead of you...

27
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,879
be filled with softness and warmth.

28
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,879
May the hand you're holding...

29
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,090
be a sturdy bridge for you.

30
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,090
All I can do for you is
put my hands together...

31
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,289
and pray.

32
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,300
(Episode 77)

33
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,399
All right.

34
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,240
As you know, Jung Ssang Sook
loves my soy sauce marinated crab.

35
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,709
My goodness.
It's so demotivating to know...

36
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,850
that she'll be the one eating
all this food. I can't stand her.

37
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,620
It's your first time...

38
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,620
making food for Gong Hee's in-laws.

39
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,959
First impressions last forever,

40
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,689
so you'd want to leave
a good impression, right?

41
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,860
I just hate her guts. That's all.

42
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,000
If you keep saying you hate someone,

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,930
that person will hate you too.

44
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,470
You're so right.
You know what's fascinating?

45
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,439
When I hate someone,
that person hates me too.

46
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,279
When I like someone,
that person likes me too.

47
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,910
- Exactly.
- I guess...

48
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,579
feelings are contagious too.

49
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,019
They absolutely are.
If someone hates you,

50
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,019
it means it all started with you.

51
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,449
Mom!

52
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,319
I'll help.

53
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,019
Why did you make so much food?

54
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,389
Well, Grandma said we should.

55
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,560
My gosh, Grandma.

56
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,569
When your mother got married,

57
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,800
we were struggling financially,
so I married her off...

58
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,310
with nothing but some pickled plums.

59
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,709
I still feel so bad about it
to this day,

60
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:00,550
so I wanted to cook up a feast
for my granddaughter.

61
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,509
My gosh, Mom.

62
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,050
Grandma.

63
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,050
My goodness, yes. This is nice.

64
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,250
Goodness me.
I don't have a mother or a daughter.

65
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,889
Poor me.

66
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,990
Come on, Auntie Gyeong Bok.

67
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,160
You know I love you, right?

68
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,029
What? For real?

69
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:24,040
For real, of course.

70
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,639
I read this somewhere.

71
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,370
Do you know why the Korean word...

72
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,310
for "aunt" has the character
for "mother" at the end?

73
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,379
Because your aunt is like
your second mom.

74
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:35,449
What?

75
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,579
Are you saying I'm your second mom?

76
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,819
That's right.
I'm Maeng Gong Hee's second mom.

77
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,160
Bring it on.

78
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:50,389
- My gosh.
- My sweetheart.

79
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,470
Gong Hee, you'll live a great life.

80
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,240
They say
kindness is always rewarded.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,110
You're the kindest person I know.

82
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,939
I can guarantee it. My goodness.

83
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,610
Lady Luck will shine on you,
and you'll live a great life.

84
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,810
My dear Gong Hee.

85
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,180
Thanks, Auntie.

86
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,389
- My auntie!
- Yes! Oh, my.

87
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,790
- Mom!
- Yes!

88
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,189
My second mom.

89
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:22,360
- Mom.
- Yes.

90
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,199
I trust you'll keep your promise.

91
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,839
You told me you knew what it meant
to take responsibility.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,269
I'll be good to you, Father.

93
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,540
You don't need to be good to me.

94
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:38,779
You just have to be good
to Gong Hee.

95
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,279
There's nothing more
to married life.

96
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,980
Just make sure your wife is happy.

97
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,189
But actually,

98
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,149
that's the hardest thing of all.

99
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,689
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

100
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,560
Gong Hee.

101
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:03,269
Here.

102
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:09,470
Then, we'll be going now.

103
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,279
By the way, are you okay
with not going on a honeymoon?

104
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,250
Well, things are busy at work now,

105
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,920
and we'll go when the baby is born.

106
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,819
I'll make sure to take her...

107
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:21,990
when she can go away
without any worries.

108
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,189
Now's an important time for Mr. Seo
at work.

109
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
What? "Mr. Seo?"

110
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,560
Will you keep calling him that?

111
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,300
Oh, that's what I'm comfortable with
for now.

112
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,970
But you two are married now.

113
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,040
You don't have to be so polite
to each other anymore.

114
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
That's right.

115
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,610
It doesn't sound right to me either.

116
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,009
Right.

117
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,850
We'll figure it out.

118
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,050
Oh, my. She said "we."

119
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,919
We'll be going now.
We'll come by often.

120
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,320
- Okay.
- Is this it?

121
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,419
- Yes.
- I'll take that.

122
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,190
- I'll be outside.
- I'll be back.

123
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,389
- Okay.
- Grandma, I'll be going now.

124
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:02,889
Gong Hee.

125
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,529
Yes, Grandma.

126
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,070
In life,

127
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,539
there will come a time
when you must make a decision.

128
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,639
When that time comes,

129
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,909
just think about
what makes you happy.

130
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,450
That's how you won't have regrets.

131
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,009
I'll keep that in mind.

132
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:25,750
Stay healthy, Grandma.

133
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,519
Get going now.

134
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,059
Ssang Sook must be craning her neck,
waiting for you.

135
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,399
All right.

136
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:55,110
You should go now.
Min Gi is in the car already.

137
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,820
Dad, what will you do now...

138
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,980
since you don't have anyone
to work out with every morning?

139
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,620
You can come by often.

140
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,259
It's not like you're going far away.

141
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,899
You should still exercise
even if it's by yourself.

142
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,629
Be sure to take care of yourself.

143
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,870
All right.

144
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Gong Hee.

145
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,639
Gosh, Dad.
Why do you keep apologizing to me?

147
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,779
Don't worry, Dad.

148
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,019
Don't look back.

149
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,690
Just keep going forward.

150
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,230
Don't wonder
what you might have left behind...

151
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,629
and let it hold you back.

152
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,399
Dad, why are you crying?

153
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,000
You're making me cry too.

154
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,409
I know you'll live a good life.
I believe in you.

155
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,639
You've always done that.

156
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,779
You always overcame things bravely.

157
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,419
No matter what happens from now on,

158
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,990
keep going forward
as you normally would.

159
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:13,389
Okay.

160
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:17,360
I broke so many people's hearts
by choosing this path.

161
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,730
I'll walk down the path
without wavering.

162
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,169
I have to live a good life,

163
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:24,769
no matter what.

164
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,549
Come on, Dad.

165
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,879
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:40,549
My gosh.

167
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,490
I'm sorry, Gong Hee.

168
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:48,059
Why do you keep saying that?

169
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,759
Why?

170
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,559
It's nothing.

171
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,740
Don't cry for me

172
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:05,710
Don't be sad for me

173
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,279
Don't look at me like that

174
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,289
You look like
you've lost all meaning to life

175
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,590
That look on your face

176
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,629
Don't love me

177
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:34,169
Our love has come to an end

178
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:42,710
Why did you just let me leave

179
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,220
- Hey.
- We're here.

180
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,919
Welcome. Yes.

181
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,250
What took you so long?

182
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,919
Well...

183
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:55,990
Father, Mother.
Please look kindly upon me.

184
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:59,299
Gong Hee's family
packed all this food for us.

185
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:02,029
Goodness,
they didn't have to give us so much.

186
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,769
How should I express my thanks?

187
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,200
Are they trying to
bombard us with food?

188
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
They shouldn't have sent so much.

189
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:09,769
They made sure to pack
some soy sauce marinated crab...

190
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:11,610
because you like it, Mother.

191
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,710
They didn't add anything weird
to give me a stomachache, did they?

192
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,110
Pardon?

193
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,320
Mom, what kind of joke is that?

194
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,919
I'm not joking.

195
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,360
Then, we'll go upstairs
and get some rest.

196
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,690
All right. You must be tired.

197
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,059
Go upstairs and rest.

198
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,789
Okay, Father, Mother.
We'll turn in for the night.

199
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,259
All right.

200
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,230
Yes, go on up.

201
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,330
Good.

202
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,269
Hey.

203
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:44,809
How much longer will you glare
at Gong Hee like that?

204
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,179
If you're not going to take my side,

205
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:48,549
just keep your mouth shut.

206
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,850
I need time to pull myself together.

207
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,919
You should open these up!

208
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,590
She said it was
soy sauce marinated crab.

209
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,919
I don't even have to look.

210
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
My goodness.

211
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,129
"I should try to like her."
I keep telling myself that,

212
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,529
but it just doesn't work.
What am I supposed to do?

213
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,740
Gosh, what a shame.

214
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,840
Min Gi is way too good for her.

215
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,379
You must be really tired.

216
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,950
Just unpack tomorrow. Rest for now.

217
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,120
So, I have something to say.

218
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,059
Last night,

219
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,159
were you with Ms. Kang Ji Na?

220
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
What?

221
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,740
Ms. Kang came to
the bride's waiting room and said...

222
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,610
that you were together last night.

223
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:58,179
Ms. Kang told you something
that could be taken the wrong way.

224
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,850
My stuff.

225
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,289
I had left some things there,
so I went to get them back.

226
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,129
I'll believe you.

227
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,360
You promised me before the wedding.

228
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,970
That we'd both take responsibility
for the baby.

229
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,340
That we'd never do
anything shameful as Momo's parents.

230
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,639
Yes. Let's work on it together.

231
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,529
Why are you lying there awake?

232
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:47,500
I can't sleep.

233
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,470
Are you worried about Gong Hee?

234
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,179
Ssang Sook will be so mean
to Gong Hee.

235
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,110
I'm wondering
if I should've taken out debt...

236
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,509
to get them a small apartment
or something.

237
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,919
Even if Ssang Sook doesn't show it,

238
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,950
she still has a good heart.

239
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,590
And Gong Hee will be good
to her in-laws.

240
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,629
Don't worry so much.

241
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,159
Mom, you even got down on your knees
before my mother-in-law...

242
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,730
because of me.

243
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,370
I don't think I could ever do that.

244
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,669
I can't even ask her
to be nice to Gong Hee.

245
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,409
I must have a long way to go
before I can be like you.

246
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,980
You're doing your best too.
You're doing a good job.

247
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,190
Mom, when I got married,

248
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,860
did you feel this way too?

249
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,990
I'm worried about
every little thing,

250
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,330
and I feel so empty
as if I'm missing a limb.

251
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
That's right.

252
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,309
I did.

253
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,179
My daughter.

254
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,980
My beautiful daughter.

255
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,080
It felt like yesterday...

256
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,389
when I braided your hair
and sent you off to school.

257
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,620
Thinking about
how hard you'd have to work...

258
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,460
as you cooked and cleaned,

259
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,059
it made my heart ache so much...

260
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,200
that I couldn't sleep...

261
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,440
for days on end.

262
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,240
Why did it have to
take me this long...

263
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,680
to understand
how you felt back then?

264
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,480
Why must we experience something firsthand
to understand it?

265
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,119
That's what breaks my heart.

266
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,289
To know that your heart
ached this much back then too.

267
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:08,329
Maeng Gong Hee.

268
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,140
She's really gone.

269
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,319
Oh, hello.

270
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:31,559
Why are you here so early?

271
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:33,890
I should prepare breakfast.

272
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,160
I'll take care of it.
I don't need your help.

273
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,559
Do you even know
what we normally have for breakfast?

274
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,329
Still, I should help you. Wait.

275
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,970
I got this.

276
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,609
Oh, right.

277
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,839
About the food my family sent.

278
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,650
They should be refrigerated.
May I put them away?

279
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,650
Hey.

280
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,349
Tell your mom not to send anything
unless she knows what she's doing.

281
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,190
Pardon me?

282
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,619
She sent all sorts of salty dishes.
They're bad for you.

283
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,559
We don't eat stuff like that.
We're on a low-sodium diet.

284
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,460
Oh, I heard you liked
soy sauce marinated crab.

285
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,000
I used to, but not anymore.

286
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,170
There are other dishes like
braised short ribs and fritters.

287
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,339
Like I said, we don't eat
such salty and sweet dishes.

288
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,440
She never even bothered to ask
before sending all this food.

289
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,640
What are we going to do
with all that food?

290
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,680
It'll all end up in the compost bin.

291
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,450
You don't need to help me.

292
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,250
Just take care of those.

293
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,220
Either throw them out
or give them away.

294
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:39,859
But...

295
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,250
Mom.

296
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,220
Yes. Hi, Gong Hee.
Did you sleep well?

297
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,089
Yes, I did.

298
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,759
What about you, Mom?

299
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,930
I slept like a baby.

300
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,559
I guess you're happy that I'm gone.

301
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes. The house feels more spacious
and comfortable without you.

302
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,839
Ask her how Ssang Sook reacted
to the food.

303
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,009
My goodness. Did she pass out
because it was too good?

304
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,579
Hey, did they like the food?

305
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,980
Oh, yes.
Of course, they all liked the food.

306
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,650
They said to thank you
on their behalf.

307
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,390
Yes. I'll see you soon, Mom.

308
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:49,829
Okay, bye.

309
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,769
Gong Boo moved out,

310
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,670
and Gong Hee is gone too.

311
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,109
I must say, the house feels empty.

312
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,150
Why are you eating like a bird?
It's not nice to see.

313
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,480
Just don't eat, then.

314
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,650
His heart must feel empty
now that his daughter is married.

315
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,190
Are you the only one
who married off their daughter?

316
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,589
I did too.

317
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,190
You have me!

318
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,759
Oh, hey.

319
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:28,900
- Here.
- I'll live with you forever.

320
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:32,339
Right. We have you, Dan Soo.

321
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:34,839
- Thanks to you, we won't be lonely.
- That's right.

322
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,769
To do Gong Boo
and Gong Hee's part too,

323
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:37,910
I'll have three bowls of rice.

324
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:40,180
All right. Eat as much as you want.

325
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,450
If you want to do
Gong Hee's part too,

326
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,779
three bowls won't do.

327
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,519
Right. Then we'll need
more than one rice cooker.

328
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,779
I hadn't thought of that.

329
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,019
Mom, I'm here!

330
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:54,460
Father, we're here!

331
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:58,130
What? What's going on?

332
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,430
What?

333
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,529
- Hello.
- My goodness.

334
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,240
- Say hello.
- Why are you here so early?

335
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,839
What's with the suitcases?

336
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,380
Oh, we're going to live here
from now on.

337
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,640
My goodness. This is nuts.

338
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,079
Who said you could do that?
Who said you could move in with us?

339
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,779
Come on, Mom.
I know you're happy that we're here.

340
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:21,849
You must be lonely
now that Gong Hee moved out.

341
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,720
We're here to comfort you, Mom.

342
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,759
What? You don't need to comfort me.

343
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,529
I want to be lonely.

344
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,089
I want to enjoy solitude too!

345
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,900
Mother, please.

346
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:37,599
Ssook Ssook will be born soon,
you know.

347
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,170
And his clinic is very busy
these days.

348
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,039
Can't you please help us out...

349
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,009
just until
the kids are a little older?

350
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,809
You know, No Ah and...

351
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,150
I want to live happily with you,
Grandma.

352
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,789
What did you say, No Ah? Louder.

353
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,859
No Ah wants to live with Grandma.
Happily.

354
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,029
Oh, my goodness.

355
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,490
You guys must've had a script
for this or something.

356
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,960
Did you make No Ah
practice that line? Goodness.

357
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,799
- My, look who's here.
- Hello.

358
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,900
Hi. No Ah,
I guess you wanted to live...

359
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,809
with me and your grandma.

360
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,210
Grandpa!

361
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,339
Yes, sweetie.

362
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:22,109
Hi, I'm Gu Dan Soo.
Call me Uncle Dan Soo.

363
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:24,349
Uncle, you're handsome.

364
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:26,380
Hey, you have a good eye.

365
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,220
Mother, we can go ahead
and unpack...

366
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,789
in Gong Boo's old room, right?

367
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:33,660
You guys. Are you serious?

368
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,059
Hey, who said
you could move in with us?

369
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,490
Honey, did you give them permission?

370
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,559
What was I supposed to do?
They said they had no other choice.

371
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,769
Whatever.
I never gave them my permission.

372
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:43,369
No Ah.

373
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:45,769
- The house is bustling again.
- I love you, Grandma.

374
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:49,109
This means more work
for Myung Ja again.

375
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:18,769
(Cashier's Check, 10,000 dollars)

376
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,940
This is an emergency fund,
not a money gift.

377
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,410
Use it when you crave
spicy tteokbokki.

378
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,549
You're not alone.

379
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,049
Never forget that.

381
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,349
(Waiver of Parental Rights)

382
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,329
Hello.

383
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,970
Oh, Dan Soo.

384
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,769
I want to let out the shoulders.
You can do it, right?

385
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:27,440
Yes, of course.

386
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:29,410
But...

387
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,140
it'll take some time.

388
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,650
Oh, actually...

389
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,779
This.

390
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,119
Can you try it on?

391
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,319
Pardon?

392
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,190
Well...

393
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,359
I made this for you, Dan Soo.

394
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,529
What? For me? Why?

395
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:56,369
Well...

396
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,670
Oh, I mean...

397
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,509
The shirt I made you
fit you well, so...

398
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,740
And you make any clothes
look good, so I just...

399
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,549
Even so, this is a bit much.

400
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,250
I can't take this for free.

401
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,220
Come on. It's a gift.
Your birthday is coming up.

402
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,119
Try it on.

403
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Please?

404
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,839
Oh, no.

405
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,509
The stitching here needs
a little more work.

406
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,910
I'll fix it right away.

407
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,009
Oh, okay.

408
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,890
(Hwang Ik Sun, Oh Jung Eun)

409
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,660
Oh, my.

410
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,400
Why is my grandma's name
on that thing?

411
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,140
What did I just see?

412
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,210
It looked like
some sort of agreement.

413
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,339
But why would you and my grandma...

414
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,289
(My Merry Marriage)

415
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,829
Look here.

416
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:31,559
Why did you do something
I never told you to do?

417
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,200
Do you think
you can ignore me like that?

418
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,869
- What is it?
- I came to ask you something.

419
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:37,099
Tiffany Alterations.

420
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,970
Do you know Ms. Audrey?

421
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,599
Mom,
shall we watch a movie together?

422
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,839
- I haven't gotten to do...
- Let's do that.

423
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,069
so much with you, Mom.

424
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:46,910
Mother, could you pick up No Ah
from daycare?

425
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,410
What? Mom, don't go anywhere.
Wait here, okay?
