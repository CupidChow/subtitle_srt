1
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,320
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Maeng Gong Hee.

3
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,930
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

4
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:06,970
You're the one
who's going through something.

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,070
Maeng Gong Hee, you fool.

6
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,370
Why would you endure it
all by yourself?

7
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,279
I'll give you five seconds.
Explain what's going on.

8
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,650
Nothing's going on.

9
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,220
I just wanted to see
how much taller you've grown.

10
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,060
I thought you had grown quite a bit,

11
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,459
but you're still like a little kid.

12
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,129
Hey, I used to be taller
when we were little.

13
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:36,159
Yes, when we were little.

14
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,899
Back then, you were taller...

15
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,200
and stronger than me.

16
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,310
So...

17
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,709
you always protected me...

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,879
and took care of me.

19
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,050
You think you can act up because
Maeng Gong Hee has got your back.

20
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,390
Bring it on!

21
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,440
Now, I'm taller than you,

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,209
and I'm quite strong too.

23
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,940
So, don't think you have to
suffer through it alone.

24
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,140
Hey.

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,349
Are you saying this
because you know something?

26
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,849
Hey, Maeng Ggong.

27
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,050
Do you remember what I wrote...

28
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,589
on the envelope of my money gift
at your wedding?

29
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,890
"You are..."

30
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,290
"not alone."

31
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,730
That's right.

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,959
Never forget it.

33
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,200
The fact that you're not alone.

34
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,719
We've been busted anyway.

35
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,989
If Gu Dan Soo knows,
it's only a matter of time.

36
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:10,429
No. What did we even do?

37
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,290
Seo Min Gi.

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,899
The fact that we used to
live together is no big deal.

39
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:17,170
It's all in the past now.

40
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,630
What could anyone do
with that information?

41
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,769
What about our relationship?

42
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,839
We still love each other.

43
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,209
End things with her,
and we'll start over.

44
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,209
Calm down and try to be coolheaded.

45
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,010
Why have I been holding out
all this time? What for?

46
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,920
I can't let myself fall down here.

47
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,619
Why must you be so stubborn?

48
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,749
I said we should go to Dodo Group.

49
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,619
You should've just listened to me.

50
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,760
People can see what's going on,
and they'll gossip.

51
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:46,830
They'll say
I married a good catch...

52
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,830
and ignore all of my hard work.

53
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,100
That's not what I want.

54
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,439
You already know that.

55
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,439
Why is it so hard
for me to love you, Seo Min Gi?

56
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,519
How could I not nag?

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,689
You disappeared overnight,

58
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,450
and all your things were gone too.

59
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,589
What was that burial gown for?

60
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,019
Are you happy
that you drove me insane?

61
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,429
Gosh, my ears hurt.

62
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:19,189
There's nothing much to pack anyway.

63
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:20,330
You got some rest.

64
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,630
Let's go home now, Mom.

65
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,630
This is my home now.

66
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,239
Where am I supposed to go?

67
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,239
Mom!

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,209
Listen carefully, Myung Ja.

69
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,939
This is my final home.

70
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,739
I moved here.

71
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,879
And I love my new house.

72
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,780
Why are you doing this, Mom?

73
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,850
Do you want to drive me
even more insane?

74
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:48,090
Stop asking me to go with you.

75
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,119
I hid in case you'd react like this.

76
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,360
You're sick, Mom.

77
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,429
You should
at least receive treatment.

78
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,160
It's all no use.

79
00:04:56,559 --> 00:05:00,100
Mom, you just have to do
what they tell you at the hospital.

80
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,499
Modern medicine has gotten
so much more advanced.

81
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,670
I...

82
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:06,639
don't want to bleed my kids dry...

83
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,910
and shove things into my body...

84
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,710
just so I can live longer.

85
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,179
Mom.

86
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,319
Come here and sit down.

87
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,489
As I cleaned out my house,

88
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:28,499
I got rid of everything,

89
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:33,329
but I made sure to pack
the notebook with your poems in it.

90
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,199
Here.

91
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,939
Read some poems for me, Myung Ja.

92
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,910
Go on and read for me.

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,790
"Mom's Sunshine."

94
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,290
"The sun shines down nicely
on my yard."

95
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,660
"Mom dries chili peppers
in the sunlight."

96
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,730
"She dries the chili peppers..."

97
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,499
"and raises us."

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,800
"Even when the chili peppers are
all dry..."

99
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,270
"and we are all grown up,"

100
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:16,679
"the sun will still
shine down nicely on our yard."

101
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,679
"The sunshine..."

102
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,420
"will dry my mom's tears."

103
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,790
"Having grown up
eating those chili peppers,"

104
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,889
"we will come by
just like the sunshine."

105
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,929
How are you so good
at writing poetry, Myung Ja?

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,770
Once you're done growing your crops,

107
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,739
you harvest your chili peppers
and dry them.

108
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,410
Then, you burn
the dried pepper stems.

109
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,879
Once you go back to nothing,
you repeat that process.

110
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,189
That's the way of nature.

111
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,660
You only take what you need,

112
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,600
and you must let the soil rest too.

113
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,759
If you get greedy,

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,699
nature won't give you anything.

115
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,340
I have lived...

116
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,110
as much as I should.

117
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:19,869
I've done as much as I could.

118
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,579
I won't be greedy
and want a longer life.

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,189
Myung Ja,
you're so tender and warmhearted.

120
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,720
You came to see me often,

121
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,230
just like the sunshine.

122
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,329
Thank you.

123
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,770
I truly loved my life.

124
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,869
I got to meet you as my daughter.

125
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,939
I was so grateful for that.

126
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,309
I am...

127
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:59,079
thankful that...

128
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,420
you're my mom.

129
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,319
When my siblings and I get together,

130
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,590
that's what we all say.

131
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,790
That we're relieved to have you...

132
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:12,090
as our mom.

133
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,400
My goodness.

134
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,129
Thank you so much.

135
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,100
Mom.

136
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,499
That's all we need.

137
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,069
I've enjoyed
all the blessings in life.

138
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,179
I was able to provide
a small bit of shade for you kids.

139
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,079
I'm sorry that...

140
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,420
I'm putting a weight
on your shoulders until the end,

141
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:40,590
but I made a choice.

142
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,389
I want to be comfortable here...

143
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,960
until my time is over.

144
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm asking you this favor.

145
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,870
Let me do this, please.

146
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,270
This is my wish.

147
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,179
Let's do this, okay?

148
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,630
Dan Soo,
help out with the Heirmez project.

149
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:21,929
Me?

150
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,370
It might be hard for Min Gi
to work on it alone.

151
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,699
You should build
some experience too.

152
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,010
It won't be bad
to learn Min Gi's work either.

153
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,109
I never accepted your order
to stop the Holly project.

154
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,309
If I say to stop it,
you must do as I say.

155
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:41,150
I decide what our priorities are.

156
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,819
Min Gi's project takes priority.

157
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,949
It doesn't matter...

158
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:50,319
if I assume you're doing this to me
because of Mom, right?

159
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,260
We're at work.

160
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,459
Why are you mentioning
that useless thing?

161
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,370
What mom?

162
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,099
That kind of stain
doesn't exist in your life.

163
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,140
That's how I've raised you.

164
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,910
Executive Director Gu.

165
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,410
This is what the chairwoman wants.
You should accept it.

166
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,179
You can't continue to whine
like a child forever.

167
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,750
"Whine like a child?"

168
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:18,949
Don't be mistaken.

169
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,790
I'm sure the Holly project
is important as well,

170
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:26,530
but a large project as this
takes more than just passion.

171
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:28,630
If you look at the big picture...

172
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,900
and learn to move strategically,

173
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,370
it will be helpful for you.

174
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,270
You seem so proud of yourself.

175
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,410
Or is this also a part
of your great plan?

176
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,579
Anxiously worrying about
when your dirty secret...

177
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:44,910
might come out...

178
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:48,319
while pretending to be laid back
and well-mannered on the outside.

179
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,050
That must be your strategy.

180
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:52,949
Executive Director Gu.

181
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,160
Follow my decision.

182
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,729
It's right that we proceed
with Mr. Seo at the helm.

183
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:00,729
My gosh.

184
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,300
Isn't it childish...

185
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,729
to get revenge at work
for family matters?

186
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,969
Prove yourself
with your capabilities.

187
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,640
If you pull off Min Gi's project
as you help him out,

188
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,339
we will discuss
the next steps afterward.

189
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,780
Lead him well.

190
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:20,709
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,449
My gosh.

192
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,020
(Chairwoman's Office)

193
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,400
It was exactly this spot.

194
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,099
Where you handed me a chance
as if you were being charitable.

195
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:41,099
You seemed to want
to become the heir so badly.

196
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:44,240
I wasn't being charitable.
I was being fair.

197
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,910
Although, I'm not sure
if you know what that means.

198
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,339
I warned you.

199
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,349
You will regret it.

200
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,949
The position you got for free
as the chairwoman's grandson?

201
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:59,120
I'll rise to that position
through my own efforts.

202
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:02,089
Are you shameless or just bold?

203
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:05,260
Your defensive skills are beyond
what I imagined.

204
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,229
I caught you in the act.

205
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,329
Your office affair with Kang Ji Na.

206
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,400
You must be very mistaken
about something.

207
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,140
My relationship with Ms. Kang Ji Na
is already over.

208
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,010
Don't think to nitpick
for no reason.

209
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,880
So this is
how you'll slither out of this?

210
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:27,819
Do you think Maeng Ggong
doesn't know what's going on?

211
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,349
She's not just being fooled.

212
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,349
You don't even know
how she feels right now...

213
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,620
as she's putting up
with a man like you.

214
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,359
Whether you believe me or not,

215
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,990
I don't care.

216
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,429
You'll be working under me now,
so try to keep up.

217
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,199
You remember too.

218
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,829
Since we were little,

219
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,599
you've always been following me
from behind.

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,410
Seo Min Gi.
You want me to work under you?

221
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,579
That's what the chairwoman wants.

222
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,819
I'm going to make this project
a success, no matter what.

223
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,319
I have no intention of causing
any useless chatter.

224
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:07,890
So, don't misunderstand things.

225
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:10,719
Just follow my orders well.

226
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:13,630
You'll learn what it means
to do things right.

227
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
And I warned you too.

228
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,370
If you make Maeng Gong Hee cry,

229
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,030
I won't let you off the hook.

230
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,609
I told you to stay out of it
as it didn't concern you.

231
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,179
You still don't understand
what that means?

232
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,319
You don't even know
what's really precious to you.

233
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,120
And you don't even know
how to recognize good people.

234
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:41,089
And you think you have the brains...

235
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:43,760
to kick me out of this company?

236
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,660
Will you actually be able to do that
with your skills?

237
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:53,199
Try to do a proper job.

238
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,740
Starting now, at least.

239
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,069
It'll be exhausting
to be disappointed again.

240
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,959
Fine, wait and see.

241
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,800
Find out
what will happen to Dan Soo...

242
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,670
if he turns away from me
and decides to side with you.

243
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,400
Keep your eyes wide open
and see it for yourself.

244
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,479
Because of me...

245
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,150
What if I ruin Dan Soo's life too?

246
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:41,120
My dear Dan Soo.

247
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,650
I really don't want Dan Soo
to ruin his life because of me.

248
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,949
My gosh, I can't let that happen.

249
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:53,959
Hey.

250
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,630
Are you coming here from work?

251
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,030
Yes.

252
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,540
Oh, my. You just reopened your shop,
but you're already swamped.

253
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,410
Hey, is everything okay?

254
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,479
Did Chairwoman Hwang
not say anything?

255
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,380
Mom, by any chance,

256
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,449
did you visit Grandma?

257
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,890
It seemed like...

258
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,959
you wanted me
to get along with your grandma.

259
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,229
My goodness.

260
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:29,729
But I think
I made the situation worse.

261
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:34,969
Mom.

262
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,469
Why are you trembling?

263
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,809
If you have to be on the run...

264
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,579
like your dad,

265
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,949
then what should I do?

266
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,120
That won't happen.

267
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:51,020
I won't follow Dad's suit.

268
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,819
You see,
Maeng Ggong trained me well,

269
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,390
so it takes a lot to knock me out.

270
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,059
Grandma can never beat me,

271
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,189
so don't worry.

272
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,699
Oh, here.

273
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:09,770
It'll be nice to give this
to the other business owners...

274
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,339
to let them know
that you've reopened.

275
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,010
My gosh. You prepared this?

276
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,979
Let's start over.

277
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,209
One step at a time.

278
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,609
With a clean slate,
just like this new white towel.

279
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,550
Thank you.

280
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,449
What a thoughtful gift.

281
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,689
I'm more thoughtful than I look,
aren't I?

282
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,819
I'm incredibly thoughtful.

283
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,490
My goodness.

284
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,859
Right, Gong Hee's parents
and aunt should get it too.

285
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,059
I'm most grateful to them.

286
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,240
They all helped me so much...

287
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,640
until we could meet again.

288
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,910
They taught me how to give...

289
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,939
and receive love.

290
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:52,750
Yes, you're right.

291
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,579
Even when I was having a hard time,

292
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,790
they always stayed by my side
and took care of me.

293
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,459
With the neighbors in the building
and Chairwoman Hwang too,

294
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,199
I'll try to patch things up,
slowly but surely.

295
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,699
For you,

296
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,599
I'll try to be brave.

297
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,319
My goodness.
What Mr. Ryu said earlier...

298
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,460
got me all confused.

299
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,260
He went on about love and marriage.

300
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,329
Why did he say all that?
It made me blush.

301
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,369
Dear me. Never in my life...

302
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,629
have I received...

303
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,369
a single chocolate pie from a guy,
let alone real chocolate.

304
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:53,740
How sad.

305
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,180
My gosh.

306
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,809
That Detective An or whatever.

307
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,849
Why did he give me
those dried radish greens?

308
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,889
Does he want me to cook him
a batch of dried radish green soup?

309
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,159
Goodness. I'm not his wife.

310
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:11,589
That funny man.

311
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:15,859
What?

312
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,869
What brings you here again?

313
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,139
It's not like I wanted to come here.

314
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
Where is Kang Myung Ja?

315
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,169
Now that you two are in-laws,

316
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,909
you keep asking for her
every other day.

317
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,480
Are you two best friends now?

318
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,379
Why do you keep asking for Myung Ja?

319
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,819
Do you think I want to come here
and ask for her?

320
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,579
Ever since she and I became in-laws,

321
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,919
I haven't been able
to sleep peacefully at night.

322
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,520
I see. This must be about Gong Hee.

323
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,059
Since Gong Hee spent the night
at our house,

324
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,430
you wanted to come here and find out
if she spoke ill of you. Oh, boy.

325
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,470
I suppose you feel guilty
about a lot of things.

326
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,530
What? Why would I feel guilty?

327
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,339
Hold on, that chocolate.

328
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,970
It looks exactly like the chocolate
I gave to Mr. Ryu.

329
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:04,339
My gosh!

330
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,520
You mean, this?

331
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,790
Hey!

332
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,720
Why are you eating this? Why?

333
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Why do you have this?

334
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,690
Look at this. I tied this myself.

335
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,599
Well, I'm eating this
because I received this as a gift.

336
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,129
It's not like I stole this!

337
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:26,629
I...

338
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,800
I prepared this for Mr. Ryu,

339
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,210
so I worked hard
to wrap this nicely.

340
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,339
I'd rather...

341
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,250
eat this all by myself.

342
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,349
I refuse to share this with you,
Maeng Gyeong Bok.

343
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,520
Goodness. I don't want any.

344
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,190
It's too sweet.

345
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,359
It gets stuck between your teeth
and doesn't even taste good.

346
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
Hey.

347
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:52,190
You should've bought
something nicer.

348
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,490
Why did you get this?

349
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,129
No one would appreciate this
as a gift.

350
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,430
Do you even know
how much this costs?

351
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:01,899
It costs more than multiple servings
of your dumplings.

352
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,669
Forget it. You need to leave.

353
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,770
You won't hear anything nice
when Myung Ja comes back,

354
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,240
- so just go. Get out!
- My goodness!

355
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,109
- Leave. Get out!
- Hey! I'll never come back here!

356
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,280
Oh, dear. What a nuisance.

357
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:16,750
My gosh. You moved up in the world
overnight.

358
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,419
What brings you to this humble shop?

359
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,419
What's up?

360
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,619
Please, Gyeong Bok.

361
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:24,859
Here.

362
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:27,859
What's this?

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,030
I got you some towels.

364
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,829
I'm planning to give it
to every neighbor.

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Didn't you kick out
this old neighbor of yours...

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,970
from your new shop the other day?

367
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:41,680
I'm sorry about that.

368
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,079
I want to apologize.

369
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:48,280
Dan Soo prepared these towels.

370
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,819
When there were unsavory rumors
going around about me,

371
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,119
you and Myung Ja defended me.

372
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,260
I think I remember that.

373
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,129
I was going through something,

374
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,369
so I was snappy with you too.

375
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,770
Let's get back on good terms.

376
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,169
Like the white towel here,

377
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,040
let's start over with a clean slate.

378
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,780
Well, it is white indeed.

379
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,980
Forget it.
Just come to the poetry workshop.

380
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,319
I'm so bored without you.

381
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,690
Goodness. Don't write a poem
about these towels.

382
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,319
All right, Gyeong Bok.

383
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,859
Anyway, where is Myung Ja?

384
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,829
I want to give it to Myung Ja too.

385
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,599
Myung Ja found her mom.

386
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,599
She'll come home with her.

387
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,700
My gosh, really?

388
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm so relieved.

389
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,909
I know. Now, I can breathe.

390
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,510
Goodness. I kept thinking,

391
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,849
"Myung Ja will die first
at this rate."

392
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,579
- She'll be home with her soon.
- Oh, my.

393
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,780
- That's such great news.
- I know.

394
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,290
(Myeongwol Nursing Home)

395
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,819
Ma'am, please take good care
of my mom.

396
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,530
I promise you
we'll take great care of her.

397
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,359
It'll be much better
than her being alone...

398
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,700
because she'll be less lonely.

399
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,230
Don't worry too much.

400
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,500
- Please take good care of her.
- Of course.

401
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,470
I'll leave her in your care, ma'am.

402
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Mom.

403
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,559
Are you asleep, Mom?

404
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,169
Listen to the caregivers here,

405
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,339
and call me right away
if you feel sick.

406
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:57,240
I'll be going, then.

407
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,659
I'm leaving,

408
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:14,690
but I'll come back to see you.

409
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:32,649
The house
where Mom has lived all her life.

410
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,950
The house where Mom and Dad
made many memories together.

411
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,720
The house
where she raised us and missed us.

412
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,990
Just like that, Mom made the choice
to abandon that house.

413
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,730
So...

414
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,000
just like that,

415
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,869
I head home
as I leave Mom here alone.

416
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,609
Sadness clings to my feet...

417
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,879
like rocks and stones.

418
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,480
With every step I take,

419
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,550
it tells me to stop
and not to take another step.

420
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,919
- You're home.
- You're home.

421
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,020
You're back.

422
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,520
- You're back!
- What?

423
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,059
But why are you alone?

424
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,059
What about your mother?

425
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,730
Where is Grandma?

426
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,369
She's not coming.

427
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,099
What does that mean?

428
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,240
Didn't you meet her
at the nursing home?

429
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,510
I thought
you were coming home together.

430
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:36,180
She says she will just stay there.

431
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,210
Mom says it's her last wish.

432
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:40,950
Just leave it at that.

433
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,349
Oh, my. But...

434
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,220
But what is going on?

435
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,450
What do you mean,
it's her last wish?

436
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,319
What is that supposed to mean?

437
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,159
- Oh, dear.
- Is Grandma badly ill?

438
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,960
Dad, isn't Great-grandma coming?

439
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,599
Well...

440
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, dear.

441
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:08,109
- My goodness.
- Dad, you're home.

442
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,740
- Father, you're home.
- Yes.

443
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,780
No Ah.

444
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:15,649
Here, I bought some rice cakes.

445
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:17,419
You should serve them
with dinner later.

446
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:18,550
Gosh, it's heavy.

447
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,589
But why are you all standing around?

448
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,490
Where is Mother?

449
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:31,869
Hey.

450
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,770
Myung Ja.

451
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,770
What about Mother?

452
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,869
Where is she?
Why did you come home alone?

453
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,639
She says...

454
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:46,909
that's her home now.

455
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,750
She wants to...

456
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,419
spend the last of her days...

457
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,190
She wants to spend
her final days there.

458
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,399
What?

459
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,169
My goodness.

460
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,680
Don't we have
something to talk about?

461
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,889
You kept avoiding me at work too.

462
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:27,889
What's wrong?

463
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,190
If it's about what happened
between me and Kang Ji Na,

464
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,359
let's give it a rest.

465
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,490
It's just something from the past.

466
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,359
It's all over now.
You know that too.

467
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,329
I'm not trying to
talk about the past.

468
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,230
It's still going on now.

469
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,369
I saw it several times
right in front of my eyes,

470
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,139
but I still believed you.

471
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,869
Seeing you with Ms. Kang...

472
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,109
and seeing you being friendly
with each other.

473
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,109
You got the wrong idea.

474
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,010
We were just working together.
That's all.

475
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,710
Don't use your weird imaginations
to pick a fight with me.

476
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,579
"Weird imaginations?"

477
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,319
Then what were all the things
I saw and heard?

478
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,690
My gosh.

479
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,190
Gong Hee, you seem really tired now.

480
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:04,589
You're getting sensitive
over nothing,

481
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,790
and it's making you read too much
into things for no reason.

482
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,200
Everything you're imagining...

483
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,159
is just a delusion, so stop it.

484
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,069
Don't say anything strange
to other people...

485
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:14,369
and make them misunderstand too.

486
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,770
Who would I say this stuff to?

487
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:20,639
The chairwoman put me in charge
of a very important project.

488
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,579
She said she'd have Gu Dan Soo
report to me now.

489
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,909
This is a very important time.

490
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,980
Please don't let the chairwoman
hear about this stuff.

491
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:36,889
Are you going out again?

492
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:38,730
Where are you going?

493
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,329
It's an important call.
It's about work.

494
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,579
Hey, I told you not to call
whenever you wanted.

495
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,849
We should celebrate
defeating Gu Dan Soo...

496
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,010
and having
our project take priority.

497
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,780
I prepared champagne.

498
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,149
Later.

499
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,050
Come right away.
I can't wait for very long.

500
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,859
Well, I have an urgent meeting.
I have to go.

501
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,260
Don't go.

502
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,879
(My Merry Marriage)

503
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,510
I should've just carried her here
on my back.

504
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,149
- That's what I should've done.
- Myung Ja.

505
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:36,180
Let's go now. Let's go and get Mom.

506
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,020
Is she still not home yet?

507
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,389
Are you just getting home now?

508
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,250
Why? You should just live
with your parents.

509
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,260
- Everything is a mess.
- Who cares if it's a mess?

510
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,020
I like that we can be here together
at this very moment.

511
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,760
Mr. Gu, I need you to do your best
for my project from now on...

512
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,230
as per the chairwoman's orders.

513
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,930
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
