1
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,140
Ji Na and I...

2
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:24,980
will get married.

3
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:26,409
We won't break up anymore.

4
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,259
What do you think you're doing, Mom?

5
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,329
Do you want to see me die
from humiliation?

6
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,900
"Humiliation?"

7
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,400
Is this humiliating to you?

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,529
You're even more humiliating.

9
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,599
Why must you waste your time
with this good-for-nothing?

10
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:52,740
Tell him to leave this instant!

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,240
We will not break up.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
What is this,
the love story of the century?

13
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,890
Shall I wait and see
when you'll let that hand go?

14
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:13,890
I will never let her hand go.

15
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,600
"I do not have time
to imprison my love."

16
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,500
"I do not have time
to calculate things..."

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
"and push my feelings away."

18
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:26,369
"I don't have enough time
to do nothing but just love."

19
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,139
My gosh.

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,540
It's so true, Mr. Ryu.

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,309
Life is too short
even if you do nothing but love.

22
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,680
Why is everyone so full of hatred?

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,619
Life is too bitter.

24
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,660
Hey.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,190
My goodness.

26
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,100
What happened to your clothes?

27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,800
It's nothing.

28
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,430
I don't believe you.
Something must've happened.

29
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:59,600
Who did this?
You need to tell me. Come on!

30
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:02,710
I'm not a kid.

31
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:07,210
So please leave me alone!

32
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,160
What? What did I even do?

33
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,790
Did he get into another fight
with Ji Na?

34
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,150
Go home.

35
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,219
I'll call you.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,390
And you shouldn't step in, Min Gi.

37
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:53,119
Kang Ji Na, you...

38
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,589
What on earth are you thinking?

39
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,599
(Ji Na)

40
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,909
(Seo Min Gi)

41
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,909
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,480
Even if you do end up marrying him,

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,980
you'll split up
in less than three months.

44
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,420
Then you will blame me
for not stopping you.

45
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,749
You'll lash out at me.

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,890
I know you very well.

47
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,789
All I want to do is love you,
Seo Min Gi.

48
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,059
Why does it have to be so difficult?

49
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,849
Goodness. Is this place
an athlete training center or what?

50
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,119
Do you want to become
a professional boxer?

51
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,059
How could you leave like that
without saying anything?

52
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,770
When I see you at work,

53
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,900
I'll throw a serious punch at you.

54
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,279
Maeng Gong Hee.

55
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,349
Hey, Maeng Gong Hee.

56
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,319
I told you to close the windows
when punching the punching bag.

57
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:40,200
What? What is this place?

58
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Where am I?

59
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:45,070
Right, I moved back home.

60
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
You woke up.

61
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,969
Yes, as you can see.

62
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,409
What are you doing in my room?

63
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,349
Please come with me.

64
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,789
Dan Soo, my baby.

65
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,960
Welcome home.

66
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:12,229
Thanks for listening to me
and coming home.

67
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't do it
because of what you said.

68
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,239
Now, you'll get married...

69
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,210
and let me appoint you
as my successor, right?

70
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,140
Hello, Dan Soo!

71
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,109
Welcome back.

72
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,620
They cooked up a feast for you
to welcome you back after a while.

73
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,390
Oh, thank you.

74
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,390
Of course.

75
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,320
Hurry up and dig in.

76
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,789
Well... Is there no soup?

77
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,690
Soup?

78
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,400
I need a bowl of rice with warm soup
to start my morning right.

79
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,770
Koreans must eat rice, you know.

80
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,440
We made sure
to prepare your favorite dishes.

81
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:57,370
Do we have some rice and soup?

82
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,279
We made some for ourselves,
and there's a bit left.

83
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,779
Would you like some?

84
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,010
Yes, please!

85
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:03,950
Do we have soybean paste stew?

86
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,690
Made with zucchini, potatoes,
and tofu.

87
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:09,789
- Yes.
- Sure thing.

88
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:10,989
Thank you.

89
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,589
We must eat Korean food.

90
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,900
Oh, boy. It feels so empty
without Dan Soo.

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,630
The table looks empty.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,070
As they say, presence
is more keenly felt in absence.

93
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,409
Dan Soo really loved
our soybean paste stew.

94
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,169
Mom, eat more.

95
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:31,440
Not just this stew.

96
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,580
He always gulped down a whole bowl
of soybean sprout soup too.

97
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,650
Whenever I asked him if he liked it,

98
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,380
he was always like,
"It's unbelievably good."

99
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,950
Oh, my. He made me want
to cook more things for him.

100
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,049
I know.

101
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:45,359
I can't believe he left so suddenly.
I'm sad.

102
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,390
I must say, his grandmother
seemed pretty intense.

103
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,560
Tell me about it. I gave her...

104
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,599
crab marinade
and pretended it was coffee,

105
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,469
but she gulped it down at once.

106
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:01,109
My goodness.

107
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,279
Oh, dear. What if he's uncomfortable
and stressed at her house?

108
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:06,979
I can't stop worrying about him.

109
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,620
I'm done.

110
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,849
Why? Eat some more.

111
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,020
Well, I have to
go to work early today.

112
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:21,589
See you later.

113
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:22,690
- All right.
- All right.

114
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
My goodness.

115
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,200
What's with her today?

116
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,630
She always eats everything
on her plate.

117
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,570
I guess her stomach is still upset.

118
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,469
Should I go
and prick her finger again?

119
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,070
No, just finish your breakfast.

120
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,270
She'll probably take medicine later.

121
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:40,239
Oh, right. Gong Boo and his wife
are coming back today, right?

122
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,080
Yes, we should go
and get some groceries today.

123
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,750
We definitely don't need
to buy honey.

124
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,349
They're coming back
from their sweet honeymoon.

125
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,219
Good morning, Gong Hee.

126
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:23,919
Hello.

127
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,419
You're early.

128
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,859
The doors are closing.

129
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,070
Is everything going well with Holly?

130
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,400
I'll share the updates
at the meeting later today.

131
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,140
If it's too hard on your own,

132
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,940
you can share the workload
with others.

133
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,239
No, I'll try it on my own.

134
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,750
It's a very important project.

135
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,349
You should discuss anything
you get stuck on.

136
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,490
I'll stop by
the Administration Team.

137
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,980
I should go and see a doctor first.

138
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,880
The pregnancy test
could've been wrong.

139
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,890
It can't be right.

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
What is it now?

141
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,069
You didn't answer when I called.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,709
And what's wrong with you?

143
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,539
Your heart is swaying
after one word from your mother.

144
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:53,809
You told me to give things up,
so I did.

145
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,010
I told the chairwoman.

146
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,520
Isn't that enough?
What more do you want from me?

147
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,990
Give up?

148
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,090
If you want to take that back,
tell me now.

149
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,189
I'll give everything up neatly too.

150
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,029
I won't take it back,

151
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,199
ever.

152
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,069
Hesitating will only
leave you ruined.

153
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,169
You listen to everything
your mother says.

154
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:21,709
Min Gi.

155
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:24,980
Stop being so mad.
Please look at me.

156
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,350
You know...

157
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,520
I can't live without you.

158
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,650
What if someone comes in here?

159
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm not afraid of that.

160
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,590
I'll reveal everything.

161
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,360
"Seo Min Gi is my man."

162
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,630
"No one should try to steal him."

163
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,069
The day we get married,

164
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,209
I'm really going to cry so much.

165
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,209
Things are so hard for us.

166
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,079
You know what?

167
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,880
You always create
difficult situations yourself.

168
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,090
I know that.

169
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:11,120
I know,
so let's just stay like this.

170
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:14,020
Let's stay like this for a minute.

171
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,100
Let me rest my heart a little.
Please.

172
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,909
What are you doing over there?

173
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:38,949
Grandma.

174
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,919
You know that oak tree over there?

175
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,620
If we made acorn jelly
with the acorns from that tree,

176
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,159
how many blocks could we make?

177
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:50,760
Acorn jelly is really tasty.

178
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:55,169
Will you make acorn jelly
when you're taking time off work?

179
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,230
It's a waste to throw them away.

180
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,470
Gosh, seriously.

181
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,939
I granted you your wish.
Will you keep nagging me?

182
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,939
Stop talking nonsense...

183
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,480
and go to work.

184
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,209
There's someone...

185
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,220
I don't want to run into
for the time being.

186
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,449
Just leave me be.

187
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,189
Someone he doesn't want to run into?

188
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,789
Who on earth is it
for him to act this way?

189
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,600
I should hurry up
and change his mind.

190
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,730
This just won't do.

191
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:38,409
Gu Dan Soo is taking some time off
starting today.

192
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:39,640
Just a heads-up.

193
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,880
What? Taking time off?

194
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,750
Oh, I mean,
we're busy with the Holly project.

195
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,419
I was just surprised to hear
that he's taking time off...

196
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,520
all of a sudden.

197
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:51,520
How are things going?

198
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,260
You saw the designs
from Holly, right?

199
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,329
Now, if we send our designs back,

200
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:59,029
we'll get feedback from Holly.

201
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,029
We don't have much time left
until Fashion Week.

202
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,970
Not just our team,
but Design Teams A and B...

203
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,470
should all work together on this.

204
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,140
Will we have to work overtime
from now on?

(TF Team,
Marketing Manager Seo Min Gi)

206
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,329
Why would you skip work too?

207
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,299
The meeting with Ms. Kang's mother
is this evening, right?

208
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,510
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,909
I've reserved a VIP room
at a traditional Korean restaurant.

210
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,439
Let's just have her
come to the house.

211
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
Pardon?

212
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,949
If you suddenly change
the location...

213
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,520
I must seal the deal
once and for all.

214
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,449
I feel as though...

215
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,689
things might seriously go wrong
if we delay any longer.

216
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,720
That's what my gut tells me.

217
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,230
Eat up, ladies.

218
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,529
Just to let you know,
I added extra meat for you.

219
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,740
Oh, my.
After eating the dumplings here,

220
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,240
I can never eat dumplings
from anywhere else.

221
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,939
Hey, we don't get skimp
on ingredients.

222
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,909
You know that other dumpling shop
across the street?

223
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:21,110
They skimped on tofu
and built themselves a building.

224
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,110
You're bluffing.

225
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:24,449
All dumplings are
pretty much the same.

226
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:31,689
Thank you for coming
to my son's second wedding.

227
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,419
Whether it's the 2nd or 3rd time,
we should be there.

228
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,959
What are you even saying?

229
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,890
I think
they'll live happily this time.

230
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,329
Your daughter-in-law looks like
she has her act together.

231
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,699
How could she not have
her act together at that age?

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,699
She obviously looked like
she was over 40.

233
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,699
Here, eat up.

234
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,069
- Gosh, that's hot!
- Go on.

235
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:49,939
Oh, my. Hey!

236
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,169
My goodness.

237
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,809
Myung Ja,
you're a mother-in-law now.

238
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,409
That's right.
I'm a mother-in-law now.

239
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,679
Do you know what it takes
to be a good mother-in-law?

240
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,419
Act like a nice older girl friend
who likes to pay for meals.

241
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,990
Just that much.

242
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,890
Pay for meals?

243
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,289
- Not even cooking for them?
- My goodness.

244
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,929
You don't know what you're saying.

245
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,500
You think they'll like
their mother-in-law's cooking?

246
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:15,929
No.

247
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,569
They prefer mothers-in-law
who treat them to meals...

248
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:21,140
at fancy restaurants.

249
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,240
That's not true with me.

250
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,409
My future daughter-in-law
loves my cooking so much.

251
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,909
"I came to have your food, Mother."

252
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,179
She says that and keeps coming over.

253
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,850
You know, you lack in many ways.

254
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,020
But especially when it comes to
reading the room, you're hopeless.

255
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,590
You don't even know
that she's being fake.

256
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,260
Hey, if that's being fake,

257
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,329
would she offer to switch out
all of the furniture in my house?

258
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:47,000
She buys me so many clothes
and purses too.

259
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,470
Oh, she bought me this
the other day too.

260
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:51,970
This is a limited edition, so...

261
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,240
Here, eat up.

262
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:54,569
My gosh.

263
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,909
And my son will be getting married
in Dodo Hotel's Grand Ballroom.

264
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,449
You girls must come.

265
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,409
Hey, the meal there costs
hundreds of dollars per person.

266
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:06,549
- There you go. Open up.
- Gosh, that's hot.

267
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,419
Hey, seriously.

268
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,650
My goodness.

269
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,159
Hey, honey. Why?

270
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,140
Oh, my friend is treating us
to a meal...

271
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,439
for coming to her son's wedding.

272
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,470
We're just having some dumplings.

273
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:32,779
Why would I go there?

274
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:35,079
She invited important guests over.

275
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,079
Come and make some fresh kimchi.

276
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:38,779
It's the chairwoman's orders.

277
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,590
The housekeepers did
the grocery shopping.

278
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,520
Am I a vending machine
that sells fresh kimchi?

279
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,590
Do I look like a pushover to you?

280
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,459
You should just grovel to her
on your own.

281
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:51,529
Why are you dragging me into it too?

282
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,360
Hurry up!

283
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,299
My gosh.

284
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,640
Oh, dear.

285
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:13,549
What?

286
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,250
You're eight weeks pregnant.

287
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,730
The white part you see here
is the baby.

288
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,759
You can see the small arms
and legs forming, can't you?

289
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:31,540
The baby is about 2.1cm long.
It's growing really well...

290
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,070
at the normal rate of growth.

morning sickness?

00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,739
Well, when I smell food,

294
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:40,340
I feel queasy,

295
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,749
and I keep getting drowsy.

296
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,050
Most women experience
those symptoms in early pregnancy.

297
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:47,350
Things could get worse
from the eighth week on,

298
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,449

299
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,989
You might experience anemia too.

300
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:52,959
Be sure to take iron supplements.

301
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,489
And you might have some pain
in your chest and belly.

302
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,999
Don't worry too much, though.

303
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,570
But...

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,070

00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:27,130
Don't worry about anything else.

361
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,600
I just want the two of you
to live happily together.

362
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,870
Embrace each other's flaws
and be there for each other.

363
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,780
Goodness. She has seen
all of my flaws already. Hey.

364
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,550
Don't worry.
We'll live a happy life together.

365
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:47,919
Honey, you should say
a few words too.

366
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:51,650
I wish you all the best.

367
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:56,130
What? Myung Ja told you
to say a few words, but that's it?

368
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,790
Say a few more words.

369
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,030
A few more encouraging words.

370
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,530
Live happily on your own.

371
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,439
My goodness.

372
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,469
You drive me nuts.

373
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,469
Of course, they should live happily.

374
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:11,810
If you get divorced twice...

375
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,479
Gosh, even just thinking about it...

376
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:17,479
Why are you saying
such a ridiculous thing?

377
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,880
What? I should say something too.

378
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,719
As his uncle.

379
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,890
Is that why you had to say
he might get divorced twice?

380
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:29,090
You're like two peas in a pod.
How encouraging. Goodness.

381
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,400
Oh, here.

382
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:38,130
- Oh, my.
- These are for you.

383
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,840
- My gosh.
- Why did you buy so many things?

384
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,269
My goodness. One, two, three...
How many are these?

385
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,540
Oh, dear.
You didn't have to get a gift...

386
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,310
for every single person
in the family.

387
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,550
As you know, I don't have
any family elders in my family.

388
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,080
I thought of my parents
and grandparents...

389
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,989
and bought two gifts
for each person.

390
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,689
You must miss your parents a lot.

391
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Yes.

392
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,530
I couldn't stop thinking of them
on the day of our wedding.

393
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,659
Even during our honeymoon,

394
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,429
Hong Dan said she missed her mother
and kept crying.

395
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:10,769
Of course. Come here.

396
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,209
Everyone...

397
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:19,580
has someone they miss
and lives with anger...

398
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,909
and sorrow in their heart.

399
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,850
Everyone keeps a jar of emotions
in their heart.

400
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,280
Some people let the emotions
consume them and kill them,

401
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,120
whereas some people...

402
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,590
let them ripen
and use them to grow as a person.

403
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,830
My dear granddaughter-in-law,
I know you're the latter.

404
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,600
I could tell that much
the moment I met you.

405
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,600
Grandmother.

406
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:46,769
Yes, my dear.

407
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
You two will live happily together.

408
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:51,310
You're staying for dinner, right?

409
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,939
Then let's have dinner
when Gong Hee gets home.

410
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,310
Yes, your mother bought everything
at the grocery store.

411
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,310
Thanks to you,
I get to enjoy this feast too.

412
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,850
- Tell them.
- What?

413
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,290
Oh, right.
We should go home and rest.

414
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,019
Gosh, she's tired.

415
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,459
What? My goodness.

416
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
She's just giving me a massage.

417
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,900
- Should I carry this?
- No, come on.

418
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,669
- All right. Let's go home!
- What? My gosh!

419
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:24,769
Everyone does
a little ceremony like this...

420
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:27,239
when they get home
from their honeymoon.

421
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,749
- What?
- The groom...

422
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,249
carrying his bride
in his arms like this.

423
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:32,249
Oh, boy.

424
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,019
Hey, you're already out of breath.

425
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,249
Stop bluffing.

426
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:39,360
Can you even walk all the way there?

427
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,560
Of course, I can.

428
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,790
I'm much younger than you.

429
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
Is that so? Then...

430
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,429
Hey, Mr. Chauffeur.

431
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,929
Escort me to the bed
safe and sound, please.

432
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:55,640
Yes, my lady!
Just feed me some rice!

433
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,209
I'm about to fall off.
Hold me properly.

434
00:25:58,469 --> 00:25:59,979
Let's go! Oh, boy.

435
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,449
I understand they were tired,

436
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:08,050
but how could they not have dinner
with us after their honeymoon?

437
00:26:09,689 --> 00:26:10,949
But they at least thought of us...

438
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:12,489
and brought back presents for us.

439
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:16,790
Goodness. I hear
young married couples these days...

440
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,759
say they're always busy
and rarely visit their families.

441
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,959
I'd never expect them
to stay overnight.

442
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,169
But they should've
at least stayed for dinner.

443
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,169
Do they not know that
we cooked up a storm for them?

444
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:28,169
We sent them home with some food,
so it's all good.

445
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,340
They probably wanted to have dinner
on their own.

446
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:34,140
Gosh, fine. I'm done.

447
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,209
Goodbye, my son.

448
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:39,120
Good riddance, seriously!

449
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,390
My gosh.

450
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:46,219
Goodness. Now that your son is gone,

451
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,590
you want
to get rid of your button too?

452
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,530
When a button falls out,
you have to stitch it back on.

453
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,600
It never feels nice
when a button suddenly falls out.

454
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,269
Why do I keep getting a bad feeling?

455
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:00,699
What do you mean?

456
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,169
I don't know.

457
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,739
I feel like
something is sitting on my chest.

458
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:08,810
My goodness.

459
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,350
- Let's go! Let's go inside.
- Hey, stop!

460
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,759
Be careful.
Ssook Ssook is growing inside of me.

461
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,759
Gosh, my back.

462
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,820
What?

463
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,499
Hey, put me down.

464
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,969
Hold on. Ouch, my back.

465
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,040
Oh, boy.

466
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,570
Hey, kid.

467
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:39,580
Who are you?

468
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:41,580
Do you know this kid?

469
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,749
- No.
- What?

470
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:46,780
Hey, do I know you?

471
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,120
Then why are you sitting here?
Where are your parents?

472
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:58,429
Me?

473
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,530
I am Maeng Gong Boo's son.

474
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:11,810
My son?

475
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,719
(My Merry Marriage)

476
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,130
He's your son.

477
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,189
I raised him by myself
for the past five years.

478
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:32,900
It's about time
you played your role as his father.

479
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,030
- Who are you?
- I'm Maeng No Ah.

480
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,600
You're here already.

481
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,900
- Are you done making fresh kimchi?
- You...

482
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,909
Hey! Do you want to get slapped
in the face with fresh kimchi?

483
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:44,370
Hong Dan! Honey!

484
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:47,310
I'm not moving an inch from here.
I'll wait all night long.

485
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
Things are tough, aren't they?

486
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,009
You don't look so great.

487
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,249
It's not like that.

488
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:53,620
Then do you have
some other kind of concern?

489
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,120
