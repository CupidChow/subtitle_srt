when filming with children.)

(Myeongwol Nursing Home)

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,230
(Episode 99)

4
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,869
Goodness. Everyone has to
fill out the visitor application.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,339
I see.
I guess they'll bring her down here.

6
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:44,409
I want to go up to Mom's room
and see her.

7
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,080
Well, they have their own rules.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,450
We have to follow the rules.

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,889
I want Mom to have
this warm ginger tea.

10
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:54,190
Can you go and find a cup?

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,289
Sure, no problem.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,509
Mom, why are you in a wheelchair?

13
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,639
She pulled her back last night.

14
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,009
Your back? What happened?

15
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,649
I think she had a dizzy spell.

16
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,120
Don't worry.

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,450
I tripped
while going to the bathroom.

18
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,449
This is my car now.

19
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,530
My goodness, Mother.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,660
- Yes, hi.
- I'm here.

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,229
Yes, my son-in-law is here.

22
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,399
Mother, how are you feeling?
Are you all right?

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,600
Don't you worry.
Don't worry about me.

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,309
Please come with us, Mother.

25
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,250
This really isn't a good idea.

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,809
If I have to leave you alone here,

27
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:53,720
I really will lose my mind, Mom.

28
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,080
Myung Ja.

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,350
Do you still not understand
what I want?

30
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,360
Should I refuse all visitors?

31
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,259
Or should I...

32
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,589
find some other place
and disappear again?

33
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:06,830
Mom.

34
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,199
Oh, dear.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,399
Right now,

36
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,300
I'm preparing for my last days
as a mother.

37
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:17,209
It was my choice to live my life,

38
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:20,380
so it's up to me to decide
how I want to die too.

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
My gosh.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,120
Take me to my room.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,359
I need to get some rest.

42
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:36,259
- Sure.
- No, I'll do it.

43
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,259
Gyeong Tae.

44
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,859
Stop butting in to help me.

45
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,669
Look how old I am.

46
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,199
Just because I'm breathing,
it doesn't mean I'm alive.

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,569
Waiting for someone to hold onto me.
Is that living?

48
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,139
I just want to live here
like this...

49
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,810
until I can finally...

50
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,979
quietly breathe my last
and leave my body one day.

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,160
I do not want to be a burden
to anyone,

52
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:10,060
nor do I want...

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,729
to keep lying in a hospital bed
while barely breathing.

54
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,500
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,039
Wait, Mother.

56
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,680
Mom, I brought
plenty of twisted donuts for you.

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,049
Share them with the nurses
and other patients here, okay?

58
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,750
All right.

59
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,880
And here.

60
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,319
I wrote you a letter.

61
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,190
Stop coming here.

62
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,919
You understand
what I'm saying, right?

63
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,229
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100
Mom.

65
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,269
- Mom.
- Honey.

66
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,169
Mother.

67
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:04,680
Oh, dear.

68
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:13,560
Your daughter must be upset.

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,259
She's busy enough
with her own life as it is.

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,030
But she keeps coming to see me
and bringing me things.

71
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,100
I came here
to keep her from doing that.

72
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,169
The next time she comes to visit,

73
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:29,840
don't let her in.

74
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,919
You're not going to take off
your stockings too, are you?

75
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,020
Well...

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,229
That's because...

77
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,799
I didn't know I'd have to
weigh myself so suddenly.

78
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,929
You need to tell me these things
at least two weeks prior...

79
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,499
so I can be prepared.

80
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,030
My gosh. Had I known about this,

81
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,340
I wouldn't have ordered sundae
along with tteokbokki last night.

82
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,309
I get it. Just get on the scale.

83
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:06,309
Darn it.

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,410
Please...

85
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:19,549
So,

86
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,489
that's not too bad
for a pregnant woman, right?

87
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,689
You are slightly overweight.

88
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,530
Overweight?

89
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,799
You know better than anyone else
that you're an older mom, right?

90
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,140
It looks like you called me here
to pick a fight.

91
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,939
That's right. I'm old.

92
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:39,340
I can estimate
how long your lifespan will be...

93
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,109
if I run some tests.

94
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,510
What did you say?

95
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,780
Gosh, of course.

96
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,320
The woman
Maeng Gong Boo was married to...

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
can't be normal.

98
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,020
Tell Gong Boo to watch out
for high cholesterol.

99
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,520
That runs in the family,

100
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,030
so have him get tested
at a university hospital yearly.

101
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,830
Don't let him eat
spicy and salty foods late at night,

102
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,729
and tell him
to exercise regularly too.

103
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,729
I see.

104
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,470
What? Hey, honey.

105
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,970
What are you doing here?

106
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,580
Well, I came because she said
she wanted to talk about No Ah.

107
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,580
But she suddenly measured my height
and weighed me.

108
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,280
Now, she even wants
to draw my blood.

109
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,189
Give it a rest, Soo Yeon.

110
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,460
Don't call her out
without my permission from now on.

111
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
I'm No Ah's birth mom.

112
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,229
I think I have the right
to check on...

113
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,989
the physical well-being
of his caregiver.

114
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,499
You don't have that right.

115
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,700
I fully trust this woman.

116
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:39,830
So, you should stop
crossing the line and interfering.

117
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,939
Stop butting in
on our family's business, okay?

118
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Let's go, honey.

119
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,739
Okay, let's go.
Let me grab my stuff, honey.

120
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,479
- What did you do?
- Oh, my earrings.

121
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,109
Let's go.

122
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,410
Hold on.

123
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Let's go.

124
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:58,989
(Doctor Lee Soo Yeon)

125
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,890
Hey, come in.

126
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:08,499
These are calla lilies.

127
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,770
- Yes.
- Dad liked these flowers, right?

128
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,629
You remember.

129
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,799
Of course.

130
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,939
For a while after you left,

131
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,869
I saw calla lilies...

132
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,539
every time I got home.

133
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,879
Dad must've wanted to...

134
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,109
greet you with these flowers
if you came home.

135
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,450
As your dad...

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,989
handed me these calla lilies,

137
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,720
he told me what they meant.

138
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,859
He said they stood for a love
that lasts a thousand years...

139
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,330
and that we should love
for tens of thousands of years.

140
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,640
(In Loving Memory of Gu Hae Joon)

141
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,650
What?

142
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,619
Who was here?

143
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,989
On Dad's death anniversary,

144
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,619
someone had left calla lilies
at his grave.

145
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,530
Was that perhaps...

146
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,330
you, Mom?

147
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,039
Only then...

148
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,609
did I realize
your dad had passed away.

149
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,010
Even when I wanted to give up
because things seemed too hard,

150
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,510
I still thought he must be
somewhere under the same sky.

151
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,950
When the wind would blow,

152
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,919
I'd imagine the same wind
blowing outside his window.

153
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,320
I kept thinking of your dad
like that...

154
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,530
and kept on living my life.

155
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,660
Just the fact that...

156
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,999
he was still alive
under the same sky...

157
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,269
was enough to comfort me.

158
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,310
I have someone...

159
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,310
like that too.

160
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,909
When the sun rises in the morning,

161
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,879
I imagine that person
looking at the same sun.

162
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,450
When the clouds go by,

163
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,119
I imagine them going by
above that person's head too.

164
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,330
When it rains,

165
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,460
I think it must be raining
outside that person's window too.

166
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,300
Just by thinking about that person,

167
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,529
I can endure another day.

168
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,670
Is that perhaps...

169
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,840
Gong Hee?

170
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,989
My meeting ran late last night.

171
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,430
I went straight to work from there.

172
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,029
Aren't you worried?

173
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:00,300
I told you last night
that my belly hurt.

174
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,700
Oh, right. Are you okay?

175
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,310
No.

176
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,340
I nearly lost Momo. Our child.

177
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,749
What do you mean by that?

178
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,109
I went to the emergency room.

179
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,019
I'm at risk of having a miscarriage.

180
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,790
Seriously consider
quitting your job.

181
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,889
What did you say?

182
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,389
Your job...

183
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:26,729
is taking a toll on you,
whether you realize it or not.

184
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm sure it must cause you stress...

185
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:36,040
Do you think I might have
a miscarriage because of work?

186
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,909
The Holly project is on hold too.

187
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:41,840
You don't need to overwork yourself
and keep going to work.

188
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,050
Resting at home
and taking good care of the baby...

189
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,749
It's not because of work.

190
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,220
"Quit your job
for the sake of the baby."

191
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,050
Is that all you can say?

192
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,290
I told you not to get so sensitive.

193
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,060
I'm worried as a husband and father.

194
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,560
That's why I'm telling you to quit.

195
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,460
Where did you go yesterday,
leaving your sick wife behind?

196
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,759
What was the meeting for?
And who did you meet?

197
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,830
You never even
explain anything properly.

198
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,899
But you call yourself
a husband and father?

199
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,310
This is exactly why
I don't want to come home.

200
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:14,879
Do you want me to be honest?

201
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,479
Even after I arrive at home,

202
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,879
I stay in the car for a while
before coming inside.

203
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,450
I can't breathe when I come home.

204
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,850
You keep suspecting
and badgering me.

205
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,359
How could I breathe in here?

206
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,859
Earn my trust if you want me
to stop suspecting you.

207
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,229
How can I believe you?

208
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,229
What is all this noise?

209
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,340
Hey, why are you yelling at him...

210
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,070
when he just got home
after a hard day's work?

211
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,609
Your parents-in-law live here too,
you know.

212
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,909
I knew you didn't have much respect
for your in-laws,

213
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,080
but you can't do this to Min Gi.

214
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,220
Even when I was raising Min Gi,

215
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,050
I never once raised my voice at him.

216
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,220
So how dare you yell at him?

217
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,029
I get that you're emotional
because you're pregnant,

218
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,960
but you're just being plain fussy.

219
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,460
Being pregnant doesn't mean
you can do whatever you want.

220
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,170
Son, where are you going now?

221
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,109
You just got home from work!

222
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,999
Are you okay, ma'am?

223
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,029
Don't make such a fuss.

224
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,269
The doctor got here on time
and treated me.

225
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,540
Why did she collapse again?

226
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:56,409
I believe it was hypoglycemic shock.

227
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,609
Have you been skipping meals lately?

228
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,050
I just ate a little less
because I was feeling so frustrated.

229
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,090
Don't get so dramatic over nothing.

230
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,190
But if this keeps happening,
it could become a serious issue.

231
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,729
You must make your health
your number one priority to...

232
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,060
My number one priority?

233
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,800
My number one priority is...

234
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,570
to get rid of that leech
who's stuck to Dan Soo's side.

235
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:23,940
Ma'am, I know that
you're very worried about Dan Soo,

236
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,269
but you'll be in big trouble...

237
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:27,609
if you neglect your health
like this.

238
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,879
Don't worry.

239
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,249
I won't be able
to take my last breath...

240
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:34,249
until I get rid of that thing.

241
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,019
I must live longer.

242
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:40,019
I will keep my eyes wide open...

243
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,259
and watch Dan Soo.

244
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,889
- Well, then.
- Right.

245
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,340
It seems like those at Heirmez
were quite impressed with Dan Soo.

246
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,310
They specifically asked that
he be in charge of the project.

247
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,379
As a designer,

248
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,580
Dan Soo has grown way more
than I expected.

249
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,649
I don't think I can keep him
under me for much longer.

250
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
How about you send him
to an overseas branch office...

251
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,619
for a couple of years?

252
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,460
Do you think he'll be up for it?

253
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
You opened
the branch office in France...

254
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,499
to expand the business into Europe.

255
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,999
The office hasn't produced
any meaningful results yet,

256
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,540
so we were talking about
closing it down.

257
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,869
Should I have Dan Soo...

258
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,680
run that office?

259
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,609
It won't be easy.

260
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,019
Even though we recruited top talent
in the industry for that office,

261
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,190
the business failed.

262
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:49,820
In any case, it might be a good idea
to separate them for the time being.

263
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,690
But he'll refuse...

264
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,029
to be separated from his mother.

265
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,330
Give him a task.

266
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,040
You can't really tear them apart
against their will.

267
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,820
You want me to go to France?
All of a sudden?

268
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,060
I should apologize
for treating you like a child.

269
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,529
You've grown quite a bit
as the heir to Jayce Fashion.

270
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:26,759
I give you that.

271
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,930
Finally,
you're giving me some credit.

272
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Goodness. It sure took you a while.

273
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,070
So, here's what I want you to do.

274
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,340
Go to the office in France.

275
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,409
So, am I being exiled
to that remote island?

276
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,479
That office is like a warehouse
with just a handful of employees.

277
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,040
I heard some rumors that
we were closing it down soon.

278
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:47,979
So, go there
and prove what you can do.

279
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,389
Get the Jayce Fashion brand
into Paris...

280
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:53,190
within a year.

281
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,259
You must open a boutique at
Raphaen Department Store in Paris.

282
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,320
That's your task.

283
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,330
But how?
You know how difficult it is.

284
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:01,659
Get it done.

285
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:03,560
Then I'll reconsider...

286
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,830
what you're so stubbornly
telling me to do.

287
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,940
If I succeed within a year,

288
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:15,810
you will accept Mom...

289
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,810
as family, right?

290
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,019
But if you don't succeed
within a year,

291
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,489
you'll have to give up.

292
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,590
This was your idea,

293
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,790
so just don't regret this later.

294
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,930
A year is more than enough time.

295
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,600
I'll prove how capable I really am.

296
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,029
Even if Mom stays by my side
for life,

297
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,100
no one will be able
to take issue with it.

298
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,369
I'll show you...

299
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,139
who the heir of Jayce Fashion is
for certain.

300
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,639
So, open your eyes wide
and watch me.

301
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,409
You shouldn't underestimate
this task.

302
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,310
Europe isn't an easy market.

303
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:54,879
We've been in the red for years
over there.

304
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,489
Besides, it might take you
a full year just to adjust.

305
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,220
Pulling off the impossible.

306
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,359
I should do just that
as the rightful heir.

307
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,369
Do you not need
to visit your mom again today?

308
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,170
She said she'd disappear again
if I kept visiting her.

309
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,409
She threatened me.

310
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
My goodness.

311
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,379
Oh, boy.
I don't want to stress her out,

312
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,209
so I can't visit her.
This is driving me crazy.

313
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,780
Don't worry too much.

314
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,090
It's better than her
being alone at home.

315
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,359
There, she at least has people
who look after her.

316
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,320
She's refusing treatment
when she's ill, so I'm worried.

317
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,629
And I think
her condition is getting worse.

318
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,060
She was in a wheelchair.

319
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,760
My goodness. Why?

320
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,000
She had a dizzy spell and fell.

321
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:49,169
Oh, no. That's really worrisome.

322
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,340
Oh, dear.

323
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,810
Mom, do you remember?

324
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,340
On rainy days,

325
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,949
you sat the five of us
in front of the charcoal brazier...

326
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,719
and made us donuts.

327
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,520
The sizzling sound
of the donuts being fried...

328
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,990
would get mixed
with the sound of the rain.

329
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,060
And the five of us
would sit together side by side...

330
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,929
while waiting
for the donuts to be ready.

331
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,899
Yes, I remember.

332
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:20,830
My sweet babies.

333
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:22,699
Mom.

334
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,709
Never forget that you have us,
your children.

335
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,379
We will protect you until the end.

336
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:34,149
I give you my word, Mom.

337
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,149
Just like how you took care of us,

338
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,020
we will take care of you, Mom.

339
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,359
So, never be anxious.

340
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,629
You have us.

341
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Ma'am.

342
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,369
Come out and have some food.

343
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,369
Sure.

344
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,550
All right.

345
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,879
Oh, no! Ma'am.

346
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,119
- Are you all right?
- Goodness.

347
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,689
I'm okay.

348
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:17,260
But this... My goodness.
I'll call your daughter.

349
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,459
No, don't.

350
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,760
No, please don't.

351
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:23,699
- There's no need.
- My goodness.

352
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,830
Please just...

353
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,669
keep it to yourself.

354
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,169
Don't tell anyone.

355
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
I have...

356
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,060
an important announcement to make.

357
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,500
About what?

358
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,399
Did they give us the go-ahead
to resume the Holly project?

359
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:03,139
We'll work on that together
when I'm back.

360
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,409
When you're back?
Are you going somewhere?

361
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:08,810
Grandma tasked me
with an assignment.

362
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:12,580
If I pull it off,
she'll accept Mom as her family.

363
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,550
I see. That's good news.

364
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:18,790
So, what's the assignment?

365
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,790
She wants me
to go to the office in France...

366
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,959
and make the business profitable
within a year.

367
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,530
Oh, the office in France?

368
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,129
If I ask you to come with me,

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
would you?

370
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,770
I know you're joking,
but thanks for asking.

371
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,109
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

372
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:41,939
You love to work.

373
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,780
For now, I'm going to
only think about my Momo.

374
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,619
Keeping Momo healthy
and giving birth.

375
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,580
That will be my sole focus for now.

376
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Goodness.

377
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,250
On the rooftop, you yelled
that you'd become successful...

378
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,219
and show everyone what you could do.

379
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,760
You yelled at the top of your lungs.
Where did that Maeng Gong Hee go?

380
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,600
Of course, she's still here.

381
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm just putting it on hold
for a little while.

382
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,030
Once I give birth
to my healthy Momo,

383
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,699
you'll see me back
in my busy-bee mode.

384
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,939
All right.
That's the Maeng Ggong I know.

385
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,980
So, have you already made up
your mind to go to France?

386
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,050
Should I...

387
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,250
not go?

388
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,219
Why are you asking me?

389
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,899
Do you need me by your side now?

390
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,800
Can you get through this alone
without me around,

391
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:41,939
Maeng Gong Hee?

392
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,369
Of course, you should go.

393
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:46,070
You are Holly.

394
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,639
Who am I?

395
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm Holly's avid fan who wants Holly
to become even more successful.

396
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,750
Go there...

397
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,780
and make Jayce Fashion known
in all of Europe.

398
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,520
Hey, come on.

399
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,490
Shouldn't you ask me to stay?

400
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,990
I'll probably waver
if you ask me not to go.

401
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,600
You, seriously...

402
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,830
Must you do this
even on a day like this?

403
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,270
"A day like this?" What do you mean?

404
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:18,109
Today is just another day
because I'll come back.

405
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,850
Yesterday, today, and even tomorrow.

406
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:28,919
They're just
some of the many ordinary days...

407
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:29,980
we're given.

408
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,790
"Ordinary days?"

409
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:34,189
That's right.

410
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:37,689
Mundane days
with nothing special going on.

411
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:39,730
One of those days.

412
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,399
So...

413
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,770
if you're having a hard time now,

414
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,800
don't think it's wrong.

415
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,669
Just tell yourself...

416
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:53,270
"Today was an unusual day."
Then just let it go.

417
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,379
You're good at knocking people out,
after all.

418
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,810
All right. Should I punch you
and knock you out today?

419
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,990
Be safe,
and I'll see you when you're back.

420
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,230
I'll be back soon.

421
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,600
That was my goodbye.

422
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,649
(Executive Director's Office)

423
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:31,100
Goodness, what is this?

424
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,639
Did you draw these, Dan Soo?

425
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,409
Fresh flowers will wilt,

426
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,510
so I drew them on paper.

427
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,810
If you turn one page a day,

428
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,580
I will be back...

429
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,480
when you finish turning
the last page.

430
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
What?

431
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,889
What do you mean, you'll be back?

432
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,760
I made Grandma a promise.

433
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:55,359
I said I'd go to
the office in France...

434
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,159
and pull off
the task Grandma set for me.

435
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,699
Then, she will accept you
as her family.

436
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,369
- Dan Soo.
- So,

437
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,909
even when we're apart,

438
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,740
think that we're still together.

439
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,540
I'm going there
so I can continue to be with you.

440
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,980
Do you really believe
what the chairwoman said?

441
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,250
I'm going to believe her.

442
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,020
If we can become a family,

443
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,419
I'll believe her.

444
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,790
That will be the beginning for us.

445
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:27,790
Why should you leave again
because of me?

446
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,330
Don't do that, Dan Soo.

447
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,300
It's something we have to overcome
at least once.

448
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:36,969
I'll put an end to things
and come back.

449
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,139
Grandma gave me a year
to finish my task,

450
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,879
but there are
only 180 drawings in there.

451
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,449
I'll take care of everything
within six months and come back.

452
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,919
You can trust me and wait, right?

453
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:00,889
(Bubble Up Laundry)

454
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:02,830
I'm not going to be gone forever.

455
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,100
I'll be back soon.

456
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:05,969
Still, when you're abroad,

457
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:08,030
there's nothing you miss more
than home-cooked food.

458
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,300
That's right.
We made all your favorite dishes,

459
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,340
so eat up.

460
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,469
Did you say goodbye to Gong Hee?

461
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:16,010
I asked her to come
and have dinner with us,

462
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,280
but she said she was busy.

463
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,050
Gong Hee must be sad too.

464
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,179
She relied on Dan Soo a lot
as a friend.

465
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,419
She'll be losing
a reliable supporter at work too.

466
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,409
(To Ms. Maeng Gong Hee)

467
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
I'll be back.

468
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:59,389
Is he the Terminator or something?

469
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,740
Oh, the baby is coming!

470
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:23,840
These are false labor pains, okay?

471
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,010
Last night, you said
they were three minutes apart,

472
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,879
but they were gone
when we got to the hospital.

473
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,619
When you actually go into labor,

474
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,219
you won't even have time
to breathe through the pain.

475
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,389
Is Ssook Ssook coming out?

476
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,090
I mean,
I really felt a jolt in my belly.

477
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,929
It was a weird feeling, okay?

478
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:41,330
That means I'm going into labor.

479
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,159
I am, aren't I?

480
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,149
I'm still not due for a while.

481
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,719
No way.

(My Merry Marriage)

483
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,550
- What? The baby is coming?
- I was right!

484
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,520
What if something bad happens
to Hong Dan because of me?

485
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,250
The responsibility you spoke of...

486
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,820
was nothing but a facade.

487
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,290
I know you feel more sensitive...

488
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,889
because your body is exhausted too.

489
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,119
- Get some rest.
- Please...

490
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,760
She's not at home?

491
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:46,629
Oh, whatever.
I'm sure she'll be back.

492
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:47,929
Because of me...

493
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,500
I'm sorry.

494
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Sorry.
