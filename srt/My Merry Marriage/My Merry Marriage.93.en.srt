1
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,090
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,999
From now on, I need you
to accept her as my mom, Grandma.

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,729
(Episode 93)

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,739
Oh, my. I see that you prepared
seaweed soup for my birthday.

5
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:41,640
You should sit too, Grandma.

6
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,309
Doesn't the seaweed soup
look so good, Mom?

7
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,349
Yes.

8
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:53,760
Grandma!

9
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,029
How dare you set foot in here?

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,830
- My goodness.
- How dare you...

11
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,660
use Dan Soo...

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,499
to set foot in my house?

13
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,400
Get that shameless face
out of my sight at once.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,569
Get out of my house!

15
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,440
Grandma, please don't be like this!

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
What are you waiting for?

17
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,410
Drag her out.

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,940
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:15,379
Stay away.

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,980
Don't you dare lay a hand on my mom.

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,419
I will not let it slide.

22
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,450
Gu Dan Soo!

23
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:26,620
Grandma, being like this
won't change anything.

24
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,320
She's my mom,

25
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,159
and I'll protect her.

26
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,659
Your mom?

27
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,730
She's your mom?

28
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:39,400
How could you say such a thing?
How dare you?

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,969
This filthy and nasty woman
is your mother?

30
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,969
She abandoned everything
including her own child and ran off.

31
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:46,809
How dare she show up now
and say she's your mother?

32
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:47,939
Does she have no shame?

33
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:50,880
Grandma, that's enough. Please stop!

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
You want me to stop?

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,820
How could I? Just how?

36
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,380
Please. I beg you, Grandma.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,950
Stop this...

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,689
and accept Mom as your family.

39
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,620
How could I accept her
when I know how your dad died?

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,389
I lost my son because of her.

41
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,760
Do you want me to be reminded
of Hae Joon every time I see her?

42
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,329
I can't do that.

43
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:10,999
I can't!

44
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,669
You were all alone in Kkotsan
after your dad died.

45
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,600
The day I went to Kkotsan
to get you...

46
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,439
That day, your mom died.

47
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:21,740
You don't have a mom.

48
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,450
- Grandma.
- I don't want to hear it!

49
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,950
I wish you had just died
in someplace...

50
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,119
where no one could find you.

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,750
Hae Joon can never come back.

52
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:34,019
Why are you still alive and well?
Why?

53
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,790
How dare you hold Dan Soo's hand?
Have you no shame?

54
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,530
How could you come here?

55
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,959
Did you persistently survive...

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,669
to ruin your son's life?

57
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,239
Look at you holding your head high.

58
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,310
How dare you.
You're no better than vermin!

59
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,350
Stay.

60
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,410
I told you to become stronger.

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Grandma.

62
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:06,859
I know you'll regret this.

63
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,089
I say this from experience.

64
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,690
Here's the thing
about reconciliation.

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,760
Once you miss the right time,

66
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,730
you have to take the long way
to patch things up.

67
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:25,839
Are you all right, ma'am?

68
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,239
She stole Hae Joon from me.

69
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,579
Now, it's Dan Soo.

70
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,820
She'll take Dan Soo away
from me too.

71
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:54,899
Are you all right?

72
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,109
You know, I...

73
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:05,679
As long as you know I'm your mom,
I'm happy.

74
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,019
It's more than enough for me.

75
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,690
Being Chairwoman Hwang's
daughter-in-law.

76
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,489
I never wanted such a title.

77
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,589
I just need you.

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
I know...

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,929
you two have hated each other
for many years.

80
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:30,369
But you're my family, you know.

81
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,540
The two of you are my only family,

82
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,579
so I want to try my best
to patch things up.

83
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,019
This is all my fault.

84
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,589
Because of me,

85
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,860
you were hurt yet again.

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,560
To Chairwoman Hwang, I'm just...

87
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,930
the woman who got her son killed.

88
00:04:58,829 --> 00:04:59,899
This won't work.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,399
Why would you say that?

90
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,740
Don't say that again.

91
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:15,649
Grandma may not be able
to accept you right now,

92
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:17,849
but I'll keep trying,

93
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,219
so don't worry.

94
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,200
You couldn't even eat
because of me. I'm sorry.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,529
You couldn't even have seaweed soup.

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,740
We can eat out.

97
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,070
There are many good restaurants
in the area.

98
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,779
But it's your birthday.

99
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,950
What are you doing?

100
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,519
I grilled some steaks.

101
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,519
Steaks?

102
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,719
Did I say I wanted a steak?

103
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,229
Well, Momo was craving it.

104
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,659
What?

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,899
Mother, you don't like
the Korean dishes that I make.

106
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,829
You won't eat the side dishes
that my mom sent.

107
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,399
Thankfully, Momo found a solution...

108
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,769
and said
we should have a steak dinner.

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,409
Look at you.

110
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,240
If you were craving meat,
you should've just said so.

111
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,010
Why are you putting this on me?

112
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,279
Something smells delicious.

113
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,950
A steak dinner?

114
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,920
She had a craving for it,

115
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,719
so she grilled steaks for all of us.

116
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,690
She's really something.

117
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,190
Gong Hee,
did you have a craving for meat?

118
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,500
You should've told me.

119
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
You never asked.

120
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,899
"What do you feel like eating?"

121
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,469
"Are you all right?"

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,969
You never ask me such questions.

123
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,010
Hey.

124
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,279
Does he have to ask you
those questions for you to tell him?

125
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,909
Don't be so difficult.

126
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,010
Just tell him what you're craving
and what you want.

127
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,420
Let's go to a good steak house
tomorrow.

128
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,120
Gong Hee and I will eat out
for dinner tomorrow.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,620
If you don't take her out
to a steakhouse,

130
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,130
she'll seriously resent you later,
so you should do that.

131
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:09,659
Oh, boy.

132
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,930
- Dad.
- Hey.

133
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,240
- What's wrong?
- Fix me some dinner too.

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,639
Oh, you're home.

135
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,110
- Take a seat, Father.
- Okay.

136
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,909
You haven't eaten yet?
What have you been up to?

137
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,610
Chairwoman Hwang
didn't even feed you?

138
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,250
I guess you had a busy day.

139
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,620
I had one stressful day today.

140
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,089
Dan Soo showed up with his mom.

141
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:34,789
Oh, boy.

142
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,159
I heard Audrey or whatever
was his mom.

143
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,029
My goodness.
I nearly passed out when I heard it.

144
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,800
That woman's mother ran that bar...

145
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,469
called Night Fog or Night Dew
or whatever.

146
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,909
And her father was
an ex-con fraudster.

147
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,310
How could Gu Dan Soo have
a mother like her?

148
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,039
I would never want
a daughter-in-law like her either.

149
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,680
Where did you hear
such strange rumors?

150
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
I overheard...

151
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,320
while having to go there and make
fresh kimchi, thanks to you.

152
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,050
Do you think the hired help
in that house can't hear or see?

153
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,019
Apparently,
that woman came by the house...

154
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,990
and made a huge fuss
as she cried her eyes out.

155
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,529
It sounded like
something out of a drama.

156
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,269
Am I wrong?

157
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Ta-da.

158
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Everyone.

159
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,479
This is the outfit I'll be wearing
to tomorrow's open class at daycare.

160
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,810
What do you think, No Ah? Tell me.

161
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,779
My gosh.

162
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,250
Honey, you take a look.
What do you think?

163
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
How do I look?

164
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,420
It's No Ah's open class.

165
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,519
Why are you more excited about this?

166
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,620
All the moms will be there.

167
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,420
I can't lose to any of them.

168
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,260
I, Eom Hong Dan,
work at a fashion company.

169
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,060
I should stand out.

170
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:49,829
Well...

171
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:54,239
I think you'd already stand out
thanks to your age.

172
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,300
Get rid of this hand.

173
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,670
My forehead will rot.

174
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,270
Goodness,
look at all these wrinkles here.

175
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,339
Look at this. Oh, boy!

176
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,410
What are you saying?

177
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,709
I'm still a flower bud
waiting to bloom.

178
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:06,709
My gosh.

179
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,619
A bud is only a bud if it still has
a chance to actually bloom.

180
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:13,749
Hey, everyone says
I look so young for my age.

181
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,920
People think I'm at least ten years
younger than I actually am.

182
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,259
- Are you laughing?
- Hey, I guess...

183
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,989
everyone around you
has bad eyesight.

184
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:21,259
What about all these wrinkles?

185
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,359
How can they think you look young?

186
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,070
Hey, Quack.

187
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,640
Shall I give you a scalp massage
since it's been a while?

188
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,209
Oh, gosh. Private Maeng Gong Boo.
I've committed a grave sin.

189
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,670
Why, you little...

190
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,109
Honey, I'm really sorry.

191
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,050
I will let you live
for No Ah and Ssook Ssook's sake.

192
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,879
At ease.

193
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,079
At ease.

194
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,390
I have surgery...

195
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,390
tomorrow morning,
so I have to leave early.

196
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,759
Head to the daycare center
with No Ah first.

197
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,989
I'll be there once I'm done.

198
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,890
Okay, then. Fix yourself breakfast
before you go.

199
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,859
Mother and Auntie said
they had to go shopping early too.

200
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,369
They have a big order in two days.

201
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,030
You're speaking as though
you've fixed me breakfast before.

202
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,570
Come on.

203
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,869
Run over like the wind
once you're out of surgery.

204
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:07,739
Don't you dare be late.

205
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:10,680
Yes, ma'am. Private Maeng Gong Boo.
I've received my command.

206
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,749
Good. At ease.

207
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,550
At ease. You too.

208
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,660
Oh, dear. Hey, how did it go?

209
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,329
What about your mother?

210
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:29,499
Goodness. What are we to do?

211
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,770
You haven't had dinner, have you?

212
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,170
I'm not hungry.

213
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,469
Oh, dear.

214
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,369
Is someone in the kitchen?

215
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,070
Oh, Sleepwalker.

216
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,749
I mean,
Audrey asked to borrow the kitchen.

217
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,329
Are you making seaweed soup?

218
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:58,959
Yes.

219
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,530
I wanted to cook for him myself.

220
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,369
Thanks for letting me
use your kitchen.

221
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,400
I was thinking of making it for him.

222
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:09,700
Dan Soo said you two were going
to his grandma's house,

223
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,440
so I figured
you would have dinner there.

224
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,109
Well, something happened.

225
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,680
By the way, what is that?
A can of tuna?

226
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:20,719
Yes.

227
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,719
When Dan Soo was little,

228
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:27,089
I used to cook seaweed soup
with tuna like this.

229
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,989
We couldn't afford meat,

230
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,589
and it wasn't easy
to go to the market either.

231
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,030
So I'd make him soup
with a can of tuna.

232
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,430
He was a good son
who'd enjoy it just the same.

233
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,739
You must be reminiscing
about the past a lot.

234
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,339
There's a lot to talk about
with Dan Soo, right?

235
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,209
Yes, even talking all night
might not be enough...

236
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,810
to express how much I missed him.

237
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,249
Gosh, Gyeong Tae. You're home.

238
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:55,879
Yes, where is Myung Ja?

239
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:57,320
She's in the kitchen.

240
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,550
Okay.

241
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,259
Goodness, Myung Ja.

242
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Oh, right.

243
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,140
You're here.

244
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,709
Well...

245
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,349
Congratulations on
being reunited with Dan Soo.

246
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,749
I'm happy for you.

247
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:49,339
Hey, I visited all the care homes...

248
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,440
in Paju and Ilsan.

249
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,239
Mother wasn't there.

250
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,910
Don't worry too much.
We'll find her soon.

251
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,680
Detective An and I are...

252
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,989
doing our best.

253
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,160
What did you do wrong with Audrey?

254
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,930
Tell me.

255
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,099
What kind of debt
do you have with her?

256
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,969
You tried so hard to find her,

257
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:20,469
but now that she's here,
you barely acknowledge each other.

258
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,869
You said you were indebted
to Dan Soo's dad too.

259
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:23,869
Does this have to do with that?

260
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,310
Goodness, why did I bother asking?

261
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,609
Fine,
you don't even have to tell me.

262
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,680
Don't tell me.

263
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,379
Oh, my.

264
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,790
Grandma, I'm sleepy.

265
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,989
Oh, my dear No Ah. Goodness.

266
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,390
Yes, it's time for sleep.
Let's get you in bed.

267
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,660
All right.

268
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,930
Just a second.

269
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,829
All right, No Ah.

270
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,170
Here we go.

271
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,009
All right. Come and lie down.

272
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,079
- There.
- Here.

273
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:06,950
Goodness.

274
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Here you go.

275
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,719
My gosh.

276
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,589
It's Mom's seaweed soup.

277
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:21,599
I made it with tuna.

278
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,700
Do you remember?

279
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,430
Yes, I remember.

280
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,839
Seaweed soup with a can of tuna.

281
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,170
A chocolate pie with a candle in it.

282
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,379
Moving from...

283
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,749
inn to inn
as if we were living in hiding.

284
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,420
I'm sorry for only leaving you...

285
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:44,079
with such childhood memories.

286
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,790
To others,

287
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,030
seaweed soup
made with a can of tuna...

288
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,690
and a chocolate pie instead of cake
might seem sad.

289
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:56,999
But to me,
it was the best birthday meal.

290
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,140
Because I had...

291
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,700
my mom and dad with me.

292
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,839
This looks good.

293
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:21,660
It's so delicious.

294
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,089
It's too hot, though.

295
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,959
It's so hot that I'm...

296
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,129
You should eat too, Mom.

297
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,070
Okay? Come on.

298
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,369
Okay.

299
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:47,009
Try some of this too.

300
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,489
It's so good.

301
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,430
Finally,
the day of battle has dawned.

302
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,099
This is the day
I've been preparing for.

303
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,530
That's right.

304
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,940
Everyone else is so dead.

305
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,780
Okay, then. Shall I go and wake up
the sleepyhead boy?

306
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,950
No Ah! You have to get up!

307
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,050
My goodness.

308
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,719
How can you still be asleep?

309
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,890
You're not pretending to sleep...

310
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,430
because I'm making breakfast
this morning, are you?

311
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,540
Why are you burning up?

312
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,739
What... No Ah.

313
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:46,969
Maeng No Ah.

314
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:50,379
No Ah, what's wrong?

315
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,749
Oh, no.

316
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,450
No one else is home either.

317
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,650
Gosh, what should I do?

318
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:01,560
Oh, dear. No Ah.

319
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,660
(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

320
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,700
(Commanding Officer)

321
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,640
(Han Internal Medicine Clinic)

322
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,109
Get Dr. Lee Soo Yeon out here now!

323
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,110
So if you sign him in first...

324
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,549
Forget about all that.

325
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,880
He's burning up right now.

326
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,890
Oh, hey.

327
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,090
No Ah is sick.

328
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
My goodness.

329
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:41,029
Did you carry him
and run all the way here from home?

330
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,330
I was so worried
that I couldn't even think.

331
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:47,499
You're a doctor.
Please take a look at No Ah.

332
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,840
Please? Hurry. Please examine him.

333
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,110
Mom.

334
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,709
Yes, No Ah.

335
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:56,580
No Ah, Mom's here.

336
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,180
Are you feeling really sick?

337
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,249
Hang in there, all right?

338
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:02,219
Hang in there.

339
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,120
We'll take No Ah inside.

340
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,019
- Okay.
- Take his temperature first.

341
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,959
Here, be careful.

342
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,430
Please take good care of him.
Please?

343
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,900
Take good care of him, please.

344
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,600
I get that you were in a rush,

345
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,430
but how could you run here
when you're pregnant?

346
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,569
You shouldn't be so careless.

347
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,170
Right, my Ssook Ssook.

348
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:27,269
I'm sorry, Ssook Ssook.
I startled you, didn't I?

349
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,610
Please take a seat and wait.

350
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,150
No Ah.

351
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:36,549
No Ah...

352
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,819
You see, we need a good strategy.

353
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,559
How are we going to use it?

354
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,390
It's all because
Holly's designs are so popular.

355
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,330
Some are outright copying them.

356
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,729
We should consider
the brand's image too.

357
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,299
Instead of taking
a no-mercy approach,

358
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,799
let's write a press release about
how Holly is causing a sensation.

359
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,769
Gong Hee, let Mr. Gu know.

360
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,640
Yes, I'm sure Mr. Gu will agree.

361
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,009
Good.

362
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,610
Hello. Hey, Gong Hee.

363
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:10,450
At 6 p.m., okay? I made a reservation.
At Terrace Fine Dining.

364
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,890
Isn't that Terrace place
really expensive?

365
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,920
This is our first night out
after our wedding, you know.

366
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,229
My gosh, Gong Hee.
Is Mr. Seo taking you to Terrace?

367
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,940
I'm so jealous.

368
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,370
It's such a romantic place.

369
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,870
Oh, my. Lucky you.

370
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:34,209
Most people can only afford
to go there for their anniversary.

371
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:39,110
Nice one, Mr. Seo.
He sure loves his wife very much.

372
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,580
He's a changed man
now that he's married.

373
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,519
Come on. Everyone knows
Mr. Seo was always a gentleman.

374
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:49,660
Everyone's gentleman
is all yours now.

375
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,430
Lucky you, Gong Hee.

376
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,069
Enjoy.

377
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Let's eat.

378
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:23,719
Is there anything
you want to know about Momo?

379
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,390
What?

380
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,860
What do you mean?

381
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,830
Will Momo be a boy or a girl?

382
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,969
What will Momo look like?

383
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,910
Will Momo resemble Dad or Mom?

384
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,940
What will Momo's personality
be like?

385
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,180
Will Momo be an active kid...

386
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,249
or a quiet one?

387
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,989
I'm curious every day,
and I can't wait to meet Momo.

388
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,090
I'm curious too, and I can't wait
to meet Momo either.

389
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,190
No, you've never once been curious.

390
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,299
Other expectant dads...

391
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,370
would put their ear on the belly
to listen to their baby...

392
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,440
or whisper...

393
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,269
sweet words to their child,

394
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,140
but you've never once done that.

395
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:18,549
Right.

396
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,110
I should do that.

397
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,249
No, no one says...

398
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,150
you should do that.

399
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,959
It should come naturally.

400
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,860
I'll try harder.

401
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,499
You'll try?

402
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,499
Yes, I will try.

403
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:44,739
I should.

404
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,749
A relationship that won't last
unless you try to make it work.

405
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:57,749
Forcing yourself
to try to show love,

406
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,049
take responsibility,

407
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:02,959
and act sweet.

408
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,590
Having to try to force yourself
to feel a certain way.

409
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,160
Will we be okay?

410
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,370
Is this...

411
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,239
really okay?

412
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,120
Why aren't you eating?

413
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,160
What? Oh, well...

414
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,459
I need to go to the men's room.

415
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,910
What are you doing?
Why are you here?

416
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,009
Why? I came here to have some wine.

417
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,140
We used to come here often,
you know.

418
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,479
Your taste doesn't change.

419
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,120
Gong Hee and I are having dinner.
Why did you follow us here?

420
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,249
What are you trying to do?

421
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,219
I don't know.

422
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:39,489
What?

423
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,789
I have no idea
why I'm being like this.

424
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,390
Even just imagining you
and Gong Hee sitting together...

425
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,430
and looking lovey-dovey
makes my stomach turn.

426
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,900
The thought of you two
sharing the same bed...

427
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,529
makes me feel crazy.
What am I supposed to do?

428
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,630
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

429
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,509
I'm trying so hard
to hold myself back, but I can't.

430
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:01,440
I don't get it.

431
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,580
Why should we be in this mess now?

432
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,410
We have to deal with this
because of Maeng Gong Hee? Why?

433
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,479
You can't be here.

434
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:09,749
Go home.

435
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:10,749
If I go home, then what?

436
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,090
You'll enjoy your dinner
with Maeng Gong Hee?

437
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,360
- Kang Ji Na.
- I'll give you 30 minutes.

438
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,930
Ditch her in 30 minutes
and come to my place.

439
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,360
If not, even I don't know
what I might do.

440
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:16,219
Actually, Chairwoman Hwang called me
on my way to the restroom.

441
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,350
She wants to see me now.

442
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,620
Chairwoman Hwang?

443
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,729
I'm sorry. I wanted
to have dinner with you today.

444
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,259
Take your time with the meal
and go home.

445
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,759
I'll be home soon too.

446
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Momo.

447
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:57,559
I want to build a good family
for you.

448
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,759
I want to show you that
your parents love each other.

449
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,229
I thought I could make it work
if I tried.

450
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,499
At what point...

451
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,100
did things start to go wrong?

452
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,920
- The village
- The village

453
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,330
- I miss the time
- I miss the time

454
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,630
- When I lived in that village
- When I lived in that village

455
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:41,130
Where are you?

456
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,999
Why aren't you even calling me?

457
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,509
Where are you, Mom?

458
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,180
Please tell me.

459
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:05,259
"My old hometown,
the village of flowers."

460
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:11,400
"I miss the time
when I lived in that village."

461
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,330
"Spring in My Hometown."

462
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,309
Mom's hometown.

463
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,880
Hometown.

464
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,059
(My Merry Marriage)

465
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:17,759
Let's shut down
the Holly project now.

466
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,370
Are you trying to single me out
at work?

467
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,900
By blatantly taking Min Gi's side?

468
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,999
Why did you come home alone?

469
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,769
He said the chairwoman called.

470
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,670
What's wrong
with that chairwoman of yours?

471
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,940
She even orders you to come and go?

472
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,239
The chairwoman was at home
last night.

473
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,509
I must've misheard.

474
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,410
They used to say married daughters
were no longer family.

475
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,049
You couldn't go home...

476
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:35,850
just because you wanted to.

477
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,249
That's how things were back then.

478
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,989
Oh, Mom's hometown.

479
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,650
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
