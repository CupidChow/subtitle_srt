00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,289
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,289
Oh, dear.

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,459
(Episode 91)

4
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:30,799
My gosh.

5
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,270
Hey.

6
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,710
Oh, no.
You look so upset and worried.

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,270
I guess you couldn't find her.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,739
Did you run around all day?

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,079
Where could my mom be hiding?

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,349
Oh, dear.

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,989
Hey.

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,859
What happened to your shoes?

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,260
You'll wear holes in them.

14
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:57,029
Who cares about my shoes?

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,529
What if my mom dies
on a street somewhere?

16
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,669
The thought of it
is driving me crazy.

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,400
Why would you say that?

18
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:09,099
You know...

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,010
I kept thinking about it,

20
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:14,940
and it's just so odd.

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,309
I mean, it's not like your mom
doesn't know your personality.

22
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:23,179
She must've known that
you'd persistently try to find her.

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,760
Why did she have to leave a letter
and disappear like that?

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,559
It's because she didn't want
to be a burden to her children.

25
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:32,960
Even when she had her back surgery,

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,630
she didn't want her children
to spend money,

27
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:37,299
so she stubbornly insisted
she wouldn't undergo...

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,510
Why did the doctor come?
What did he say?

29
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,769
Oh, he just said...

30
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:48,909
I should stick to physical therapy
and exercise.

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,650
And I should get
plenty of massages...

32
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,150
so that I don't grow stiff.

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,950
By the way,
the test I mentioned last time...

34
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,049
Doctor, we can go now, right?

35
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:01,419
Come on. Let's not stay here
and leave the shop empty.

36
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,430
Why? What is it, all of a sudden?

37
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,469
My goodness, hey.
You should at least eat something.

38
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,240
What if you collapse?

39
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,109
Gosh, I'm so worried about Myung Ja.

40
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,340
What should I do?

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,889
Geon. In my dreams,

42
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,919
I went back to you
hundreds of times.

43
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,429
I went back, helped you up,

44
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,630
and held you in my arms.

45
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,399
Mom!

46
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,820
Mom.

47
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,089
- Come here.
- Mom.

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,769
Geon, my son.

49
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,970
My dear son, I'm sorry.

50
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,010
I'm sorry for leaving you like that
back then.

51
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,450
Mom's sorry.

52
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,549
Mom is sorry.

53
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,899
How could you leave like that?

54
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,799
I never even got to call you Mom.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,369
I'm really sorry.

56
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,139
I felt so bad.

57
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,409
To tell you the truth,

58
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,079
I've missed you a lot too.

59
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:42,719
Ever since that day,

60
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,820
there hasn't been a single day...

61
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,529
when I didn't miss you, Mom.

62
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,010
That day...

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,779
The day you left,

64
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,019
our stuff was left unpacked,
just like that.

65
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,159
You said you'd make me tteokbokki
once we were done unpacking,

66
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,560
but Mr. Seo showed up,
and you stepped out with him.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,870
When you came back, you looked sad.

68
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,300
And that night, you left.

69
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,209
When you stepped out with Mr. Seo,

70
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,110
you met Grandma,

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
didn't you?

72
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,849
Yes.

73
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,389
And you signed that pledge.

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,329
My father...

75
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,570
had already extorted
a lot of money from her.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So I...

77
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,810
had to leave to pay her back.

78
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Even so,
why did you make such a choice?

79
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,079
From the moment...

80
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,779
your father and I fell in love,

81
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,789
we had to be on the run.

82
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,560
We'd run away,

83
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,459
and Chairwoman Hwang
would send her people to find us.

84
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,800
Then we'd run away
to someplace else.

85
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,829
And she'd find us again.

86
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,240
Your dad, Hae Joon...

87
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,709
It's true...

88
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,909
that I ruined his life.

89
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,979
If only he had never met me,

90
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,050
he would've lived...

91
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
a comfortable life,
enjoying his family's wealth.

92
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,560
I was too young back then,

93
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,599
so I don't remember anything else,

94
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,599
but I clearly remember
what Dad told me once.

95
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,639
He said the greatest happiness
in his life...

96
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,839
was meeting you, Mom.

97
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,380
He said he was the happiest...

98
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,810
when he was with you.

99
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,579
Dad...

100
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,089
went out to look for you
every single day after you left.

101
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,760
He said he'd be sure to find you...

102
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,860
so that the three of us
could live happily together again.

103
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,599
He left me with Gong Hee's family.

104
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,469
I waited for you
who wouldn't come back...

105
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,170
and for Dad
who was busy looking for you.

106
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,240
Every day,

107
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,539
I waited...

108
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,079
and waited.

109
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,279
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,420
I thought I should leave...

111
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,589
I thought I had to leave...

112
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,430
for your sake and for your dad too.

113
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
I regret it now.

114
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,829
I deeply regret it.

115
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,610
Then why did you do something
you'd regret again?

116
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,479
You met your son again at last.
Why did you leave again?

117
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,750
From now on,

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,349
never leave me.

119
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,750
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,060
I'm sorry for everything.

121
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,659
Stop saying sorry.

122
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,959
You have to be stronger now.

123
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:51,829
There are many hurdles
we must overcome.

124
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,099
My grandma.

125
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,040
You should meet her.

126
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,280
Well...

127
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:02,979
I...

128
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,310
I...

129
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,479
I can't do that.

130
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,089
But we're a family, you know.

131
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,790
I just...

132
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,359
I want nothing else.

133
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:21,729
As long as you...

134
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,869
As long as I can see you like this.

135
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,640
I ask for nothing more.

136
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,239
Now,

137
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,709
you have me.

138
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,349

(Baeknyeon Spine Hospital)

140
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,800
You gave my mom a referral note?

141
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Yes.

142
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,869
I told her to go
to a bigger hospital.

143
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:07,579
But what's wrong with my mom?

144
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:12,009
Please tell me.
What's wrong with her?

145
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,749
I believe she has blood cancer.

146
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,920
I told her to go
to a bigger hospital...

147
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,190
and get an in-depth assessment.

148
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:22,290
Cancer?

149
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,989
What do you mean?

150
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:26,489
Are you saying...

151
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:30,359
my mom has cancer?

152
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,229
We need her to get
a full assessment to be sure,

153
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,369
but that's what I think.

154
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:36,940
She's not young,

155
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,170
so she should undergo treatment
right away.

156
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,379
Does it mean it can be cured?

157
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,780
People get chemotherapy.

158
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,550
Can my mom live
if she undergoes chemotherapy?

159
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
We'll need to run some more tests
to be sure,

160
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,920
but in Ms. Im Sun Yi's case,

161
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,390
she may need
a bone marrow transplant.

162
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
That's...

163
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,129
Would she get it from her children?

164
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,739
Did you tell my mom about this too?

165
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,339
She asked me about it back then,

166
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,310
so I explained everything to her.

167
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,170
Goodness. Why do you keep asking
over and over?

168
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:50,079
I told you. He said you'd be fine
after the surgery.

169
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,009
Not that. I'm asking about the cost.

170
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:54,849
It'll cost a lot of money.

171
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:57,249
My goodness. Don't you worry.

172
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:59,890
I just feel so bad.

173
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,320
Why do you feel bad, Mom?

174
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,719
At this old age, why bother...

175
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,290
My gosh. I feel horrible.

176
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,930
She felt bad
that she was still alive.

177
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:18,239
She felt terrible that
she'd make her children worry.

178
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,540
So, she went into hiding.
That was why.

179
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,950
Mom.

180
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,249
How could you think that?

181
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,290
Mom, please don't do this.

182
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,560
Please come back, Mom.

00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,109
My gosh.

186
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,410
You're quite late.

187
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,050
What's she doing here?

188
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:03,020
Well, the thing is...

189
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,820
No Ah told me...

190
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,489
that his daycare teacher
wanted to meet with his mom.

191
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,890
I am No Ah's mom,

192
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,690
so I should be here, of course.

193
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,030
You're a doctor. Aren't you busy?

194
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,359
What about you?
Shouldn't you be at work now?

195
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,329
This is about my son.
Of course, I should be here.

196
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,770
"My son?"

197
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,540
Why is No Ah your son?

198
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,070
I think of him as my own,
not some stranger's son.

199
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,379
Please calm down.

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
I asked you to come...

201
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,050
because there's an open class soon.

202
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,310
- I'll be there!
- I'll be there!

203
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:36,950
I'm so stressed out,
stuck in the middle!

204
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,619
Hey, pick a card.

205
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,119
My prediction was correct, remember?

206
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,959
- I said a new life was blossoming.
- Goodness.

207
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,060
Wait, did that card
put a curse on me or something?

208
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,229
No, your fate is already decided.

209
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,469
These cards...

210
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:55,140
just give you a sneak preview
of what is to come. All right.

211
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,239
No, forget it.

212
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:00,709
Hold on.

213
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:06,550
- This one is calling me.
- Flip it.

214
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
What?

215
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,420
That looks ominous.

216
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,020
What does this card mean?

217
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,520
- Look. He's tied up.
- Yes.

218
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,890
This card is called...

219
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,759
the Hanged Man...

220
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,499
or the Death Row...

221
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:22,499
Come on!

222
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,129
Does it mean
I'm practically on death row now?

223
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,440
Well, this card
symbolizes sacrifice.

224
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:31,509
Hey.

225
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,810
You're totally tied up.

226
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:36,280
Why did I have to pick this card?

227
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:43,579
You met Ms. Audrey?

228
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,749
My gosh, I'm glad. I'm so relieved.

229
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,459
Thanks, Maeng Gong Hee.

230
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,320
It's all thanks to your advice.

231
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,560
You don't need to thank me.
You acted on it right away.

232
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,060
Well done, Gu Dan Soo.
I'm so proud of you.

233
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:01,070
You'll come home with her, right?

234
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,339
I'll be there tomorrow too.

235
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,469
Where are you going?

236
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,339
Oh, Mother.

237
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,009
I'll call you back.

238
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
"Gu Dan Soo?"

239
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:13,410
I guess you and Dan Soo are close.

240
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,150
Well, we've been friends
since we were kids.

241
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,020
He's renting a room
at my parents' place now.

242
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,959
I get that you two are friends,

243
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:24,060
but he called a married woman
at this late hour?

244
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
That's bad manners.

245
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,729
Something happened,
so he wanted to tell me about it.

246
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,499
What happened?

247
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,300
Is there a secret
I don't know about?

248
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,599
Mother, what about dinner?

249
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm meeting my friends,
so I'm heading out now.

250
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,810
Fix yourself some dinner.

251
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,950
Is Min Gi working late again?

252
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,150
Yes, his project is keeping him
very busy these days.

253
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,349
It's your fault that
Min Gi is so busy these days.

254
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,420
- Pardon?
- He didn't want to upset you,

255
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,859
so he turned down
Ji Na's offer to help out.

256
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,229
Seriously,
what's the matter with you?

257
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,499
Be honest. Are you worried
Min Gi might cheat on you?

258
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:08,200
I really can't understand you
no matter how hard I try.

259
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,869
I won't ask you to help him at work,

260
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,839
but you at least
shouldn't get in his way.

261
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,479
Well, Mother.

262
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,479
Momo can hear everything.

263
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:18,849
What?

264
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,619
Every time
you say such things to me,

265
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,619
it stresses my baby too.

266
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,390
I'm trying to be careful,

267
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,390
so I ask you
to please be careful too.

268
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,089
I want you to be fond of me, Mother.

269
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:32,530
Of Momo too.

270
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,859
Have a good time
with your friends, Mother.

271
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,140
Look at that.

272
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,540
She's using her baby as an excuse.
Goodness.

273
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,009
By that, she meant
I should stop nagging her.

274
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,619
I can't be fond of her unless
she does things I can approve of.

275
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,749
If she wants me
to only say nice things,

276
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:58,820
she should be good to me.

277
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,520
Oh, dear. My friends...

278
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,589
will ask me
about my daughter-in-law.

279
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,359
I belittled Kang Myung Ja's daughter
in front of them.

280
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,359
Why her of all girls?

281
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,129
I'm so stressed out.

282
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,440
Does anyone care about
how stressed I am?

283
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,170
Momo.

284
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,910
Let's only hear nice things
and think happy thoughts.

285
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,650
A happy heart brings happy things.

286
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,479
Okay?

287
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,850
Momo.

288
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,559
I can't wait to meet you.

289
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,930
Mommy will shower you with love.

290
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,759
Look forward to it.

291
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
Do you still have a lot to do?

292
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:59,380
I can help you, you know.

293
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:01,680
If you're done for the day,
get going.

294
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,779
I got this.

295
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,789
Let's grab a drink.

296
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,049
I want to talk to you
about something.

297
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,289
I have no reason to talk to you.

298
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,489
You won't even look at me.

299
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,229
Why are you being like this?

300
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,900
Because you might waver?

301
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,069
What's wrong with that?

302
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,670
We were so in love for three years.

303
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,100
About our breakup too.

304
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,940
Did our love fizzle out?

305
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,039
We were forced to end things
because of someone.

306
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,009
But it's not something
that can be undone.

307
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,309
Then why did you step in
and ruin my blind date?

308
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:36,850
You can't stand the thought of me
dating someone else.

309
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:40,289
It was a mistake.
It won't happen again.

310
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:43,819
Is that so?

311
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,690
Fine.

312
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,660
Then I should go on a date
with that man again.

313
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,799
What are you doing?

314
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,309
I should make some effort
not to confuse you.

315
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,080
I should see him again.

316
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,440
I have so much time on my hands.

317
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,309
It's me, Kang Ji Na.

318
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,509
I want to see you again.

319
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,850
You know, that day,

320
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,049
our conversation was interrupted
by an intruder.

321
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,420
Can you come to my neighborhood?

322
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,690
I'm leaving work now.

323
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,499
Yes, I know that place.

324
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,200
Okay, let's meet there.

325
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,069
All right.

326
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,709
What?

(Assistant Manager Eom Hong Dan)

328
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,049
What's up?
Why are you calling me at this hour?

329
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,150
Did they find Grandma?

330
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,190
No, it's not about that.

331
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:49,959
What should I do?

332
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,360
Earlier,
I had to leave in such a rush...

333
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,229
to get to the daycare center
on time,

334
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,130
so I totally forgot
to send an email.

335
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,170
I told the agency
I'd email them by today.

336
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,729
The files are all at work too.

337
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:02,940
Oh, no.

338
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,539
We told them
we'd email them by today, for sure.

339
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:08,080
I should've reminded you earlier.

340
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,749
I have to prepare for an open class
at the daycare center.

341
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,650
I'm sorry, Maeng Gong Hee.

342
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,249
Gong Hee, please.

343
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,289
Help me, please?

344
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,489
Well, Mr. Seo is working late today.

345
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,529
Oh, then you can just call Mr. Seo.

346
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,069
- Help me.
- Well...

347
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,140
I'll see what I can do.

348
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,039

Okay.

350
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,719
No, I shouldn't disturb him
when he's busy working.

351
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,519
I should just go there.

352
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,390
We can have dinner together
on our way home.

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,670
I'm scared.

364
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,670
Hey, where are you now?

365
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,110
Darn it. Hey, let go of me
if you want to talk.

366
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,309
Hey, who do you think you are?

367
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,910
Do you always have to do
whatever you want?

368
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,580
Earlier, you said
we should finish our conversation.

369
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,150
I'm all for it.

370
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,120
Let's have an intimate conversation.

371
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,950
I was crazy for letting you
come to my place.

372
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,120
You said it was good manners
to take a lady home.

373
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,219
Do you call this good manners?

374
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,789
When someone escorts you
to your place,

375
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,459
it's good manners to invite them in.

376
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,200
Who do you think you are?
You annoying little...

377
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,049
What?

(General Manager Seo Min Gi)

379
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,819
It doesn't look like
he clocked out for the day.

380
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,590
Where did he go?

381
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:49,440
I never wanted you to waste
your time with a jerk like him.

382
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,140
Then what do you want me to do?

383
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,009
You're not here.

384
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,009
How am I going to
spend all this time alone?

385
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,309
Did you do that on purpose?

386
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:03,180
To see how I'd react?

387
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,190
I did it because I was upset.

388
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:09,319
Because you kept pushing me away.

389
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:12,759
Please don't do things like this.

390
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,799
You're destroying yourself.

391
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,130
Who cares if I destroy myself?

392
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,499
It's none of your business now.

393
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,999
You ditched me
to take responsibility for Gong Hee.

394
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:28,910
You came running to rescue me today.

395
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,410
Did it mean nothing?

396
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,450
Was it just another mistake?

397
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,979
Should I interpret it like that?

398
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I'm off.

399
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,539
Don't go.

400
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,140
Don't go, Seo Min Gi.

401
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,580
Stay with me, just tonight.

402
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,450
No, just for a bit.

403
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,690
It's fine
even if it's just for a moment.

404
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,729
Let's stay like this, okay?

405
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:32,739
Hey, you.

406
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,880
Mom didn't want her children
to donate their bone marrow to her,

407
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
so she decided...

408
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,610
not to get the tests done
and went into hiding.

409
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,950
Goodness. She's so stubborn.

410
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,219
I can't believe
she just left a letter...

411
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:48,289
and vanished like that.

412
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,190
Hey, we have to find Mom
as soon as possible.

413
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,900
She needs to get the tests done
and undergo treatment.

414
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,529
If Mom's condition gets worse...

415
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Then she...

416
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,769
What if she passes away?

417
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:08,840
Oh, dear.

418
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,080
I'll look into it too,

419
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,910
so try not to be anxious.
Take care of yourself.

420
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,150
All right?

421
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Okay.

422
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,519
I guess
that was your eldest brother.

423
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,459
He must be so worried.

424
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,259
He can't even come here now
since he's in the US.

425
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,989
It must be very frustrating.

426
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,799
Hey, by the way...

427
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,769
Did Mother...

428
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,940
have a serious condition?

429
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:42,039
It's none of your business.

430
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,640
Go out and look for Audrey.

431
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:48,680
Well, about that.
I talked to Dan Soo on the phone.

432
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,479
He found Audrey.

433
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,920
He'll sleep there tonight...

434
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,259
and bring her here in the morning.

435
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:58,989
Now that he's found Audrey,

436
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:01,529
I'll work even harder
to find Mother...

437
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:02,999
Forget it.

438
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,799
I don't need your help.

439
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:09,799
You go out of your way for others
while ignoring your family.

440
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,170
You always put others first.

441
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,269
Your own family comes second.

442
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,340
I should be used to it by now,
but I'm sick of it.

443
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,610
Now that he's found Audrey,

444
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,479
you can worry about my mom?

445
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,289
Does my mom
not matter to you at all?

446
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:27,150
You have too much time
on your hands now,

447
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,759
so you'll be generous
and show some interest?

448
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,860
Forget it. No, thank you.

449
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,900
My goodness.
Why must you put it like that?

450
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,400
I've been looking for Mother too...

451
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,499
I suppose...

452
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:41,940
you're not taking me seriously.

453
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,809
When I said
I couldn't live with you anymore,

454
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,410
I wasn't lying.

455
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,410
I...

456
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,749
won't live with you.

457
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,279
Once I find Mom,

458
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:00,890
I will...

459
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,890
divorce you.
