1
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,620
Don't lay a hand on me.

2
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:24,859
Don't do...

3
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,060
stuff like this anymore.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey, what did I do?

5
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,840
You looked like you were having
a nightmare, so I just...

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,170
Right, so just mind
your own business.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,139
Get out. And...

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,839
don't come into my room
without my permission.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,359
(Episode 39)

10
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,929
What's with him this time?

11
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,800
He's getting angry for no reason.

12
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,429
Seriously, Gu Dan Soo...

13
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,039
(Audrey)

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
What...

15
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,279
Oh, come on in. Take a seat.

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,749
You're still here.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,720
I've been working late.

18
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,119
This tea smells so good.

19
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,559
It made me think of you, Gong Hee.

20
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,059
My gosh. Thank you.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,729
Did I call you too late?

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,530
No. I actually needed...

23
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,669
to bad-mouth Gu Dan Soo to someone.

24
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,600
Dan Soo? Why?

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
He got angry for no reason.

26
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,110
I was just checking in to see
if he was having another nightmare.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,039
Dan Soo had a nightmare again?

28
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,110
It only happens occasionally
these days.

29
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,750
When he first moved in,

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,250
he had a nightmare every single day.

31
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,649
I always stayed by his side
when he was having a nightmare.

32
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,589
Gosh, he's acting strange today.

33
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:01,119
He totally snapped at me.

34
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,860
I think Dan Soo...

35
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,130
has feelings for you.

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,899
Did you know?

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,869
Dan Soo?

38
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,169
No way.

39
00:02:13,429 --> 00:02:14,940
He probably thinks of me...

40
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,309
as a huge rock or something.

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,839
I'm certain that
he has feelings for you, Gong Hee.

42
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:26,179
He stepped out at that late hour
to pick up spicy tteokbokki for you.

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,350
He stepped out
to get spicy tteokbokki?

44
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,419
When?

45
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:37,160
I'm really craving tteokbokki now.
Super spicy tteokbokki.

46
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,729
You'll ruin your stomach
at that rate.

47
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,069
Oh, I see. How come
he didn't give it to me, then?

48
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,199
Try to notice
Dan Soo's feelings too.

49
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,870
I think he really likes you.

50
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,440
I have a boyfriend.

51
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,940
You have a boyfriend?

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
Yes.

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,509
Does Dan Soo know?

54
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,650
Yes, he does.

55
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,250
I was planning to tell him,

56
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,220
but he saw me
when I was with my boyfriend.

57
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,090
I was hoping things would work out
between you and Dan Soo.

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,130
Dan Soo and I are...

59
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,329
just friends, really.

60
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,340
We've been besties
since we were little.

61
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:23,699
I see.

62
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,359
Hey, Snot Face.

63
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,960
Why didn't you give me
the spicy tteokbokki you picked up?

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,199
What did you do with it?

65
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,060
Who told you that?

66
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,400
Audrey saw you.

67
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,699
What did you do with it?
What a waste.

68
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,069
I guess there are no secrets
in this neighborhood.

69
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,739
I don't know why you're sulking,

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,079
but stop sulking already.

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
If you keep sulking
like a petty loser,

72
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,350
I will teach you a lesson!

73
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:12,449
Why? What?

74
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,389
Do you want a sparring match, then?

75
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:16,359
Maeng Gong Hee.

76
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,030
You will always
stay by my side, right?

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,269
What? Are you still half asleep?

78
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,039
We're friends.

79
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,169
You consider me a friend.

80
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,169
What is with you?

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,950
Dan Soo, Gong Hee!
Come and eat breakfast!

82
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,530
Seriously,
what is with him these days?

83
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,900
You look much better now.

84
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,260
You should keep coming here.

85
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,470
Okay, I will.

86
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,799
Goodness. You stubborn girl.

87
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,900
Finally,
you've come to a realization.

88
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,939
Do you now see...

89
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,169
who suits you better...

90
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,210
and what the right thing to do is?

91
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,150
You seem so excited
now that your wish has come true.

92
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,220
But don't get the wrong idea, Mom.

93
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,450
I am not doing this
to grant your wish.

94
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,820
I'm doing it because I want to.

95
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:21,289
So? What's your plan now?

96
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,720
I told you. I will marry Gu Dan Soo.

97
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm curious...

98
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,400
how Min Gi would react
when I get married.

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Are you saying you will get married
because of that loser? What is this?

100
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,470
What's wrong with it?

101
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,340
You want to make a business deal
with my marriage too.

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,080
I should use it too.

103
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,479
I should consider the advantages
I'll get from the marriage.

104
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Yes.

105
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,919
Right now?

106
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,289
I'll come to you.

107
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,789
Okay.

108
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,559
Who was that?

109
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,600
Just someone you don't have to know
all your life.

110
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
I'll be going now.

111
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:08,770
My goodness, that girl...

112
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,109
Who is she going to meet this time?

113
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,710
Is Min Gi your toy?

114
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,309
Why would you keep playing with him?

115
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,220
You must've heard that Gu Dan Soo
and I are getting married.

116
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
That's right.

117
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,419
I came because I couldn't believe
what I heard. Why?

118
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,030
You shameless girl.

119
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,999
Did you have fun fooling around
with Dan Soo, casting Min Gi aside?

120
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,160
Are you happy
to make a fool out of him?

121
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,169
I have a plan too.

122
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:42,739
"A plan?"

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,910
Is that so?

124
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,080
Let's hear how great a plan that is.

125
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,210
Min Gi can never leave me.

126
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,950
What?

127
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,080
He's just sulking right now.
That's all.

128
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,090
If I tell him that
I will marry Gu Dan Soo,

129
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,650
he'll realize...

130
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:02,119
he can't live without Kang Ji Na.

131
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,859
He'll feel it deep inside.

132
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,890
Hey!

133
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,799
Are you saying you'll keep playing
with Min Gi's heart?

134
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,799
What kind of brat are you?

135
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,970
Seeing how you're shouting
like an uncultured woman,

136
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,840
I can imagine the kind of education
he must've gotten at home.

137
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,679
You don't have to deal with her.
I'll take it from here.

138
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:27,720
This is your mom?

139
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:30,919
What's this?

140
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,590
Did you follow me?

141
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,220
You should just go about your day.

142
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,119
Will you waste your time
dealing with this petty matter?

143
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,929
Where do you think you're going?
Stay right there.

144
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,570
I don't think we can talk properly
with my mom here.

145
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,640
I'll see you some other time
in private.

146
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,270
Bye, then.

147
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,210
Hey!

148
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:11,429
You must be
Manager Seo Min Gi's mother.

149
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,929
We've met before, haven't we?

150
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:24,039
I've heard people say this.

151
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,439
That a rags-to-riches tale
never happens in real life.

152
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,910
That people who wear rags
belong together.

153
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,549
How could someone in rags
end up rich?

154
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,879
Are you saying that
my Min Gi is a raggedy man?

155
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,950
Oh, my.

156
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,549
Is that how my words sounded to you?

157
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,720
I was trying to congratulate you.

158
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,989
What?

159
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,289
A mere chauffeur...

160
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,700
became the head secretary
at such a big company.

161
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,300
I mean your husband.

162
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,139
Congratulations.

163
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:01,979
So,

164
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,050
the son of a chauffeur...

165
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:09,050
shouldn't think
he deserves to have my Ji Na.

166
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,690
This darn woman.
I can't believe what you're saying.

167
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,690
Why?

168
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Will you throw that at me?

169
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,560
Go ahead, then.

170
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,229
If you can handle the consequences.

171
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,499
Why? Can you not do it?

172
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,269
I'm glad you know
that you can't take me on.

173
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,210
Well, then.

174
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,149
Take good care of your son.

175
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,850
Oh, right.

176
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,320
Tell your son that I asked him...

177
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,930
to drive my Ji Na around...

178
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,790
safe and sound.

179
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,269
Hey!

180
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,739
Who does she think she is?

181
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,509
How infuriating.

182
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,590
My poor Min Gi. What do I do?

183
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,859
He was born to the wrong parents.

184
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:27,489
My Min Gi...

185
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,899
What will I do about my poor Min Gi?

186
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,340
Oh, what?

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,479
Where did my handkerchief go?

188
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,350
My Hermes.

189
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,249
Where did my Hermes go?

190
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,359
My Hermes...

191
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,430
This one... Right.

192
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,670
What's wrong with you?
You keep spacing out.

193
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
What?

194
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,810
Oh, about Gong Boo...

195
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,670
I feel a little weird...

196
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,940
after we met with Hong Dan
as a family.

197
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,850
Hey, things will sort themselves out
when the time comes.

198
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,479
Don't worry too much. Okay?

199
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,850
Oh, right.

200
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,330
Hey, what's wrong?

201
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,960
- What is it?
- Gosh, I think I burned my finger.

202
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,529
Hang on. Oh, dear.

203
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,369
Just stay there. Goodness.

204
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,840
Here. Put your hand in there.

205
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,009
Good.

206
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:52,050
Hey, why are you so out of it?

207
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,180
You've never gotten hurt
while working all your life.

208
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Hold on.

209
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,649
Here. Let's take this, and...

210
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,389
Here, give me your hand. Like this.

211
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,920
- Goodness.
- What's this?

212
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,989
- It looks like a woman's.
- Let me see.

213
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,300
What?

214
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,269
They say men are still kids
even when they get older.

215
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,269
Oh, my...

216
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,170
But...

217
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,109
You don't have to do this.

218
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,279
Oh, well...

219
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,540
What is it?

220
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,210
Why are you blubbering
and not saying anything?

221
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,779
Whose is this?

222
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,779
Well...

223
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,119
I can't live with this fury
inside me.

224
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,560
When I'm feeling this angry,

225
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:42,300
I must read Mr. Ryu's poems.

226
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,200
"The confession that I love you."

227
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,170
"Could it be a cure to love?"

228
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,310
"Could it be a poison for love?"

229
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,040
"I cannot know its effect."

230
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,409
"It only depends on..."

231
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,950
"how the one holding it uses it."

232
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,090
"Without fear,"

233
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,350
"will you open the padlock
of secrets..."

234
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,659
"and valiantly blow up that love
to pieces?"

235
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,090
("Leaves in Your Heart"
by Ryu Si Cheol)

236
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,330
"Will you keep it locked up
inside your heart..."

237
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,769
"and choose a life sentence
in love?"

238
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,940
"That choice is also..."

239
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:25,139
"your own to make."

240
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,529
Will you really not tell me
where you got it?

241
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,759
I can tell it's a woman's.

242
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,800
Gosh, smell the perfume on that.

243
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:54,739
I don't know.

244
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,769
So, you'll continue
to remain silent?

245
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,670
Hey, burn it up.

246
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,779
What? That'd be a waste.

247
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,310
It's perfectly fine.

248
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,909
But that scarf...

249
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,749
Isn't that an Hermes scarf?

250
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:13,619
It is. The finishing touches
are done in the Hermes style.

251
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,989
What? Then, do you mean... Oh, my.

252
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,659
This piece of cloth
is from a luxury brand?

253
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:22,830
It's very expensive
if you buy it at full price.

254
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,369
I doubt that Dad bought it.

255
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,239
Did you pick it up off the ground?

256
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,040
Yes, that's right.

257
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,080
Well, in that case...

258
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,279
Oh, my.

259
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,080
My goodness.

260
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,450
You were getting so worked up
over it,

261
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,450
but did you like it?

262
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,090
It's a luxury brand.

263
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,159
Mom, I'll buy you
a much nicer one soon.

264
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,389
You? With what money?

265
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:53,389
I will...

266
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:57,659
get rid of my bothersome label
as a temporary employee tomorrow.

267
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,070
What?

268
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,529
- What?
- Oh, my.

269
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,399
She'll win a big award
in a company-wide contest.

270
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,399
A huge award.

271
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,310
Then, will you become
a permanent employee tomorrow?

272
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,479
Yes.

273
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,850
Goodness!

274
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,320
Good job, Gong Hee.

275
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,820
Goodness, my baby, Gong Hee.
Good job!

276
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,759
I swallowed my food now.

277
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,259
Good job, my baby!

278
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,830
- Oh, my.
- Dad, stop talking.

279
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,899
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

280
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,970
My goodness.

281
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,470
Whose daughter is she?

282
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:40,440
Gong Hee is so smart.

283
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,139
I'm very proud of her.

284
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,779
She actually did it, at last.

285
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,950
Goodness.
You nagged her like crazy...

286
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,119
to leave that company.
Don't you remember?

287
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,989
Gong Hee persistently held out.
You know?

288
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,159
Yes, totally.

289
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,529
I should flaunt my cooking skills.
It's been a while.

290
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,259
We should throw a party
to celebrate her promotion.

291
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,029
What are you so excited about
at this early hour?

292
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,340
Have you not heard the news?

293
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,170
Word doesn't travel fast enough.

294
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:13,210
My niece, Gong Hee...

295
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,639
What about your daughter,
who's a mere intern?

296
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:17,940
Hey! She's no longer just an intern.

297
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,210
My daughter is getting
a permanent position.

298
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,550
Don't talk if you know nothing.

299
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

300
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,560
Goodness gracious.

301
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:34,290
- Did you see it?
- They've announced the winner.

302
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,330
- Ms. Kang...
- What? Look at that.

303
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,600
- I told you.
- Yes, you were right.

304
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,269
- My, I'm so jealous.
- Is something going on?

305
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,840
Why is everyone gathered around?

306
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,769
They announced the winner
of the blind contest.

307
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:49,680
- I told you.
- Right. Oh, isn't that it?

308
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,180
(Design Manager Kang Ji Na)

309
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,710
(Winner of Blind Contest,
Design Manager Kang Ji Na)

310
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,749
My gosh, this is great.

311
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,920
Hey, come on.

312
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,600
Can you step aside, Gong Hee?

313
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,499
Congratulations.

314
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:20,609
- My gosh! Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Ms. Kang.

315
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,009
- You rock.
- Seriously.

316
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,679
- Congratulations.
- Take us out for drinks.

317
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,449
- Shall I?
- I totally knew this would happen.

318
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,020
- You're so cool.
- My goodness.

319
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,689
- Seriously.
- This is amazing!

320
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,189
My gosh. This is so cool.

321
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:50,270
Gong Hee, I know that
you're brave with everything.

322
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,310
But this time,
you were a bit too reckless.

323
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,280
But I'm sure you learned a lot
from this experience,

324
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,409
so don't be too disappointed.

325
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,889
If you want to look for a new job,
just let me know.

326
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,320
I can certainly find a good position
for you.

327
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:22,669
What's the poem called?

328
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,570
Hey!

329
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,879
Keep an eye on your son.

330
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,980
Now that my daughter is
a permanent employee too,

331
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,350
he'd better address her
appropriately.

332
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,719
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

333
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:40,389
She just got rid of
her temporary employee tag.

334
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:42,760
For her, it's the beginning.

335
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,429
My daughter has a bright future
ahead of her.

336
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,030
What? Hold on.

337
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,369
My Hermes.

338
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:55,240
Why is that around your neck?

339
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:57,899
Why?

340
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,270
I gave it to Gyeong Tae.

341
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:02,709
What?

342
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,909
You gave him this?

343
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,909
Yes, I gave it to him.

344
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:12,949
That man...

345
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,990
He said
he picked it up off the ground.

346
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,959
You like to covet
what belongs to others.

347
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,389
You still haven't quit that habit?

348
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,859
"What belongs to others?"

349
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,199
Hey! Get your facts straight.

350
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:26,000
Why would you give your scarf
to my husband?

351
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,800
He was coughing,

352
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
so I put it around his neck.
That's all.

353
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,270
Whether my husband
catches a cold or the flu,

354
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,939
why do you care?

355
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:37,510
Gyeong Tae and I grew up together
as close friends too.

356
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,850
Is it a sin to worry about him?

357
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,310
It's not like I held his hand...

358
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,449
or hugged him.

359
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,919
I know what you're after.

360
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,649
Goodness. That's enough.

361
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:47,719
Aren't you used to this by now?

362
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,990
Why are you getting so worked up?
Let's go.

363
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,129
I'm angry
because she does this all the time.

364
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:53,429
Let me ask you something too.

365
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,560
How much longer
will you treat me like this?

366
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,230
What's so wrong with putting a scarf
around his neck?

367
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,020
A big petal fell on me from the sky.

368
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,760
I guess we'll skip winter
and step straight into spring.

369
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:23,459
Oh, my.

370
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:30,330
Mr. Ryu, why are you so romantic?

371
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:35,240
Whose scarf is this?

372
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,570
My gosh.

373
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:40,869
It's mine.

374
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,179
Some ignorant woman
tried to steal it from me,

375
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,649
so I was trying
to protect my ownership rights.

376
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,050
You must cherish this scarf.

377
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,350
Protect it well.

378
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,320
I will, Mr. Ryu. Thank you.

379
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:02,230
(Kang Myung Ja's Book of Poetry)

380
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,100
Learning to find joy
in your everyday life...

381
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,869
and learning about love
through people.

382
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,480
That makes every one of us a poet.

383
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,689
Ms. Kang Ji Na is the winner?
What happened?

384
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,730
Oh, that?

385
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,659
I thought Gong Hee was the winner.
Am I wrong?

386
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:39,169
You said all the executives
were leaning toward Gong Hee.

387
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,300
The decision came
from the higher-ups,

388
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,699
so what can I do?

389
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,439
I heard the order came
from the chairwoman.

390
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,340
So, just know that and let it go.

391
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,850
Don't go around
complaining about it.

392
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:03,090
What's with the announcement?

393
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,590
There must've been a mistake.

394
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,429
What mistake?

395
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:09,129
Is there a problem
with the announcement?

396
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,830
No. There are no problems, ma'am.

397
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,830
Grandma!

398
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:16,240
I am not going deaf yet.

399
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,469
Grandma, you praised
Gong Hee's presentation.

400
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:23,010
I thought Ms. Kang's presentation
was better than hers.

401
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:27,350
Mr. Seo, do you think it's strange
that Ms. Kang is the winner?

402
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,350
Ms. Kang is a talented designer.

403
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,020
She certainly deserves
to be the winner.

404
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,689
That is not what you said
the other day!

405
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,919
The other day, you said
you were leaning toward Gong Hee.

406
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,560
You and that intern
must be pretty close.

407
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:42,530
All things aside,

408
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:44,260
I'm a good judge of character,

409
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,669
and I know a good design
when I see one.

410
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:47,629
From the presentation to the design,

411
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:49,600
Ms. Kang totally lost that game.

412
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,070
You agreed with me the other day!

413
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,310
Why did you suddenly change
the winner?

414
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,909
She will marry
the heir of Jayce Group.

415
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,080
I just wanted
to give her a career boost.

416
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
What other reason do I need?

417
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,679
So in other words,

418
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,820
you manipulated the result
based on your personal feelings?

419
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,619
Ms. Kang will put wings
on your back.

420
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,429
Besides, it's very easy
to replace an intern.

421
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:15,199
Who says I want wings?

422
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,600
I don't need wings.

423
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,629
She'll marry me?
I don't want to marry her!

424
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,429
I'll say this again. Mark my words.

425
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,600
I will not marry Kang Ji Na.

426
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,669
Gu Dan Soo!

427
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,480
- You need a woman like Ms. Kang.
- No!

428
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,149
Listen carefully, Grandma.

429
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:35,219
The person I need is not Ms. Kang.

430
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,719
I refuse to get married like that.
Also...

431
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,419
This rotten company. I quit.

432
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,919
Gu Dan Soo.

433
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,159
Gu Dan Soo!

434
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,199
I told Grandma...

435
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,730
that we're not getting married.
You're in agreement, right?

436
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,699
Why are you notifying me of this?
Why now?

437
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,439
Hey, don't you already know
the reason?

438
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:01,270
What? "Hey?"

439
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,840
I am your superior at work.

440
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
I can't respect you as my superior
because you don't act like one.

441
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,820
Your mother visited the chairwoman.

442
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,189
After that, they changed the winner.

443
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:17,090
Seriously, aren't you embarrassed?

444
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,689
If I were you,

445
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,560
I'd be too embarrassed
to even walk around like this.

446
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,129
- Look, Mr. Gu Dan Soo.
- At first,

447
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,840
I thought we were similar
in some ways,

448
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:31,969
and there were moments
when I thought I should date you.

449
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:33,869
But...

450
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,679
it's over.

451
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,550
As of this moment,
there are no more dates for us.

452
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:43,949
Dan Soo, hear me out first.

453
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,919
I feel like listening to you
will make my ears rot away.

454
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,790
Now, if you'll excuse me.

455
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,669
Does this make sense to you?

456
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:01,770
I can't believe this, seriously.

457
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,810
Where did Gong Hee go?

458
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,179
Dan Soo, did you hear?

459
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,149
Gong Hee didn't win.
Ms. Kang is the winner.

460
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,310
Gong Hee is not getting
a permanent position.

461
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,419
Does this make sense to you?

462
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,119
Where is Gong Hee?

463
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,350
Gosh, I don't know. Where is she?

464
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,359
I saw her working away earlier
with a pile of reports.

465
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,159
My gosh. She should just cry
and let it all out.

466
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,859
My heart broke
when I saw her holding it all in.

467
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,530
Why did Director Lee
have to get her hopes up like that?

468
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,570
Seriously.

469
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,740
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Transferring to...

470
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,379
Maeng Gong Hee,
where on earth have you gone?

471
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:49,219
Gu Dan Soo.

472
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,250
Where are you going
during office hours again?

473
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,959
Don't mind me.
I won't work at this darn company.

474
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,790
- Follow me.
- Let go.

475
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,230
Follow me.

476
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,429
Let go of me!

477
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,030
Why, you...

478
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:09,070
I told you not to act immature,
didn't I?

479
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,869
I'm not the one that's immature.

480
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,810
Grandma crossed the line!

481
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,810
I'm sure you can see
what is happening too.

482
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,909
The chairwoman will never go back
on her word.

483
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,109
You know that too.

484
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,149
So, you'll simply give up
beforehand?

485
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,719
Then, what about Maeng Gong Hee?

486
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,689
Gong Hee was going to be chosen,

487
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:27,719
but Kang Ji Na overturned it!

488
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,490
You have to think about
Ms. Kang's perspective too.

489
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,290
Have you even thought about
what people might say...

490
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,189
if they take back
the contest results...

491
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,600
and put Gong Hee's design up
instead of Ms. Kang's again?

492
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,199
That's strange.

493
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,139
Gong Hee isn't the one
you're worried about.

494
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,909
I see that you're worried
about Kang Ji Na,

495
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
Seo Min Gi.

496
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:56,719
Don't even call me
for the time being.

497
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,750
I'm totally disappointed...

498
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,290
in you and Grandma.

499
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
What are you doing?

500
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,510
Just...

501
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,409
leave me alone.

502
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,780
What are you doing here?

503
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,679
I'm slacking off.

504
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,850
I learned this from you.

505
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,790
Let's go.

506
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,359
Come with me.

507
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,530
Hey.

508
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:20,869
Hey, wait.

509
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:22,969
Where are we going?

510
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,740
(My Merry Marriage)

511
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,609
Why aren't you answering?

512
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,980
Actually, I felt awkward around you.

513
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,320
You didn't seem like the friend
I had known since my childhood.

514
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,820
Is it someone's birthday today?

515
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,889
Our dear Gong Hee got a promotion.

516
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,290
She got rid of
her temporary employee tag...

517
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,290
and became a permanent employee.

518
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,030
I should congratulate Gong Hee.

519
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,889
- Congratulations!
- You worked so hard, my girl.

520
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,169
