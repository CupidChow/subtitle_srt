1
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,260
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,390
My baby and I...

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,030
were in an emergency.

4
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,369
It was when I needed...

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,399
my husband
and my baby's father the most.

6
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,910
If you can't come running right away
in that situation,

7
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,009
I'm not really sure
how I'm supposed to trust you...

8
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,849
and live with you.

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,020
What do you mean by that?

10
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm asking if we can trust
each other as a married couple.

11
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:58,690
I've done nothing to be ashamed of
in front of you and Momo,

12
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,959
and I can assure you
it'll never happen.

13
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,599
Then what about what I saw
in front of the office earlier?

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,900
I don't really know what you saw,
but it's a misunderstanding.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,970
You're being unreasonable.

16
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,239
A misunderstanding?

17
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:11,340
I'm being unreasonable?

18
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,209
We said we'd trust each other.

19
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,980
While I was being taken
to the hospital after the accident,

20
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,950
you disappeared with Ms. Kang
just like that.

21
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,080
So, how am I supposed to trust you?

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,779
How am I going to...

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,790
have faith in this marriage?

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,419
I told you
it was a misunderstanding.

25
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,090
Ms. Kang and I were heading out
for a meeting together.

26
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,829
What more do you want me to do?

27
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,329
Should I quit my job?

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,200
Will that satisfy you?

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,439
All right.

30
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,299
Okay.

31
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:44,939
I was being foolish.

32
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,880
For you,
the success of your project...

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,549
is more important than me right now.

34
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:10,700
How badly was she hurt?

35
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,230
Is the baby okay?

36
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,299
Yes, they're both fine.

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,870
I heard Dan Soo held her in his arms
and rolled over.

38
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,840
He scraped his palms a little.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,939
Gong Hee is fine.

40
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,880
Maeng Gong Hee, seriously.

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,079
She should be very careful
in early pregnancy.

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,950
My gosh. What are you doing, honey?

43
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,480
You're an ob-gyn.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,119
You need to pay more attention
to your sister.

45
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:32,850
Seriously, why does she
make me so anxious?

46
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,959
Hey, Gong Boo.

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,889
Hey, I heard you nearly
got into an accident earlier.

48
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,560
You heard too?

49
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,500
Goodness. Why did Mom tell you?

50
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:46,700
Of course, I should know.
I'm an ob-gyn.

51
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,799
You should be very careful
in early pregnancy.

52
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,070
If you experience
any type of pain or cramps,

53
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,169
rush to the hospital right away.

54
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:55,609
I guess you really are a doctor,
after all.

55
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,810
Okay, I heard you.

56
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,109
Keep your stomach warm.

57
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,450
Try doing deep breathing
or meditating.

58
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:05,290
The key is to relax yourself
physically and mentally.

59
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,220
All right. Bye.

60
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,299
Momo.

61
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,630
Mommy is sorry.

62
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,799
I will really be careful
from now on.

63
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,639
I will...

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
only think about you, Momo.

65
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,339
The two of us.

66
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,549
Let's be healthy.

67
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,850
Let's be happy.

68
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,450
Promise.

69
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,750
Did Mr. Seo get home all right
last night?

70
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:10,619
I mean,

71
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,049
we were just going to have
one drink after work yesterday,

72
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,160
but it went on for a while.

73
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:15,790
He drank quite a bit.

74
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:16,989
I'm worried.

75
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,560
Mr. Seo can't drink that much,
you know.

76
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,130
He drinks
without knowing his own limit.

77
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:25,929
Oh, right.

78
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,169
Did he not mention
that we had drinks together?

79
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,570
Oh, no.
Should I not have said anything?

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,209
Gong Hee, this must bother you.

81
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,050
I heard you guys drank
because of work.

82
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,190
And I'll take care of my husband.

83
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,019
Is that so?

84
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,190
Did he mention that
we drank just by ourselves?

85
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,360
I don't intend
to interfere in his work life.

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,599
If it was purely for work,

87
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,099
it couldn't be helped.

88
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,269
Gong Hee, you're more open-minded
than I thought.

89
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,469
How understanding of you.

90
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,810
It's too obvious
why you're talking to me...

91
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,310
like this.

92
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,079
What? "Obvious?"

93
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,579
I trust my husband.

94
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,149
So,

95
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,920
please stop
with your useless tricks.

96
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,430
You should've been more careful.

97
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,240
How did you hurt your hand?

98
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,479
Someone was getting on my nerves,

99
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,810
so I punched the wall.

100
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,680
Good going.

101
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:48,950
Why did you call me?

102
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,719
The pieces from
the Holly collaboration project...

103
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,550
are getting great responses.

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,959
It's drawing a lot of attention.

105
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,159
You should keep
this momentum going...

106
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,760
until I name you my successor.

107
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,099
Grandma.

108
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Yes?

109
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,200
Is there something you want to say?

110
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:12,039
You can tell me.

111
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,010
That woman.

112
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,510
How much money did she get from you?

113
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,849
You're talking about
that woman again?

114
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,380
I told you to just forget her.

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,019
I just don't get it.

116
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,990
If she abandoned her son...

117
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,490
and got money for it in return,

118
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,800
shouldn't she be living it large
by now?

119
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,200
Why is she still living
in that state?

120
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,070
I just don't understand.

121
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,099
Dan Soo.

122
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,909
You don't need to know all that,
all right?

123
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,279
When it comes to the likes of her,
you don't even have to ask.

124
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,680
No matter how much you give them,
they blow everything.

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,649
So ask no more, Dan Soo. Okay?

126
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,060
("Leaves in Your Heart")

127
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,889
("Leaves in Your Heart")

128
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,870
Goodness, he followed me again.

129
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,899
Do you think a man that size
fits in at a poetry workshop?

130
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,240
He looks like he'd just boil
a poetry book whole and eat it.

131
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,570
Anyone can study poetry
if they want to.

132
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,310
Good morning.

133
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

134
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

135
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,519
Have you all been well?

136
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,649
- Yes.
- Yes.

137
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,649
Good.

138
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,089
All right. Today...

139
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,760
(Parents)

140
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,700
Today, I thought we could write
some poems about parents.

141
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,599
Most of you here must know
what it feels like to be a parent.

142
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,870
Today, you won't look back
on yourself as a parent...

143
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,240
but think about...

144
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,909
your own parents.

145
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,979
My parents.

146
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:36,579
Mom.

147
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,550
Title, Mom.

148
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,529
A snail crawls on a tree.

149
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:49,529
A migratory bird flies in the sky.

150
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,770
An angel sits...

151
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:54,969
over there.

152
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:02,709
Mom is alive in my hometown.

153
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:05,810
It makes the whole world...

154
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,849
so warm.

155
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Oh, my.

156
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,119
That was great.

157
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,560
Oh, my.

158
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,430
Goodness, what am I to do
with his unexpected charm?

159
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,329
That was a beautiful poem.

160
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,670
Good job.

161
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,810
Goodness, that was really great.

162
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,209
Nice.

163
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:38,550
Then, this time... Let's see.

164
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,479
Ms. Kang Myung Ja.
Will you read your poem out loud?

165
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:47,489
(Kang Myung Ja's Book of Poetry)

166
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:50,859
"My mom's face is like an old book."

167
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,030
"On her face,
weathered by the passing of time,"

168
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,400
"stories of my family
fill the space like her wrinkles."

169
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,469
When you left,

170
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,640
I cried so much...

171
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,209
as I went through your clothes
for the last time.

172
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,979
My heart ached so much
to send you off,

173
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,119
but it's strange.

174
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:25,030
I feel relieved
to be the one to leave.

175
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,270
When I leave, I'll get to meet you.

176
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,540
When I get there,

177
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,640
just don't tease me...

178
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,379
for being such a crooked old lady.

179
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,020
"At times,
I take out that book and ask."

180
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,890
"'Was it this painful for you too,
Mom?'"

181
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,150
"'Did you blunder about?'"

182
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,859
"'How did you become a mom, Mom?'"

183
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,859
"Then, the old book..."

184
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,160
"gets up from her seat
as she brushes herself off..."

185
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,759
"and wraps her arms around me."

186
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,670
"That this was
how she became a mom."

187
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:09,640
"She smiles brightly."

188
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:21,780
What?

189
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,249
What do you mean, his mom?

190
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:28,489
I'm at work right now.

191
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:29,660
Who would come to see him?

192
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,989
Hang on a minute.

193
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,390
I mean...

194
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,430
Oh, okay. I'll look into it.

195
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,770
Bye.

196
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,170
What's going on?

197
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,469
The daycare teacher said
No Ah's mom came by...

198
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:47,979
and took him with her.

199
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,680
What on earth...

200
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,020
By No Ah's mom,
do you mean Soo Yeon?

201
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,749
But didn't No Ah's birth mom
go to the US?

202
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,030
Maeng Gong Boo,
if you knew about this,

203
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,160
you're so dead.

204
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,140
Good job, everyone.

205
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,940
That's all for today.
See you next week.

206
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

207
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,709
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

208
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,749
Mr. Ryu.

209
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,950
I think I'll miss you so much
until next week.

210
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,890
I think I'll miss you a lot too.

211
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,619
By the way, Gyeong Bok,

212
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,790
you're so good at writing poetry.

213
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:43,160
Speaking of which,
why haven't you debuted as a poet?

214
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,099
From now on,
I shouldn't call you Detective An.

215
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,739
I think I might have to call you...

216
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,469
- Poet An.
- My gosh.

217
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,570
Oh, please. I'm not good enough.

218
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,379
And what about you, Gyeong Bok?

219
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,379
You write like a famous female poet.

220
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,879
- Look.
- Yes?

221
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,459
Hey, what's going on?

222
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,729
I called
because Gong Boo wasn't answering.

223
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,499
There's an emergency
at the daycare center, Mother.

224
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,900
The daycare center?
It's still early.

225
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,099
I'll go and pick up No Ah later.

226
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,910
Lee Soo Yeon picked him up already.

227
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,839
What? What do you mean?

228
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,879
Calm down first, Mom.
I'll go and see what's going on.

229
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,609
How can I calm down right now?

230
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,249
Do you know how surprised I was
when I got Hong Dan's call?

231
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,249
I mean, does she think
she can just show up and take him?

232
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,749
Did you give her
permission to do this?

233
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:42,420
Anyway, let me go
and find out what's going on.

234
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,430
Relax, okay? Try to relax.

235
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,930
- I'll call you.
- There's so much going on.

236
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,129
What are you guys going to do?

237
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
My goodness.

238
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,900
Darn it!

239
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,270
(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic,
Director Maeng Gong Boo)

240
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:00,270
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon!

241
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Where are you?

242
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,180
Seriously,
what are they going to do?

243
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,479
My gosh! I'm sorry.

244
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,550
Hey, are you all right?

245
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,619
Oh, hey.

246
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:18,259
How's Gong Hee? Is she okay?

247
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,489
Did she look like she was all right?

248
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,200
Gong Hee?

249
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,400
Well, she seemed fine, as usual.

250
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,369
She was in an accident yesterday,
in front of the office.

251
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:29,339
What?

252
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,339
Hey, don't tell me...

253
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,209
Did you not know about it?

254
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,109
I didn't know.

255
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,839
Hey.

256
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
How could you be like this?

257
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,780
I get that you're not fond of her,

258
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,719
but she's pregnant
with your son's child.

259
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,390
Just because
she's not your own child,

260
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,060
you really shouldn't treat her
like this.

261
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,560
It's not like
I'm doing this on purpose.

262
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,459
How am I supposed to know
when she's not telling me anything?

263
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,999
Am I supposed to read
my daughter-in-law's mind?

264
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,700
Even if she says nothing,
you can see it if you're attentive.

265
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,170
You can see how she's feeling
physically and mentally.

266
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,270
They say you should consider
your mother-in-law your mother too.

267
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,040
You really are so mean to her.

268
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,609
I can't be nice to her
because I just don't like her.

269
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,410
She's just bogging my Min Gi down.

270
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,509
What did you just say?

271
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,950
Gong Hee is bogging your son down?

272
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,749
Am I wrong?

273
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,249
- My goodness.
- Hey.

274
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:23,089
If it weren't for your son,

275
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,560
she'd have a very successful career
ahead of her.

276
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,489
What do you mean
Gong Hee is bogging him down?

277
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,030
Your son is bogging Gong Hee down.

278
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,700
She barely just became
a permanent employee.

279
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
How dare you compare her
to my Min Gi?

280
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,339
How dare you?

Hey, I don't care if we're in-laws.
Bring it on. Fight me!

- What? I'm so angry...

- Stop. Please, that's enough.
- Hey, seriously.

284
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,650
- Unbelievable.
- My gosh!

What's your problem?

286
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,619
We'll begin the assessment.

287
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,989
Assessment complete.

289
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You're here. Come down, No Ah.

290
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:07,599
My gosh. You're taller than average.

291
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,400
Is it because you take after Dad?

No Ah, let's go.

293
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,379
Why?

294
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:20,109
Can't I spend more time with Mom?

295
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:24,290
The last time he was here,

296
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,989
we couldn't do the full assessment.

297
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,119

I'm a doctor,

301
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,770
and I just want to run some tests
on No Ah. That's all.

we should get back together?

Don't you worry.

Yes.

324
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,269
We're at...

325
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,779
I'm home.

326
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,719

Yes, what's the matter?

329
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,690
Why didn't you tell me
about the accident?

330
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,130
You made me look like
such a bad person.

331
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,559
I saw your mom today.

332
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:18,229
Do you have any idea
what she put me through today?

I didn't want you
to worry for nothing.

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,969
Whether I worry for nothing or not,
it is up to me.

336
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,910
You keep disrespecting us,
your in-laws.

337
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh, that wasn't my intention at all.

338
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:39,420
Are you happy now that you made me
look like an evil mother-in-law?

339
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,120
I keep questioning
what your real intentions are.

340
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,559
Hey, you're married, which means
you're a member of this family now.

341
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,900
You're already telling your family
everything...

342

whenever anything happens.

343
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,400
Do you care more about them...

344
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,340
than this family of yours
who you live with now?

345
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,779

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,580
In here,

347
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:10,920
your grandchild is growing.

348
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,519
I'm sure your grandchild can hear
your beautiful voice now.

349
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
What?

350
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,160

Yes.

it sounds like you're singing.

What? Well...

00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:35,110
I sound like I'm singing
when I'm talking?

Oh, Momo is tired.

00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:53,289
I should go upstairs
and get some rest.

360
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,430
All right. Rest up.

361
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
What was that?

362
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,380
I was trying to scold her,

363
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,880
but why do I feel like
she wasn't even fazed by any of it?

364
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,519
Gosh, how annoying.

365
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:16,249
Well, my voice...

366
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,830
Keep your stomach warm.

367
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,200
Try doing deep breathing
or meditating.

368
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
The key is to relax yourself
physically and mentally.

369
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,580
Momo.

370
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,450
It's okay.

371
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,620
Everything will be okay.

372
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:54,690
Let's only think happy thoughts.

373
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:56,890
Only happy thoughts.

374
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,499
Take off your shoes.

375
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,850
Hi, you two. You came home together?

376
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:23,549
Oh, I ran into No Ah
in front of the house.

377
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,789
Right, No Ah?

378
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,360
Mom walked you home, didn't she?

379
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:31,090
No Ah, go to your room.

380
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,130
We parted ways with Mom earlier.

381
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,130
No.

382
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,170
Not your mom. I was talking
about my mom, your grandma.

383
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,299
How much longer were you planning
on hiding it from me?

384
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,739
Hey, what's going on?

385
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Mother.

386
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,509
He hid from me
that No Ah's mom came back.

387
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,180
I mean,
how much longer do I have to...

388
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,080
How many more times
will he stab me in the back?

389
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,120
What are you talking about?

390
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,249
When did I stab you in the back?

391
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:03,259
Then what was it?
Did you stab me in the front?

392
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,330
You don't need to get so worked up.
Calm down.

393
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,499
I did hear Soo Yeon was back,

394
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,160
but it's no big deal.

395
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,630
What you're worried about won't...

396
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,729
Wait, Mother.

397
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,170
So, you knew too?

398
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,509
Oh, no. It's not that.

399
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:19,610
How...

400
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,509
How could you keep this from me?

401
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,580
Hey, No Ah. Come with me.

402
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,850
Wait, Mom.

403
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,249
You can't run away alone like this.

404
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:34,860
I'll take No Ah to the shop.

405
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,190
You get it sorted out.

406
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,620
Choose your side wisely.

407
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,229
Don't make things worse.

408
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,459
Wait, Mom.

409
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:46,999
Bring me your marriage vows.

410
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Now!

411
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:54,709
What?

412
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,640
You said you had to feed the kid
before coming.

413
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,809
Why are you here already?

414
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,880
Goodness. Don't get me started.

415
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,319
No Ah, let's eat here.

416
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,789
But I'm full.

417
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,819
What? What did you eat
that you're full?

418
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:11,959
I had jjajangmyeon with Mom and Dad.

419
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,529
Sweet and sour pork too.

420
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,759
The three of you?

421
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,930
Yes.

422
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,700
But it's supposed to be a secret
from Mommy Hong Dan.

423
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:27,709
Oh, dear. Don't you think
things are going the wrong way?

424
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,009
I mean with Soo Yeon.

425
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,009
I can't stand how anxious I am.

426
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,410
I'm already worried enough
with Gong Hee,

427
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,979
and Gong Boo is also
causing all this trouble.

428
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,749
By the way,

429
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,519
where did your brother go,
leaving you in the shop by yourself?

430
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,559
Goodness, I don't know.

431

(Tiffany Alterations)

434
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,920
On my son Geon's tenth birthday.

435
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,459
On my son Geon's 15th birthday.

436
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Geon.

437
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,959
This is the last birthday gift...

438
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,200
you'll get from me.

439
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,209
On one hand, I was worried
I might never get to give you this,

440
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,180
but I also thought...

441
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,190
it might be better
if I didn't give it to you at all.

442
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,190
Taxi.

443
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,029
I was so lucky to meet you again,

444
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,769
to hear you sing,

445
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:43,900
and to see you smile.

446
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,670
That was more than enough,

447
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,979
but I must've gotten too greedy.

(For lease)

450
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,279
I was happy to stay by your side
for a little while, at least.

451
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,690
Forget all about your lousy mom...

452
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,860
and live with a smile on your face.

453
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,569
Did you leave again?

454
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,400
Leaving me behind like this.

455
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,870
Again, by yourself...

456
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,580
If you were going to leave
just like this,

457
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,279
why did you act like my mom?

458
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,580
Why?

(My Merry Marriage)

460
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,610
Like I said, ask no more.

461
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,509
I need to hear it from her
in person.

462
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,009
I must know
why she had to leave me...

463
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,440
and if she really liked
money so much.

464
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,749
Dan Soo!

465
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,450
About that project...
I'd like to work on it alone.

466
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,650
I don't want to do anything
that might be misconstrued anymore.

467
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,219
Why is that girl here?

468
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,360
Am I not welcome here?
