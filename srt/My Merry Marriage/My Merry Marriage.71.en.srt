1
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,140
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,510
(Episode 71)

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,880
Let's get married, Maeng Gong Hee.

4
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,249
You said the child was mine.

5
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,720
I'll take responsibility.

6
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,259
It was right here
in front of my house, wasn't it?

7
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,029
Where you denied that fact
altogether.

8
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:44,529
That was...

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,070
I was so surprised
and confused at the moment.

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,169
I do apologize for saying that.

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,339
I will accept your apology
for my child's sake,

12
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,110
but I'll just pretend
I never heard your proposal.

13
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,809
The child will need
a safe, stable home.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,720
But you love someone else.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
It's not right to get married
just to be responsible.

16
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:15,189
You shouldn't do that,
even for the child's sake.

17
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,400
Don't come back here again.

18
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,440
You're going out to meet Dan Soo,
aren't you?

19
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:41,719
Dan Soo...

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,259
is planning to propose to you.

21
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,100
Dan Soo told me so.

22
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,800
He wants to propose to you?

23
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,600
That is crazy. You know that better
than anyone else.

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,369
If you truly care about the baby,

25
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,009
you two can't be together.

26
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:05,979
It's only right that you marry me.

27
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,449
- But...
- I don't need your answer now.

28
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,979
Think about it.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,619
Marriage is a reality.

30
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,259
I'll wait...

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,020
for your answer.

32
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,180
(Maeng Gong Hee)

33
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,719
Hey, why aren't you here yet?

34
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,559
Don't wait for me. Just go home.

35
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,730
Like I said,
I'll wait here until you come.

36
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,300
If you don't come,

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,869
I'll wait here all night
and freeze to death.

38
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,800
Please.

39
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,909
Stop acting like a kid.
Go home now, please!

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,909
Apparently,
Dan Soo asked Gong Hee...

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,110
to marry him.

42
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,349
He told her he'd raise...

43
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,080
her child.

44
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,089
Dan Soo.

45
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,430
I don't want you to be hurt
by such painful love.

46
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,670
Just like me,

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,670
Gong Hee will feel like
she's always being chased.

48
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,309
You don't want
your love story to be...

49
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,779
such a sad one,
like me and your dad.

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,289
How come
he's nowhere to be seen all day?

51
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:33,629
He's not even picking up his phone.

52
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,289
He probably went fishing again,
which is totally understandable.

53
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,099
He's not saying anything,
but he loves his daughter so much.

54
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,330
He must be more upset
and devastated than you are.

55
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,469
He always says, "My dear Gong Hee."

56
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,409
She's the apple of his eye,
you know.

57
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,679
Parents are bound to feel betrayed
by their children...

58
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,909
at some point in their lives,

59
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,549
but I never once imagined
Gong Hee would worry me this much.

60
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:57,549
Even if they say every child
is bound to cause trouble,

61
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:59,049
I never thought
Gong Hee would do this.

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,289
She always just smiled
even when she was scolded...

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,159
and said yes no matter
how uncomfortable the situation was.

64
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,390
Gong Hee is such a sweetie,
for sure.

65
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,299
Oh, dear. I thought Lady Luck
would be on Gong Hee's side.

66
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,770
I hoped
she'd just have an easy life,

67
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:20,000
but I guess life is hard
for everyone after all.

68
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,570
Hey, ladies.

69
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,380
Hey, it looked like
you closed your shop earlier.

70
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,549
You're still here?

71
00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:29,950
Well...

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,219
About Gong Hee...

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,820
My gosh.

74
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,060
Mr. Maeng told me everything.

75
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:44,429
My husband told you
about her situation?

76
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,659
He must be losing his mind.

77
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,429
Well...

78
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,169
I said this to Mr. Maeng too.

79
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,580
Myung Ja.

80
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,779
I think...

81
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,150
Gong Hee...

82
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,320
should just marry
the child's father.

83
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,260
Hey, stop talking
if you don't know what's going on.

84
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:18,830
About Gong Hee being pregnant,
keep it to yourself...

85
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,370
for the time being, okay?

86
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,440
I'd hate to see the neighbors
gossip about her.

87
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,270
Well, I'm just...

88
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:30,880
- worried about her. That's all.
- About that,

89
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,880
we'll get it sorted out.

90
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,549
But the child will need a father,
you know.

91
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:43,250
I just think it'd be best...

92
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,719
for you to persuade her.

93
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,169
I...

94
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,870
killed someone.

95
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:05,580
I like Dan Soo.

96
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:09,909
I like him so much
that I can't bring myself to stop.

97
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,049
I keep wanting to see him.

98
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,580
I want to be with him.

99
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,950
I feel so at ease
when he's next to me.

100
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,760
No. Not Dan Soo.

101
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,929
Gong Hee, you can't be with him.

102
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,370
This is all my fault.

103
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:31,039
Just blame your foolish father.

104
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,710
My gosh. You reek of alcohol.

105
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,479
I heard you drank all day
at Gyeong Sol's pub.

106
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,150
You should've at least called me
and told me you were there.

107
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,289
I couldn't even reach you.

108
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,659
Why did you tell Audrey
about Gong Hee?

109
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,190
I should've been the one
to tell her, if anything.

110
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,029
Why would you tell her that?

111
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,229
It's nothing to brag about.

112
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,830
Gong Hee should get married.

113
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
What?

114
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,969
We should just let her marry
the baby's father.

115
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,779
You and Audrey are saying
the same thing.

116
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:15,179
Did you consult Audrey first
and decide this with her?

117
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,719
What? Are you crying?

118
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,359
Let's just have Gong Hee marry him.

119
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,060
I met him.

120
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,799
Met who?

121
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,760
That punk, Ssang Sook's son?

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,229
That's right.

123
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,299
He's not a bad kid.

124
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,010
He's an upstanding guy.

125
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,010
He knows his manners
and is smart too.

126
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,310
He says he'll marry Gong Hee.

127
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,849
He'll take responsibility.

128
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,880
He's Jung Ssang Sook's son. No way.

129
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,720
Darn it! Why not?

130
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,959
Gosh, you scared me!

131
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,159
It's not like he's an enemy
who killed your parents.

132
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,959
Then it's fine.

133
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,900
An enemy who killed my parents?
What are you talking about?

134
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,799
Becoming in-laws with Ssang Sook?
Don't make me laugh.

135
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,400
Stop complaining!

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,309
Just have them get married,
all right?

137
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:20,480
Honey, I know very well...

138
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,650
that you've been through a lot
since you married me.

139
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:29,220
That's why I live
without complaining all that much.

140
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,390
But when it comes to
Gong Hee's marriage,

141
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,689
please let me say my piece too.

142
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,029
Please let me talk!

143
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,929
Let's have them get married.

144
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,500
Have her marry the baby's dad!

145
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,419
The child will need
a safe, stable home.

146
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,350
I want to take responsibility.

147
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,319
Responsibility.

148
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,390
Responsibility.

149
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:06,789
Responsibility.

150
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,260
(Gu Dan Soo)

151
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,919
Don't you even care
when I'm about to freeze to death...

152
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,150
out here?

153
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,260
You seem fine.

154
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,829
So why won't you listen to me?

155
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,829
You know why I asked to see you.

156
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,370
Do you pity me?

157
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:56,569
Is that why you're doing this?

158
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,240
Do you think
I'm doing this out of pity?

159
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,750
Did my feelings for you
seem that shallow?

160
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,850
Then what is it?

161
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,620
I told you
we should just be strangers.

162
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,120
We've been doing that just fine
until now.

163
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,819
So why are you
suddenly acting like this...

164
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,289
just because
you now know I'm pregnant?

165
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,520
It's not sudden.
It's how I've truly felt for years.

166
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,890
And it's not a problem to me
whose baby it is.

167
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:17,529
That's why.

168
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:23,029
So let's get married, Maeng Ggong.

169
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:25,799
Yes.

170
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,909
Let's get married.

171
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,209
If you're fine
with the way I am now,

172
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,309
let's get married, Gu Dan Soo.

173
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:40,890
Marry you?

174
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,590
Are you crazy?

175
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,289
Hey.

176
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,159
So what if you're Holly,
the world-famous designer,

177
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,130
and the grandson of the chairwoman
of Jayce Fashion?

178
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,559
Did you think I'd fall at your feet
and call you a prince?

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,870
To me, you're just Snot Face Geon.
Got it?

180
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,799
Go! Just leave now!

181
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,510
You're showing me everything.

182
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,240
That's not how you feel.

183
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,610
Hey, what would the chairwoman say?

184
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,579
Would she jump for joy?

185
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:12,949
And what about my mom and dad?

186
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,150
Would they thank you
and have us get married?

187
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,760
Who cares what other people think?

188
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,390
What you think is
the most important.

189
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,860
No. That's the only thing
that matters.

190
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,100
You're the only one
who can judge your heart.

191
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,159
Don't let anyone
take away that right.

192
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,770
Say what your heart tells you to.

193
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:31,699
Do you not like me?

194
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:35,870
Tell me if you don't like me.

195
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,539
Push me away
and throw punches at me.

196
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,709
But you can't do that. You won't.

197
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,209
That's how you feel.

198
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,720
- Go.
- Maeng Gong Hee.

199
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,319
Should I really start
throwing punches as you said?

200
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,390
Will you leave then?

201
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,590
We can't do the impossible.

202
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,760
Go back...

203
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,400
to where you belong.

204
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
My place has always been
by your side.

205
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,169
Ever since we were young.

206
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,799
That was then, but not now.

207
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,840
I'll see you at work,
Executive Director Gu.

208
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,390
Momo.

209
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,100
What is...

210
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:36,230
the best decision for you?

211
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,240
I wanted to...

212
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,880
give you a happy family.

213
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,909
How does this make any sense?

214
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,740
Why doesn't it make sense?

215
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:23,380
Having you control our finances?

216
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,049
Okay, that's fine.

217
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,579
But this isn't right.

218
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,789
Do you know what happened today?

219
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,120
Gosh, don't do that. It's on me.

220
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,220
How much is it?

221
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:35,630
It's 83 dollars.

222
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,159
You've been very busy
with all our patients, right?

223
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,559
This meal is on me.

224
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,169
Here.

225
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,100
Thank you, Dr. Maeng.

226
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,740
Gosh, this is no big deal.

227
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,970
Is there anything else
you want to eat?

228
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,840
Order everything.

229
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,980
Do you have another card
I could try?

230
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,539
Pardon?

231
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,079
(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

232
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,079
Here you go.

233
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:00,679
The machine must be faulty.

234
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,689
Right.

235
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:04,789
This card isn't working either.

236
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:08,230
- What?
- I think your card is maxed out.

237
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:10,529
Maxed out?

238
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,370
- I'll pay with this card.
- Okay.

239
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,470
Yes. There you go. Enjoy.

240
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,799
Thank you.

241
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,140
Will you eat with us, Dr. Maeng?

242
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,380
Oh, no. I'm full.

243
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,179
I'll eat on my own.

244
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,220
Go ahead.

245
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,590
How can my credit limit be less
than 1,000 dollars a month?

246
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,360
A man should have his pride
in society.

247
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Does your pride
put food on the table?

248
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,760
Hey, you talk about pride
and whatnot...

249
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,260
and pay for dinners and drinks.

250
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,699
If you keep doing that...

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
What if I keep doing it?

252
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:49,929
Seriously?

253
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Goodness.

254
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,439
Do you even know how much money
we're spending on No Ah right now?

255
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,439
You don't even know
how much it costs to raise a child.

256
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,610
My gosh.

257
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,510
Would No Ah eat more than you do
in a single meal?

258
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,419
You add so much cheese
to tteokbokki and chicken feet,

259
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,319
but you never like the cheese
I want to buy.

260
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,590
You're like Jekyll and Hyde.
Two-faced!

261
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,360
That must be
what Ssook Ssook likes to eat.

262
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:16,490
When a woman is pregnant,

263
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,799
her taste buds change too.

264
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,130
Come on.
You woke me up with all the noise.

265
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,240
No Ah.

266
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,909
Thanks to my lucky charm,
my clinic is doing well,

267
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:32,480
but we still have to live
in such poverty.

268
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,179
No Ah. Did you do your homework
from daycare before going to bed?

269
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,449
I don't want to go
to the daycare center.

270
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,650
What?

271
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,319
It's too easy for me.

272
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,990
I want to go to
an English kindergarten.

273
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,659
An English kindergarten?

274
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:55,870
Goodness, our dear No Ah
must still be dreaming.

275
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,600
You're not fully awake yet, right?

276
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,510
I am fully awake.

277
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,579
My mom sent me
to an English kindergarten...

278
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,439
and all the academies I wanted.

279
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,909
Right. Did you see that?

280
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,350
He's not a lucky charm.

281
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,819
He's a black hole for money.

282
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,490
A black hole.

283
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,020
Kids these days
sure aren't easy to handle.

284
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,559
My goodness.

285
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Put that away.

286
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,679
Dan Soo.

287
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,679
I heard you didn't go
to the meeting with the press.

288
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,620
How long has it been
since you became an executive...

289
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,179
that you blew off
such an important occasion?

290
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,790
Grandma.

291
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,489
Why do you look like that?

292
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,530
Is something wrong?

293
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,800
No.

294
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,530
It's nothing.

295
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:01,769
Tell me. What's going on?

296
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:03,600
I'll listen to
whatever you have to say.

297
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,739
Who could understand how you feel
besides your grandma?

298
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:11,009
Go ahead and tell me.

299
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,380
I was going to propose to someone,

300
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:17,479
but I was rejected.

301
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,719
"Propose?" What do you mean?

302
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,949
She's a tough nut to crack.

303
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,459
She won't listen to me at all.

304
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,290
Can't you take my side, Grandma?

305
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,759
So, you're saying...

306
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,330
That's right.

307
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,530
There's someone I want to marry.

308
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,739
What about Ms. Kang Ji Na?

309
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:41,840
It's Maeng Gong Hee.

310
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,009
Maeng Gong Hee?

311
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,320
The intern who was recently promoted
to a permanent employee?

312
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,449
Yes, that's right.

313
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,090
Grandma.

314
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,360
If it weren't for Gong Hee,

315
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,259
I'd still be wandering around
with my guitar.

316
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,900
As you know, I'm a wanderer.

317
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,459
But...

318
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:10,169
I kept going to work because of her.

319
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,900
She made me want to live,

320
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,840
and she made me want
to be better at my job.

321
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,780
You told me...

322
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:20,780
in the past that there was someone
you wanted to marry. Was that...

323
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:23,310
That's right. It was Gong Hee.

324
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,979
I want to marry Gong Hee.

325
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,620
Can't you take my side, Grandma?
Please?

326
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Please, Grandma.

327
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,590
Well, all right.

328
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,560
I should help you.

329
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,199
I should help my dear grandson...

330
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,100
so he can live the life he wants.

331
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,640
Don't worry.

332
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:50,870
Grandma, thanks.

333
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,880
Dan Soo, this punk.

334
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,110
He'll be worse than his dad.

335
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,550
This won't be any easier.

336
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,719
What should I do?

337
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,699
How come Dad isn't joining us?

338
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,870
I guess he's hungover.
Just leave him be.

339
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,469
Let him suffer a little
to learn his lesson.

340
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,009
Why would you say that
after making hangover soup for him?

341
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,209
I'll go and get him.

342
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,380
No. Just eat and go to work.

343
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,479
I'll wake him up.

344
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,749
Eat up, okay?

345
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,390
Okay.

346
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:39,689
Gong Hee.

347
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:45,600
Would you want to marry
the baby's father if he wanted to?

348
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,070
No.

349
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,040
So, you don't want to marry him?

350
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:54,739
No, I don't.

351
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,939
Your dad met him.

352
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,140
He said he wanted to marry you.

353
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,249
Mom, you know
he's marrying someone else.

354
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,120
He loves someone else.

355
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,189
It's wrong to marry me
just to be responsible.

356
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,719
My goodness. Come on.

357
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,989
Come here. Oh, boy.

358
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,989
Marriage is about
taking responsibility.

359
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,100
What more do you need?

360
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,600
Dad.

361
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,300
You should meet with Ssang Sook.

362
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,699
We should hurry up
and pick a date for their wedding!

363
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:27,870
Dad, what is with you?

364
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,870
Why won't you answer me?

365
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,909
Seriously, what is with you?

366
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,540
Are you still drunk?

367
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,150
Why are you yelling at me?

368
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,509
You've been acting strange
since yesterday!

369
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,620
Hurry up and get it done!

370
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,419
Before her belly starts showing.
Darn it!

371
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,850
Oh, my goodness. Hey!

372
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,219
Gyeong Tae,
have some soybean sprout soup...

373
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:48,030
before you lie down again! Come on!

374
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:50,530
My gosh.

375
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,800
My brother rarely raises his voice
like this at home.

376
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,199
What is the matter with him?

377
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:56,769
Oh, dear.

378
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,810
Dad.

379
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,219
I'm going to work.

380
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,820
But you know, Dad,

381
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,229
I will not marry Mr. Seo.

382
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,130
Don't worry too much. I'll be fine.

383
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,509
You drank a lot yesterday.
Have some hangover soup.

384
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:38,080
Eat your breakfast, okay?

385
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,679
I'm sorry, Dad.

386
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:54,560
Gong Hee.

387
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,999
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,030
Dad is sorry.

389
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,239
I am sorry, but...

390
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,110
But you can't be with Dan Soo.

391
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,409
Not Dan Soo.

392
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,749
When he announced
that he'd marry you,

393
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,560
he yelled at my mom like that.

394
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:29,330
When he makes up his mind
about something,

395
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,360
he bullheadedly goes for it
without looking back once.

396
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,269
In the end, he persuaded the family
and married you, Myung Ja.

397
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,439
You see, this is...

398
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,780
the second time I've seen him
raise his voice at home.

399
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:48,850
My gosh. In my opinion,
he won't back down.

400
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,179
But Gong Hee has a point.

401
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:56,189
I can't force her to marry
someone she doesn't even love.

402
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,560
Why don't you just meet
with Ssang Sook first?

403
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,429
Find out what she's thinking.
You need to at least hear her out.

404
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:15,239
Oh, dear.

405
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,969
They say...

406
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,810
raising a child
can be heartbreaking.

407
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,120
Looking at you, I feel like
you'd need five hearts...

408
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,390
to survive parenthood.

409
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,300
- Here.
- What?

410
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:49,909
Iron supplements.
It's a must for pregnant women.

411
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,110
My gosh, Ms. Eom.

412
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,150
You don't need to thank me.

413
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,110
It's from Mr. Gu Dan Soo.

414
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,390
About Mr. Gu Dan Soo.

415
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,890
He cares about you a lot.

416
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,090
He kept asking what would be
essential to take during pregnancy.

417
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,900
It sure is nice
to have a longtime friend.

418
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,140
Ms. Maeng Gong Hee?

419
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:22,009
The chairwoman wants to see you.

420
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,449
(Executive Director, Gu Dan Soo)

421
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,759
I don't think Gong Hee is the one
who needs those supplements.

422
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,560
Shouldn't you take them,
Mr. Gu Dan Soo?

423
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,189
Take them and grow up.

424
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm not the one
who needs to grow up.

425
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,269
Don't you think
you and Seo Min Gi need to grow up?

426
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,669
You're blaming Gong Hee
for everything when you wronged her,

427
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:54,100
and you're making
ridiculous demands.

428
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:57,769
You're so overprotective
of Maeng Gong Hee.

429
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:00,439
Then you shouldn't be here now.

430
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,949
What do you mean?

431
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,080
I suppose
you also told Chairwoman Hwang...

432
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:07,650
that you wanted to marry Gong Hee.

433
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,519
So, Dan Soo likes you.

434
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,229
Don't be so flustered.

435
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,130
It won't work out anyway.

436
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:24,939
Right.

437
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:29,040
I hope you didn't tell him
you'd accept his feelings.

438
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,810
No, I did not.

439
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:36,650
Even if Dan Soo doesn't give up
and gets clingy,

440
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,880
I trust you'll do the right thing.

441
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:53,999
I did tell you
I'd give you a separate reward.

442
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:55,499
Take it.

443
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,969
Oh, getting a permanent position
is good enough for me.

444
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:03,509
No, you have to take it.

445
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,310
I put in a good amount.

446
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,709
I'm also compensating you
for knowing your place.

447
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:17,489
You understand
what that means, right?

448
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
Yes, ma'am.

449
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:24,759
I understand, but...

450
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,300
I can't take this...

451
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:31,870
- What is this? How childish.
- Gu Dan Soo.

452
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,070
You said you'd take my side!

453
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,840
I am doing this
because I'm on your side.

454
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,709
I wanted to trust you
because you're my grandma,

455
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,140
but you deceived me again.

456
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,810
You should be embarrassed, Grandma.

457
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,120
Try to be a little more creative,
at least.

458
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,249
What is this? How embarrassing.

459
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,290
Hey, let go!

460
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,249
Grandma, you watch me.

461
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:54,390
I will never let her hand go.

462
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,699
- Dan Soo, wait. Gu Dan Soo.
- Hey.

463
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,699
My gosh, ma'am.

464
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,630
Oh, no.

465
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,499
Let go, and we can talk.

466
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,939
Let go of her hand.

467
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:11,939
You stay out of this.

468
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,840
No. You stay out of this.

469
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:16,509
(Chairwoman's Office)

470
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,769
(My Merry Marriage)

471
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:38,870
I'll do everything you ask for
besides letting them get married.

472
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,870
What do you want?

473
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,870
I'll give you money.

474
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,939
How much will it take?

475
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,709
- Darn it!
- Today,

476
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:46,580
I'm going to take you down
even if it costs me my life!

477
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,310
This is my poetry teacher.

478
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,880
I know a thing or two
about poetry too.

479
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:55,189
You can't be with that girl.

480
00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:57,719
You're the next chairman
of Jayce Fashion.

481
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:00,890
I think it would be best
to have Maeng Gong Hee fired.

482
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,890
