1
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,410
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,540
I feel like
there's this tangled mess...

3
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,279
sitting in my heart.

4
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,320
Where do I begin to untangle this?

5
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,689
Or should I just leave it as it is?

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,159
I'm not sure...

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,260
about anything.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,569
What...

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,100
should I do, Gu Dan Soo?

10
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,310
When you're making clothes,

11
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,679
you come across those knots.

12
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,690
They get all tangled up...

13
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,090
that it seems impossible
to untangle them.

14
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,789
But they eventually get untangled
in the end.

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,700
You just have to undo them
from the middle, one step at a time.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
You know that too.

17
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,670
But right now,

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,640
I can't even tell
where the middle is.

19
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,539
You're in the middle.

20
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,339
Start with yourself,
whatever it may be about.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,649
Hey, you're a simple-minded girl.

22
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:36,380
Just think about yourself.

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,350
Don't try to understand
other people so much.

24
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:40,750
And what if I don't understand them?

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,990
What am I supposed to do?

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,160
You know what you're good at.
Throwing punches out of nowhere.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,229
Charge at them,
throw them on the ground,

28
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,229
and kick them.

29
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:52,699
Hey, am I a thug or something?

30
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,500
You kicked me all the time.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,240
That was because
you were asking for it.

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,580
Will you really not tell me...

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
what this is about?

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,350
I was just complaining about life.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
Thanks for the ramyeon.

36
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,289
Hey, wait.

37
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,759
I don't know what it's about,

38
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,630
but you're blaming yourself again,
aren't you?

39
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,030
Stop doing that
and just blame other people.

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,970
It's nice. Just live comfortably.

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,870
My goodness.

42
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,440
Crying and laughing.
You know that's cheating, don't you?

43
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,039
I'll be going.

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Maeng Gong Hee.

45
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,560
What on earth can't you tell me?

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,889
I'd rather have you lean on me...

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,030
and cry your eyes out.

48
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,829
Why were you tearing up?

49
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:03,329
Why?

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
- Mom.
- What?

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,579
Hey, when did you get here?
Why didn't you call me?

52
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,650
I came because I wanted your food.

53
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,489
Oh, no. But it's too late.

54
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,250
Have you still not had dinner?

55
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,120
Well, someone cooked for me,
so I had some food.

56
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,060
But you should have a proper meal
at home.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,799
You haven't been eating well,
so I was worried about you.

58
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,460
Let's go inside.
I'll fix you dinner quickly.

59
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,329
No, I eat just fine these days.

60
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,100
I should go home now.

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,840
I'm happy now that I've seen you.

62
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,380
Gong Hee, spend the night here.

63
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,310
No, I should get going.
My in-laws will be waiting.

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,220
Just spend one night here.

65
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,090
Stay with me, okay?

66
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,359
This is my daughter
that I gave birth to.

67
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,759
I can tell
just by looking at her face.

68
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,660
Something is worrying her,
but she can't talk about it.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,829
She's trying to smile more
on purpose.

70
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,210
"The chocolate I received from you."

71
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,280
"Splendid fireworks."

72
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,850
"They will burst in my heart
and become a handful of ash."

73
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,479
"They will become love."

74
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:28,889
("Leaves in Your Heart")

75
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,519
It's so romantic.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,869
Mr. Ryu, your poems melt my heart...

77
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,869
like these sweet chocolates.

78
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,869
Your poems always...

79
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,979
light up my heart,

80
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,379
but I have nothing...

81
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,179
but these small chocolates
to give you.

82
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,890
No.

83
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,350
Hang on.

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,059
Just as your poems color my heart,

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,799
I hope these chocolates...

86
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:23,010
will also color your day...

87
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,439
with sweetness.

88
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,650
Good.

89
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Oh, my.

90
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,549
Darn it.

91
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,260
Let me say this first.

92
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,859
I hope you won't ruin my mood now.

93
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm preparing chocolates
for Mr. Ryu.

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,470
- Don't jinx them...
- Just go to bed if you're sleepy,

95
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,629
and stop spewing nonsense.

96
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,299
What is this about?

97
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,270
Gong Hee will sleep here tonight.
I'm just letting you know.

98
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,979
That girl runs off to see you
whenever...

99
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,650
I can't believe this.

100
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:12,590
Both the daughter and the mother
will just do whatever they want.

101
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,260
My gosh.

102
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:16,789
Oh, my.

103
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,260
Did you two fight?

104
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
What?

105
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:25,200
She said she'd spend the night
at her parents' house.

106
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,410
Did she discuss this with you?

107
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,470
Or did she go there
without telling you?

108
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,039
Well...

109
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,879
She told me at work that
she was going to see her parents.

110
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,650
Is that so?

111
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,820
But today isn't a special day.

112
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,049
Why would she do that,
all of a sudden?

113
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,960
It'd be nice for her
to get some rest there.

114
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,669
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

115
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,369
All of a sudden, without a word...

116
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,239
(1 unread message, Ji Na)

117
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,710
I met with Maeng Gong Hee earlier.

118
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,340
At my house.

119
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,580
What do you mean by that?

120
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,249
Why would Gong Hee go there?

121
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,689
Didn't she tell you that we met?

122
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,260
She didn't come home.

123
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,660
She must've been shocked...

124
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,059
from hearing
that we used to live together.

125
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Then, what?

126
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:27,900
Did she think
things weren't serious between us?

127
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,330
Are you telling me
you actually said that?

128
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,169
It's funny.

129
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,770
We have so much history between us.

130
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,309
You can't just ignore that.
Isn't that right?

131
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,410
Why did you say that?

132
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,150
Why do you think I told her?

133
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,489
I have to correct what's wrong.

134
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,789
You felt it too, Min Gi.

135
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,960
You're regretting it in your heart.

136
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,600
It can't just be over like this.

137
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,100
Am I the only one who thinks so?

138
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,999
I'm hanging up.
Let's talk at work tomorrow.

139
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,320
I didn't know either.

140
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,379
That I'd need you this badly.

141
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:25,189
I can't even take a sip of water
without you. What can I do?

142
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,629
Come back.

143
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,859
In the end,
the one who will shine by my side...

144
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,770
is you, Seo Min Gi.

145
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:59,920
"If you rub
the magic lamp like this,"

146
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,790
"a genie will appear
and grant a wish..."

147
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,129
Hey, my hand isn't a magic lamp,
No Ah.

148
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:11,269
Why do you keep rubbing my hand?

149
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,109
Your hand is rough.
It's fun to rub it.

150
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:16,170
It's like playing with sand.

151
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
What?

152
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,509
Hey, what's wrong with my hand?

153
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:21,749
My gosh.

154
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:26,779
Goodness.

155
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,190
Oh, I'm sure I put my hand cream
somewhere here.

156
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,090
Where did it go?

157
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,330
Oh, no. My goodness.

158
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:45,940
My skin feels so moist.

159
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,170
Hey, Mr. Q.

160
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:50,170
Come on, baby.

161
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
"Hey, Mr. Q?"

162
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:54,609
What is that all about?

163
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,009
You're a quack. So, you're Mr. Q.

164
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,920
Look, there are kids listening.
No Ah and Ssook Ssook.

165
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,759
- What?
- Explain this first.

166
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,430
But why did this come out of there?

167
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,899
You were working with big hospitals
and whatnot.

168
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,830
I guess that brought in
some pretty decent money.

169
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,739
Oh, that was from Grandma
to give to No Ah.

170
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:22,540
Is that for me?

171
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,239
- Yes.
- My gosh.

172
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,139
- Are you going to lie?
- What?

173
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,710
Why do you keep racking up
bad karma?

174
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,779
Come clean before I count to three.

175
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,090
One, two...

176
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,090
Fine, you're right.

177
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,859
It's from the time
when I worked as an advisor.

178
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,290
I withdrew the money
to keep it as an emergency fund...

179
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,330
without getting caught.

180
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,129
My gosh. I can't believe this.

181
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,830
Is there more?

182
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,700
Are you suspecting me now?

183
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:53,139
I'm innocent!

184
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,340
Innocent, my foot.

185
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,840
You've stabbed me in the back
so many times.

186
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,909
Look, the back of my head is
becoming flat from all the stress!

187
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,109
- It was always flat...
- Hey!

188
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,379
Listen up. If there is more,

189
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,149
you need to tell me now
to maintain peace in the family.

190
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,060
I swear, there is no more.

191
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:13,489
Look at my innocent eyes.

192
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,229
If I find more,

193
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,330
you'll get a beating
for every dime I find, okay?

194
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,529
Come on. For every dime?
Get with the times.

195
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,570
You need to consider
the inflation rate.

196
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,600
Fine. For every cent, then.

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,139
- No Ah, let's get rolling.
- Let's get rolling!

198
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,239
- Search him. Stay still.
- I swear, there's no more. Wait!

199
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,070
Stop, hold on.

200
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,609
I'm very ticklish.

201
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,979
Your arms will hurt.
You can stop now.

202
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:37,850
The wrist pain during pregnancy
will last for life.

203
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,989
You've been running around
all day every day to find Grandma.

204
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,759
I can't go
and look for Grandma with you,

205
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,259
so I should at least do this.

206
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:49,090
I know you have bad knees.

207
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,759
I'm still strong and healthy,

208
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,729
so don't you worry.

209
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,200
Come and lie down here. It's fine.

210
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Okay.

211
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,609
Mom, it feels so nice
to be lying by your side like this.

212
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,279
It feels so warm and cozy.

213
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,249
Goodness. It's nice to go to sleep
next to your mom...

214
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,009
when you have a husband?

215
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,879
Who says that
in their honeymoon phase?

216
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:15,820
Don't you also prefer to go to sleep
next to me than to Dad?

217
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,950
Be honest with me.

218
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,090
When your dad and I were newlyweds,

219
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,190
we got along so well.

220
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,200
Even when my mother-in-law
was so mean to me,

221
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,460
my resentment melted away
the moment I saw your dad's face.

222
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,170
Although, it's all in the past now.

223
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,999
Really? You and Dad were like that?

224
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,840
All your emotions become dull
with time, no matter the kind.

225
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:36,909
To maintain the relationship,

226
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:39,440
you need a happy memory or two.

227
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:43,180
Should I just skip work tomorrow...

228
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:44,950
and go with you?

229
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,050
Goodness. No, don't.

230
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,950
I just want you to live a happy life
without worries.

231
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,889
Stop worrying about me.

232
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,019
That's how you can help me.

233
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,369
Okay, without worries.

234
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,470
Without worries.

235
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:16,979
Mom.

236
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,820
To tell you the truth,

237
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:25,489
I'm having a hard time.

238
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,029
It's so hard.

239
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:07,729
Hello, have you been well?

240
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,970
How shameless of you to come here.

241
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,239
With your head held high.

242
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:18,479
I heard you liked mangoes.

243
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,710
Dan Soo told me.

244
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,989
Dan Soo asked me to pay you a visit.

245
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,019
As Dan Soo's mom,

246
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,729
I'm going to be brave...

247
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,790
and make an effort.

248
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:38,399
"Mom?"

249
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,999
You're his mom?

250
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,040
Have you no shame
to call yourself his mom?

251
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,970
Dan Soo was practically an orphan.

252
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,869
I was the one who took him in,
fed him, clothed him,

253
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,340
and helped him
get to where he is now.

254
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,779
It wasn't you. It was all me,

255
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:55,379
Hwang Ik Sun.

256
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,680
Even if you keep doing this,

257
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,450
you can't change the fact
that I am Dan Soo's mother.

258
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,649
And you can't change the fact
that you were the one...

259
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:04,720
who got Hae Joon killed.

260
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,220
If you're going to
keep being stubborn like this,

261
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,029
I won't stay quiet.

262
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:12,629
Must you...

263
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,670
tear me and Dan Soo apart?

264
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,840
Then do you expect me
to just sit back and watch...

265
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,540
as he goes down the wrong path
because of you?

266
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,940
You want me to accept
a mere thing like you as my family?

267
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:28,979
For Dan Soo's sake,

268
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,879
could you please put the past
behind you...

269
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,989
and take a step back?

270
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,489
Please...

271
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,629
stop hurting Dan Soo.

272
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,629
How dare you lecture me?

273
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,300
Who do you think you are?

274
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:50,200
How dare you tell me
to stop hurting Dan Soo?

275
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,639
Fine, wait and see.

276
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,810
Find out
what will happen to Dan Soo...

277
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,670
if he turns away from me
and decides to side with you.

278
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,680
Keep your eyes wide-open
and see it for yourself.

279
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,109
You can come to me
and beg me on your knees then.

280
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:04,749
But just remember...

281
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,519
that you won't be leaving here...

282
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:09,119
in one piece then.

283
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,840
What if...

284
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:32,879
I really end up ruining Dan Soo too?

285
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:37,009
What if I ruin Dan Soo's life too?

286
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,550
Then what am I going to do?

287
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,119
What should I do?

288
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,869
I must intervene.

289
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,269
My dear Dan Soo...

290
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,540
I can't let him go on like this.

291
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,279
Honey.

292
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,450
Detective An and I went to Myeongwol
and checked some places,

293
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,389
but we couldn't find anyone
with Mother's name.

294
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,889
Did you check all the care homes
in the area?

295
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:24,760
Did they really all say
she wasn't there?

296
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,459
There are only a few care homes
in the area,

297
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,899
so we checked
every single one of them.

298
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:33,100
The thing is, Detective An
did find a similar name...

299
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,169
at one of the care homes he visited.

300
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:36,869
The name was Bok Yi.

301
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
"Bok Yi?"

302
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,139
Does the name ring a bell?

303
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:45,080
There was a lady
whom everyone called Ms. Bok Yi.

304
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,350
"Bok Yi?"

305
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,290
I feel like
I've heard the name before.

306
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,959
Detective An and I will go
to Chungcheong Province today.

307
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,300
Don't worry too much.

308
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:00,730
Hang in there, all right?

309
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,070
Bok Yi?

310
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,199
Bok Yi...

311
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,810
Oh, boy.

312
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,919
Goodness, you scared me.
Hey, I'm working now.

313
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,389
What's that?

314
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,389
It's Valentine's Day, you know.

315
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,820
I prepared this special gift
for you, Gyeong Bok.

316
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
My goodness.

317
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:30,760
What? Aren't women...

318
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,830
supposed to give gifts to men
on Valentine's Day?

319
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,669
Well, what matters is that
you express your love.

320
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:41,000
Then I shall accept this
with a grateful heart.

321
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,179
What is this?

322
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,949
What? Aren't these
dried radish greens?

323
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,490
At the poetry workshop, you talked
about dried radish green soup,

324
00:18:57,889 --> 00:18:58,889
so I thought...

325
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,230
This is nuts. My goodness.

326
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,600
You got me dried radish greens
instead of chocolate?

327
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,770
My heart is all dried up now,
like these dried radish greens.

328
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,869
Do you like my gift?

329
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:19,139
Detective An, were you too busy
catching bad guys to watch dramas?

330
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:23,080
What man gives a woman
dried radish greens as a gift?

331
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,209
Seriously.

332
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
My gosh.

333
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,119
Oh, it's busy today.

334
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,719
My gosh, Mr. Ryu. You're here.

335
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,159
Yes, hello. I was in the area,
so I wanted to stop by.

336
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,300
You didn't come
to the workshop today.

337
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,000
We're dealing with a family issue
at the moment,

338
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,540
so I don't have time
to write poems now.

339
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I see.

340
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:49,709
You're here too.

341
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:53,709
By the way,
what's with the dried radish greens?

342
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:57,810
Oh, he bought me
those dried radish greens...

343
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,449
for Valentine's Day.

344
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,449
He said he bought it for me
because I wrote a poem...

345
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:04,959
about how much I missed
dried radish green soup or whatever.

346
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
I see.

347
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:18,369
Valentine...

348
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,909
is the name of the Roman saint,
who was the patron of love...

349
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,869
even in the midst of persecution.

350
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:25,980
He officiated weddings
for soldiers in secret...

351
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,340
when they were forbidden to marry.

352
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,379
He was the patron saint
of love and romance.

353
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:33,919
Valentine's Day was created
in memory of him.

354
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,590
Oh, my.

355
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:40,359
Goodness, I didn't know about
the meaning behind Valentine's Day.

356
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,300
This day suits you very well.

357
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:47,959
Please accept this.

358
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,340
Oh, my.
Is it okay for me to take this?

359
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,270
Of course.

360
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
Here.

361
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,810
Every time you eat one,

362
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,419
please think about me too.

363
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,280
My goodness. You're making me blush.

364
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,719
Oh, my.

365
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,159
Detective An. What are you doing?
Why are you still here?

366
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:16,389
Let's get going.

367
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm going to leave a little later.

368
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,570
What? Hurry up and come along!

369
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,939
That's right. Hurry along.

370
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:31,240
I have something to talk about
with Mr. Ryu.

371
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,439
You should get going, okay?

372
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:34,310
Detective Dried Radish Greens.

373
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,810
- Why...
- Come on.

374
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,379
Hurry up, man.

375
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,449
- Let's go.
- Mr. Ryu, please have a seat.

376
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:41,850
- Okay, thank you.
- Let's sit.

377
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,850
Oh, my.

378
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,090
Did you wrap this yourself?

379
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:49,129
- Well, that is...
- My goodness.

380
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,560
Hey. It's me, Myung Ja.

381
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,030
Hey, Myung Ja.

382
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,199
Did you hear anything about Mom?

383
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,969
Oh, not yet.

384
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,399
Didn't you hear anything?

385
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:05,139
I asked some of my doctor friends
working in hospitals,

386
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:07,909
but I guess care homes
are a different matter.

387
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,879
It's not easy to find her.

388
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm just going around
to random places for now.

389
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,090
I went to Mom's hometown too.

390
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,050
There wasn't anyone
under Mom's name,

391
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,719
but there was someone named Bok Yi.

392
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,629
Bok Yi?

393
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:23,859
Are you sure it was Bok Yi?

394
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,830
Do you know that name?

395
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,159
Yes.

396
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,600
It's Mom's older sister's name.

397
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,830
The one who passed away
when Mom was little.

398
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,500
Mom used to mention her to me
from time to time.

399
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,939
That she remembered her sister,
Bok Yi.

400
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Hey.

401
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,209
I think I can find Mom.
I'll call you back later.

402
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:51,119
If you keep acting
however you want like this,

403
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,490
I have no other way either.

404
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,959
And what if I don't act
however I want?

405
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,889
What else can I do?

406
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:56,889
Kang Ji Na.

407
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:59,800
You're bound by
that useless sense of responsibility,

408
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,500
so I have to do something.
I can't just sit by and watch.

409
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,770
So? What are you planning to do?

410
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,310
First, I just let her know
that we used to live together.

411
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,580
But Maeng Gong Hee had come
to confirm something else.

412
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Something else?

413
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,750
She wanted to confirm...

414
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,050
if you and I were together
the night before last.

415
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:29,159
I bet you wanted to get past that
by lying.

416
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,159
You must've thought
Gong Hee would believe you,

417
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,399
being the simple girl she is.

418
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:36,000
But do you think Maeng Gong Hee
really bought your lie?

419
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,639
No, she just pretended
to fall for it.

420
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,939
She doesn't believe you, Seo Min Gi.

421
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,609
That was why she came
all the way to my house to check.

422
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,719
Why did you have to
mention us living together?

423
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,820
You didn't have to say it.

424
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
It's the truth that she has to face.

425
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,760
She knew everything
before you got married.

426
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:03,990
That Kang Ji Na is the person
Seo Min Gi loves.

427
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,230
Still, she made this choice.

428
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:09,730
What did I do wrong?

429
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:12,270
What is it that you want?

430
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,570
Where do you want to end up
by doing all this?

431
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:17,209
Get divorced.

432
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,439
What?

433
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,280
Divorce Maeng Gong Hee
and come to me.

434
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,149
That's only right.

435
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,419
This was the wrong path
to begin with.

436
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,959
It's fine. I'll fix things.

437
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,490
You should just do as I say...

438
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,159
My gosh. I can't take this anymore.

439
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,330
So, are you saying...

440
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,800
you shamelessly let
your current wife find out...

441
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,070
that you and your ex-girlfriend
used to live together?

442
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,270
Gu Dan Soo.

443
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,040
This isn't your business.

444
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Is that right?

445
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,609
But even
your ex-girlfriend is involved.

446
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:57,949
Why can't I get involved?

447
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,419
This is about my wife and me.

448
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,959
Then get your act together.

449
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,929
I told you.

450
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,359
Don't you dare
make Maeng Gong Hee cry.

451
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,929
It must be nice
to be Maeng Gong Hee.

452
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:17,600
She even has a friend
to step up for her.

453
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,969
Is this situation funny to you?

454
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:25,810
Or are you proud?

455
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,909
I knew you were a bottom-feeder
to begin with,

456
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:32,179
but if you're this fine
after seeing someone's heart break,

457
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,350
you're the absolute worst,

458
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,990
Ms. Kang Ji Na.

459
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,810
Hey, Maeng Gong Hee. Where are you?

460
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:58,609
I'm in your office. You said to
bring the documents for you to sign.

461
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,909
No, you can't do this!

462
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,449
She is my mom!

463
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,649
Please let me see her just once!

464
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:11,189
Her family is here.
Why won't you let me see her?

465
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,219
Please just let me check, at least.
Please!

466
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:17,030
But the patient doesn't want it.

467
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,230
She said she wasn't your family.

468
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,129
We can't help it either.

469
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:25,740
But she is my mom.

470
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:28,469
What kind of person
would get a good night's sleep...

471
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:30,969
after losing their parent?

472
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,409
Please.

473
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,010
I'm human too.

474
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:39,350
I'm her child. I have to find her!

475
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,679
Oh, my.

476
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,919
Are you okay?

477
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,820
Myung Ja!

478
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,320
(Myeongwol Nursing Home)

479
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,330
Myung Ja!

480
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,770
Why do you keep trying to find me?

481
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,399
You're wearing yourself out!

482
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Mom.

483
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,070
Is that you?

484
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,040
Is that really you, Mom?

485
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,840
I told you not to find me.

486
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,580
Myung Ja!

487
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,379
Mom!

488
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,959
Mom!

489
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,820
Myung Ja.

490
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,469
What are you doing here, Mom?

491
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,840
I looked everywhere for you.

492
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:37,709
If you hide like this
without even saying a word,

493
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,810
what am I supposed to do?

494
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:43,879
How am I supposed to live?

495
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,949
How am I supposed to live
without going mad?

496
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,949
I didn't want to burden you.

497
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,490
That's why
I tried to be apart from you.

498
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,730
Why did you keep tiring yourself out
to look for me?

499
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,730
This was tiring,

500
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,359
but it was even harder
not to have you around.

501
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:02,929
A world without you...

502
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:04,399
is too scary.

503
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
I can't live without you, Mom!

504
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,770
I can't live a single day
in my right mind.

505
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:12,740
Why would you, Mom?

506
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,250
Why would you hide?

(My Merry Marriage)

508
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,969
I made a choice.

509
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:38,030
I want to be comfortable here...

510
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,439
until my time is over.

511
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,969
Dan Soo, help out...

512
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:43,869
- with the Heirmez project.
- Me?

513
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:44,969
I warned you.

514
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:45,980
You will regret it.

515
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,639
And I warned you too.

516
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,449
If you make Maeng Gong Hee cry,

517
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:50,709
I won't let you off the hook.

518
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,050
Are you going out again?

519
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,219
It's an important call.
