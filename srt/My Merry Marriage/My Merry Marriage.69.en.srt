1
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,219
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,029
(Episode 69)

3
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,029
Why?

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,769
Is something wrong, Ms. Maeng?

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,700
Tell me what it is.

6
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,209
Why did you ask for me?

7
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,290
Well, I got those teas as a gift.

8
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,290
Can you try them?

9
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,960
Me? Why?

10
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,460
Let me know which one
would be best to offer to my guests.

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,490
Rate them and make a list.

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:05,329
But I don't think it's part
of my job as a designer, sir.

13
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,040
I worked with you
on the fashion show,

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,110
so I can trust you and know
that you have good taste.

15
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,509
I need the opinion
of someone I can trust.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,879
Have a seat.

17
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,100
This tea is...

18
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,969
very fruity,
and I like the tangy flavor.

19
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,210
And?

20
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,020
This one is a little bitter.

21
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,330
My gosh.

22
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,389
Hey! Are you teasing me now?

23
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,359
Look here, Ms. Maeng.

24
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,770
You're an executive director
and the chairwoman's grandson. So what?

25
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,930
To me, you're still
Snot Face Gu Dan Soo.

26
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,270
Did you think I'd fall for this?

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
I see that it's not working.

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,570
Seriously, what happened?

29
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,309
You're Holly? And what is this?

30
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,350
Can you explain what's going on?

31
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,819
How can you be Holly?
If you're the chairwoman's grandson,

32
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,650
why didn't you tell me?

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,589
I did tell you a few times
that I was Holly,

34
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:35,059
but you didn't believe me.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,920
And if I'd told you
who my grandma was,

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,390
your family would've kicked me out.

37
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,129
What else? Is there anything else
you want to know?

38
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,129
Even so, you should have told me.

39
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:46,400
Well, how do the teas taste?

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,839
Why won't you do your job?

41
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,770
Fine, this is what you'll do?

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,210
Sit down and try the rest.

43
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,580
You have to try all of them.

44
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,210
Mr. Executive Director,
I have to wrap up the fashion show,

45
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,010
so I'm swamped right now.

46
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,980
Well, this is very important...

47
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,379
I have to get back to work.

48
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:07,420
Please refrain from calling me
for help with personal stuff.

49
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,589
If you call me here
for something like this again,

50
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,089
I'll report you
for workplace harassment.

51
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Hey, wait!

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,839
I wanted you to have some good tea
and rest, Maeng Gong Hee.

53
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,770
Goodness.

54
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,110
Why do you have so many secrets,
Snot Face?

55
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:30,779
My gosh.

56
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,050
Well...

57
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,379
I feel better after seeing his face.

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,249
I can breathe now.

59
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,499
How's Myung Ja?
Is she still bedridden?

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,839
Yes.

61
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Oh, dear.

62
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,939
I really hope
she pulls herself together soon.

63
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,309
I feel like there's nothing I can do
to help her.

64
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,450
She won't listen to anyone.

65
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,879
Even I don't know what to do.

66
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,319
Well...

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,650
I don't know how this will sound,

68
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,789
but you guys are very lucky.

69
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,830
What do you mean we're lucky?

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,360
You know very well...

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,629
that I'm in this mess now
because I couldn't get pregnant.

72
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,900
I was exhausted
after 12 unsuccessful IVF attempts.

73
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,539
Then my husband and I drifted apart.

74
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,279
So, he had a child
with another woman...

75
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,880
and hounded me to divorce him.

76
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,580
It still makes me so angry.

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,620
I feel like he left me
because I couldn't get pregnant.

78
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,750
Forget it and move on now.

79
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,760
Why are you still hung up
on something like that?

80
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,529
Both Gong Hee and Gong Boo...

81
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,859
can make babies with such ease.

82
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:57,400
That's why I say you guys are lucky.

83
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,900
Oh, boy.

84
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,669
It's not just me.

85
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,400
So many people struggle...

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,810
because they can't conceive
when they want to.

87
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,140
Life is so precious.

88
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:13,349
It really is a blessing.

89
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,390
I know how upset Myung Ja is,

90
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,289
so I didn't say anything to her,

91
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,690
but Gong Hee should have the baby
no matter what and raise it well.

92
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,299
My goodness.

93
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,669
What is going on?

94
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:38,810
Why does he keep coming here
so often these days?

95
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,039
Well, he's just...

96
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,049
Men just love to stalk me.

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,419
So, which dumplings would you like?

98
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,750
Galbi dumplings?

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,890
Yes, two servings
of galbi dumplings, please.

100
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,890
Okay.

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,719
Hey.

102
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,429
You should stay by Audrey
to keep her safe.

103
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,260
You can't come here.

104
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,099
Well, that's...

105
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:05,830
The thing is...

106
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,640
- So...
- What?

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,640
My gosh.

108
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,979
Was that a wink?

109
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,979
Oh, goodness.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,549
(Changhwa Diner,
Spicy beef stew, fresh pork belly)

111
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,460
(Tiffany Alterations)

112
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,029
Move out of the way.

113
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,260
I can't do that.

114
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,500
You're trying
to cause a scene again!

115
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,500
If you don't move,

116
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,900
I have no other choice!

117
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:44,609
Excuse me.

118
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,210
It's fine.

119
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,679
I'll go and talk to him.

120
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,779
But I can't let you do that.

121
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,380
It'll be fine.

122
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,390
Let's go.

123
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,820
I have something to say
to the chairwoman too.

124
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,310
What's going on between you two?

125
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,080
What? Who? Between which two?

126
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,750
Stop trying to avoid the question.

127
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,049
You went into the kitchen
and were winking and stuff.

128
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,719
Gosh, well...

129
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,349
I wasn't winking.

130
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,760
It's because
I have such big round eyes.

131
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,089
I kept getting dust in my eye.

132
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:43,229
Gosh, you know
what I'm talking about.

133
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,429
Then use some eyedrops.

134
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:45,669
Goodness.

135
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,210
(Maeng Dumplings)

136
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,479
Hey, what is it?

137
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,479
What's going on?

138
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,320
That guy showed up again.

139
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,020
Ms. Oh Jung Eun went with him.

140
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:05,289
What?

141
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:14,130
I asked you here
to have one last meal together.

142
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,359
You should leave Seoul after this.

143
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,500
It will be best for you
to disappear...

144
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,099
before Dan Soo finds out.

145
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,440
I should.

146
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,940
But before that,

147
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:27,779
let me ask you one thing.

148
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,150
When Dan Soo was growing up,

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,620
did he ever talk about me?

150
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,150
Why are you curious about that?

151
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,020
In case Dan Soo...

152
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,260
missed his mom...

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,960
What if I should appear
before him now...

154
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,700
and ask for forgiveness?

155
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,900
Who do you think you are
to act like you care about Dan Soo?

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,439
Whose fault was it that
he lost his father? How dare you?

157
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,240
Was that really my fault?

158
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,010
If you had accepted me,

159
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,750
I wouldn't have had to
wander and hide...

160
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,279
or leave Hae Joon and Dan Soo,

161
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,650
and Hae Joon
wouldn't have had to go through...

162
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,220
something like that
as he was looking for me.

163
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,260
It all happened because you coveted
something you shouldn't have.

164
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,159
Your overflowing greed
gobbled up my son.

165
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:26,400
I only wanted one thing.

166
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,299
It was to live by Hae Joon
and my son's side.

167
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,669
Was that too much to ask for?

168
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:34,079
Of course, it was.

169
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,309
My biggest regret in life is that
I didn't cut you off sooner.

170
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,319
The apple didn't fall too far
from your barmaid mother's tree.

171
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,350
How vulgar.

172
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,620
Why didn't you say that
to Dan Soo too?

173
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,529
The reason Dan Soo had to grow up
without a mom...

174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,900
and how his grandma threatened
and drove away his mom.

175
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,770
Even if I could go back in time,

176
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,299
I would make the same decision.

177
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,809
Even if Dan Soo resents me,

178
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,309
I'd do it for my grandson.

179
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,380
(General Recording)

180
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,789
Everything you just said...

181
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,189
has been recorded.

182
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,319
I could text this...

183
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,090
to Dan Soo right this instant.

184
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,100
Delete that right now.

185
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,459
How dare you threaten me?

186
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,480
What do you think you're doing?

187
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,010
It's not a threat.

188
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
I'm begging you.

189
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
I'll leave.

190
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,919
But just give me three months.

191
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,760
Until then,
I'll just stay by Dan Soo's side...

192
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,689
and watch him from afar.

193
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,260
Just three months.

194
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,900
Can't you see how desperate I am
to do this?

195
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,569
I don't expect much. This is it.

196
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:13,709
I won't tell him that I'm his mom.

197
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,909
I'll only stay by Dan Soo's side...

198
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,350
and watch him.

199
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,779
If you won't even let me do that,

200
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,490
I don't know what I might do either.

201
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,140
"So, Snow White and the prince..."

202
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,669
"lived happily ever after."

203
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:46,709
The end.

204
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,590
Goodness, what a little angel.

205
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,260
You're the cutest when you sleep.

206
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,799
Are you awake?

207
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,400
Read to me again.

208
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,809
"A long time ago,
there once lived Snow White."

209
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,409
"Next to her..."

210
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,250
Please sleep.

211
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
"But then..."

212
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,659
My goodness.

213
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,789
We had to give up our room
to that little kid.

214
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:42,230
What are we doing
in the living room like this?

215
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,600
And why do I always have to
read him his bedtime story?

216
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,299
He says he can't get into the story
when it's in my voice.

217
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,309
Then you could read it to him
in a woman's voice.

218
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,309
Once upon a time,
there lived a scary evil witch.

219
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,480
That evil witch...

220
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,679
ate spicy chicken feet
and grilled tripe so often...

221
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,750
that every time she opened her
mouth, she would breathe fire...

222
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,659
Hey, do you want me to show you
something really scary?

223
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,059
No.

224
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,990
You know, about Gong Hee...

225
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,159
She's still acting brave at work,

226
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:20,199
but that makes me feel
even worse for her.

227
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,400
Have you spoken to her?

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Not yet.

229
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,209
She must have a lot on her mind
as it is.

230
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:28,779
Actually,

231
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,579
I'm against her having the baby
on her own.

232
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:33,850
And do you think I'm all for it?

233
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,549
Just wait until I get my hands
on that guy. I'll kill him.

234
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,220
How dare he do that to my sister?

235
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,620
Gosh, you're all talk.

236
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,590
You must've forgotten
everything you've done.

237
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,360
What did I do?

238
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,699
This is what people call
double standards.

239
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,569
It's different
from what happened between us.

240
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,100
I am rooting for her as a woman
who was also determined...

241
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,709
to have and raise a baby on her own.

242
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,409
Well, it doesn't really feel like...

243
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,909
I'm raising a child
with a spouse now either.

244
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,419
I didn't know the clinic
would suddenly get so busy.

245
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,250
You must be my lucky charm,
Hong Dan.

246
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,120
The legendary woman
who overcame premature menopause.

247
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,829
That mouth of yours.
Your mouth is the problem.

248
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,159
Then you could just shut me up.

249
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,400
- I could shut you up with this.
- Hey!

250
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
- Sorry. Oh, no.
- Your foot smells like bad breath.

251
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:27,699
That's bad. What do I do?

252
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,400
Is it rotten?

253
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,000
Go and wash up!

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,850
- Gong Hee.
- Yes?

255
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,689
Let me ask you for a personal favor.

256
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,890
Go and get something
from the basement.

257
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,630
I just can't find the time because
of a meeting out of the office.

258
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,370
Ice Witch is making her run
useless errands again, right?

259
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:06,669
My gosh.

260
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,740
Gong Hee is
a permanent employee now,

261
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,449
but her ridiculous attitude
just won't change.

262
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,579
My goodness.

263
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,279
She's seriously too mean.

264
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,990
Excuse me, hello.

265
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,860
- Are you from Hanbit Printing?
- Yes.

266
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,189
Why did you come
all the way down in person?

267
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,559
I could've brought it up to you.

268
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,829
- I was told to bring it up myself.
- I see.

269
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,230
But what are all these?

270
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,840
These are wedding invitations.
Take a look.

271
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,770
Anyway, the wedding is taking place
at such a nice venue.

272
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,140
This is a really expensive venue.

273
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,209
I'm jealous.

274
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,090
(For All Your Printing Needs,
Hanbit Printing)

275
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,520
(TF Team, Design Manager Kang Ji Na)

276
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,860
I know you're busy too. Thanks.

277
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,360
Congratulations on your wedding.

278
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,130
We're the only ones
who are late for the meeting.

279
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,130
Let's go.

280
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:06,669
Yes.

281
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,980
(Seo Min Gi, Kang Ji Na)

282
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:23,720
All right. Our executive director...

283
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,750
kindly joined us for this meeting.

284
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,289
My, what an honor.

285
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,329
Please continue
to sit in our meetings.

286
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,329
All your fond memories
of being on the TF team.

287
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,029
You haven't forgotten
those memories, right?

288
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,270
Memories? Like what?

289
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Oh, right.

290
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,340
You kicked me in the shin.

291
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,409
It was so memorable
that I can never forget it.

292
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,779
Well, that was... Please forget it.

293
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,020
Since everyone is here,

294
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,789
I have something to give you all.

295
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,829
What do you think you're doing?

296
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,799
Why? We got these printed
to give them out.

297
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,039
Come with me.

298
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,909
(Seo Min Gi, Kang Ji Na)

299
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,610
- Goodness.
- Gosh, are they fighting again?

300
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,050
They were very tense.

301
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,719
It seemed serious.

302
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,689
Here I was, thinking
things were peaceful for a while.

303
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,219
Oh, boy.

304
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,429
(Seo Min Gi, Kang Ji Na)

305
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,630
Oh, wait.

306
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,030
Sir, is there a problem?

307
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,469
Oh, they always fight like that...

308
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,709
whenever their eyes meet.

309
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm sure you've seen them fight
in the office.

310
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,239
Goodness.

311
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,320
Oh, dear. When will they grow up?

312
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,179
I hope they grow up soon.

313
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:08,790
I hope they take responsibility
for what they said.

314
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,590
As their superior,
I will make sure they do.

315
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,640
Hey, what's wrong?

316
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,590
Did you just rip it up?

317
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,890
What are you doing
without even talking to me first?

318
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:48,300
Is it always your way
or the highway?

319
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,630
You want to cancel the wedding?

320
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,840
No. I cannot do that.

321
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,509
The two of us must get married,
no matter what.

322
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,209
Do you not even think about
how hurt Gong Hee would be?

323
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,009
How will she feel
if people in the company find out?

324
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,219
Every time I see you
being so selfish like this...

325
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,080
I really am sick of this.

326
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:12,689
You are sick of me?

327
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Why?

328
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:19,360
Do you suddenly like her now that
she's pregnant with your child?

329
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,530
Do you love her?

330
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,259
Talking about taking responsibility
was just an excuse.

331
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,169
Gong Hee.

332
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,310
You tell him.

333
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
That's enough.

334
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,610
Tell him!

335
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:43,320
You said you'd never bog him down.

336
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,650
You said yourself that the baby
had nothing to do with Seo Min Gi.

337
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,060
You said that to my face.

338
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,390
Are you faltering now because
he said he'd take responsibility?

339
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,659
I don't know why
I have to be listening to this now.

340
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,699
Honestly, the pregnancy...

341
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:00,800
was so sudden for me too.

342
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,439
Until I made up my mind
to keep the baby,

343
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,870
I was very stressed out.

344
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,340
Mr. Seo was not involved
in that process in any way.

345
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,610
It was solely my decision.

346
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,810
So, get rid of the baby.

347
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,219
Why are you being so stubborn?

348
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,689
Do I really have to
keep listening to this?

349
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,060
Seo Min Gi, you tell us.

350
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,259
How exactly are you going
to take responsibility?

351
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,929
I already told him
I did not need him to do anything.

352
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,159
Please!

353
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,999
I'm the one
who's the most confused right now.

354
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,669
So, please stop.
What do you want me to do?

355
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:35,669
How should I take responsibility
for this situation?

356
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,800
Should I give up on the wedding?

357
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,340
It's not an easy decision...

358
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:41,979
What did you say?

359
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,439
How could you say such a thing?

360
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
Gu Dan Soo.

361
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,050
What on earth was he saying earlier?

362
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,749
You're pregnant?
What does that mean?

363
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,759
I'm moved to tears.

364
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,189
What's this,
the love story of the century?

365
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,929
She's pregnant
with another man's child.

366
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,929
Are you going to marry her
or something?

367
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,229
As the heir to Jayce Group?

368
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,400
Say something!

369
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,070
Let's go. I'll explain everything.

370
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:27,689
(Together with Jayce Fashion)

371
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,689
Why didn't you tell me?

372
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,459
You should've told me
when something like that happened.

373
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:36,459
Are you stupid?

374
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,600
I was scared.

375
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:41,600
I was afraid...

376
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,199
that you might shun me too.

377
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,009
Why did you step in like that?

378
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,179
Ms. Kang is right.

379
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,709
You are the heir to Jayce Group.

380
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,340
Why would you bring that up now?

381
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,080
It doesn't matter
whose child it is...

382
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,719
and whether or not
I'll raise the child by myself.

383
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,050
It wasn't your place
to step in like that.

384
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:00,519
Don't tell me...

385
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:04,090
that was why you pushed me away.

386
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,989
I told you...

387
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,630
that we should just be strangers
as if we didn't know each other.

388
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:13,169
I still feel the same way.

389
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,840
Tell me.

390
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,100
Was the baby...

391
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,310
the reason you pushed me away?

392
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,310
Is that important now?

393
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,880
What matters now is how I feel.

394
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,009
You're an executive director,
and I'm a mere employee.

395
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,810
We're nothing more than that.

396
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,979
You said you were scared.

397
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,419
Like you said,

398
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,150
if I'm an executive director,
and you're just an employee,

399
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,689
then there's no reason
you couldn't tell me.

400
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,759
Right now,

401
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:39,659
I'm not a mere stranger to you.

402
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,400
I have to go, sir.

403
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,519
Why do you look so upset?

404
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,290
Mom, are you feeling better?

405
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,830
Let's go inside and eat.

406
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,269
All right.

407
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,610
Hi, Gong Hee!

408
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,340
Why did you cook up a feast?

409
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,479
Hey, why did you go to work
on an empty stomach?

410
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,880
You're pregnant.

411
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,519
You need to eat.

412
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,650
Have a seat.

413
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,689
Eat everything on the table.

414
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,060
This is too much food.

415
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,560
No, it's not.

416
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,030
You'd better finish everything.

417
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,999
Your face looks gaunt.

418
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Hurry up and eat.

419
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,560
Do what you want.

420
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,489
Mom.

421
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,360
I'll help you out.

422
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,769
I will help you.

423
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:28,999
I can...

424
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,269
totally help you raise your baby.

425
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,580
Yes! You have me too.

426
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,009
I'm really good with kids too.

427
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,679
Eat well and try to smile a little.

428
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,419
You did nothing wrong.

429
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:49,360
Why can't you walk
with your head held high?

430
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,630
We'll raise the baby well
and give it everything it needs.

431
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:54,560
All of us will help you,

432
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,459
so you...

433
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,600
don't need to worry about anything.

434
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,709
Here.

435
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,110
Try this too.

436
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,120
Here.

437
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:38,769
What?

438
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:40,870
Am I seeing things now?

439
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,489
Maeng Gong Hee.

440
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,630
It's really Gu Dan Soo.

441
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:18,850
Why did you come here,
Executive Director Gu?

442
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Why are you calling me like that?

443
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:23,679
We're not at work now.

444
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,249
And am I not allowed to come here?

445
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,459
I paid a year's rent up front,

446
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:29,459
so I'm still a tenant here.

447
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,360
I'll give you back your rent.
Get out.

448
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:38,769
What are you planning to do?

449
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
Seo Min Gi is going
to marry Kang Ji Na.

450
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,340
Go. I want to be alone.

451
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,340
What are you going to do,
you foolish Maeng Ggong?

452
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,890
Seriously...

453
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,219
You didn't even tell me about it,
and what?

454
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,820
Let's become strangers?
Let's not see each other anymore?

455
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,729
You were just pretending
to be tough.

456
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,169
I won't fall for your words again.
So come on out!

457
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
My gosh.

458
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,469
Whatever.

459
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,150
I can't show him my weak side.

460
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,719
Not to Dan Soo.

461
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,989
I just have to get through this.

462
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,890
It will all pass.

463
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,699
Seo Min Gi, you jerk!

464
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,810
How could you do that
to Maeng Gong Hee?

465
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,050
Gong Hee is...

466
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:03,820
Maeng Gong Hee is...

467
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:14,030
To me, Maeng Gong Hee is...

468
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,669
like my own life.

469
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:30,939
(My Merry Marriage)

470
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,249
Did you cry all night?

471
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,150
Your face looks like
you were crying all night.

472
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,479
What am I supposed to do, Dad?

473
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:39,620
I know I can't.

474
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,749
I know I could never do that,

475
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:44,560
but I like him so much
that I can't bring myself to stop.

476
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,590
Gong Hee...

477
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,630
I told her I'd take responsibility.
I will keep my word.

478
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,259
I'll set a date to get married.

479
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:53,199
I haven't told you
why I came here, have I?

480
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,830
I'll become your baby's dad.

481
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,840
