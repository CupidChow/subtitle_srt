1
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,290
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:28,460
(Episode 100)

3
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,969
These are false labor pains, okay?

4
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:33,940
Last night, you said
they were three minutes apart,

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,739
but they were gone
when we got to the hospital.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,940
When you actually go into labor,

7
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,539
you won't even have time
to breathe through the pain.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,839
Is Ssook Ssook coming out?

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,679
I mean,
I really felt a jolt in my belly.

10
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,580
It was a weird feeling, okay?

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,449
That means I'm going into labor.
I am, aren't I?

12
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,120
What you felt was
the gas in your stomach...

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,129
moving into the intestines.

14
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,300
You've been eating a lot.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,470
If you overeat,
Ssook Ssook will feel sick too.

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,199
So, Ssook Ssook isn't coming out?

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,070
Oh, Ssook Ssook is
stuck in traffic now.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,239
Mom's stomach is filled with gas
right now,

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,339
so Ssook Ssook is stuck
in a serious traffic jam.

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,309
Gosh, seriously.
I hear other husbands...

21
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,349
take such good care of their wives
when the due date is approaching.

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,320
Why did I get pregnant at this age?
It's not like it'll make me rich.

23
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,149
Mom.

24
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,420
Yes, No Ah. You're the only one
who cares about me.

25
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:32,560
Having contractions
that are 15 minutes apart...

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,060
is a sign that labor has begun.

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,869
If you feel a squeezing sensation...

28
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,970
at regular intervals,
tell me right away.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,569
I'm an ob-gyn, you know.

30
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,239
Of course, I'd know
when my baby is about to come out.

31
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,239
I don't trust you. I thought
you were a quack when we first met.

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,509
What is a quack?

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
No Ah.

34
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,250
When you hear her say
stuff like that, just forget it.

35
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:52,849
Whatever.

36
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,379
I'm going to keep count, okay?

37
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,090
You said
they'd be 15 minutes apart, right?

38
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,590
All right.

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,019
- One, two,
- One, two,

40
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,390
- three, four, five,
- three, four, five,

41
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,860
- six, seven,
- Gosh, I'm tired.

42
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,200
- eight, nine, ten.
- eight, nine, ten.

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,679
I'm still not due for a while.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,219
No way.

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,320
Momo.

46
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,130
Hang in there, okay?

47
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,459
You can do it, right?

48
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,929
I'll keep you safe...

49
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,570
and wait for you
until the day we meet, Momo.

50
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:09,459
Hey.

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,890
I'll have dinner with my friends
and watch a show too.

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,100
Just know that I'll be home late.

53
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,670
It means none of us
will have dinner at home today,

54
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,839
so you can just order in
or something.

55
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:22,739
Okay.

56
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,260
I feel like it's been a while,
seeing you in the morning like this.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,739
The project is in the final stages,
so I can breathe a little now.

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,140
Once the project is done,

59
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,140
you won't have a good excuse.

60
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,110
What do you mean, an excuse?

61
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,850
The excuse that
you can't come home because...

62
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,749
you have to work all night.

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,350
Don't be so twisted.

64
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,719
See you when I'm back
from my work trip.

65
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,160
Another work trip?

66
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,999
We're wrapping up
and finalizing things now.

67
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,059
It'll take a few days.

68
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
What's wrong?

69
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,910
I wanted Momo...

70
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,780
to have a warm, loving home.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,150
That was the only reason
I decided to marry you,

72
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,249
and I want to protect our marriage.

73
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,689
I want to keep the promise
I made to myself.

74
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,360
I want to keep the promise
I made to my baby,

75
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,059
which is why I'm pretending
not to know what I saw.

76
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,329
I'm letting you deceive me.

77
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:55,999
What?

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,030
Have you ever...

79
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,970
tried to understand how anxious
I might be now, even just once?

80
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,309
How much I've endured by myself...

81
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:06,809
and how scared I've been.

82
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,739
Have you thought of that even once?

83
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,520
What more do I have to do?

84
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,119
You tell me.

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,090
Please be honest for once.

86
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,119
If I ask you not to go
and to stay by my side,

87
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,960
can you do that for me?

88
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,329
I want to protect our Momo
because Momo is so precious to me.

89
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:28,829
Is Momo...

90
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,970
precious to you too?

91
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,210
You said you'd only take a month off
for your maternity leave.

92
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,710
Why? You should take
at least three months off.

93
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,579
I'll adjust
the duration of your leave...

94
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,879
You're just pretending to worry...

95
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,550
to keep me from going to work.
How cowardly of you.

96
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,290
The responsibility you spoke of...

97
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,420
was nothing but a facade.

98
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,929
I know you feel more sensitive...

99
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,300
because your body is exhausted too.

100
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,369
Get some rest. I'll be back.

101
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,069
No...

102
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,270
My belly...

103
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,939
Please...

104
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,509
Please help me...

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,329
Eight hundred ninety-eight,
eight hundred ninety-nine,

106
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,090
nine hundred.

107
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,100
Gosh, your mom is still doing that.
Look.

108
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,670
- It's happening! Labor pains!
- What?

109
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,739
Why? What's wrong?

110
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,439
Hey, you quack!

111
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,439
You were wrong.
I was right again this time!

112
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,949
Contractions once every 15 minutes.
I was right.

113
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,379
- You punk!
- Really? Wait.

114
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,949
Hey! Wait, it hurts! Let go of me!

115
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,020
- Let go first.
- I told you.

116
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,889
Are you okay? Let go of me first.

117
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,819
- Honey, my belly...
- Honey, please.

118
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,090
I think the baby is coming!

119
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,369
- You're okay. Hang in there.
- Oh, no...

120
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,800
I don't think I can do this.

121
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,569
Why? What is going on?

122
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,639
My goodness. What is it?

123
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,509
- Are you having contractions again?
- Yes.

124
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,410
They're for real this time. I swear.

125
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,879
- This is serious.
- What?

126
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,110
Be calm. Deep breaths.

127
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,679
Yes. Last time,

128
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:31,850
you made a huge fuss,
saying it was the real deal.

129
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,319
Gong Boo even had to run home
in the middle of his workday.

130
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,020
But what did it turn out to be?

131
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,530
You had gotten all worked up
because Ssook Ssook was kicking.

132
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,999
But she says
it's the real thing this time.

133
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,230
Can you describe the pain?

134
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,569
Well, that's...

135
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:49,939
I think I feel better now.

136
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,079
See? You cried wolf. My goodness.

137
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,239
Well...

138
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,749
Was Ssook Ssook
in a boxing match this time?

139
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:01,249
I felt a really strong jolt,

140
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,079
but it's gone again.

141
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,889
You pulled out
a fistful of my hair earlier.

142
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,189
Was I the one in a boxing match?

143
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:13,999
Seeing how active Ssook Ssook is,

144
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,300
Ssook Ssook must have
a knack for sports...

145
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,530
My gosh!

146
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,770
- Honey! It's back! My gosh.
- Hey!

147
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,340
I was right! These are labor pains!

148
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,639
- My goodness.
- Honey, hold on. Hey!

149
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,480
Let's be calm. Relax.

150
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,639
We practiced the breathing.
Watch me and breathe.

151
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,009
There you go.

152
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,489
- I'm dying!
- Wait!

153
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,220
I'm dying!

154
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,119
Maeng Gong Boo! If I die,
you're totally coming with me.

155
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,559
- You know that, don't you?
- All right.

156
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,329
You always scared me,
telling me to watch out...

157
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:46,660
- since I'm an older mom!
- I'm sorry.

158
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,699
I can't let anything bad happen
to my Ssook Ssook.

159
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,699
No, I'd never be able
to live with that.

160
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,140
- Please do something!
- Oh, dear. This is bad.

161
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,109
Maybe this time,
the wolf is really here.

162
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,640
My gosh,
I shouldn't just stand here.

163
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,109
Hey! Where is the bag you packed?

164
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Oh, dear.

165
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,650
Goodness.

166
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,059
Yes, hello?

167
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,559
What? The baby is coming?

168
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,130
Yes, okay. Got it. Oh, my.

169
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,870
Goodness me. What do I do?

170
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,469
- My gosh.
- Hello.

171
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:28,599
- Let's sit here...
- Excuse me.

172
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,969
We're closed for today.

173
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,679
My grandchild is being born!

174
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,979
- Oh, really?
- Congratulations.

175
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:39,479
- Then, you should hurry over.
- Congratulations.

176
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,050
Yes, thank you.
Then, please excuse me.

177
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,990
- He's in such a rush.
- My goodness.

178
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,920
(Birthing Center)

179
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,959
- Hong Dan!
- You can't go in now.

180
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,719
I have to go in there.

181
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,329
I run an OB-GYN clinic.

182
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,329
Oh, boy.

183
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,530
You can't try to force your way in.

184
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,429
I'll tell you
when you can go inside.

185
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,429
When? I have to be by her side.

186
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:34,939
Not now.

187
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,599
My gosh!

188
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:40,939
Good grief. What are you doing?
You look like a mess.

189
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,979
You practically have a sign
on your forehead that says,

190
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,709
"I'm the husband
of an expectant mother."

191
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:47,449
Hey, just sit still.

192
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,479
You're a man.
You need to pull yourself together.

193
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,550
But Hong Dan is an older mom.

194
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,959
What if something bad happens
to Hong Dan because of me?

195
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
I...

196
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,030
I told her
they weren't labor pains...

197
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,469
I told her she was making a fuss.

198
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,069
Hey, kid!

199
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:11,339
Come on.

200
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,439
Did that wake you up a bit?

201
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Dad.

202
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:19,179
You shouldn't cry
when your child is being born.

203
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:21,079
You should greet your baby
with a smile.

204
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,849
A father should never cry.

205
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,490
All right? Goodness, my boy.

206
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,719
Dad!

207
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:32,329
Come here. It's fine. Don't cry.

208
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,959
It's okay.

209
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,370
That's it.

210
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:42,800
We have an emergency OB-GYN patient.

211
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,140
- Did you contact the family?
- I can't reach them now.

212
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,910
But this is really urgent.
We should have her give birth first.

213
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,040
(Hankuk University Hospital)

214
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,209
Please...

215
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,979
Please...

216
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,020
Please save my baby.

217
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:58,219
Please...

218
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,890
Ma'am, you're almost there.

219
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,589
Just hang in there a little longer.

220
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,059
Doctor.

221
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,130
I can't do this.

222
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,670
I don't have any strength left.

223
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,969
It's okay. Take deep breaths,

224
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:20,839
and you have to
control your strength.

225
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,640
Ma'am, the next time you feel pain,

226
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,780
take a deep breath in
and push with all your might.

227
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:30,719
All right.
I can nearly see the baby's head.

228
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:44,300
Maeng Gong Boo!

229
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Hong Dan!

230
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,569
Gong Boo is here! I'm right here!

231
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,740
You punk!
Stop talking and just stay still!

232
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:54,410
Hong Dan, I'll make you
your favorite spicy chicken feet.

233
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,540
Hang in there.

234
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,849
Niece-in-law, you have to boost
my pub's sales like you used to!

235
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,020
Okay? You can do it. You got this!

236
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Be quiet, all of you.
How can she give birth like this?

237
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,290
Honey, you can do it!

238
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,760
I love you!

239
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,829
Ma'am,
your family is rooting for you.

240
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,660
Let's give it one last push.

241
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,520
This is Manager Seo Min Gi's phone.

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,120
Is this
Ms. Maeng Gong Hee's guardian?

243
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:41,120
Ms. Maeng is going into
emergency labor right now.

244
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,819
We need her guardian's consent.

245
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Hello?

246
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,559
Hello, could you confirm
your identity?

247
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,800
I'll tell him to call you back.

248
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,270
What was that call about?

249
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,040
Oh, it was nothing.

250
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,179
What time did you say
the meeting was?

251
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,150
Well, we have about an hour left.

252
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,150
(Power off)

253
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,579
Hey, you might die first.
My goodness.

254
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,179
How many hours has it been?

255
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,479
Is she all right?

256
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,319
She is an older mom.

257
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,219
The longer it takes,
the harder it'll get for her.

258
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,660
- Maeng Gong Boo, you jerk!
- Mom, this won't do.

259
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,229
I should go in.

260
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,900
Oh, my. That kid...
What's wrong with him?

261
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,380
Ms. Maeng, you need to
keep breathing. Breathe.

262
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,880
Good. Keep breathing.

263
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,949
Great. I see the head now.

264
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,120
Hang in there, just a little longer.

265
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:37,969
Will you...

266
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,270
stay with me tonight?

267
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:46,449
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,150
It was my mistake.

269
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:01,800
Min Gi...

270
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,300
was with me last night.

271
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,339
At my place, in my room.

272
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,140
He was with me last night.

273
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:20,849
You.

274
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,849
Do you love Seo Min Gi?

275
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,490
- Incubator!
- Yes, we'll get one ready.

276
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:35,359
Ms. Maeng.

277
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,699
Ms. Maeng!

278
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,010
- What is going on?
- Oh, dear.

279
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,569
Gong Boo went inside too.

280
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:48,410
Has the baby come out or not?

281
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,979
Why won't they tell us?

282
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,250
It's not like the baby will come out
right away.

283
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:54,479
Come on, Gyeong Bok.

284
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:58,620
My goodness. Let's just wait.
Don't worry, okay?

285
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,719
But how many hours has it been?
We've been here all day.

286
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,790
Oh, boy.

287
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,790
- What?
- Oh, my.

288
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,160
- What is this?
- My gosh.

289
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,559
That's my grandchild, right?

290
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,469
Yes! It must be!

291
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,699
The baby is out!

292
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
- It's a baby girl!
- A baby girl!

293
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,870
No Ah, you have a sister now!

294
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,209
A baby girl!

295
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,410
- I'm so happy!
- My gosh!

296
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Oh, my.

297
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,609
My gosh, Ssook Ssook.

298
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Here's our Ssook Ssook.

299
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,690
Oh, my.

300
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,960
Ssook Ssook, it's you.

301
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:40,659
My baby.

302
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,899
You did so well.

303
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,399
I'm delighted to meet you.

304
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,639
Our baby is...

305
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,839
so beautiful.

306
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,079
Why are you crying?

307
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,280
I'll be so good to you, okay?

308
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,879
For the rest of my life,

309
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,649
I'll take great care of you,
Ssook Ssook,

310
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,349
and No Ah.

311
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,450
My Ssook Ssook...

312
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,419
You did so well.

313
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,089
Momo.

314
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
My gosh.

315
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,700
You woke up.

316
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:58,309
No, you shouldn't be
moving around now.

317
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,379
But what happened?

318
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,180
- Well...
- My baby is okay, right?

319
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,950
You were rushed
to our emergency room,

320
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,819
and we performed
an emergency delivery.

321
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,050
We delivered your baby.

322
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,050
My baby is okay, right?

323
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,159
You gave preterm birth,

324
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,329
so we're treating your baby
in our neonatal intensive care unit.

325
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:29,000
It's a common treatment step
for premature babies.

326
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,510
We're doing our very best,

327
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,710
so please don't worry too much.

328
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:49,490
It was my fault
that Momo was born too early.

329
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,159
Because of me...

330
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:53,159
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:55,129
Sorry.

332
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,919
Gong Hee likes
seaweed soup with clams.

333
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,589
I wonder what Hong Dan likes.

334
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,889
Just put in a lot of meat.

335
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,490
Meat broth is the best
for women who just gave birth.

336
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:30,059
Hold on. Hey, won't she get
seaweed soup at the hospital?

337
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,629
Hospital food tastes awful.

338
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,000
I should cook some
and take it to her.

339
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:36,800
Anyway,
Gong Hee is due next month too.

340
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,010
Hey, I wonder why Gong Hee
hasn't been visiting us lately.

341
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,010
She doesn't want to upset
her mother-in-law.

342
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,980
Her belly must be getting big now.

343
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,649
Oh, dear. These days, no one...

344
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,450
mistreats their daughter-in-law
except for Ssang Sook.

345
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,819
Just wait until Gong Hee
gives birth to her baby.

346
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,589
What will you do
after she gives birth?

347
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,930
What do you think?
I'll barge into Ssang Sook's house,

348
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,500
- and I will just...
- What will you do?

349
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,659
Will you beg on your knees?

350
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,599
"Please look kindly
upon my daughter."

351
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,440
Will you bow to her like this?

352
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,740
Goodness.
That will surely intimidate her.

353
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:20,849
My goodness.
The sun is high up in the sky.

354
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,649
How come she's so quiet?

355
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,430
Where did she go
so early in the morning?

356
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,730
She said
she was taking some time off work.

357
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,599
(Kang Myung Ja's daughter)

358
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,839
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

359
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,710
Please leave a message
after the tone.

360
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,109
That's strange.

361
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,089
She's not at home?

362
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,589
She never told me
where she was going.

363
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,119
She can't be at work now, right?

364
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,389
She's taking time off,
so I'm sure she's not there.

365
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,859
She probably went
to see her parents.

366
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,430
Oh, whatever.
I'm sure she'll be back.

367
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,430
You must be busy.
Don't worry. Just get back to work.

368
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:16,869
All right.

369
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,250
Was that Mother?

370
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:26,849
Yes.

371
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,079
She says Gong Hee isn't at home.

372
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:30,919
Where did she go?

373
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:41,730
We said we'd forget about work
and have fun today for a change.

374
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,760
It's our first trip together
in so long.

375
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:47,700
Please focus on the two of us.

376
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,599
Okay.

377
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,319
Well, seaweed soup was included
in my meal here,

378
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,119
but it tasted so awful
that I couldn't eat it.

379
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,460
Mother,
your seaweed soup is the best.

380
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,230
- Mom, you really are the best.
- Grandma is the best.

381
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,059
I was so worried
because she couldn't eat anything.

382
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:19,030
Goodness, I'm telling you.
She's so fussy.

383
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,069
No one screamed louder than her
when giving birth.

384
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,669
It's so impressive that
she had a natural birth at her age.

385
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,579
How should I put this?
She's a true champion.

386
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,180
I really felt like
I was on the verge of dying.

387
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,980
Did you think
it'd be easy to become a mom?

388
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,720
My gosh. You're right.

389
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,819
Now, I have huge respect
for all mothers.

390
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,059
Yes, you did very well.

391
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,899
Father.

392
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,869
It was so hard.

393
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,839
Mom, you've given birth,
but you're acting like a baby now.

394
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,569
No Ah is right.

395
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,270
- What?
- The baby princess is here.

396
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,609
- Oh, my!
- My gosh.

397
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,940
My goodness.

398
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,050
- Be careful.
- I want to see her too.

399
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,409
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

400
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:07,409
- Careful.
- My goodness.

401
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,149
- Oh, careful.
- My gosh.

402
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,149
Oh, my.

403
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Here, No Ah.

404
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,020
My gosh.

405
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,859
- Oh, my.
- How adorable.

406
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,730
Ssook Ssook.

407
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,859
Hi.

408
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,040
My gosh.

409
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,500
- Here, eat up.
- My gosh.

410
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,940
Yes, you need to eat well...

411
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,839
to breastfeed your baby.
Hurry up and eat.

412
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,609
- Oh, my.
- Honey, what else are you craving?

413
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,609
I want a beer.

414
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:38,849
Come on, you silly girl.

415
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,819
Look at the sharp nose.
Just like Daddy's nose.

416
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:44,619
- How adorable.
- I know, right?

417
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,990
All right. Eat as much as you want.

418
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:48,859
My gosh, yes.

419
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,190
Oh, my.

420
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,200
I'm back!

421
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Welcome back.

422
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,839
Welcome, my son.

423
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,919
My, this is nice.

424
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,119
"I'm back." "Welcome back."

425
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,319
Having a place to come back to...

426
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,220
and having someone
waiting to greet me.

427
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:26,859
How have you been?

428
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,030
What? We talked on the phone
so often.

429
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,430
Why are you asking me that?

430
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,829
As promised,

431
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:35,639
I came back after taking care of
all the issues at the France office!

432
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,899
My gosh, how impressive.

433
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:40,809
Hey, I really missed you, Dan Soo.

434
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:41,909
I missed you too, Mom.

435
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,309
You must've had a hard time there.

436
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,450
Goodness, you've been through a lot.

437
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,849
You were so far away from home.

438
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,750
It was no big deal.

439
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,460
Your son is
a world-renowned designer.

440
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,020
You didn't think
I could handle that much?

441
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,030
You were away for a while.

442
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,530
Is there anything you want to eat...

443
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,599
or any place you want to go?

444
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,899
Well...

445
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,730
Is Maeng Ggong doing well?

446
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,369
Oh, Gong Hee?

447
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,639
I didn't tell her on purpose.

448
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:15,280
I wanted to just show up
and surprise her.

449
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,139
I see.

450
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:21,510
I haven't heard anything
about Gong Hee either.

451
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,050
I hear she hasn't really been coming
to visit her parents.

452
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,119
I haven't seen her in a while.

453
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,359
She's getting close to her due date.

454
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:33,290
Myung Ja seems really worried too.

455
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,599
It's okay.

456
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,770
All will be fine
because I'm back now.

457
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,909
Oh, my. How adorable.

458
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,480
- My gosh.
- It's Gong Hee.

459
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Hey, Gong Hee.

460
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,550
Goodness, I couldn't call you
because things were so hectic.

461
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,819
Hong Dan just had her baby.

462
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,619
It's a girl.
She looks just like your brother.

463
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,530
What?

466
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,379
Momo.

467
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,550
Mommy is here.

468
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,260
You're not ready
to come out into the world yet.

469
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,260
I should have...

470
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,970
kept you safe for longer.

471
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,540
I'm so sorry.

472
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,079
Be strong...

473
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,550
and hang in there.

474
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:01,750
Okay?

(My Merry Marriage)

476
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:14,589
- Mom.
- Gong Hee...

477
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,159
I was scared.

478
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,030
I was so scared
that I might lose Momo, Mom.

479
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,569
I'll think that you've accepted Mom
as your family now.

480
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,069
Then tell her
to come and live with me.

481
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,210
What?

482
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,980
Gong Hee, I'm sorry I came so late.
What about the baby?

483
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,480
You must be busy. You should leave.

484
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,809
And...

485
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,710
never come to see me again.
