1
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,269
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,320
The person who abandoned me
in the rain.

3
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,159
It's you.

4
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,170
How...

5
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:51,970
Since when...
How long have you known?

6
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,670
Don't expect me to explain.

7
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,509
When you abandoned me,

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,350
did you at least give me a reason?

9
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:03,679
Dan Soo. No.

10
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,279
Geon.

11
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:08,149
That's a misunderstanding.

12
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,259
- Mom was...
- "Mom?" How dare you?

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,529
Geon.

14
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:15,829
Geon.

15
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,829
Don't call me by that name
ever again.

16
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:21,829
"Mom?"

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,399
Don't even dare...

18
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,039
to speak that word out loud.

19
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,640
Yes, I know it'd be difficult
for you to understand me.

20
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:36,050
I don't know what you heard,
but I...

21
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,850
And quit using me...

22
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,919
to threaten Grandma.

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,319
Grandma is...

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,259
my only family now.

25
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:48,530
Ever since you left me and Dad,

26
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,860
I've never once considered you...

27
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:56,830
my family.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,020
Geon!

29
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,449
(Maeng Dumplings,
Tiffany Alterations)

30
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,449
Geon.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,089
I'll explain everything.

32
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,759
Okay?

33
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,630
What kind of person
your grandma is...

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,470
and why I had no choice
but to leave. All of it.

35
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,870
You know...

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,880
it's already too late.

37
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,650
Geon.

38
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,280
Geon.

39
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:51,989
Geon.

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Geon...

41
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,259
Geon.

42
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:20,150
You ruined everything.

43
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,150
So why...

44
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,930
Why look at me with such sad eyes?

45
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,829
Just why?

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,210
Here.

47
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,380
Mom made this
while thinking of you, Geon.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,319
Keep this with you.

49
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,519
It means
I'm always by your side, Geon.

50
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:25,919
You know...

51
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,889
I have a checkup appointment
at the OB-GYN clinic.

52
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:29,949
Do you want to come with me?

53
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
Yes. Of course, I should tag along.

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,259
One moment.
Let me just send this email.

55
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:35,729
Sure.

56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,960
Great news.

57
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,369
Heirmez wants to meet today.

58
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,640
Today?

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,539
I told you there was someone I knew
at Heirmez through my dad.

60
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:52,939
What?

61
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,650
Were you two
about to leave together?

62
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
Well...

63
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,049
Gong Hee, you must know that
this is such an amazing opportunity.

64
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,220
You don't want him...

65
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,119
to lose this opportunity
because of you, right?

66
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,460
Hey, I'm sorry.

67
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,830
It's fine. I'll be going, then.

68
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,700
Everything about this project
is going so smoothly.

69
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:20,939
Is it because
we have such great teamwork?

70
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:29,950
(On my Geon's 23rd birthday)

71
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,689
(On my son Geon's birthday)

72
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,260
Every year, I waited...

73
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,400
for your birthday.

74
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,669
I felt like it was the only day...

75
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:57,809
when I could be forgiven
even if I thought of you.

76
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,080
Living my cursed life,

77
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,689
I ran away fearing that
the curse would go to you.

78
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,890
But the very first day
I met you again,

79
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,030
I wanted to see you again,

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,999
Geon.

81
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,070
(Put in beef to add more flavor
to your soybean paste stew.)

82
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,910
It's done.

83
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,950
I think it tastes pretty good.

84
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,020
She said
she was on a low-sodium diet.

85
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,320
So, she'd prefer this bland
rather than salty.

86
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,689
All right. Gosh, it's hot.

87
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,429
Oh, boy. What?

88
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,760
My gosh. It's hot.

89
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:54,499
Oh, my.

90
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Hey!

91
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:58,570
What are you doing now?

92
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,470
Hurry up and get it off the book!

93
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,910
Pardon? Why?

94
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,239
Hurry. Get the pot off the book.

95
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,239
Okay.

96
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:08,710
My goodness.

97
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,320
Hey, did you think I put this here
for you to use it as a trivet?

98
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:14,820
Darn it.

99
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:15,919
Oh, no.

100
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,660
Goodness.

101
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,590
Well, since you had left it
on the table...

102
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,429
I'm sorry, Mother.

103
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,030
Hey, does your family use
poetry books as trivets?

104
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,200
Goodness. No wonder
you're Kang Myung Ja's daughter.

105
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:30,669
Seriously.

106
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,799
I can just buy you
a new poetry book.

107
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,609
How would that be
the same as this one?

108
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,580
This copy was signed
by my teacher in person.

109
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,979
Seriously, I don't like you.

110
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,200
Mother, have a seat.

111
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,429
I made some soybean paste stew.

112
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,830
Please try some.

113
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:06,239
My goodness.

114
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,780
Sorry for making you go
to the clinic alone.

115
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,320
Is the baby growing well?

116
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,520
Oh, yes.

117
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,220
I guess
Father is coming home late again.

118
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,359
Is he still not back
from the chairwoman's home?

119
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,030
No. You know how it is.

120
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,260
He doesn't have a set schedule.

121
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,460
I see.

122
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,169
He leaves
so early in the morning too.

123
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,499
It must be hard for him to work
at the chairwoman's house too.

124
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,070
Are you trying to get me riled up?

125
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,109
It makes me uncomfortable
to hear that.

126
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,650
Do you think your father-in-law...

127
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,410
is freeloading off the chairwoman?

128
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,820
No, I didn't mean that.

129
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,489
I was just saying
he must have a lot on his plate.

130
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,519
Come on.

131
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,290
We even used to live
at the chairwoman's house.

132
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:02,759
What? At the chairwoman's house?

133
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,359
When I was little.

134
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,399
There was a room
in the semi-basement of their house.

135
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,700
Min Gi, why would you bring it up?

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,700
You. Don't you dare
go to your mom...

137
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,040
and tattle about this stuff.

138
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,509
Of course not. Why would I?

139
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,210
Goodness.
I seriously don't like you.

140
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,060
I must've made another mistake.

141
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,430
Don't worry. She's acting like that
for no reason.

142
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,659
Mom had high expectations
for my marriage.

143
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,100
I don't live up to her expectations.

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,769
No, what I meant was...

145
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,139
It's not that you're lacking
in any way.

146
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,979
My mom was just overly greedy.

147
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm her only hope, you see.

148
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:55,649
Right.

149
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,420
I should do better.

150
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,489
Let's eat.

151
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,659
My, the stew is great.

152
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,700
(Missed Call, Gu Dan Soo)

153
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,769
Is something the matter?

154
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,389
Gu Dan Soo, is something going on?

155
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:38,389
Today...

156
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:39,859
Who is it?

157
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,869
It's getting late. Who is it?

158
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,269
Oh, it's Dan Soo.

159
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:59,139
What? The call got cut off.

160
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,080
Is something really wrong?

161
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,180
Please excuse me.
Let me make a call.

162
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,450
Okay.

163
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:16,330
Ms. Audrey, can you talk right now?

164
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,430
Yes.

165
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:21,029
Why do you sound like that?

166
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,369
Is it perhaps about Dan Soo?

167
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,739
Dan Soo...

168
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:28,840
knows everything now.

169
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,210
That I'm his mom
and everything else.

170
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,350
Ms. Audrey, are you okay?

171
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,619
I shouldn't be okay.

172
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,989
I broke my child's heart.

173
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,290
Right now,

174
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,830
my heart aches more,
thinking about how hard...

175
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,729
this must be on Dan Soo.

176
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,570
He was hurt because of me,

177
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,399
and I might've just picked
at his wounds again.

178
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,639
Maybe I should've left
in the first place.

179
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,139
Before Dan Soo found out.

180
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,479
I let my greed...

181
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,119
hurt Dan Soo...

182
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,220
once again.

183
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,930
Dan Soo must need time
to accept things.

184
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,229
You met each other again
after so much struggle.

185
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,300
You waited for the day
you could meet Dan Soo again.

186
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,409
Gu Dan Soo.

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,779
It must be so painful...

188
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
all by himself.

189
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,869
(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic,
Director Maeng Gong Boo)

190
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:02,999
We're closed for...

191
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,540
(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

192
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,259
What brings you here again?

193
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,629
Why are you ignoring my calls?

194
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,830
I wanted to talk about No Ah.

195
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,960
Why would I talk to you about No Ah?

196
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,499
When you went to the US
after leaving No Ah outside my door,

197
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,070
I made myself very clear.

198
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,170
I warned you never to come
looking for him again.

199
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,670
Why did you ignore that warning?

200
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:45,180
Maeng Gong Boo, you've changed
since you remarried.

201
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,850
You didn't use to be
such a responsible man before.

202
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,879
Look at you
still working at this late hour.

203
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,019
Are you really
the Maeng Gong Boo I knew?

204
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,619
Enough of your nonsense. Get out.

205
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,159
Aren't you leaving?

206
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:02,529
Then do whatever you want.

207
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,070
Do you want to have a quick drink?

208
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,600
Hey, I'm a married man.

209
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,999
I'd be crazy to drink with you.

210
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,170
Why?

211
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,580
You used to go out drinking
as a married man.

212
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,409
After marrying me,

213
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,450
you kept drinking with people...

214
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,779
until you even cheated on me.

215
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,580
I told you. That was a mistake.

216
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,790
It doesn't matter.

217
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:30,590
All I want is No Ah.

218
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,830
Hey, you're only back for a bit.

219
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,259
Don't confuse the kid, all right?

220
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,460
For a bit? No.

221
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,029
I came back to take care of No Ah.

222
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,830
What? Take care of No Ah?

223
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,200
That's right. I got a job.

224
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
What?

225
00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:49,940
What on earth are you talking about?

226
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,180
Have you no shame?

227
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,450
"Shame?"
That's rich coming from you.

228
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,580
If that's a joke,
it's not even funny.

229
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,820
I at least feel guilty
when I think of No Ah.

230
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,290
I am ashamed of the fact that
I didn't even know No Ah existed.

231
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,290
But what about you?

232
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,759
Me? What about me?

233
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,460
Look at yourself now. You won't say
you'll take No Ah back.

234
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,300
What? You got a job?

235
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,670
And you want to see No Ah often?

236
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,840
Then why not just take him back?

237
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,700
Why show up here at this hour
and keep beating around the bush?

238
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,769
No.

239
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,540
- I just...
- You're afraid...

240
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,909
you might have to give up
on your dream because of No Ah.

241
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,820
So, you want to leave him with me
while you play a mom.

242
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,389
Your selfish greed
will only confuse No Ah,

243
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:39,619
and I won't let it happen.

244
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,440
I heard you ate out with your dad.

245
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,810
What did you have?
Something delicious?

246
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,310
I can't tell you
because it's a secret.

247
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,479
A secret? What's a secret?

248
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,649
It's a secret
that only Dad and I know.

249
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,590
You guys had dinner together.
Why should it be a secret?

250
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,960
Hold on. I think you have a fever.

251
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:19,560
Do you have a headache?

252
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,600
No, I don't.

253
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:24,899
Well...

254
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,700
I think you have a fever.

255
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,310
Instead of making a stew
every morning,

256
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,680
why don't we have bread
from time to time?

257
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,420
What's it called? Yes, brunch.
Something like that, you know?

258
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:42,820
American style.

259
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,359
American style, my foot.

260
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,960
Why don't you move to the US, then?

261
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,989
I like having soups and stews
in the morning.

262
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:53,859
But you could go easy on the salt.

263
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,899
Everything has so much flavor.

264
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,840
Well, I think it's a bit too salty.

265
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,340
Then how about you wake up early...

266
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,210
and help me
season everything I make?

267
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,779
Mom, don't say that.
That sounds very scary.

268
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,550
I lost weight when I didn't want to
because of her cooking.

269
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,879
I lost 3kg.

270
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:15,550
The foods she makes aren't edible.

271
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Mother.

272
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,159
I just tasted it again,

273
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,060
and it actually tastes perfect.
Just the right amount of salt.

274
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,800
Yes. Health is important and all,

275
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,000
but food has to taste good.

276
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,770
Side dishes should be
a little salty and sweet.

277
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,439
You know, I think
No Ah had a mild fever last night...

278
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,280
Oh, no. No Ah is running late
for daycare.

279
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,709
We'll be late for work too.

280
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,750
- My gosh!
- Mom, take No Ah to daycare.

281
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Please.

282
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,119
- Thank you!
- See you later!

283
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,990
Oh, boy.

284
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,760
I knew this would happen.

285
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Look at this.

286
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,629
I'm like their servant, aren't I?

287
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:07,469
I guess. They sure boss you around.

288
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,270
They won't even put away
their dirty dishes.

289
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,980
They never do the dishes.

290
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,609
They never clean...

291
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,080
or do their own laundry.

292
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,649
Oh, boy.

293
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
My gosh.

294
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:22,389
Dear me.

295
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:26,219
Goodness.

296
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,990
Oh, dear.

297
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,030
Look at this mess. My goodness.

298
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,840
Oh, gosh.

299
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:43,010
Grandma.

300
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,909
Yes, sweetheart.

301
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,109
No Ah, are you hungry?

302
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:55,090
My gosh.
I think you still have a fever.

303
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,790
Let's see.

304
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,560
Hey. Oh, my.
Try these sweet potatoes.

305
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,030
They're steamed to perfection.
Oh, boy.

306
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:13,899
Hold on. What's that?

307
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,310
I'll be wearing this in my coffin.

308
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,879
- My goodness.
- I prepared these myself.

309
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,020
Why would you prepare
your burial clothes already?

310
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:28,949
I'm waiting to die anyway.

311
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,419
Instead of doing nothing
as I waited to die,

312
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:34,889
- I figured I should do something.
- Goodness.

313
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:36,929
I can't just dump such baggage...

314
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,159
on my children and die.

315
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,230
So, you got mourning clothes
for your children too?

316
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,340
For one last time,

317
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,070
I wanted to buy clothes
for all of my children.

318
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,909
Oh, dear.

319
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,310
As if your children and grandkids
would thank you for this. Seriously.

320
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,679
Why are you acting like
you're dying or something?

321
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:01,990
This breaks my heart.

322
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,090
Why would it break your heart?

323
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:07,560
If I know I'm dying soon,

324
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,730
I can be well prepared for it.

325
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:16,030
I wish the Grim Reaper would show up
in my dream and tell me.

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,669
Whether it's tomorrow
or the day after tomorrow,

327
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:22,540
I'd happily hold
the Grim Reaper's hand...

328
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,240
and follow him as I sing.

329
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,480
My goodness.

330
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,580
Do you belong
to the Grim Reaper's fan club?

331
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,679
Come on.

332
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,080
Is that why you can't wait
to greet the Grim Reaper?

333
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,219
My goodness.

334
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,419
Oh, dear.

335
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,459
But then again, you never know
when the Grim Reaper would show up.

336
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,260
Well, I should get ready too.

337
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,629
You still have a lot of time.

338
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:50,800
You're still full of energy.
You still have a lot of time.

339
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,070
Come on. What are you talking about?

340
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,040
My children are already looking
for a care home for me.

341
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,109
Oh, boy.

342
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:02,179
Sun Yi.

343
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,250
Of course, I know I'll die soon too,

344
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,850
but it makes me feel uneasy
for no reason.

345
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,419
A care home?

346
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,159
I think it'd be helpful...

347
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,469
if we could identify
customer needs and target groups.

348
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,600
In other words,

349
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:32,209
between Mr. Gu
and Gong Hee's Holly Collection...

350
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,649
and Ms. Kang and Mr. Seo's
collaboration with Heirmez,

351
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,119
what would people want more?

352
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,379
Is there something we can use
to assess and identify...

353
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:43,350
customer needs and wants?

354
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,359
How about we do market research?

355
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,859
If we get a sense of the demand
as we look around luxury stores,

356
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,929
we could find the information
we're looking for.

357
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:53,929
Then...

358
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,199
let's get out there and do it.

359
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,270
Market research.

360
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:13,679
Could I have today's charts?

361
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,290
Come on.

362
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
What?

363
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,669
- Mom!
- Hey, No Ah.

364
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,109
Wait. Why are you...

365
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,919
His fever broke.

366
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,689
It should be fine
to send him to daycare.

367
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,119
I'll give you enough medication.

368
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,689
I asked you
what you were doing here.

369
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:57,030
Why won't you answer me?

370
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,100
- Will you please watch him?
- Yes, doctor.

371
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,209
No Ah, stay outside
with the nurse for a minute.

372
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:09,709
Okay.

373
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,580
What candy flavor do you like?

374
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,709
Strawberry.

375
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,419
I think No Ah is sick...

376
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,490
because of you.

377
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,659
I'm sorry, Mother.

378
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,459
When you got divorced,

379
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,790
I felt bad for you.

380
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:32,830
Because I raised my son wrong,

381
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,760
your marriage ended
in less than a month.

382
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,730
But still, how could you
have a kid in secret...

383
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,869
and raise him on your own?

384
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:41,709
Weren't you scared to do that?

385
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:45,480
And then,
without even discussing it with us,

386
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,010
you left after abandoning him.

387
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,280
There were
unavoidable circumstances.

388
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,449
Missing out on this chance
to study abroad...

389
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:53,419
meant that
I might never get another chance.

390
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,320
I figured I could move to the US
with No Ah later on.

391
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,820
Later on, when?

392
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,359
When he's out of daycare?

393
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:01,929
When he starts school?

394
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:05,800
Not everyone is a mom
just because they've given birth.

395
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,929
Do you know what you've done...

396
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,699
when he needed his mom the most?

397
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,669
You abandoned No Ah
for selfish reasons.

398
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,270
I can't acknowledge you
as No Ah's mom.

399
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,209
I'm regretting it too.

400
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,879
So, what will you do?

401
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,750
Why are you working
at a clinic in my neighborhood?

402
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,310
Don't worry.

403
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,379
I won't take No Ah right away.
I just...

404
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,389
I came back to see No Ah.

405
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:33,520
Does Gong Boo know?

406
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:35,659
That you're working here?

407
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Yes.

408
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,800
I met him and told him last night.

409
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,359
Last night?

410
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,869
Then, what about my daughter-in-law?

411
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:47,669
No, she doesn't know that I'm back.

412
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,139
Gosh, what a relief.

413
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,010
Before she finds out,

414
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,109
you should go back
to your own place.

415
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:57,609
Mother.

416
00:24:58,949 --> 00:25:01,149
You know
I was very fond of you, right?

417
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,949
You were always on my side.

418
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,260
- Can't you understand...
- No.

419
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,359
I don't understand you.

420
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,889
I'm not...

421
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,230
on my son's side
or my daughter-in-law's.

422
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm just...

423
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,800
on my grandson No Ah's side.

424
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,040
You shouldn't do this,
even if it's just for No Ah's sake.

425
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,240
Mother.

426
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,280
Please don't show yourself
in this neighborhood again.

427
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:29,709
I'm begging you.

(Han Internal Medicine Clinic)

429
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,060
What am I supposed to do?

430
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:53,169
Let's go.

431
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:03,379
Hey. Where are you, Dan Soo?

432
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,550
We're supposed to do
market research together.

433
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,419
I stepped out,
but I'm on my way back.

434
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,550
I'm right in front of the office.
I'll be right there.

435
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,790
Then I'll wait out front.

436
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:14,619
Bye.

437
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,169
You're here.

438
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,939
Why are you staring at me?

439
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:35,949
What are you doing?

440
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:37,580
It's because you're cute. Why?

441
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Buckle up.

442
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,050
Okay.

443
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,429
So cute.

444
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:50,129
Hey, stop it.

445
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,530
Hey, Maeng Gong...

446
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,230
Maeng Gong Hee!

- What?
- What accident?

452
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:39,939
- Dan Soo was by her side...
- What did you say?

453
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,169
What did you just say?

454
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:42,369
Dan Soo was with her?

455
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:43,969
They went to the hospital. Oh, my.

00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:46,909

- An accident...
