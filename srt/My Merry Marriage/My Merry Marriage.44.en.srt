1
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:32,729
Oh, no.

2
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,800
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing expensive.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,870
I'm sorry. I'll buy you another one.

4
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,210
Gosh, no. It's not expensive.

5
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:46,079
Anyway, get changed.
We should get going.

6
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,079
Okay.

7
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:48,649
I'm really sorry.

8
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,079
It's fine.

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,200
(Episode 44)

11
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,200
Where did he go?

12
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:12,809
Did I keep you waiting?

13
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,480
No.

14
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,279
I couldn't find a similar one.

15
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,279
Here, take this.

16
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,650
Mr. Seo, it's really fine.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Here.

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,100
This looks very expensive.

19
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,439
Do you not like it?

20
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,010
I do, of course.

21
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,840
It's a million times prettier.

22
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,549
I'm glad you like it.

23
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,450
Let me put it around your neck.

24
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:28,880
Is the computer
looking down on me now as well?

25
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,089
Fine, let's see who wins. You or me.

26
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,419
My report...

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,790
Why won't it work?

28
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,959
Oh, goodness.

29
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,429
You handed in your resignation
the other day.

30
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,630
Now, are you planning on
smashing the company?

31
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,369
If you don't want to work,
just say so.

32
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:45,600
Stop acting like a fool.

33
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,299
Gosh, can't you see
that I'm trying to work?

34
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,310
This thing is frozen
all of a sudden.

35
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,380
No! My report!

36
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:59,480
My goodness.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Do you know
how to do anything properly?

38
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,989
Why don't you please submit
another letter of resignation?

39
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,619
I thought you had written
over 100 of them.

40
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,119
Will you please stop talking
about the resignation letter?

41
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,589
I got it back.

42
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:11,889
With such a lousy assistant manager,

43
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,929
no wonder the employees
beneath you keep acting up.

44
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,329
Figures.

45
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,839
From a pure spring pure water flows.

46
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,369
My superior is...

47
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,510
so far from being pure...

48
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,810
that I'm still not good at my job.

49
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,980
Well, it's not like I have anything
to learn from you.

50
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,019
What did you say?

51
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,589
(Mom)

52
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,630
What?

53
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,530
Oh, my. What's up with her?

54
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,600
Did she just leave me standing here?
Why, that...

55
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:52,769
Why, that rude brat.

56
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,609
What was that picture just now?

57
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,470
Where are you right now?

58
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,380
That chauffeur's son is hilarious.

59
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,179
You dumped him,

60
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:05,910
so he's rushing to get married now.

61
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,549
Seo Min Gi.

62
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,419
Are you seriously going all the way
in the end?

63
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:16,359
Ji Na.

64
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,329
Ji Na, are you listening to me?

65
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,600
You know you have to go
to Chairwoman Hwang's today, right?

66
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,269
Today is
her son's death anniversary.

67
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,100
Hello?

68
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,839
Ji Na. Are you listening?

69
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,709
Oh, my back.

70
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,310
(Maeng Dumplings)

71
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,519
Hey, Gyeong Tae.
Where have you been?

72
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,089
The shop was so busy.

73
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,490
What? You won't even stop
when I'm talking to you.

74
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,019
Are you going home?

75
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,089
You need to watch the shop.

76
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,959
Where are you going now? Hey!

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,529
What are you doing?
Are you calling someone?

78
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,529
What's wrong with your husband?

79
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,469
He looks like
his soul has left his body.

80
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,170
Goodness.

81
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,420
You're sure
this is all of your debt, right?

82
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,089
Aren't you being too nitpicky?

83
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:23,389
How can I not be? This is reality.

84
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,060
Other than the loan I took out
to open my clinic,

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,260
I'm all clean.

86
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,459
Right, you are clean.

87
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,200
You have no assets whatsoever.

88
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,029
So pure and clean.

89
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,740
I have a lottery ticket
where I won five dollars.

90
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,469
Who knows what might happen
if I buy them each week?

91
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,979
You have such big dreams too.

92
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,039
The richest man is the one
with the biggest dreams.

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,180
Gosh, that mouth of yours.

94
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,920
So, what happened
with your letter of resignation?

95
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,579
What else could I do?

96
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,750
I got it back.

97
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,120
That's a wise decision.

98
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,789
If a talented woman like you
doesn't work,

99
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,360
it's a national loss.

100
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,000
And what about my bruised pride?

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,170
Just take your pride
and throw it out the window.

102
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,500
You don't need that.

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,570
Gosh, it must be nice
to be so carefree.

104
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,110
So, what will you do?

105
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,139
How will we get married
with no money?

106
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,440
Let's have a frugal wedding.

107
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,149
Don't you know what the trend is?
Small weddings.

108
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,180
Even if it's the smallest wedding,

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,219
we'd still need a venue.

110
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,050
We need to have
invitations made too.

111
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,159
You don't expect me
to pay for everything, do you?

112
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,700
You were so talkative
until just now.

113
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,800
Why have you shut your mouth
like a clam?

114
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:51,479
You! Goodness gracious!

115
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,789
You should wait patiently.

116
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,750
But he's not here.

117
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,719
He must be very upset.

118
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,159
He's not going to see me.

119
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,029
You're here.

120
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,070
I came for Dad's death anniversary.

121
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,370
I'm not here to see you,
my corrupt grandma.

122
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,469
Will you keep doing this?

123
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,740
Will you keep skipping work?

124
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,779
I told you. I'm not going to work
at that lousy company.

125
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,279
Then, pay me back
for your pay advance.

126
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,820
And give me your credit card too.

127
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,490
Come on. Are you really
going to be this mean?

128
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,130
How much would it be...

129
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,659
to pay for your credit card bills...

130
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,229
and the pay advance you asked for?

131
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,300
Mr. Seo, do the math.

132
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,370
I've already done so.

133
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,039
To tell you the details...

134
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,409
Come on, Grandma.
Why are you in such a rush?

135
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,170
Who said I wasn't going to work?

136
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,579
I'm just...

137
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,849
using my vacation days.

138
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,979
Everyone gets to use
some vacation days at work.

139
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,719
Then, you're going back to work
starting tomorrow.

140
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,050
I'll go to work.
But let's make one thing clear.

141
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
What?

142
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,889
Stop hiring temporary employees.

143
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,490
And stop torturing them
with the hopes of a promotion.

144
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,099
If you don't like my ways,
you should become the chairman.

145
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:16,630
You can fix the company.

146
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:21,240
The board members were evenly split.

147
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,200
I chose Ms. Kang
based on my standards.

148
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,909
And my standards were based
on profitability.

149
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,639
If you want to overturn that,
you should work your way up fast.

150
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,180
I was planning on doing that anyway.

151
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,579
By the way,
I saw you came by Dad's grave.

152
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,889
You should've asked me
to come with you.

153
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,990
His grave?

154
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,060
I didn't go.

155
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,260
What?
Then who were those flowers from?

156
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,260
Someone had left calla lilies.

157
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,630
Calla lilies?

158
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,499
Who left the flowers
that Hae Joon used to like?

159
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:56,900
Oh, the groundskeeper
at the cemetery must've left them.

160
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:01,339
He must've taken extra care
as it's his death anniversary.

161
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:02,509
Is that so?

162
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,280
Well, what a nice gesture.

163
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,719
I'm so grateful for Mr. Seo
in many ways.

164
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,060
I can't just keep receiving gifts.

165
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,469
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

166
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,869
Well, I don't know much
about men's watches.

167
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,969
Will you be giving someone a gift?

168
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:34,109
Yes, to someone I'm grateful for.

169
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,509
In that case...

170
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,979
How about this one?

171
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,320
It is one of our high-end products,

172
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,050
but many men in their 30s
like this design.

173
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,050
I see.

174
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,719
(Price: 3,000 dollars)

175
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,660
Oh, this is a bit too...

176
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,770
Could you recommend something
that's not too expensive?

177
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,070
Okay, just a moment.

178
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,540
Come in.

179
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:10,180
I thought you couldn't make it,
Ms. Kang.

180
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,209
Of course, I should be here.
I have someone to meet.

181
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,479
You came for my dear Dan Soo.

182
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,619
Of course, you should be here.

183
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,599
This is your future daughter-in-law.

184
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,229
Say hello.

185
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,300
Please look kindly upon me.

186
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:38,570
Hae Joon.

187
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,280
Please watch over them from above.

188
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,709
Both Dan Soo
and your daughter-in-law.

189
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,020
If she's going to treat us
like outsiders,

190
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,619
why did she make us come
and stand here?

191
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,820
Did she need an audience?

192
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,290
And why did Ji Na come here?

193
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,129
Is she in her right mind?

194
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,530
Min Gi is here too.

195
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:04,129
I thought it was funny
when people said...

196
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,930
their sons' lives were ruined
by the wrong daughters-in-law.

197
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,540
That was until I lost you like that.

198
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,009
That will never happen again.

199
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,979
I will keep Dan Soo safe...

200
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,349
until the end.

201
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,420
How...

202
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:30,589
How did you leave like that?

203
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:33,129
Please tell me.

204
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,099
Please visit me in my dreams.

205
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,400
Please come and tell me, Hae Joon.

206
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,550
Are you still lying here like this?

207
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,560
At least change
out of those clothes.

208
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,589
Aren't they uncomfortable?

209
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,030
In the morning, you said
you had something to tell me...

210
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,070
and that it wouldn't take long.

211
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,400
Just tell me now.
What was that about?

212
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,310
What was it?
You have something to tell me.

213
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,440
If there's something
you're hiding from me,

214
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,680
just tell me everything.

215
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,479
I have sinned.

216
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,890
I did something very bad.

217
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,259
What? What did you do?

218
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,030
I am a sinner.

219
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:43,459
Okay, but what did you do?

220
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,530
I deserve to die.

221
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,670
Have you changed your strategy...

222
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,869
from pleading the Fifth
to making a false confession?

223
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,440
What is with you, seriously?

224
00:12:58,509 --> 00:12:59,979
Gosh, you.

225
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,119
Do whatever you want!

226
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:05,589
My goodness.
I'm so upset, seriously!

227
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,229
Why, Hae Joon?

228
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,430
(In Loving Memory of Gu Hae Joon)

229
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,320
I have nothing more to wish for.

230
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,950
Dan Soo,
as soon as I see you get married...

231
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,219
Grandma.

232
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,890
That is enough. I'll just leave
if you go on about it.

233
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,160
This temper of his.

234
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:52,129
Ji Na, I trust that
you'll change him for the better.

235
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,079
Ma'am,
Min Gi is getting married too.

236
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,140
Oh, really?

237
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:07,209
Min Gi, I didn't know
you were seeing someone.

238
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,379
So, who is this lady?

239
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,249
Of course, I'm sure
you've chosen someone wonderful.

240
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
What's going on?

241
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,060
Are he and Gong Hee already talking
about getting married?

242
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,759
She has a heart of gold.

243
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
On top of that,
she's smart and wise.

244
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,030
She's perfect for him.

245
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:28,400
I promise
I'll introduce you to her soon.

246
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,070
Yes, you have to.

247
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,079
He'll go on a blind date soon
anyway.

248
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,310
If I choose a wise girl
with a heart of gold,

249
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,920
then it's not a lie.

250
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:01,599
Dear Mr. Seo
to whom I'm so grateful.

251
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,770
No, I need something better.

252
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,209
Dear Mr. Seo whom I admire...

253
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,609
That will sound like
I'm trying to be distant.

254
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,749
(My love)

255
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:21,420
I want to get married too.

256
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,060
As soon as possible.

257
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,709
Why did the necklace break
when we were talking about marriage?

258
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,339
Forget it. That happened
because it was a cheap necklace.

259
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,910
Whatever.

260
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,800
What are you doing?

261
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,430
You tell me. What are you doing?

262
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,499
Are you really going to marry
Maeng Gong Hee?

263
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,940
This is ridiculous.

264
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,670
I just...

265
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,469
had dinner...

266
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:14,469
with the guy you're going to marry.

267
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,979
Now, I understand
how miserable it must've been...

268
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,680
for you.

269
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
What?

270
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,290
I saw you standing
next to Maeng Gong Hee...

271
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:34,560
in a wedding dress.

272
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,900
My whole life,
I've never been afraid of anything.

273
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,930
But now...

274
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,339
I was always the one
standing next to you.

275
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,280
The thought that
it might not be the case anymore...

276
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,209
and the thought that
I might lose you forever...

277
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,579
terrify me.

278
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,119
Okay, so?

279
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,660
How far
are you willing to go with me?

280
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,599
Dan Soo.

281
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,770
Why don't you stay a little longer?

282
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,239
What for?

283
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,369
Grandma will just nag me
to move back home.

284
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,509
She'll be sad
if you leave like this.

285
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,410
You should just sleep here tonight.

286
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,749
I trust that you will take good care
of my grandma.

287
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:34,519
Dan Soo, by any chance...

288
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:38,630
When you visited
your father's grave,

289
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,130
did you see anything else
besides the flowers?

290
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:42,959
Did you perhaps see someone there?

291
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,469
No. Why?

292
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,340
It's nothing.

293
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,499
Get home safely, then.

294
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,170
Bye.

295
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,390
Tell me.

296
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,719
I asked you how far
you'd be willing to go with me.

297
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,330
Let's get married.

298
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,430
What?

299
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,299
Let's get married.

300
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,009
Do you realize...

301
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,410
what you just said?

302
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,239
I will...

303
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:32,779
marry you.

304
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,749
Think carefully about this.

305
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,989
If we get back together this time,

306
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,519
we have to take it
all the way to the end.

307
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
Yes.

308
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,559
You're a princess,
and I'm like a lowly peasant.

309
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,299
We belong to different worlds.

310
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:50,499
I know.

311
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,170
And...

312
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,069
you still want to marry me?

313
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Yes.

314
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:04,110
Kang Ji Na is surrendering
to Seo Min Gi.

315
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,009
The arrogant,

316
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,549
haughty Kang Ji Na...

317
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,390
says she is surrendering.

318
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,890
That's right, Seo Min Gi.
I surrender.

319
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,130
In the past, I was as cold as ice,

320
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
and you were always passionate.

321
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,539
You were the one who taught me...

322
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,370
what it's like
to be passionately in love.

323
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,450
I can't be with anyone else...

324
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,350
because I've already given you
my everything.

325
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,120
I've already given you my heart,

326
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,249
so I have no place left
for anyone else in my heart.

327
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,130
I feel the same way.
I can't live without you either.

328
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:02,370
I love you.

329
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,670
I love you too.

330
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,610
I hated you because I loved you.

331
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,610
Because it pained me so much.

332
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,979
I relied on that resentment
to hold out.

333
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,049
Let's go to my place.

334
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
Okay.

335
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:51,989
Let's go.

336
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,569
What did I...

337
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
just see?

338
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,850
Gong Boo!

339
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,479
What?

340
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,319
Ssook Ssook is hungry.

341
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,360
Ssook Ssook,
what do you feel like eating?

342
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,390
Oh, you're still thinking.

343
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,390
Ssook Ssook is thinking.

344
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,930
Yes, Ssook Ssook.

345
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,900
I see. That's what you want?

346
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,840
Okay, got it.

347
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:48,640
Ssook Ssook wants chicken feet.

348
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,880
With extra Cheongyang chili powder.

349
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,009
How does a fetus know...

350
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,910
what chicken feet taste like?
And at this hour?

351
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,819
Right now.
Our Ssook Ssook wants it now.

352
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:59,719
Okay, let me go and get it now.

353
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,160
Wait. You know the place
by the intersection, right?

354
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,059
They use Cheongyang chili powder.

355
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,830
- Yes.
- That's what Ssook Ssook wants.

356
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,999
It has to be 100 percent
Korean Cheongyang chili powder.

357
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,259
My goodness.

358
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,370
Ssook Ssook said that? Okay.

359
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,870
- I'll be back.
- Okay, be back soon.

360
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,209
Just you wait, Quack.

361
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,479
You're a divorced man
with nothing to his name?

362
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,979
I only have one dream left now.

363
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,590
I will...

364
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,459
make you my servant.

365
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,930
I scoured all the markets nearby
to buy this.

366
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,430
I ran so fast in case it got cold.

367
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,799
Look at all this sweat, sweetie.

368
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,110
Is it good?

369
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,440
Yes, Ssook Ssook says
it's really tasty.

370
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,380
Ssook Ssook wants me
to tell you thanks.

371
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,719
It's not Ssook Ssook
but you who finds it tasty.

372
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,120
I enjoyed that.

373
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,330
Do you want some water?

374
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,630
Oh, wait.

375
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,100
Yes, Ssook Ssook.

376
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,769
I see.

377
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,769
Okay, got it.

378
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,340
Why? What is it now?

379
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,509
Well, Ssook Ssook wants
some dessert.

380
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,840
We have plenty of desserts at home.

381
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,650
- We have yogurt and tangerines...
- No!

382
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,249
Not stuff like that.

383
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:39,850
Ssook Ssook wants
sweet potato cheesecake.

384
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,450
You know, the sweet and salty kind?

385
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,959
Ssook Ssook,
can't Daddy buy it for you tomorrow?

386
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,229
That can...

387
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:48,229
never happen.

388
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,069
- What did you say?
- Darn it.

389
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,440
What?

390
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
You can have this.

391
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,459
I have brought home...

392
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:19,690
a hippo that eats nonstop!

393
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,200
Be quiet.

394
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:27,969
Okay.

395
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,069
Sorry.

396
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,610
You're here.

397
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,479
I thought you were going to be late.

398
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,190
What were you doing?

399
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,519
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

400
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:55,259
Is there something I could write
in a letter that isn't overbearing?

401
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,299
I want to give Mr. Seo a gift.

402
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Do you...

403
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,799
like Min Gi a lot?

404
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
What?

405
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,610
Are you serious about him?

406
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,479
Well...

407
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,430
Oh, dear.

408
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,830
Gyeong Tae.

409
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Gyeong Tae.

410
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,100
Stop right there!

411
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,009
- He was your next-door neighbor.
- No...

412
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,410
Stab me if you can.

413
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,920
I killed someone.

414
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
No.

415
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,489
No!

416
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,259
Don't die!

417
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,729
Don't die!

418
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,330
Don't die!

419
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,200
What's wrong?
Did you have a nightmare?

420
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,670
Look at all this sweat.

421
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:17,539
What's wrong?

422
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:20,749
You seem so out of it.

423
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,920
Did something really happen?

424
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,059
I'll go and get some water.

425
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:14,529
Detective Maeng.

426
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:15,999
What's going on?

427
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,910
I...

428
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,709
killed someone.

429
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,719
I...

430
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,979
I had always hoped...

431
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,519
to open up my husband's heart
and look inside.

432
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,019
But I was suddenly afraid.

433
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,759
I don't know what it is,

434
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,660
but fine. Bury it and go on living.

435
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,459
Don't take out that fire
from within,

436
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,769
ever.

437
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,410
(My Merry Marriage)

438
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,509
The two of you living together.

439
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:34,580
I won't tell anyone.

440
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,979
Gong Hee,
I feel bad about something.

441
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:39,850
Gong Hee, can we meet after work?

442
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,190
I guess
you're going to tell her today.

443
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,489
Hey, Seo Min Gi.

444
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,989
I'm going to sort it all out
with Gong Hee.

445
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,130
Sort what out?

446
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,529
Break up with her this instant.

447
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:49,959
What's wrong? You seem so out of it.

448
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,330
None of it matters anymore.

449
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,069
