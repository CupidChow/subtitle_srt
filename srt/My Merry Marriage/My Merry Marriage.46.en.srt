00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,120
(Episode 46)

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,960
It has taken such a long time...

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
for me to keep my promise.

4
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,220
You can't come back here.

5
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,389
Open the door.

6
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,590
If I don't see the chairwoman today,

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,459
I don't know what I might do.

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,859
Don't you remember what I told you?

9
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,230
Go back!

10
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,329
Open the door.

11
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,429
Why are you just standing there?

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,969
She must've stopped by before.

13
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,410
Why didn't you report it to me?

14
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,609
I apologize, ma'am.

15
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,579
You're not in the best health,

16
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,179
so I didn't want to worry you.

17
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,090
You're here.

18
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,890
No matter how much I think about it,

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,789
I was so angry and upset.
That's why I came.

20
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,100
What made you so angry and upset?

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,199
You said that
if I didn't show up before Hae Joon,

22
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,899
everyone would be safe.

23
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:42,270
If you were so confident,

24
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,809
you should've protected Hae Joon.

25
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,880
You sound like you came here...

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,149
knowing what happened to Hae Joon.

27
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,850
Yes.

28
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,350
I found out.

29
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,520
Like an utter fool,

30
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,190
I only just found out.

31
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,990
How could you do that?

32
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,899
I didn't even know
that he was dead until now.

33
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,729
Does this make any sense?

34
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,130
I was still Hae Joon's wife,
you know.

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,509
You should've at least told me
when you held his funeral.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,839
Please lower your voice.

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,509
You're in front of the chairwoman.

38
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:25,709
How could I...

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,680
I didn't even know that
Hae Joon was gone from this world.

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,250
I didn't even know that, and I...

41
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,789
You don't even know
that I was being considerate...

42
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,759
to let you live without knowing.

43
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,660
How dare you come here
and shout to my face?

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,660
You fool.

45
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,669
Yes.

46
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,239
I was foolish.

47
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,810
I thought
I was doing the best thing...

48
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,039
by living in hiding...

49
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,810
for Hae Joon's sake.

50
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,579
But what is this?

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,579
How am I supposed to live now?

52
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,280
How?

53
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,889
Explain to me.

54
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,960
You have to explain
everything to me now.

55
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:19,130
Do you want to hear...

56
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:21,269
why Hae Joon died?

57
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,739
He died on his way to find you.

58
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,509
What do you mean...

59
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,810
He died on his way
to go and find you!

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Because of you.

61
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,280
Because of a mere girl like you.

62
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,019
He was so enamored
by a mere girl like you...

63
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,750
that he lived in hiding
in the middle of nowhere.

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,489
And when he went out to find you,
he got into an accident!

65
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,560
Because of you!

66
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,190
But...

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,630
I... But...

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,930
If you lived in hiding for 20 years,

69
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,500
you should stay in hiding.

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Or you should just die
in a place no one knows about...

71
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,340
and not even let me hear about you.

72
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,310
How dare you step foot
in this house?

73
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,009
How dare you call yourself
Hae Joon's wife?

74
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,109
Hae Joon died because of you!

75
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,919
You killed my son!

76
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,150
No...

77
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,460
Are you happy to hear that now?

78
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,389
Are you happy
that you've opened up the wounds...

79
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,400
in the heart of a mother
who has lost her son?

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,829
You should've died instead.

81
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,699
You're still alive like this.

82
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,840
Why should my Hae Joon die?

83
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,210
Why?

84
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,039
Goodness, ma'am!

85
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,390
I ruined everything.

86
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:54,859
I...

87
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:57,700
I ruined everything.

88
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,609
I ruined everything, Hae Joon.

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,749
I should've died instead.

90
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,689
I should've died.

91
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,299
I should've died.

92
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,049
No!

93
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,629
My goodness.

94
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,299
Oh, my. Audrey, are you okay?

95
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:02,900
Gosh, Audrey.

96
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,669
You can't do this.

97
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,799
Let go. Let me go!

98
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:11,840
Oh, dear.
Audrey, why are you doing this?

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,669
You can't do this!

100
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,510
Let me go! I should die.

101
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,809
I should die.

102
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:21,320
Oh, goodness.

103
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,479
Audrey! Wake up!

104
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,689
Audrey! Wake...

105
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:28,390
Is anyone there?

106
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,859
Please help!

107
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,390
Oh, dear. Audrey.

108
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,660
Please wake up! Goodness.

109
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,559
Is anyone there?

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,499
Help!

111
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,600
(Wife)

112
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,340
Where has he gone?
He's not even answering his phone.

113
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,970
He's not feeling well either.

114
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,169
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

115
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,679
Oh, whatever.

116
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:52,450
Has he ever told me
where he was going?

117
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,669
(Bubble Up Laundry)

118
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,979
Hey, are you just coming home now?

119
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,119
Yes.

120
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,020
Did you meet someone?

121
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,160
Oh, I had a date.

122
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,729
Where did you go?

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,229
Your hands are all frozen.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Well...

125
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,530
We took a walk.

126
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
We were waiting in line
for a popular restaurant...

127
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,299
and walking together.

128
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,470
Let's go inside.

129
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,350
Nothing happened between me
and Gu Dan Soo...

130
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,989
other than talk about
the arranged marriage.

131
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,859
Do you think I would've
felt anything for that immature kid?

132
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,090
Are you sure you haven't given up
on that marriage yet?

133
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,100
Seo Min Gi.
Do you still not know Kang Ji Na?

134
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,470
Don't you trust me?

135
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,540
I will...

136
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,310
leave everything behind
and go to you.

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
I can't...

138
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,820
live without you.

139
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,690
I only said those things
because we were with the chairwoman.

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,749
Please understand.

141
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,920
I'll tell them
when the time is right, okay?

142
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,889
Sort things out
before it's too late.

143
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,999
Okay.

144
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,570
Look at me.

145
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,950
Stop being so angry.

146
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,879
(Maeng Gong Hee)

147
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,590
Let's work.

148
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,229
(Designer Holly)

149
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
"You are not alone."

150
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:25,989
"You are not alone."

151
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,359
Hey.

152
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,529
I'm going to make some ramyeon.

153
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,529
Do you want some too?

154
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Ramyeon?

155
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:37,269
I told you. I already ate.

156
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,739
And at a popular restaurant
with a long line.

157
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,180
Well, this is a late-night snack.

158
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,180
Eat while you work.

159
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,720
Okay, then. Sure.

160
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,190
No, stop!

161
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,720
Hey, are you crazy?

162
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,989
Who uses Holly's book...

163
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:00,729
as a trivet for a pot of ramyeon?

164
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,729
A book is just a book.

165
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,200
To me, this is like a book of laws
or sacred scriptures.

166
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:13,269
Do you think that will make
Holly work with you?

167
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,210
You never know.

168
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,180
Holly isn't someone
who goes after money.

169
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,050
Why do you think so?

170
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,180
Holly does
lots of charity campaigns.

171
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,090
Holly donates clothes for kids.

172
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,460
There is no place in the world
where Holly hasn't made a donation.

173
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:31,729
And for Holly, I think
the heart is more important...

174
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,859
than money.

175
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,399
Sharing. Consolation.
Stuff like that.

176
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,300
But I think Cambodia was left out
last time.

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,170
How do you know that?

178
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,940
Gosh, hey. Have some water.

179
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,509
Have some more.

180
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,609
My goodness.

181
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
I almost died.

182
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,460
I don't need any of this.
Get it away from me.

183
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,330
Where is that foolish thing?

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,229
Bring her to me right now.

185
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,399
Ma'am.

186
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,139
That fool...

187
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,239
You never know what she might do.

188
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,009
She won't just let this go.

189
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,149
It won't be enough
that she took my son away from me.

190
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,420
Now, she will try to do the same
with Dan Soo.

191
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:32,619
Ma'am.

192
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,320
- You must take care of yourself...
- You should've done better!

193
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,659
Why didn't you tell me
that she had come by?

194
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,960
I apologize for my mistake, ma'am.

195
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,300
Find out where she goes
and what she does...

196
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,840
and tell me every little detail.

197
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,940
Find out if she shows up
around Dan Soo or not.

198
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,779
I've already put in a request.

199
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,450
We'll find out
about her movements soon.

200
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:00,950
If, by chance,

201
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,279
Dan Soo finds out,

202
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,350
you will also...

203
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,960
have to be prepared.

204
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,129
I will keep that in mind, ma'am.

205
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,359
She is...

206
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,999
a nasty burden throughout my life.

207
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,409
Someone I want to get rid of.

208
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,350
Is she usually anemic?

209
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,989
Well, yes.

210
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,889
She passed out once before too.

211
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,119
Her blood levels are low,

212
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,190
so it could be dangerous
if she receives a big shock.

213
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,759
She needs
both physical and mental rest.

214
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,529
Right.

215
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,670
Let's keep her here overnight...

216
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,070
and run a few tests.

217
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
Thank you.

218
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,409
My goodness.

219
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Dan Soo...

220
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,820
Dan Soo, my son...

221
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,460
My Dan Soo...

222
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:17,619
Oh, dear.

223
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,529
She knew that Dan Soo was her son.

224
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,729
No, Hae Joon.

225
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,399
No...

226
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,399
Hae Joon!

227
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,670
Oh, my.

228
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,009
Do you feel alert now?

229
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,070
He never lets me know...

230
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,629
that he'll be home late.

231
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,470
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

232
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,470
My gosh.

233
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,379
I...

234
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,310
deserve to die.

235
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,220
I abandoned my son...

236
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,190
and didn't even know
that my husband had died.

237
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,220
I wandered around...

238
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,259
for 20 years.

239
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,229
Whether my husband and son...

240
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,499
were alive or dead,

241
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,970
I didn't even bother
to look for them...

242
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:37,970
or ask about them.

243
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,909
I thought that was
the only kind of love left for me.

244
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,080
I am a wench
who gobbled up my husband.

245
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,790
I...

246
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,159
killed my husband.

247
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,330
I ruined everything.

248
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,769
Why did you save a wench like me?

249
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,570
You should've just let me die.

250
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,749
Don't blame yourself.

251
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,979
You should find your strength
and go on living.

252
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,420
You still have...

253
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,359
Dan Soo.

254
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,560
You were calling Dan Soo's name
in your sleep.

255
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,499
When did you find out...

256
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,600
that he was your son?

257
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,139
It hasn't been long.

258
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,710
A mother...

259
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,409
didn't even recognize her own son
when he was close by.

260
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,850
I doubt there's a mother
worse than me in the world.

261
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,790
Stop talking so negatively.

262
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,119
I...

263
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,200
have something...

264
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,100
I must tell you.

265
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,369
What?

266
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,269
What is that?

267
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,070
Please tell me.

268
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,540
For now, you should...

269
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,709
regain your strength.

270
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,230
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

271
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,230
Transferring to voicemail...

272
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,969
Don't think about anything
and just sleep.

273
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,409
You will go right to sleep.

274
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,280
You can do it, Maeng Gong Hee.

275
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,659
I'm sorry I couldn't make it today.

276
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,159
I'll call you as soon as I'm done
with my meeting tomorrow.

277
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:20,770
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

278
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,469
- Transferring to voicemail...
- What on earth is this?

279
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:42,689
One, two!

280
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,530
Here we go.

281
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,600
- Get over it soon, Maeng Gong Hee.
- One, two!

282
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,939
My goodness. Seriously.

283
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,790
What is it? Do you want to spar?

284
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,730
If I spar with you now,

285
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,959
I might end up in a pile of dust.

286
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,060
You've always been...

287
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,699
an easy opponent for me.

288
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,169
Why don't you just cry instead?

289
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,340
Or ask me to drink with you.

290
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,800
Stop acting like you're okay.

291
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,840
What? I wasn't acting okay.

292
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,280
You broke up with Seo Min Gi,
didn't you?

293
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
We did?

294
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,320
Hey, why are you hiding it from me?

295
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,689
What are you saying?
We never broke up.

296
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,219
You didn't break up?

297
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,459
Did someone say we broke up?

298
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:53,560
That never happened.

299
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,230
Hang on.
Did you really not break up?

300
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,330
Then what was with your face
last night?

301
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,600
I was just tired. That's all.

302
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
"Tired?"

303
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,209
The whole time
you were walking home,

304
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,469
you were exuding
a dark energy from your entire body.

305
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:08,810
Is that how someone looks
after a date?

306
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,879
Well, that...

307
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,379
It just happened.

308
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,820
Did you perhaps...

309
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,119
get stood up?

310
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,520
Well...

311
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,990
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

312
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,689
I'm sure he had his reasons.

313
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,429
Just butt out of my business.

314
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,199
How could I butt out?
You're making it impossible!

315
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:38,770
My gosh.

316
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:40,709
Darn it.

317
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:49,520
How did you lose your phone?

318
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:52,889
Then you should've borrowed
someone's phone to call me.

319
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,889
All right, then.

320
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,990
Come home or not.
Do whatever you want.

321
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,100
Oh, dear.
Did Gyeong Tae not come home last night?

322
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,600
I couldn't reach him,

323
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,100
so I couldn't sleep a wink
all night.

324
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,500
He lost his phone.

325
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,270
He must be losing his mind.
Good grief.

326
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:12,840
So where is he?

327
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,439
He's at the hospital
because Detective An is sick.

328
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,540
That Detective An
or whatever his name is...

329
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,350
looks like a scary bandit.

330
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,080
How sick is he?

331
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,219
Even if he comes in contact
with a cold virus,

332
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:26,419
it might run right off
after one look at his scary face.

333
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,419
Does Gyeong Tae ever tell me much
when I ask him anything?

334
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,619
If he lost his phone,

335
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:33,189
he could've borrowed someone's phone
to call me.

336
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,300
Seriously, I can't stand him.

337
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,280
She's in a weak state
physically and mentally.

338
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,520
She must've been under huge stress.

339
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,290
She must relax
and get some peace of mind.

340
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,389
I have to tell her everything
and beg for forgiveness.

341
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,800
How could I tell her that
when she wants to die?

342
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,469
How could I?

343
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:22,609
(Emergency Room, Funeral Home)

344
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,209
Okay, everybody.
Your attention please.

345
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,780
I will now begin
the historic event of...

346
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,820
Eom Hong Dan's
wedding invitation distribution!

347
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:36,659
Here you go.

348
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,530
You must get sores in your mouth...

349
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,459
if you don't make a fuss for a day.

350
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,169
Gosh, Director Lee. How did you know
I had a sore on my tongue?

351
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,969
Seriously,
you're such a considerate boss.

352
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:50,899
My goodness. You're the best.

353
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,669
Marriage and a baby.
You're killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

354
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,109
Congratulations.

355
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,580
Oh, my. What's up with you?

356
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,209
You're being so kind.

357
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,520
Thanks.

358
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,050
I will congratulate you
on your marriage,

359
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,590
but please don't act like
a shabby old lady at work.

360
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,590
Snapped right out of it.

361
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,629
Sure, you wouldn't be Kang Ji Na
if your kindness lasted much longer.

362
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:18,469
Here, pass this on.

363
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:20,230
Yoo Ra.

364
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,740
Gosh, it looks so neat and pretty.

365
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:26,240
It's not too far away.

366
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,139
You know, they say it's an issue
that people aren't getting married.

367
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:30,980
So why is booking a venue...

368
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,609
I barely managed to book a place.
It was incredibly hard.

369
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:36,020
We snagged a spot
that someone else canceled on.

370
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,649
What?

371
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,189
By the way,
is Mr. Seo not here today?

372
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:42,560
Oh, Mr. Seo?

373
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,419
He came in and went out
for a meeting right away.

374
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:45,730
Oh, okay.

375
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:52,929
You're here, Mother.

376
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,800
I came here
because Min Gi asked me to.

377
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,199
What are you doing here?

378
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,040
I asked Min Gi
to schedule a meeting for us.

379
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:03,679
Please have a seat, Mother.

380
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:17,389
"Mother?" You sure have thick skin.

381
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,090
Mother.

382
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,000
Min Gi and I are dating again.

383
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,899
We're really going to
do things right this time.

384
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,270
What?

385
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,469
Are you playing with my Min Gi?

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,310
Going back and forth
like you're just flipping your hand.

387
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,280
What about Chairwoman Hwang?

388
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,709
I know there are talks of marriage
between you and Gu Dan Soo.

389
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,280
I'll sort things out.

390
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,850
Min Gi is the man
I'm going to marry.

391
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,419
How can I trust you?

392
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,219
Hey.

393
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,929
And why should Min Gi have to
accept being treated like this?

394
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,760
With Min Gi's career
and his good looks,

395
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,030
he can marry
a much better woman than you.

396
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,270
The moment he entered
the marriage race,

397
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,540
the fanciest of potential brides
were lining up.

398
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
Who do you think you are?

399
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:09,780
I know that
I don't meet your standards, Mother.

400
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:13,510
I will be good from now on, Mother.

401
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,879
Hey, have you convinced
your mom about this?

402
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,419
She seemed to have quite the temper.

403
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,790
What if she acts rudely
towards Min Gi?

404
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:26,060
That will take some time.

405
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:29,429
It's all up to me, anyway, right?

406
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,570
I'm sure she will accept
the man I love.

407
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,570
Fine, then.

408
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,070
I'll keep my eye on you.

409
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,939
Dating that immature brat,
Gu Dan Soo,

410
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:45,609
must've made you miss Min Gi
even more.

411
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,919
Of course.
My son is a much better catch.

412
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,379
How can anyone compare to him?

413
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:52,949
Of course, Mother.

414
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,429
Oh, my.
Are you really getting married, Dr. Maeng?

415
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,369
I guess so.

416
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,740
Gosh, enlisting in the military twice
might actually be better.

417
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,010
I feel like I'm walking into a fire
with my own two feet.

418
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,909
Come on.
Marriage is better than that.

419
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,949
Enlisting in the military twice
is better.

420
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:20,780
I've already started boot camp.

421
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,219
In the middle of the night,
she says she wants to do something,

422
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:23,280
eat something...

423
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,949
It's a fiery pit
that's as hot as spicy chicken feet.

424
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:30,490
Shall I show you
what a real fiery pit feels like?

425
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,830
I'm here for my regular checkup,
Dr. Maeng.

426
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,810
(Premium Iron Supplements)

427
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,439
Iron pills.

428
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:50,439
They're crucial for pregnant women.
Be sure to take them.

429
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:52,409
I mean, you are an older mom.

430
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:55,719
But why would you give me
so many iron pills?

431
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,379
I might give birth to Iron Man
at this rate.

432
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:02,389
Older moms are twice as likely to
have gestosis or hypertension.

433
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,060
And you're three times as likely
to have gestational diabetes.

434
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,189
You must maintain a strict diet.

435
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:08,830
You are an older mom, after all.

436
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,699
"Older mom!"

437
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:12,830
Can you stop saying that?

438
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,000
But I'm calling you an older mom
because that's what you are.

439
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,340
What else should I call you?

440
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,540
Oh, should I say that
you're an older lady who's pregnant?

441
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,310
You're far along in years?

442
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Hey.

443
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,869
Chairwoman Hwang sent me.

444
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,369
How did you find me...

445
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,810
Please leave this place immediately.

446
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
No.

447
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,379
No, I won't leave.

448
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,850
I won't leave.

449
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,350
I won't run away ever again. Never!

450
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,859
Did you think
I would leave you alone?

451
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:31,280
(My Merry Marriage)

452
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,480
Gong Hee,
I actually have something to tell you.

453
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,780
What is it...

454
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,320
that you're hesitating so much?

455
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,949
Here comes the bride.

456
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,990
This is seriously incredible.

457
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,290
What's with this reaction?

458
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,020
For a man like you,

459
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,330
I don't mind proposing to you first.

460
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,389
Will you marry me?

461
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:50,399
This upcoming fashion week
is all the rage already.

462
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,399
So...

463
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,629
What about making
a direct offer to Holly?

464
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
