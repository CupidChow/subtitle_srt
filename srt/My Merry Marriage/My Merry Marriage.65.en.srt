1
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,210
(We're getting married.)

2
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,140
(Episode 65)

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,909
I told you to get it all ready
last night.

4
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,110
What did you do?

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,450
I put everything in the bag,
so I thought it was done.

6
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,819
Gosh, whatever.
You're never helpful.

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,319
Hey, let's get dressed.

8
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:39,959
Did he wash up?

9
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:42,360
No. I haven't even
washed up myself yet.

10
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,099
Hey, do you want your son...

11
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:46,029
to look messy on his first day
at the daycare center?

12
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:47,529
Hey, move.

13
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:49,029
- What?
- Oh, boy.

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,100
All right, No Ah. Open wide.

15
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,409
- Here.
- I don't want this.

16
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,509
What?

17
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,879
At a glance,
I can tell it'll taste awful.

18
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:05,019
You said the kid was smart.

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,290
You said he was a very good boy.

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,390
What's with him today?

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,890
Hey, you're not like this normally.

22
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:14,360
You're very mature and...

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,299
My mom always cooks
sunny-side-up eggs for me.

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,670
What did you say?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't eat it, then.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,969
It's so good.

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,369
Wrinkly Monster!

28
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,910
My mom doesn't have a single wrinkle
on her face.

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,650
What? Did you call me a monster?
"Wrinkly?" Hey!

30
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,380
Wrinkly Monster is here. Run!

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,449
Hey! My goodness.

32
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,859
You little rascal.
Watch what you say! Hey!

33
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,259
Here, eat up.

34
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,259
- No, I don't want it.
- I told you.

35
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,830
- It's good. Try it.
- Marriage is like enlistment.

36
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,100
- It looks awful.
- It's true.

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,300
- But you need to eat.
- No, I don't want it.

38
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,540
(Sunny Daycare Center)

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,070
Thank you.

40
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,710
Neener.

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,580
What...

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Why, that...

43
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,759
Me?

44
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:24,460
My gosh, Eom Hong Dan.

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,529
You may feel miserable now,
but you chose this.

46
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,270
What?

47
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:31,999
Oh, no.

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,270
This is nuts.

49
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,539
My daughter? Gong Hee?

50
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,110
What about Gong Hee?

51
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,080
Why won't you say anything?

52
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,920
What about my Gong Hee?

53
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,950
What is going on here?

54
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,189
Did she come here
to talk nonsense again?

55
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,260
What is it? What about my daughter?

56
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,360
Do you think
she's still hung up on your son?

57
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,369
Come on. She is not.

58
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,640
Hey, Gong Hee knows...

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,270
who'd make a good mother-in-law
and who wouldn't.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,409
Jung Ssang Sook, don't you worry
about stuff like that. Just go home.

61
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,010
Hey, do you really think
that's why I'm here?

62
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,180
Then what is it? What's the matter?

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,150
Just say it.

64
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,719
Do you know nothing about
what your own daughter is up to?

65
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,119
Are you really her mother?

66
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,529
Right now, your daughter is...

67
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,330
What?

68
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,099
Hey, Joo Ri. You're here.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,569
Oh, yes, Gyeong Tae.

70
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,969
Well... If you're here
to have dumplings,

71
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,770
you should have a seat.

72
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,839
I feel bad about him, though.

73
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,580
He has always been
the old-fashioned type.

74
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,779
He held Kang Myung Ja's hand
just once...

75
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,219
and said
he'd take responsibility for her.

76
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,619
What if he makes a fuss...

77
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,249
about having the kids get married
because he got her pregnant?

78
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,890
Why are you just standing there
and not saying anything?

79
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,289
Hey, just leave
if you're not going to say anything.

80
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,930
We're busy getting ready
for business.

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,900
Yes. Just go, okay? Go.

82
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,900
Goodness.

83
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,469
Then, I'll see you next time,
Gyeong Tae. See you soon.

84
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,670
Oh, okay.

85
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,180
My gosh. "See you soon," my foot.

86
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,890
Why did she suddenly show up
and start talking about Gong Hee?

87
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,920
Did something happen...

88
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,059
with Min Gi, that son of hers?

89
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:36,690
Well...

90
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,560
What could have happened?

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,299
I'm sure she's just trying
to keep an eye out.

92
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,500
I mean, she was the one
who was bragging...

93
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,339
about her son marrying
a rich family's daughter.

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,039
Something feels weird.

95
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:48,969
I have a bad feeling about this.

96
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,539
(Maeng Dumplings)

97
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,080
Hey, what do we do?

98
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,779
That girl, Gong Hee,
is very stubborn.

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,750
She says she won't say anything
to Min Gi...

100
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,520
and says not to worry about that.

101
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,289
But still, I feel so anxious.

102
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,729
I was thinking about
just telling her mother,

103
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,560
but I can't do that
in case things blow up even more.

104
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,770
My gosh.

105
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,169
Okay. I'll deal with it myself.

106
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:22,510
Can't she even handle that?

107
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,049
What do you plan to do now?

108
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,390
I've been sending emails to Holly...

109
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,390
I'm not talking about that.

110
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,289
Then what...

111
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,190
Your baby.

112
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,830
What do you plan to do with it?

113
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,630
Did you think I wouldn't know?

114
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
That child is...

115
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:54,210
Min Gi's.

116
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,010
I don't know what your intention is
for hiding this,

117
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,679
but if you're thinking of
splitting the two of us apart,

118
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,210
forget it.

119
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,049
I won't leave Min Gi...

120
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,849
over a mere thing like that.

121
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,820
You answered my phone call
instead of me.

122
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,460
And now, did you tattle on me
to Mr. Seo's mother?

123
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,890
Don't change the topic.
Just tell me.

124
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,659
What is your intention?

125
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,460
Why are you so anxious?

126
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,130
What?

127
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,870
Mr. Seo and I are strangers now.

128
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,200
It's true that we once dated,

129
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,440
and it is also true that
he is the father of the baby.

130
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,880
But I won't ask him for anything
or expect anything because of that.

131
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,750
I won't give up my child.
I'll raise my child.

132
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,719
It had nothing to do with Mr. Seo.

133
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:42,120
I made this decision on my own.

134
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:44,960
I really hope...

135
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,890
you stand by your decision.

136
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,289
If not,

137
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,700
I don't know what I might do.

138
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,719
Hey, I've been looking for you
for a while.

139
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,089
Take your dirty hands off me.

140
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,900
Oh, that just slipped out.

141
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,330
I was going to check what time...

142
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,200
we were supposed to be
at the dress shop.

143
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,599
Is something wrong?

144
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,169
No. It's nothing.

145
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:38,739
Nothing is wrong.

146
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,549
We can go to the dress shop
after work.

147
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:43,979
I've let them know.

148
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:45,979
Okay.

149
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,190
(Design Room)

150
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,900
Are you still making side dishes?

151
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,770
Oh, my. Are you trying
to feed the whole nation?

152
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,570
I'll send some to Mom
and to Gong Boo's too.

153
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,810
Gong Boo has his own wife now.
Why would you do that?

154
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,310
She has to go to work...

155
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,239
and take care of a kid
that suddenly showed up.

156
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,010
She wouldn't have time
to make side dishes.

157
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,719
Still, they must be doing well
after taking No Ah home.

158
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:19,080
They've been quiet for a few days.

159
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,120
I really hope
they live well together from now on.

160
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,560
Every time I think about Gong Boo,

161
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,159
my heart starts to race.

162
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,359
Who knows
what he might run home with next?

163
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,830
Goodness, don't say stuff like that.

164
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,760
Just the thought of it
makes my head hurt.

165
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,929
Seriously,
if he tries to come home again,

166
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,200
I won't let him in.

167
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,000
By the way,
you know that, don't you?

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,969
The manners of a mother-in-law...

169
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,739
when delivering side dishes
to her son's house.

170
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,210
These days, just leaving them
in front of the door is the best.

171
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,380
Even getting them from
the security office is a hassle.

172
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,849
What am I, a deliveryman?

173
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:52,720
Why should I bring it to their door?

174
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,919
And you should bring it over
early in the morning,

175
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,020
nice and fresh.

176
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:58,419
You have to take it to them
without their knowing.

177
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,390
My goodness. Don't make me laugh.

178
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,130
Then just don't make food for them.

179
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,360
Do one or the other.

180
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:08,069
Either stop caring
whether they eat well or not,

181
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,929
or deliver it early in the morning,
nice and fresh.

182
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,640
My gosh. I'd rather stop caring.

183
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,850
What is it?

184
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,179
Mom, I have a patient coming in
for an appointment later.

185
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:26,520
Can you go to the daycare center?

186
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:27,819
What?

187
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,449
I'm busy. I have to go.

188
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,650
Hey!

189
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:32,689
My gosh.

190
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:34,990
Should I still stop caring?

191
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,289
He told me to go to the daycare
to pick up his kid.

192
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:38,760
Does he think I don't have to work?

193

- What did you do?

- Yes.

- Seaweed soup?
- What is it?

207
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,860
Did something happen?

208
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:11,130
The other kids teased me.

209
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,959
Because my shoes were mismatched.

210
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,169
What? Your shoes?

211
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,130
Wait, what...

212
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,770
Oh, no.

213
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,610
I see.

214
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,380
But didn't Daddy and Mommy
help you get dressed?

215
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,309
Daddy went to work at the clinic.

216
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,150
And what about Mommy?

217
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,350
Well...

218
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,289
Grandpa will make you
some dumplings.

219

220
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:43,529

All right. Let's go.

Let's go.

223
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,209
No, Mother. Please don't say that.

224
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,179
It's not like I did that on purpose.

I keep telling him
to wear thermal underwear,

227
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,110
but No Ah keeps acting up...

228
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,449
He keeps being stubborn.

229

Even if he gets stubborn,

230
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,720
you can't let him go
without wearing thermal underwear.

231
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,720
What if he catches a cold?

232
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,689
Also, how could you send him
to daycare with mismatched shoes?

233
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,829
Oh, the mismatched...

234
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,199
That's a fashion statement.

235
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,209
You know I'm the assistant manager
at a fashion company.

236
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,610
I wouldn't have sent him
with mismatched shoes for no reason.

237
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,840
Goodness, Mother.

238
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,510
Anyway, we have him at the shop.

239
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,850
Come and pick him up after work.

Seriously,
what is wrong with your mother?

253
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,250
I mean, did I do that on purpose?

254
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,990
You saw it too. He was refusing
to put on his thermal underwear.

255
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,549
He said it was too hot
and would make him sweat.

256
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:19,659
That was why
I didn't make him wear them.

257
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:23,429

Oh, come on.

My shoes are mismatched too.

260

Just taking care of myself
in the morning is hard enough.

00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,630
I'll catch you later.

360
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,159
What?

361
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,169
Are you here for some dumplings?

362
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,229
Or are you here to see me?

363
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,640
I came to have some dumplings.

364
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,709
What?

365
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,050
(Bubble Up Laundry)

366
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,159
Do you know nothing about
what your own daughter is up to?

367
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,459
Are you really her mother?

368
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,900
Right now, your daughter is...

369
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,350
My goodness.

370
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,419
Oh, dear.

371
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,189
What's the matter?
Why can't you sleep?

372
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:04,590
Why do you think
Ssang Sook came to the shop earlier?

373
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,570
My goodness.
You're still thinking about that?

374
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,640
She suddenly brought up Gong Hee.
It's so weird.

375
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,969
Aren't you worried
as Gong Hee's father?

376
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,540
Oh, come on.

377
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:20,580
Gong Hee has never done anything
to worry us.

378
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,350
That's exactly why I'm worried now.

379
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,050
She has never complained once
since she was a little kid.

380
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,290
She always smiles quietly, you know.

381
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,290
Even when she's sad or worried
about something, she never tells us.

382
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,630
And we've been neglecting her
because of Gong Boo's situation.

383
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,060
I can't help but worry.

384
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,600
Anyway, why can't you fall asleep,
honey?

385
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:46,969
It's nothing.

386
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:50,310
Goodness. Why did I even ask?

387
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,979
Good grief.

388
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,780
- Goodness me.
- Oh, dear.

389
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,919
Hey, I'm cold.

390
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,850
Share the blanket with me.

391
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,959
- Go away.
- That hurt.

392
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,729
I will ask you one last time
whether you could come...

393
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:17,330
to the finale of the fashion show.

394
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,800
Will you come, Holly?

395
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,640
(Your email has been sent.)

396
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Please...

397
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,610
- Here.
- Could you take a look?

398
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,810
Let's go with this. Thank you.

399
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,919
We need the models...

400
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320
to come all the way here
and strike their poses.

401
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,860
Okay, I'll make sure.

402
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Thank you.

403
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,719
Can you guys make sure...

404
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:28,070
We'll change the lighting
and rehearse once more.

405
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:31,370
And please check the order
one more time.

406
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,409
- Okay, I'll check.
- Thank you.

407
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,219
- It looks good.
- Yes.

408
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,659
- Oh, no!
- One moment!

409
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,130
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

410
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,229
It's a little slippery.

411
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,499
Please have Facility Management...

412
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,229
come and check
so we can prevent accidents.

413
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,070
Got it.
I'll have them check it right away.

414
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,640
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

415
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,469
- You're not hurt, right?
- I'm good.

416
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,479
My goodness.

417
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,719
We should wipe the floor.

418
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:22,630
- This here...
- Yes.

419
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,259
- Can you check this spot again?
- Got it.

420
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,070
- Right here.
- After this...

421
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,040
Do you think Holly will show up?

422
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,380
I doubt it.

423
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,679
Gong Hee didn't hear back
from Holly.

424
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,550
Come on. Then why do you think
the reporters are here?

425
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,949
I think
all the fashion reporters are here.

426
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:50,590
If they get a photo of Holly's face,

427
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,659
it'll be the most viewed article
in the world.

428
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,890
No wonder they're all here.

429
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,259
We already published a correction
that said the rumor wasn't true,

430
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,659
but they still came.

431
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm just hoping
we won't get laughed at after this.

432
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,199
My gosh. What should we do?

433
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,199
If Holly doesn't come...

434
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,439
It'll stir up controversy.

435
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,179
Then this season is doomed.

436
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,780
After doing all that work,

437
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,150
I'll be asked
to submit a written apology.

438
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:22,749
Where is Gong Hee?

439
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,189
She's running around
to get things done.

440
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,360
She prayed over a bowl
of clean water this morning...

441
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,860
to please let Holly show up.

442
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,729
Would that
actually make Holly show up?

443
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,469
We haven't heard back until now,
so the answer is obvious.

444
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,739
Holly will not show up.

445
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,439
My goodness.

446
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,709
This show is already a failure.

447
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,620
Please check these with me.

448
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,489
Okay. The next models, get ready.
You're going in soon!

449
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,100
Space them out further apart
like we did during the rehearsal.

450
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,499
We're going a bit too fast now.

451
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:42,600
The most important thing is...

452
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,699
to let the audience
enjoy the clothes with ease.

453
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:45,900
Yes, got it.

454
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:55,409
- What's going on?
- What is this?

455
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,439
What?

456
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,150
What's going on?

457
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,090
I told you the designer
wouldn't be making an appearance.

458
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,189
Well, the thing is...

459
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,459
Stage management team,
please bring the models backstage.

460
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,300
Stage team!

461
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
What is this?

462
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,469
I thought Holly wasn't coming.

463
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:24,469
How would I know?

464
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:26,600
Is Holly here or not?

465
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:28,499
What is this?

466
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,120
What's going on?

467
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
- What?
- What is this?

468
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,189
- Go and find out what's going on.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,870
- What's going on?
- Is the designer coming?

470
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,340
- Is Holly coming?
- I think so.

471
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:10,949
Holly.

472
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,249
Please show up.

473
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:15,179
Please.

474
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,370
- Holly!
- Holly!

475
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,239
- Holly!
- Holly!

476
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:08,040
- Holly!
- Holly!

477
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,739
- Holly!
- Holly!

478
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:11,669
- Holly!
- Holly!

479
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:13,540
- Holly!
- Holly!

480
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,209
- Holly!
- Holly!

481
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:16,949
- Holly!
- Holly!

482
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:18,709
- Holly!
- Holly!

483
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:20,519
- Holly!
- Holly!

484
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,249
- Holly!
- Holly!

485
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:24,120
- Holly!
- Holly!

486
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,259
(My Merry Marriage)

487
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,330
I'm sure I told you I was Holly.

488
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,169
What? You're Holly?

489
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,199
Gu Dan Soo was Holly?

490
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:41,070
What kind of joke is this,
Gu Dan Soo?

491
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,269
No Ah is sick.

492
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:43,669
What? What's wrong with him?

493
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:45,269
No Ah.

494
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,179
Go on and tell me.

495
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,280
What has happened to my daughter?

496
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,380
Your daughter is pregnant.

497
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,449
Do you hear that?

498
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:53,979
The baby's heart is beating well.

499
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,390
Mom!

500
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,650
