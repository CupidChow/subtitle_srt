1
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,980
(Episode 41)

2
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,849
Yes, right.

3
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:00,989
I made this for him.

4
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:07,329
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,340
My gosh. I'm sorry.

6
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,479
I just thought it looked unusual.

7
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,150
I guess
you've had it for a long time.

8
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,449
Did Gong Hee go somewhere?

9
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,990
She's taking a call.

10
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,750
I'll go and get her.

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,220
Wait, Dan Soo.

12
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,629
Well...

13
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,790
I need to ask you something.

14
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,199
Do your parents live
somewhere far away?

15
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:54,270
Why are you curious
about my parents?

16
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:56,779
Well...

17
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,850
You just don't look like someone
who'd need to rent a room like this.

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,680
How come...

19
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,550
you don't live with your parents?

20
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:08,889
Well...

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,559
It's not a beautiful fairy tale...

22
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,029
I'd want to share with others.

23
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,499
I mean, my family's story.

24
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,770
Why should we talk
about something dark?

25
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,199
Mr. Seo.

26
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,099
I couldn't reach you,
so I came to see you.

27
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:58,539
Are you all right?

28
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,409
I got my hopes up...

29
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,140
only to be totally disappointed.

30
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:07,480
I must say, I'm really upset.

31
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,249
Why did Director Lee
talk like I'd win?

32
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,890
I'm so embarrassed.

33
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,260
I told my parents it was a done deal
while daydreaming.

34
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,460
You did well too, Gong Hee.

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,700
I do want to ask them
what the reason was.

36
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,599
The reason?

37
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:33,110
The reason I didn't win.

38
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,839
What did I lack?

39
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:38,210
I heard everyone talk like
I'd be the winner.

40
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,610
Why did the result suddenly change?

41
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:45,789
Well...

42
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,089
You shouldn't bring it up again,
for your own sake.

43
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,589
Pardon?

44
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,569
If you keep asking them about it,

45
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,670
the higher-ups won't get
a good impression of you.

46
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,439
Also, you need to consider
Ms. Kang's position too.

47
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,140
You're right.

48
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:15,110
I'm a mere temporary employee,
after all.

49
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,550
I know that
you must be very disappointed.

50
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,319
You must've been excited
about the promotion.

51
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:27,930
It's fine. This just shows
that I'm not competent enough.

52
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,559
You are very competent, Gong Hee.

53
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,069
How about you look for another job?

54
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,339
I'll help you.

55
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:41,170
Actually,

56
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,110
I've made up my mind
about something.

57
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,050
I...

58
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,319
What is this?

59
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:55,789
Who did this?

60
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,390
Who put this here
without even saying a word?

61
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:02,729
"Letter of resignation?"

62
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,969
Was it perhaps Gong Hee?

63
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,370
There's no name on this.

64
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,609
Somebody left this on my desk
without a word.

65
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,710
Is this your way of protesting
to complain about your workload?

66
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,750
Come out! Show yourself at once!

67
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:22,049
Oh, boy.

68
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:23,919
My gosh.

69
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,919
Production Team B dropped these off.

70
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,789
I'm going to label them.

71
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,060
Don't mind me.
Do what you need to do.

72
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,690
Do you need coffee?

73
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,299
Gong Hee, are you okay?

74
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,140
Pardon? What do you mean?

75
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,109
I mean,
you took the day off yesterday.

76
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:50,279
I thought you had submitted
your letter of resignation.

77
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,380
Gosh, what are you talking about?

78
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,109
I should work even harder
and aim for another chance.

79
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:56,950
I, Maeng Gong Hee,
won't be defeated by such things.

80
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:03,419
Then, who on earth wrote this?

81
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,789
Won't anyone own up to it?

82
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,390
It was me.

83
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,310
I wrote it.

84
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,640
Why? Is there a problem?

85
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,549
Well, why are you so proud of it?

86
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,179
I thought about it,

87
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:32,820
and I'm going to be
a doctor's wife soon.

88
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:36,460
I feel quite upset
about being treated like this here.

89
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:38,289
Ms. Eom.

90
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm going to quit working
at this lousy company myself.

91
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:44,900
Do you get what I mean?

92
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,870
Well, in that case,

93
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,339
take this letter of resignation
and format it the correct way!

94
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,140
I can't accept a resignation letter
without a name on it!

95
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Oh, my.

96
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,960
What are all these...

97
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,830
(Letter of Resignation)

98
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,900
Whenever you yelled at me,

99
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,969
I wrote one each time.

100
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,169
What?

101
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,440
(Letter of Resignation)

102
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:27,609
Are you really going
to make me worry like this?

103
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,739
Come to work this instant.

104
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,750
I won't work at a rotten company.

105
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,250
Don't associate with those
you do not want to be like.

106
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:37,679
Gu Dan Soo!

107
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,150
I'm hanging up now.

108
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,089
Live well without me, Grandma.

109
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,789
(Chairwoman Hwang Ik Sun)

110
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:47,789
I think he's really mad.

111
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:49,089
What should I do?

112
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,900
He won't come to work
or move back home.

113
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,429
He won't even get married either.

114
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,429
I think everything is ruined.

115
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:55,969
What am I supposed to do?

116
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,770
Just give him some time.

117
00:07:58,169 --> 00:07:59,570
It'll be okay.

118
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,140
You know how stubborn Dan Soo is.

119
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,679
He might say
he will never see me again.

120
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,250
Do something about it, Mr. Seo.

121
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,919
It's Hae Joon's
death anniversary soon.

122
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:17,659
How about we use this tactic?

123
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,429
It could be rather mean, but...

124
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:23,299
What is it?

125
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,179
I told you I'd find you a place
at another company.

126
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,310
That's okay.

127
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,989
I just feel bad seeing you
hanging on by a thread here.

128
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:47,650
It'll be another temporary position,

129
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,789
- but if you work hard...
- No.

130
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,489
I'm going to stay here
at Jayce Fashion.

131
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:55,859
Is this perseverance or pride?

132
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,729
You'll regret staying here.

133
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,799
Thank you for your concern.

134
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:04,169
But I'm hanging in here
so that I won't regret things.

135
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,169
I'll go back to how determined I was
in the beginning.

136
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,039
I'll study and learn things
all over again.

137
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:10,810
Please look kindly upon me,
Ms. Kang.

138
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,179
Do you think this is a school?

139
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,909
What do you mean, you'll learn here?

140
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,620
I'll do my best.

141
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,579
Anyone can do their best.

142
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,650
I'll do well.

143
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,789
Gosh, that stings.

144
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:32,970
What's wrong with that company?

145
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,000
Thinking about how much
Gong Hee's heart must be aching...

146
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,069
Goodness,
don't you know our daughter?

147
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
She'll overcome this.

148
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,409
That's right. Has Gong Hee
ever gotten down on herself?

149
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,709
Even when she fell from the slide...

150
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,319
and was bleeding so much,

151
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,720
she didn't shed a tear.

152
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,990
Enduring the pain
on her own like that...

153
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,020
makes me upset.

154
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,319
All she does is smile.

155
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,390
She only smiled
even when we couldn't send her...

156
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,329
to academies
to pay for her brother's tuition.

157
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,529
She also smiled
while dipping into her savings...

158
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,270
to help Gong Boo open up his clinic.

159
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,970
All she does is smile,

160
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,370
but how do you think
she feels on the inside?

161
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,039
When I think about that,
I seriously...

162
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:14,740
Why are these onions so spicy?
My goodness.

163
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,640
Ladies, I'm here.

164
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:20,579
Goodness,
you just come into the kitchen...

165
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,610
like it's your own living room,
don't you?

166
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,419
Why did you buy so much groceries?

167
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,319
I'm having fun making side dishes
these days.

168
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,559
Hearing that your whole family
really enjoyed them,

169
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,620
I feel so excited.

170
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,059
Goodness. Why would you think
about feeding our family?

171
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,329
I also make snacks
for my customers to eat...

172
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:39,669
when they come to the shop.

173
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:42,770
That's why people
in the neighborhood talk.

174
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,669
You should treat people
more bluntly.

175
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,569
Are you trying to seduce
all the men in the neighborhood?

176
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,679
Gosh, you should watch out too.

177
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:56,419
Oh, my.

178
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Right.

179
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,090
Hey, Detective An.

180
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,620
What? Now?

181
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,799
Gosh, that sounds great.
The weather is nice too.

182
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,829
Do people catch
that many fish there?

183
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:20,209
Right, I should go.
I'll be right there.

184
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:22,779
What is it now?

185
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:24,709
Well...

186
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:29,579
I made plenty of dumpling wrappers.

187
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,620
Where are you going?

188
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
Well...

189
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,090
Fishing. What else?

190
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,789
- You do it.
- What?

191
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,360
My goodness. I can't even...

192
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,789
- Work hard.
- Seriously?

193
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,260
Mr. Maeng must really like fishing.

194
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,100
Who knows?

195
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,429
Is he going fishing...

196
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,039
or doing something else,
using fishing as an excuse?

197
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,870
Let's just say
you caught two carps today.

198
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:00,679
They're a bit small.

199
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,980
If you want to catch big fish,

200
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,220
you have to go far out to sea
on a boat.

201
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,159
Maybe she left Korea
a long time ago.

202
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,600
Good grief.

203
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:20,929
Must we check immigration records?
Oh, dear.

204
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,240
What is it that you wanted to say?

205
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Oh, right.

206
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,270
Gyeong Tae.

207
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,340
About that woman who owns...

208
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,740
the alteration shop
in your neighborhood.

209
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,309
What? Ms. Audrey?

210
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,980
Do you know her well?

211
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,319
You said she only moved here
recently.

212
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,620
What about Ms. Audrey?

213
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,529
Oh, my. Dan Soo.

214
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,500
What brings you here?

215
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,069
This is a suit.

216
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,370
I want to have it let out.

217
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,169
A suit?

218
00:12:58,169 --> 00:12:59,909
Yes. When I tried it on,

219
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:01,669
it suddenly felt too short.

220
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,880
I must still be growing.

221
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,209
My charm and tall height
know no bounds.

222
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:11,919
I'm just kidding.

223
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,520
I only wear this once a year.

224
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,789
It seems a bit too small.

225
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,559
Please lengthen it by about 2cm.

226
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,260
Oh, you only wear it once a year?

227
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes. I'm going to wear it
when I visit my dad.

228
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,539
Oh, I guess
Geon meets with Hae Joon.

229
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,069
I need it by tomorrow.

230
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:34,069
Will that be possible?

231
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,510
Of course. I'll have it ready.

232
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,079
Then, I'll leave it to you.

233
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,110
Bye, Dan Soo.

234
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,579
Yes, have a good day.

235
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,020
A suit he wears once a year?

236
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:50,689
What could it be about?

237
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,559
I was wondering...

238
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:00,500
if I should tell you this or not
since I wasn't sure.

239
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:06,640
Last time,
when I went to the dumpling shop,

240
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,370
we ran into her outside, right?

241
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,510
I got a strange vibe
from her then too.

242
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,880
Well, I guess...

243
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,250
you're not one
to glare at just anyone like that.

244
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:23,159
I felt like
I had seen her somewhere before.

245
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,419
I think...

246
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,590
she was someone I saw in Kkotsan.

247
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,100
You saw her in Kkotsan?

248
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,199
Ms. Audrey?

249
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,370
Yes.

250
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,610
It rained so much that night.

251
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:50,250
Goodness,
is there a hole in the sky?

252
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,579
Why is it pouring down so hard?

253
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,490
The road is so dark too.

254
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:58,490
It's the perfect night
to see a ghost.

255
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:03,929
Oh, my!

256
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
What's that?

257
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,470
Is that a person?

258
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,510
Gosh, my heart nearly jumped out
of my throat.

259
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,309
Hey, are you okay?

260
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,510
Are you okay?

261
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,709
Goodness, why are you standing
on the road like that?

262
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:25,179
I thought you were a ghost.

263
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,289
Are you going to the bus stop?

264
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:30,760
I doubt the buses are running
at this hour.

265
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,730
Just go on your way.

266
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,529
The road is dark at night.

267
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,299
The weather is bad too.

268
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,230
You should just go home already.

269
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:41,329
I told you to just keep going.

270
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,439
I'm a detective in Kkotsan Police.

271
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,279
You look like
you're going somewhere far.

272
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,809
If anything happens
on your way to your destination,

273
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,610
give me a call.

274
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,620
(Kkotsan Police Station, An Sang Ho)

275
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,189
Make sure you contact me, okay?

276
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,260
So, you think...

277
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,870
that woman was Audrey?

278
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:15,829
Are you sure?

279
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:17,939
It was almost 20 years ago,

280
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,669
so the memory is blurry.

281
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,980
I wasn't too sure,

282
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,909
so I wasn't going to tell you,

283
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,980
but I can't help but think
that Audrey and Oh Jung Eun...

284
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,350
have so much in common.

285
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:33,350
You said
you didn't know her real name...

286
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:35,390
or her age.

287
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,199
It's a black suit.

288
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:47,970
It's not like
he's going to a funeral.

289
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,500
Why would he visit Hae Joon,
wearing something...

290
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,110
that looks like a mourning suit?

291
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,039
Does he want to be formally dressed
because...

292
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,779
he hasn't seen him in a while?

293
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
Dan Soo.

294
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,590
Will you not come back to work
after leaving like that?

295
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,559
I told you not to act like
an irresponsible child.

296
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:13,959
If you keep this up,

297
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,890
it'll get harder
for the company to keep you.

298
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,100
Oh, is that right?

299
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,970
I'd like that.

300
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,770
Gu Dan Soo, are you really
going to be like this?

301
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Where are you now?

302
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,340
If you're curious, come out.

303
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,309
I won't run away.
I'll stay right here.

304
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,809
Okay, where are you?

305
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,090
Hey, you didn't come to work.
Where are you?

306
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,929
Are you slacking off again?

307
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:56,100
I don't need a company like that.

308
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:57,939
And...

309
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,009
I have a more important matter
to take care of now.

310
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,179
I'm on my way now. Stay right there.

311
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,290
I quit yesterday.

312
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,100
Take good care of Jayce Fashion,
Maeng Ggong.

313
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,530
This little...

314
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,040
You lounged around in the morning
and told me to head out first.

315
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,840
Was this your plan?

316
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,269
Get yourself here now!

317
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,580
Okay, fine. That's what you will do?

318
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:45,080
Go home right now
and wait for me on your knees.

319
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,949
If you're lounging around
when I get home from work,

320
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,659
you are so dead.

321
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:51,759
Do you understand?

322
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,959
This punk.

323
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:08,169
Are you going somewhere?

324
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,310
It doesn't look like
it's work-related.

325
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,080
Mind your own business, will you?

326
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,519
Are you sure about her?

327
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,650
I'm talking about Maeng Gong Hee.

328
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,290
Are you sure she is someone...

329
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,989
you want to marry?

330
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,959
Is that important?

331
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,070
How could you talk about
marrying her when you don't know...

332
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,070
everything about her?

333
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,570
I trust what I see.

334
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,709
Someone I thought I knew very well
betrayed me.

335
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,580
I know
Gong Hee will never betray me.

336
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,689
Ms. Eom,
about your resignation letter.

337
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,130
I hope my brother wasn't the reason.

338
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,499
Well, I need to hold up
my dignity as a doctor's wife.

339
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,969
Gosh, they're so mean to me at work.

340
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:15,169
It's embarrassing, you know.

341
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,880
Right,
you'll soon be a doctor's wife.

342
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,640
- That's true, but...
- Anyway,

343
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,150
we'll congratulate you properly
at your farewell party, Ms. Eom.

344
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,620
Gong Hee, are you sure you're okay?

345
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,919
Why? Did something happen?

346
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:32,259
No, nothing happened.

347
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:36,330
To us, you're the winner.
You know that, right?

348
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,759
Of course, I know. Thank you.

349
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,370
Anyway,

350
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,900
what is Dan Soo up to now?

351
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
I have no idea.

352
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,769
He missed work today.
Is he lounging around at home?

353
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,640
What is this?

354
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:53,350
You're talking like
you two live together.

355
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,479
Oh, it's just a habit
from my childhood days.

356
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:59,080
He missed school often
when he was young.

357
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,489
He slept over at my place often.

358
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:03,759
Goodness.
This girl and her absurd fixations.

359
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,330
She thinks the two of you
live together. My gosh.

360
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,659
"Live together?"
My goodness. That is nuts.

361
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:13,729
That's right.

362
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:16,939
You live with your family, Gong Hee.
Gosh, you.

363
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:19,870
Well, they kept having
suspicious conversations.

364
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,640
About doing laundry
and cleaning the house.

365
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,479
What? I did?

366
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,550
Hey. Enough is enough, okay?

367
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:28,880
You'd better not...

368
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,679
give my future sister-in-law
a hard time...

369
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,449
when I'm not around, okay?

370
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,519
By the way,
I need to stop by the dumpling shop.

371
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,790
Ssook Ssook craves
Mother's dumplings...

372
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,100
every single night.

373
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,959
Oh, Mom will be happy to hear that.

374
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,729
You're welcome
to stop by the shop anytime.

375
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:49,370
It's so good.
You've never had it, right?

376
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,769
- Never.
- It's really good.

377
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,570
It's a famous place
with tons of reviews.

378
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,370
Ssook Ssook is such a picky eater.
Did you know?

379
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,050
Join me.

380
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,310
How about a game?

381
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,249
Did you miss work...

382
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,679
to play basketball?

383
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,050
Why? Are you afraid you might lose?

384
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,290
Don't get cheeky with me.

385
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,790
If you beat me,

386
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,560
I'll give you everything you want.

387
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:17,699
Fine.

388
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,100
I'll be nice and go to work.

389
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:23,300
That way, you can avoid
being scolded by Grandma.

390
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
What else do you want?

391
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,409
Being the heir to Jayce Group?
Do you want it?

392
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:33,979
Do you need it?

393
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,679
What are you talking about?

394
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,590
I mean, if you beat me.

395
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
But...

396
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,019
I think I'll win.

397
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:48,259
You know...

398
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,530
you've never won a single game
while playing with me, right?

399
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,439
If the inventory is off,

400
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,570
ask the distribution team about it.

401
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:04,409
What do you want me to do?

402
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,479
Darn it.

403
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,650
What's the matter?

404
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,280
The store wants us to send someone
from the head office.

405
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,979
What the head office
is sending them...

406
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:15,150
doesn't match
their inventory levels,

407
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,060
but the distribution team says
they sent the correct quantities.

408
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,060
Gosh, what a headache.

409
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,590
They're the new pieces
we're in charge of,

410
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,689
so I can't send a different team.

411
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:26,400
I see. We should go to the store
and check.

412
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:28,269
Yes, I guess.

413
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,169
It looks like we should go there
and do a full inventory check.

414
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:42,179
I'll go.

415
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:44,050
You'll do it?

416
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,489
Yes, but let me take a teammate
with me.

417
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,300
That makes the total score 15.

418
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:33,699
So, I won, right?

419
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,140
Yes, you beat me.

420
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:50,580
What's with you?

421
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,850
Will you never come back to work?

422
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:55,890
You're still talking about work?

423
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,830
Seriously, you're so boring.

424
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,130
There must be something you want.

425
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,600
That's why you're protesting
like this.

426
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,530
What is it? What do you want?

427
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,499
You see, I've made up my mind
about something.

428
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:11,840
I said I'd give you...

429
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,669
everything you wanted
if you beat me.

430
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,409
But I beat you,

431
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,979
so I won't give you anything.

432
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:24,219
I've never asked you for anything.

433
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,219
But there's something.

434
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,550
Something you took from me...

435
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,019
without even asking
if you could have it.

436
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:41,830
Hey, Gu Dan Soo.

437
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:45,999
Oh, right.

438
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,469
You don't have to keep calling me...

439
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:49,909
just because Grandma tells you to.

440
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,280
I'll deal with things on my own.

441
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,979
I'm off.

442
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,689
What is it?

443
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:05,360
Something I didn't even ask for...

444
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,560
and just took?

445
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:22,610
- Hey.
- Gyeong Tae.

446
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,179
Did you ask?

447
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,709
Not yet.

448
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,080
Goodness, you've been looking
for her for 20 years,

449
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
and she's right in front of you.

450
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,880
Why are you still hesitating?

451
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,419
You've been searching
for a complete stranger...

452
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,390
all over the country
with no problem.

453
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,090
Gosh, I'm not hesitating.

454
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:39,620
Whatever. Hang up now.

455
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,790
I'm sure I saw her in Kkotsan
20 years ago.

456
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,100
Come now.

457
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:52,169
That punk.
He said he wasn't sure earlier.

458
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,509
My goodness.

459
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,280
If she were a complete stranger,

460
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,810
there wouldn't be
any hard feelings...

461
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,979
between the person being beaten up
and the one doing the beating.

462
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,820
I mean,

463
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,689
Ms. Audrey might be Oh Jung Eun?

464
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:10,659
Oh, dear.

465
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:14,989
Don't you think...

466
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,259
this is too harsh a prank?

467
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,600
Oh, dear.

468
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,370
My goodness.

469
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,880
Welcome.

470
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:37,479
Oh, my. Mr. Maeng.

471
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:39,820
I thought you went fishing.
Are you back already?

472
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,390
There is...

473
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,219
something I want to ask you.

474
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,030
What is your real name?

475
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,100
(My Merry Marriage)

476
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,199
Mom.

477
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,870
This is my manager at work.

478
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,870
Your manager?

479
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,610
There's something
I haven't told you.

480
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,979
My clinic is having a hard time
paying the interest on our loans.

481
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:44,320
Please treat our dear Gong Hee well.

482
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,979
- Oh, my!
- Gong Hee.

483
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:49,689
- Why not lend her your clothes?
- My clothes?

484
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:51,790
Ms. Kang is headed home now.

485
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,130
We might get caught living together!

486
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,330
