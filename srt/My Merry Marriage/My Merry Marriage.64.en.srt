1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,309
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,490
I'll ask you
a straightforward question.

3
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,220
Is the baby Min Gi's?

4
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,990
I...

5
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:43,389
Answer my question.

6
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:44,999
Is Min Gi the father of the baby?

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Oh, dear. Min Gi, this fool...

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,109
How did you find me at the clinic?

9
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,819
I told you. I happened to see you
walking into that OB-GYN clinic.

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,249
Why do you keep trying
to change the subject?

11
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,020
That's not important.

12
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,550
Did you...

13
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:11,819
tell Min Gi about this?

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,190
No.

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060
Why not?

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,700
Do you have an ulterior motive
or something?

17
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,069
We already broke up,

18
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,600
so this baby has nothing to do
with Mr. Seo now.

19
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,350
Listen, Gong Hee.

20
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,919
I'm saying this because I care
about you like my own daughter.

21
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,160
This baby...

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,860
No.

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,789
I decide what to do with my baby.

24
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,089
No one but me.

25
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,800
It's better that way
for both you and Min Gi.

26
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,800
You have a bright future
ahead of you.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,669
You don't want the baby
to ruin that, do you?

28
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,369
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,339
I should get going.

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,380
What if your mom finds out?

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,380
Should I go ahead and tell your mom?

32
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,250
Would you still be okay?

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,419
Actually, I'm going to tell my mom.

34
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,050
What?

35
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,759
She should know too.

36
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,130
How do you think
your mother would react?

37
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,330
Knowing her personality,

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
she'll totally flip out.

39
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,530
I know, but I think...

40
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,539
it's only right that I tell her.
I have to go.

41
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,210
Wait, Gong Hee.

42
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,579
I beg you like this.

43
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,949
Min Gi has been through so much
to get to where he is now.

44
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,019
My smart and competent son...

45
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,949
has always had to swallow his pride
because of his parents.

46
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,819
He has finally found
a good woman for himself...

47
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,419
and wants to soar high.

48
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,759
I cannot drag him down again.

49
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,630
Gong Hee,
what can I do to persuade you?

50
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,370
Should I get down on my knees?

51
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,569
My gosh, no.
Why are you being like this?

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,069
I'll do everything you say.

53
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,639
Please...

54
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,680
don't ruin Min Gi's future.

55
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,419
- Yes, thank you. See you again.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,160
- Hello.
- Yes, sorry to keep you waiting.

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,889
You can take this table here.
This way.

58
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,030
- What would you like to order?
- One serving of kimchi dumplings.

59
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,960
- One more kimchi!
- Got it.

60
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,530
- Oh, boy.
- My goodness.

61
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:35,699
Oh, dear.
I can't even relax for a moment...

62
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,340
because I have to work
and look after that kid.

63
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,910
Hey, did you offer to raise him,
thinking it'd be easy?

64
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,680
You raised three children.
Have you forgotten already?

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,639
Why three?
I only have Gong Hee and Gong Boo.

66
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,250
There he is, your third child.

67
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,449
Hello.

68
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,449
- Oh, good to see you.
- Hello.

69
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,220
It's packed today.

70
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,460
Hey, why do you look so tired today?

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
Is something the matter?

72
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,090
No.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,329
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,799
- We'll have mixed dumplings too.
- Oh, sure.

75
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,370
- One moment.
- Excuse me. Could I get some water?

76
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,229
Sure, of course.

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Myung Ja.

78
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,710
I'll look after the kid at my shop.

79
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,910
Oh, would you?

80
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,680
It's not safe for him
to hang out here. Thanks.

81
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:22,549
Hi, sweetheart.

82
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:24,819
Come with me.

83
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:28,889
Here.

84
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,620
My gosh, No Ah. You're so mature.

85
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,989
Don't you miss Mommy?

86
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,629
I miss her.

87
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:42,999
My goodness.
You must miss her a lot.

88
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,840
You poor thing.

89
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,010
No Ah, your mom...

90
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,379
must be a wonderful person.

91
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,210
Why do you say that?

92
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,479
Because you miss her so much.

93
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:04,020
Mom's a great person,

94
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:08,160
but she's bad.

95
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:13,559
I don't think Mom misses me.

96
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:16,030
She won't visit me to see me.

97
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,169
No Ah, I'm sure your mom...

98
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,309
misses you very much too.

99
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,210
She must miss you terribly now.

100
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,580
She's probably just
holding it all in.

101
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,479
How do you know that?

102
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,820
Because...

103
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,189
I'm a mom too.

104
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,890
My gosh.

105
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,929
I came
because the chairwoman sent me.

106
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:51,100
I will leave.

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,739
I'm sorting things out now.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,809
Here is your new pledge.

109
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,179
Sign it.

110
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,249
If you refuse,

111
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,390
you will have to come with me now.

112
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,189
What? Another one?

113
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,359
It states that you will give up...

114
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:15,660
all of your rights
regarding Dan Soo.

115
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,429
Even after
the chairwoman passes away,

116
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:20,530
you cannot exercise
any rights whatsoever.

117
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,530
It means that...

118
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,570
you cannot be acknowledged
as Dan Soo's mother,

119
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,539
both legally and morally.

120
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,150
My gosh.

121
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,720
- Yes, thank you. Come again.
- Thank you. Bye.

122
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:48,859
My goodness.

123
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,559
We had a huge wave of customers,

124
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,570
and they're all gone
like the tide now.

125
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,169
I know, right?
They always come all at once.

126
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,770
Gosh, we were swamped.

127
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,239
Mom.

128
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,710
Why didn't you go home
and rest up after work?

129
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,979
Why did you come to the shop?

130
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,479
Mom.

131
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,379
I have something to say.

132
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,879
Something to say? What?

133
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:14,749
Well...

134
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,689
The thing is...

135
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,419
Is it something I shouldn't hear?

136
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,530
Hey, you're here, Gong Hee.

137
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,270
Yes, I guess she came to talk
to her mom about something.

138
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:30,570
What? Then I should hear it too.

139
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,799
My goodness.

140
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,879
No Ah came back here, didn't he?

141
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,879
What?

142
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,950
What? You took him,
saying you'd look after him.

143
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,950
What?

144
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,749
He's gone?

145
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Oh, no.

146
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,619
Well, a customer walked in
all of a sudden.

147
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:55,890
No Ah suddenly disappeared,

148
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,299
so I thought he went to the shop.

149
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,260
But if he's not here,

150
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,830
where did he go by himself?

151
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,200
Oh, dear.

152
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,939
Oh, my goodness.

153
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,410
Boom.

154
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:15,979
What? Mom?

155
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:17,979
Mom.

156
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,249
Mom.

157
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:20,689
Mom!

158
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,150
Mom!

159
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:24,590
A paternity test.

160
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
There's no getting out of it.

161
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,429
He is Maeng Gong Boo's son.

162
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:29,590
(A paternity test.
There's no getting out of it.)

163
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,590
Paternity leave.

164
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,229
It's my clinic. Impossible.

165
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,169
Find a daycare center. Done.

166
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,840
Parental rights and custody.

167
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:41,869
I don't know! I just don't!

168
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,879
Gosh, Maeng Gong Boo.

169
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,249
How have you lived your life?

170
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,419
How did you ruin your marriage
after a month...

171
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,619
and ruin the next marriage
in less than a week?

172
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,259
Why is raising a kid...

173
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,759
so hard?

174
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,999
(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

175
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:06,999
Hey, Mom.

176
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,100
I'm at the clinic.

177
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,170
What?

178
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,769
Where did he go?

179
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,239
Oh, gosh.

180
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,779
- Hey, my goodness.
- Yes, how did it go?

181
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:26,019
He's not in the building.

182
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,320
Oh, no. Where did he go?

183
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:30,489
My goodness.

184
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,259
No Ah!

185
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,759
- What do I do?
- Audrey!

186
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:39,259
Audrey, is he not over there?

187
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,200
- He's not there.
- Goodness. Where has he gone?

188
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,200
Let's go that way.

189
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Okay.

190
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:46,540
No Ah!

191
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,009
No Ah!

192
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,170
- Mom! Is he not here?
- Hey!

193
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,279
No.

194
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,109
I searched all the playgrounds
in the area but couldn't find him.

195
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,249
Oh, dear.
Where on earth has he gone?

196
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,019
- What should we do?
- Gosh, keep it together.

197
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:00,749
- No Ah!
- What do we do?

198
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:07,859
My gosh.

199
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:16,129
Hey, Eom Hong Dan.

200
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,040
Have you always been
this wishy-washy?

201
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,540
Is it a yes or a no?

202
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,470
You have to make up your mind.

203
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,680
Were you such a passive woman...

204
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,810
who waits for a man
to ask you to stay?

205
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,749
No, I'm not.

206
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,249
Goodness gracious.

207
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:40,090
But what if he doesn't need me?

208
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:42,430
What if he's just fine...

209
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,759
without me?

210
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,129
What if he's really
going back to her...

211
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:50,100
to live happily together?

212
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:54,340
Mom.

213
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,869
Mom.

214
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,659
No!

215
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,590
Oh, no!

216
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,979
Hey!

217
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,479
Are you crazy?

218
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,609
You nearly scared me to death!

219
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,249
My gosh.

220
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,249
Why, this woman...

221
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:40,680
Hey! How dare you
point your finger at her?

222
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,759
If this woman and that boy
were hurt in any way,

223
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,359
I won't let you get away with it.
Got it?

224
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,700
Gosh, what a nuisance.

225
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:08,180
It's okay. Everything is okay now.

226
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
It's okay.

227
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,659
You called Mother and Father, right?

228
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Yes.

229
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,470
I told them we found him...

230
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:31,040
and that we'd be home
after I calmed him down a bit.

231
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,310
Gosh, what an unexpected scare.

232
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:37,409
Well...

233
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:39,739
He did show up like a bolt
out of the blue,

234
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,109
so I guess this isn't that weird.

235
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,350
Hey, Hong Dan.

236
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:46,649
What?

237
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,790
Why did you stop by my clinic?

238
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,960
I mean...

239
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,830
Is it so weird for a pregnant woman
to go to an OB-GYN clinic?

240
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,290
It is weird.

241
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,060
You should go to a different clinic
since we're splitting up.

242
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,800
I think I'm being weird too.

243
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,970
You just found out you're weird?

244
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
What did you say, punk?

245
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,639
You know,

246
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,639
I thought leaving you...

247
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,279
was how I was supposed
to atone for what I did to you.

248
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,920
Well, in a way,

249
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,850
I didn't want to hurt you
in any other way.

250
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,649
If you have to keep seeing
someone you can't stand,

251
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,359
it'll only infuriate you.

252
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,060
When did I say...

253
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,690
What?

254
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,960
When did I say...

255
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,129
to leave forever?

256
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,600
Did I tell you to leave me for good?

257
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:40,639
Hong Dan.

258
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,409
What is all this
about atoning and hurting me?

259
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:44,810
Do you think
you're a judge or something?

260
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,779
And what about Ssook Ssook?

261
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,550
And what about me, you jerk?

262
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:54,019
Sorry.

263
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:56,649
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,019
You...

265
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,659
Stick right by my side for life.

266
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:01,759
Don't go anywhere.

267
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,399
That's your atonement.

268
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,930
Okay? That's your life sentence.

269
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,019
Son.

270
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,619
Mom, Dad hugged that woman.

271
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,759
What?

272
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,830
Did he do that in front of you?

273
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,759
Yes, they were fighting
in front of me.

274
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,970
She said, "You jerk,"
but then they hugged.

275
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,970
Goodness.

276
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,940
Hey, didn't he say
that he found the kid earlier?

277
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,979
Why aren't they home yet?

278
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,019
Well, Gong Boo did say something
on the phone,

279
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,450
but I couldn't understand
what he was saying at all.

280
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,920
My gosh. Should we go back out
to look for him?

281
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,389
- What?
- No, let's wait for now.

282
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,790
He said he'd be home.

283
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,259
We're here!

284
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,330
Gosh, No Ah!

285
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,529
I'm home.

286
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,499
My goodness.

287
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,499
So... Mother.

288
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,840
Have you been well?

289
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
My gosh.

290
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,550
Oh, dear.

291
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,420
My goodness.

292
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,290
I put you through so much trouble,
didn't I?

293
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,060
Oh, boy.

294
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,330
I should have taken
better care of him.

295
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,600
Oh, you know
all sorts of things can happen...

296
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,399
when you raise a child.

297
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,710
I think he followed someone
who looked like his mom.

298
00:15:57,909 --> 00:15:59,479
I'm so glad you found him.

299
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,810
Thank you for your call.

300
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:03,909
All right.

301
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,249
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

302
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,389
Thank goodness they found No Ah.

303
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,129
It states that you will give up...

304
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:19,659
all of your rights
regarding Dan Soo.

305
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,869
Even after
the chairwoman passes away,

306
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,899
you cannot exercise
any rights whatsoever.

307
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,109
You thought you could use money
to control me?

308
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:34,580
I won't let you
do this to me again, ever.

309
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,710
I will not let you.

310
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,389
It states that she'll give up
all of her rights regarding Dan Soo.

311
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:54,970
I gave her some cash,
on the condition that she signs it.

312
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
Did she just quietly accept it?

313
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,840
I left a bag full of cash
at her shop.

314
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:03,940
We should make sure
she can never show up...

315
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,310
in front of Dan Soo again
because she's too ashamed.

316
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,279
To Dan Soo, she's just...

317
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,379
the woman who abandoned her son
and ran off for money.

318
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,450
Even if she starts
hovering around Dan Soo again,

319
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:16,590
keep reminding her of that.

320
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,119
She is a mother after all,

321
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:23,159
so she won't be able to rub salt
into his wound.

322
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:24,730
Right.

323
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,369
I'll be sure to find out
her new address when she moves.

324
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:30,570
Anyway, I wonder...

325
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,770
where Dan Soo is now.

326
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,969
Why isn't he coming home?

327
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,840
I can't even reach him.

328
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,580
I guess he has decided
to take a long trip.

329
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,790
I mean,
I have a thing called shame too.

330
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,100
I can't bring myself to ask you
to live with him again.

331
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,699
But No Ah too?
Are you sure you'll be all right?

332
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,699
What can I do?

333
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,169
He says he can't even live
for a minute without me.

334
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:11,379
What?

335
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,550
No Ah will live with us at my place.

336
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,379
We came to get his things.

337
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:24,119
My gosh. It must've been
a difficult decision.

338
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,359
Will you really be okay?

339
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,230
Ms. Eom.

340
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:31,159
I mean, Hong Dan.

341
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,230
What can I do?

342
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:36,429
When I think of Gong Boo,
I feel so...

343
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,740
I feel so bad for him.

344
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,609
He really can't live without me.

345
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:46,580
If he drinks every day
because he misses me,

346
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,010
his liver will be so damaged.

347
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,550
And what if he falls into depression
from being unable to see me?

348
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,750
They say depression
is more dangerous than cancer.

349
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,820
Right.

350
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,290
Without me,

351
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,459
his life will turn
into a total mess, you know?

352
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,889
When I think about that,

353
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:06,030
I feel so anxious.

354
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,270
My goodness.
This pitiful man needs me.

355
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,070
I have to stay by his side
at all times and take care of him.

356
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:16,169
That's right.

357
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:20,609
I see. Then what about your life,
Hong Dan?

358
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:28,490
The truth is, I've realized
I can't live without him either.

359
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:34,119
Now, I get scared
when I have to sleep alone.

360
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,429
I feel so alone
with no one sleeping next to me.

361
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,899
I feel cold.

362
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:41,159
You know.

363
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Me too.

364
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,399
- Hong Dan.
- Gong Boo.

365
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,639
Why am I so cold these days?
Seriously.

366
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:51,709
Because I was gone.

367
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:53,639
- I'll keep you warm.
- Okay.

368
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,449
- Okay, that's enough.
- Goodness.

369
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,550
I'm off. I'm about to barf.

370
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,219
- Honestly...
- Hurry up and go home.

371
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:03,389
Yes.

372
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:06,159
Dad.

373
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,830
Stop staring at them.

374
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,129
My gosh, I feel hot now.

375
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:24,109
Hey, Gong Hee.

376
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,439
What were you going
to say to me earlier?

377
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,050
What?

378
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,649
You came to the shop and said
you had something to tell me.

379
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:32,649
What is it?

380
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,090
Why? Do you want to quit your job?

381
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:39,959
Well...

382
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,859
You've been looking
pretty stressed out,

383
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,560
so I saw it coming.

384
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:46,560
If it's that stressful,
you should just quit.

385
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,830
What can you do?

386
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,770
You can always find another job.

387
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,199
The thing is...

388
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,510
I know it won't be easy
to find another job,

389
00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:00,310
but no job is worth your health.
Do not ruin your health.

390
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,679
I don't want that either.

391
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:07,350
Oh, boy. Now, I can be relieved
about your brother's situation.

392
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,919
I was so worried and stressed
for the past few days.

393
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,619
I have multiple canker sores now.

394
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,919
It must be so hard for you.

395
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,159
Don't even get me started.

396
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,659
I thought I'd be able to...

397
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,399
just relax and travel
when you guys were all grown up.

398
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:20,760
Travel, my foot.

399
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,730
Relax? I wish.

400
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,699
These days,
I want to quit being a mom.

401
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,740
You wandered around,
looking for No Ah earlier.

402
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,209
Go inside and get some sleep.

403
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,580
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

404
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,129
Oh, boy.

405
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,699
I'm going to marry her soon.

406
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,740
We're getting married in a month.

407
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,379
Please...

408
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,649
don't ruin Min Gi's future.

409
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,179
You said you couldn't stay
by my side as a friend.

410
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,649
You're right. I can no longer
be friends with you either.

411
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,889
Let's just be strangers...

412
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,189
as if we never knew each other.

413
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,030
Do you really mean that?

414
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,899
What you just said.

415
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,869
I'm asking if you really meant it.

416
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,709
Why would I lie to you?

417
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
No.

418
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,709
I lied.

419
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:44,750
I said I was okay
and that I could hold out on my own.

420
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,350
I also said
we should just be strangers,

421
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,820
but they were all lies.

422
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:51,490
Where are you?

423
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,760
Show up again like magic,
Gu Dan Soo.

424
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,830
Dan Soo...

425
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:19,949
It's me, Min Gi's mother.

426
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:22,750
Yes, go ahead.

427
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,290
Why haven't you called me?

428
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,820
I thought you got my message.

429
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,760
I did not change my mind,

430
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:33,300
and I will not change my mind
about this matter.

431
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:36,669
So?

432
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,740
Are you saying you'll keep the baby?

433
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:41,139
Yes.

434
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:42,609
Hey.

435
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,740
Are you determined
to ruin my son's future?

436
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:49,280
No, I do not hold
any hard feelings against him.

437
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:52,280
And I'm sure this decision
won't ruin my future...

438
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,280
or my baby's future.

439
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,149
I will protect my baby and myself.

440
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,159
You're unbelievably reckless.

441
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,389
Is that how your mom taught you?

442
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,030
That's right.

443
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,929
I'll live my life
the way my mom taught me to.

444
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:12,600
She taught me
to always follow my heart.

445
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,840
She taught me...

446
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,439
to do what I think is important,
no matter what anyone says.

447
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,139
My goodness. How dare you
talk back to me like this?

448
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,850
Hey, I explained everything...

449
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,649
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

450
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Hey.

451
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,919
Hey!

452
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,889
- My gosh.
- It's still early. Who was that?

453
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:34,889
It was nothing important.

454
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,330
When do you want...

455
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,959
to meet Ji Na's parents
to discuss the wedding?

456
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:44,730
Are you really going to
push ahead with the wedding?

457
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,639
Yes, we should meet her parents.

458
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:49,169
Tell Ji Na to pick a date
that works for them.

459
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:50,810
We'll work around
their schedule, okay?

460
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Okay.

461
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:59,719
What am I supposed to say
to Chairwoman Hwang, then?

462
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,619
You don't need to say anything.
I'll take care of it.

463
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:08,020
Dan Soo is still away,

464
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,159
so she is already very upset.

465
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,030
If she hears that
Ms. Kang is marrying you,

466
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,330
she'll collapse.

467
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,330
She will find out eventually.

468
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,240
By the way,

469
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:24,169
Ji Na didn't say anything else,
did she?

470
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,439
No, she didn't say anything else.
What are you talking about?

471
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,780
Nothing. Don't mind me
if she said nothing else.

472
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,219
Eat up.

473
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,020
Here. Eat up, honey.

474
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:36,520
If Myung Ja finds out
about the situation,

475
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,820
will she want her daughter
to marry Min Gi?

476
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:44,659
No. Knowing her,
she'd never make such a choice.

477
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,359
Kang Myung Ja.

478
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,830
Yes, you should stop your daughter.

479
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,639
Hey, Min Gi.

480
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Oh, really?

481
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,750
Then I'll have my parents
decide when to meet.

482
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,550
By the way, Min Gi...

483
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,619
Did you perhaps...

484
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:10,750
hear anything from Gong Hee?

485
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,090
From Gong Hee?

486
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:14,889
No, about what?

487
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,060
Oh, it's nothing.

488
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:19,429
That's weird.

489
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:21,000
Mom asked me something similar.

490
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,570
Everyone keeps asking me
if I've heard anything.

491
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:26,669
Anyway, I'll see you later at work.

492
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:32,080
This wedding...

493
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,480
has to happen sooner,

494
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,810
before Min Gi finds out.

495
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,820
Oh, hello.

496
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,490
I was wondering
if our wedding invitations were ready yet.

497
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,359
Could you put a rush on those?

498
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,510
Momo, don't worry.

499
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:05,179
We will be happy, no matter what.

500
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,139
Let's have a good day today!

501
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:21,730
Let's talk.

502
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,800
What do you need to talk to me about
this early in the morning?

503
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,230
It's about your daughter.

504
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,500
My daughter? Gong Hee?

505
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,040
What about Gong Hee?

506
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,540
Why won't you say anything?

507
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,109
What about my Gong Hee?

508
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,340
(My Merry Marriage)

509
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,740
You said the kid was smart.

510
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,609
- You said he was a very good boy.
- Neener.

511
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:16,709
Why, that...

512
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:18,250
What do you plan to do now?

513
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,679
Did you think I wouldn't know?

514
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,820
That child is Min Gi's.

515
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,619
I can't keep putting it off.

516
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,219
I'll get down on my knees
and ask Audrey for forgiveness.

517
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,889
I will ask you one last time...

518
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:31,560
whether you could come
to the finale of the fashion show.

519
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,929
Will you come, Holly?

520
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,330
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
