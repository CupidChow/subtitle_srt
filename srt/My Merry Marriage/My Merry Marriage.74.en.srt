1
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,269
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,549
(Episode 74)

3
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,950
Was this what you meant
when you asked me to let you...

4
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,190
stay by his side for three months?

5
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:36,989
How cunning you are.

6
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,289
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,890
I won't say anything to Dan Soo.

8
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,059
I'm just here as a neighbor.

9
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,570
If you're close enough
with that family...

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,669
to visit their home,

11
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:51,399
you must know
what Dan Soo is thinking now too.

12
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,639
If you're still his mother,
you should try to stop him.

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,239
You should stop him
in any way possible.

14
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,309
I also don't want Dan Soo...

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,379
to make this kind of choice.

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,150
Of course, you shouldn't.

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,790
Whose fault was it
that Dan Soo lost his father?

18
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,660
Whose fault was it
that I lost my son?

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,660
Dan Soo is...

20
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:16,629
my son.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,359
I care about him more than anyone.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,669
Ms. Audrey.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,109
What was all that about?

24
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:29,740
Why are you talking about Dan Soo?

25
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:31,409
Gong Hee.

26
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,519
Oh, dear.

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,820
I trust you'll make sure
Dan Soo won't ruin his future.

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,820
And make sure
she keeps her lips sealed.

29
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,120
I'm giving you time to do that.

30
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,529
Oh, no! Ms. Audrey.

31
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,279
My gosh.

32
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:14,320
Are you all right?

33
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,659
Gong Hee.

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,889
You heard everything, didn't you?

35
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:23,760
Yes.

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,960
But I don't understand
what's going on.

37
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,299
Why did you say
Dan Soo was your son?

38
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:34,639
The truth is,

39
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,839
I am Dan Soo's mother.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,579
What?

41
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,549
The day we moved to Kkotsan,

42
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,489
I left my little son, Dan Soo,

43
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:52,790
and ran away
before we even started to unpack.

44
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
It was me.

45
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,450
Please, Maeng Gong Hee.

46
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:23,190
Please say yes this time.

47
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,730
My mother-in-law...

48
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,070
started out as a mere worker
at a clothing factory...

49
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,070
and became a CEO.

50
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,940
She grew her company
with such strong determination,

51
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,010
so she is very ambitious...

52
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,149
and has big aspirations.

53
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:55,320
But...

54
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,660
in her eyes,

55
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,329
I was just someone
from a lowborn family.

56
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,160
And that's why
she was strongly against her son...

57
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,730
marrying me.

58
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,209
But Dan Soo's dad made the choice
to leave his mother to be with me.

59
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,480
Then Chairwoman Hwang...

60
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,179
hired people...

61
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,350
to look all over the country
for her son to bring him home.

62
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,089
After being on the run like that
for a while,

63
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:34,429
I eventually surrendered.

64
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,459
And I left.

65
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,159
If I kept living like that,

66
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:44,700
I thought I might ruin
Dan Soo's life and his dad's too.

67
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,240
So, I left.

68
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,779
My husband...

69
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,880
Dan Soo's dad...

70
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,719
lost his life
while trying to find me.

71
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,529
My love was...

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,729
what drove that man to his death.

73
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,240
If only I hadn't loved him...

74
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,740
If only he had left me,

75
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,409
I'm sure he wouldn't have...

76
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,610
lost his life like that.

77
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:35,750
Gong Hee,

78
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,159
please...

79
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,399
let Dan Soo go.

80
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,969
I can't let my Dan Soo
go through painful love...

81
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,769
as well.

82
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,180
I know the chairwoman better
than anyone.

83
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,320
Once she puts her mind to it,
she gets it done in the end.

84
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,719
No matter
how much you love each other...

85
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,019
or where you run off to,

86
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,990
you will never be able
to escape her.

87
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,860
If Dan Soo ends up like his dad,
then I...

88
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
I really...

89
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,670
I won't be able to go on living.

90
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,700
I've never been a good mom,

91
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:27,969
but my Dan Soo...

92
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,779
I want to stop Dan Soo
from living a sad life.

93
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,010
My Dan Soo...

94
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,479
My poor Dan Soo...

95
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,149
I want to protect him.

96
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,159
Help me, Gong Hee.

97
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,769
I'm asking you this
for your sake too.

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,339
I don't want you...

99
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,479
to have to experience this pain.

100
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,399
Gong Hee,

101
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,500
please let Dan Soo go.

102
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,570
I can't let my Dan Soo
go through painful love as well.

103
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,010
Painful...

104
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,050
love.

105
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,019
So, what is this about?

106
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,289
Dan Soo is the grandson
of the chairwoman of Jayce Fashion?

107
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,820
And the lady that came by earlier
is the chairwoman?

108
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,959
Without Gong Hee and Dan Soo,
we won't get any answers.

109
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,329
Hong Dan, you knew about this?

110
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Yes.

111
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,599
There was a big commotion recently.

112
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,010
He kept it a secret
from people at work too.

113
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:13,339
My gosh. That kid, Dan Soo,
is the chairwoman's grandson?

114
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:15,180
I mean, how does this make sense?

115
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,409
You know, Mom.

116
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,979
He used to be a snot-faced kid
in the neighborhood.

117
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,479
Dan Soo's dad...

118
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,690
went all across the country
looking for his mom,

119
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,389
leaving him in our care.

120
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,389
Then Dan Soo's dad was
the chairwoman's son, right?

121
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:32,659
We felt bad for the man,
thinking he lived a hard life,

122
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,729
so we even brought him
side dishes and stuff.

123
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,839
Goodness, did he have a love affair
of the century or something?

124
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,740
He was on the run
because of his mother's opposition.

125
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,010
My goodness.
What has Dan Soo ever done wrong?

126
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,409
That kid had to go through
so much hardship and struggle.

127
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:50,750
I must say, I'm jealous.

128
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:53,249
I mean, his grandma found him,

129
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,719
and he became her heir in the end.

130
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,249
But why did he leave home again?

131
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:58,989
If he just stayed there,
he would inherit the business,

132
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,719
and his life would be
smooth sailing.

133
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,160
Does he have something else
on his mind, perhaps?

134
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,800
What? My gosh. By the way,
Sleepwalker stepped out earlier.

135
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Why isn't she coming back in?

136
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,140
Where are you going, honey?

137
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:30,589
(Maeng Dumplings,
Tiffany Alterations)

138
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,910
Are you okay?

139
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,910
Mr. Maeng.

140
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,249
Come on.

141
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:02,849
What do I do, Mr. Maeng?

142
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,359
I've done...

143
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,359
something very mean.

144
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,229
What do you mean?

145
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,829
I told Gong Hee...

146
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,099
the whole truth.

147
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,509
Including the fact
that Dan Soo is my son.

148
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,810
I told her everything.

149
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,420
I think I know how Gong Hee feels.

150
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,119
I think she really likes Dan Soo.

151
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,320
But I...

152
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,129
I feel so bad.

153
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,700
Maeng Gong Hee! Get out here!

154
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,749
How many times
must I propose to you?

155
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:08,820
You'll say yes this time, right?

156
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,070
Maeng Gong Hee.

157
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,270
Maeng Ggong.

158
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,940
Marry me?

159
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,239
Marry me?

160
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,400
I threw away the ring
from when we were little too.

161
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,709
Do you think I'd consider something
we said as kids to be so important?

162
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,410
That was just a toy ring
from a capsule toy machine.

163
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,379
I know you don't mean that. Stop it.

164
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,879
Let's not do anything
we might regret.

165
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,249
Both of us.

166
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,499
Don't you know me at all?

167
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,859
How could I not know you?

168
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:29,930
Holly, the designer
who kept his identity a secret.

169
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,099
The heir of Jayce Fashion.

170
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,739
And a rude punk.

171
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,440
Snot Face, Gu Geon.

172
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,780
Is there something else
I should know?

173
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:40,879
Keep something else in mind.

174
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,749
I have no regrets.

175
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,579
Except for just one.

176
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,719
I'll regret it my whole life
if I let you go.

177
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,829
I'm...

178
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,959
going to marry Mr. Seo.

179
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,239
Are you serious?

180
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:11,339
Yes, I'm serious.

181
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,079
But Min Gi has no feelings for you.
You know that too.

182
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,450
I spoke with Mr. Seo.

183
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:22,050
He said
he would take responsibility.

184
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,790
And I've decided to accept his hand.
So, you should...

185
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,959
just stop.

186
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:04,629
Momo.

187
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,800
This is the right thing to do,
isn't it?

188
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
This is...

189
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,410
the best way, right?

190
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,369
Why are you refusing to go?

191
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,709
You asked for a fried egg,
so I made you one.

192
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,050
You wanted me
to read you this book, so I did.

193
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,180
What more do you want?
What's with this tantrum?

194
00:14:58,619 --> 00:14:59,619
I won't go.

195
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,550
My gosh, this is crazy.

196
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,719
I need to drop you off quickly
and go to work.

197
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,459
What is it? He doesn't want to go
to the daycare center again?

198
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,160
What? Wait.

199
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:11,259
Honey, do something.

200
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,859
Can you scold him?

201
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:15,300
I have to go. An emergency patient
is waiting for me.

202
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,329
Then what do I do?
Should I just take him to Mother?

203
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,640
My gosh. Even yesterday,
Mom seemed annoyed.

204
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,099
She said
to stop leaving him with her.

205
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:23,709
We can't keep asking her to babysit
when she has to work.

206
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,440
Then what am I supposed to do?

207
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,609
Seriously...

208
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,209
Gosh, that kid...

209
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:31,219
What? Hey.

210
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,790
Maeng No Ah, are you really
going to be like this?

211
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,920
Anyway, you can't leave No Ah alone.

212
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,920
- I have to go. Bye!
- What? Hey!

213
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,430
So, this is my problem now?

214
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,259
My gosh.

215
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,959
What do you want me to do?

216
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,570
I can't believe this.

217
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,170
So? You just brought him to work?

218
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,609
If Director Lee finds out,
he'll yell at you again.

219
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,540
What was I supposed to do?

220
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,109
I was already running late,

221
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:04,979
and he was refusing
to go to the daycare center.

222
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,150
The jerk called my husband...

223
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,820
ditched me as if this was
none of his business.

224
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Oh, boy.

225
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,520
Sweetheart, how old are you?

226
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,690
I'm five years old.

227
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,560
My gosh. He really is smart.

228
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,570
Hey, don't say that.

229
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:23,670
I'm afraid I might break my back...

230
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,339
while raising this boy.

231
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,570
Your husband's ex-wife sent you
this five-year-old boy.

232
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,839
This is huge.

233
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,849
You know what I'll do
if you tell others about this.

234
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,849
Yoo Ra, you'd better
keep your lips sealed. Okay?

235
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,619
Yes, of course.

236
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,300
Stay still, will you?

237
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,499
(Jayce Fashion
Brand Renewal Strategy Report)

238
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,290
Mr. Seo.

239
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:17,749
Yes, Gong Hee.

240
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,799
Well...

241
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,370
Would you like to...

242
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,569
come over to my house after work
to meet my parents?

243
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:36,110
Have you made up your mind
to marry me?

244
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,140
But I need you
to promise me something.

245
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,950
Okay, what is it?

246
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,080
I don't want you to marry me
just to take responsibility.

247
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:50,650
I hope you can approach the decision
with all sincerity from now on.

248
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,890
I don't want us to feel like
we're being forced to get married.

249
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,299
I understand how you feel, Gong Hee.

250
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,469
I'm not faking my feelings
toward you.

251
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,999
It's Momo.

252
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,009
I came up with the nickname.

253
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,239
I want to make a choice...

254
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,380
that won't make me feel ashamed
in front of Momo.

255
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:16,979
I will do my best...

256
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,749
to be a good father too.

257
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,069
Wait.

258
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,140
Are things really over between you
and Ms. Kang Ji Na?

259
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,340
I don't have to report to you
about such personal matters, Mr. Gu.

260
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,209
Whether it's about your feelings
or your wedding preparations,

261
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,549
I am asking if you've managed
to tie up all the loose ends.

262
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,549
You're the one who needs to move on.

263
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:55,749
What?

264
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,390
I will marry Maeng Gong Hee.

265
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,989
I will meet her family today.

266
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,459
So, stop interfering.

267
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,569
As her friend,

268
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,269
just stay quiet
and congratulate her.

269
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,299
Don't cross the line.

270
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,200
You two are longtime friends.

271
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,670
Nothing more than that.

272
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,330
I looked away once, and he vanished.

273
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,789
Where did he go?

274
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,830
Does he want to play
hide-and-seek or something?

275
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,269
What am I going to do
if Director Lee finds out?

276
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Oh, no.

277
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,969
- Oh, this...
- What's going on?

278
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,209
Pardon? What do you mean?

279
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,279
Just now, I saw you
walking around slowly like this.

280
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,610
Like this!

281
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,950
Did you drop something?

282
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:03,450
Don't tell me you misplaced
another confidential document!

283
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:07,160
My goodness. What do you mean?
When did I do such a thing?

284
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:08,830
There's nothing on the floor...

285
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
What?

286
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,330
My gosh.

287
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
What was that just now?

288
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Pardon?

289
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,039
Oh, well... It was a bug.

290
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,779
Now that it's warming up,

291
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,779
bugs are crawling out.

292
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,950
Something strange is going on today.

293
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,160
It felt oddly chaotic in the office.

294
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,130
And Yoo Ra was busy avoiding me
as if she had done something wrong.

295
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,700
Really? What's the matter with her?

296
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,100
Did she eat something wrong?

297
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,130
What? You keep turning around
to peek at something.

298
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:52,969
You're acting so suspicious.

299
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,299
You must be hiding something
behind you.

300
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,309
Stop!

301
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,809
What's suspicious?

302
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,080
Director Lee.

303
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,350
You're so on edge today. My gosh.

304
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,880
You're the one who seems
to be on edge today, Ms. Eom.

305
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:08,549
Move aside.

306
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:10,989
Well, there's nothing.

307
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,890
They are just some documents...
I mean, some tools.

308
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,959
Anyway, there's nothing important.

309
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,459
- Gosh, what's with you?
- What?

310
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,959
What? Why? Why are you... My gosh!

311
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:23,029
Oh, no.

312
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:27,539
My gosh, No Ah!

313
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,069
No Ah, hey. Go for it.

314
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:32,380
- No Ah, no. Don't do it.
- Here it comes.

315
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,080
Gosh, ouch!

316
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,709
- My back...
- Oh, no!

317
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,910
Look.

318
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
A bug.

319
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,289
There's a bug!

320
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,160
Oh, no. What do we do?

321
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,519
Oh, my goodness.

322
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Ms. Audrey.

323
00:21:58,069 --> 00:21:59,999
Hi, Gong Hee.

324
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,539
What brings you by?

325
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:06,880
I have a favor to ask.

326
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,850
The man I'm going to marry...

327
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,680
will come over to my house
to meet my family today.

328
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:21,390
So, you've made up your mind
to marry him.

329
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:23,459
Yes.

330
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,400
Would you be able to call Dan Soo...

331
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,029
and meet him somewhere outside
when that's going on?

332
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,370
I don't want him to see it.

333
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:37,469
Another man coming over to meet me,

334
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:39,680
to promise
to spend the rest of his life...

335
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,950
with me.

336
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,650
Gong Hee.

337
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,450
Also,

338
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,150
I hope
you can pluck up your courage.

339
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,959
If Dan Soo finds out later on
that he didn't recognize his mom...

340
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,819
when she was right in front of him,

341
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,360
he'll be utterly heartbroken.

342
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,430
Dan Soo is...

343
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,870
stronger than you think.

344
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,870
Be brave, Ms. Audrey.

345
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,049
- We're here!
- Hi!

346
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:21,650
Come on in.

347
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,219
You sound happy today.

348
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:24,789
Did something good happen?

349
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:25,789
Oh, boy.

350
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,259
There's this person
who was so mean to me.

351
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,789
We taught him a lesson today.

352
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,229
Right, No Ah?

353
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,430
Give me five! Yes!

354
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,900
What? You two share a secret now?

355
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,700
- What?
- What is it? Tell me.

356
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,140
We'll tell you later.

357
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,180
Oh, dear. Ssang Sook's son
is coming over to meet us.

358
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,809
I never imagined Jung Ssang Sook
and I would end up becoming in-laws.

359
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,279
I feel like
I'm living in a nightmare.

360
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,979
Hey, that's enough.

361
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:56,319
Stop saying that.
It'll stress out Gong Hee.

362
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,120
Gong Hee said she'd never marry him.

363
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,559
I don't understand
why she suddenly changed her mind.

364
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,090
Gong Hee made the right choice.

365
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,959
Give up on changing her mind.

366
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:08,100
You said you'd respect
Gong Hee's decision.

367
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,370
I know.

368
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,039
I know that,
but it's just so strange.

369
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,440
What if she made the wrong choice
for her parents' sake?

370
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,269
Come on, Mom.
Gong Hee would never do that.

371
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,779
She'd never do anything
to ruin her own life.

372
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:22,180
Even at work,

373
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,150
she held out for years
as a contract employee,

374
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,479
no matter what anyone said.

375
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,249
She's very smart when it comes
to stuff like that, so don't worry.

376
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,959
We're here.

377
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:35,229
Oh, yes. Hello, there you are.

378
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:36,759
Come on in.

379
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,600
This is...

380
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,569
Mr. Seo Min Gi.
He's here to meet you all.

381
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,469
Hello, I'm Seo Min Gi.

382
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:54,840
Goodness,
he looks more normal than I thought.

383
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:56,749
I came to see the guy...

384
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:58,209
who put my sister
through so much heartache.

385
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,120
You should stay out of this.

386
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,190
- Did I say something wrong?
- Come on.

387
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,190
Let's not stand around like this.
Have a seat.

388
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,489
I'm sure
we have a lot to talk about.

389
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:08,559
You should join us for dinner.

390
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,660
- Right.
- So...

391
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,259
I have something to tell you first.

392
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,269
Oh, what...

393
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:17,400
Oh, goodness.

394
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:19,569
Why are you doing this?

395
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:23,140
I know very well
that I caused much concern...

396
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,739
for Gong Hee and your family.

397
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,910
I will never...

398
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,910
make Gong Hee suffer again.

399
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,479
Can I trust you?

400
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,019
Yes, sir.

401
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,360
I will marry Gong Hee.

402
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Oh, my.

403
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:03,509
You're here.

404
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:07,120
Did Gong Hee ask you
to call me over?

405
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,450
To get me out of the house?

406
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,459
I know Min Gi went
to meet her family.

407
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,459
She must not have wanted me
to see it.

408
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,630
Dan Soo.

409
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:25,700
You should...

410
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,840
let Gong Hee go
with a smile on your face.

411
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,940
Letting someone go is
a type of love too.

412
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:37,209
Letting someone go is
a type of love?

413
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,049
I don't believe that.

414
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,519
I was...

415
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,090
simply abandoned.

416
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,400
Dan Soo.

417
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,400
Someone who has been abandoned...

418
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:02,469
is trapped in that fact for life.

419
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,009
Don't think like that.

420
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,110
How could you think
that you've been abandoned?

421
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,289
No one...

422
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,690
has abandoned you, Dan Soo.

423
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,459
You are...

424
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:27,700
hiding something from me,
aren't you?

425
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,140
I think it's strange.

426
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,870
You keep crying whenever you see me.

427
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:41,110
You have something to tell me,
don't you?

428
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,120
What is it?

429
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:03,330
(My Merry Marriage)

430
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,340
They say getting pregnant
before marriage is the trend.

431
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,940
I hear you're the Marketing Manager.

432
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,299
I guess you follow
all the newest trends.

433
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,709
Why do you keep saying
stuff like that?

434
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,309
I just wanted her
to meet someone decent...

435
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:13,880
and live without much trouble.

436
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,549
Is that too much for me to ask?

437
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,150
What's going on between you
and No Ah, all of a sudden?

438
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,650
He's such a smart little kid.

439
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,120
Are you really fine...

440
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,719
with leaving me behind here?

441
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,789
Look at me.
Look at me, Maeng Gong Hee.

442
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,989
