1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,290
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,930
I'm home.

3
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,230
What?

4
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,829
Hey.

5
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:30,829
(Episode 94)

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,230
Why did you come home alone?

7
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,970
I thought
you and Min Gi were eating out.

8
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,340
He went back to the office.

9
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:37,970
The office? Why?

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,239
I'm not sure.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,340
He said Chairwoman Hwang called him.

12
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,110
If he said so, it must be true.

13
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,049
Why did you say you weren't sure?

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,250
Seriously, I'm telling you.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,759
Min Gi does all the work
in that company.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,759
She gave her immature grandson
the executive director title...

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,530
and is making my son
do all the work.

18
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,129
My dear son will fall ill
at this rate.

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,329
Goodness. I should do something.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,030
I should get something healthy
and nutritious for Min Gi.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,869
Why are you all quiet?

22
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,579
Are you hurt that...

23
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,839
I'm only worried about my son
when you're pregnant?

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,650
Hey, you said your mom got you
carp extract or whatever.

25
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,449
I'm not hurt.

26
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,320
Seeing how worried you are
about your son...

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,160
takes a load off my chest.

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,190
Get something nice and healthy
for Min Gi, Mother.

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,900
My goodness.

30
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,509
"Mother, don't worry.
I'll get him something."

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,540
Shouldn't she say this?

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,009
My gosh. My skin feels so tight.

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,850
My skin is dehydrated.

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,050
Antiaging.

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,889
I should use the face mask
Ji Na gave me.

36
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,359
Oh, boy.

37
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,570
Come in and have a seat.

38
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:20,940
What do you want?

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,910
Keeping me in the palm of your hand?

40
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,650
I told you
I'd only wait for 30 minutes.

41
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,050
Why are you late?

42
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,020
- What?
- Seo Min Gi.

43
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,420
I want you.

44
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,219
I want nothing else.

45
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,499
You still have me
wrapped around your little finger.

46
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:49,999
I feel pathetic that
I'm letting you do this.

47
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,879
It proves that
you're still in love with me.

48
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,050
We can't help it.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,809
You shouldn't feel guilty.

50
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,650
We can't control our feelings.

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,020
Am I wrong?

52
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,610
- The village
- The village

53
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,920
- I miss the time
- I miss the time

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,089
- When I lived in that village
- When I lived in that village

55
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,659
Where are you?

56
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,529
Why aren't you even calling me?

57
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:49,999
Where are you, Mom?

58
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,740
Please tell me.

59
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,650
"My old hometown,
the village of flowers."

60
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,020
"I miss the time
when I lived in that village."

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,260
"Spring in My Hometown."

62
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,260
Mom's hometown.

63
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,400
Hometown.

64
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,779
Oh, dear. Hey, Myung Ja.

65
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,250
At the care home I visited today,
they said...

66
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,849
someone around Mother's age
came alone...

67
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,089
and asked about the fees and all.

68
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,330
Well...

69
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,130
I'll widen the search area
and keep looking for her,

70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,429
so don't worry too much.

71
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,419
Hey, why are you still up?

72
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,560
Were you with Chairwoman Hwang
until now?

73
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:23,929
Yes.

74
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,260
I should wash up.

75
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,700
Here.

76
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,969
Did you have wine?

77
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,710
Yes.

78
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,239
The chairwoman offered it to me.

79
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,080
The chairwoman offered you wine?

80
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,469
Ms. Kang, isn't this
a limited edition item this season?

81
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,070
How did you buy this?

82
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,979
I heard none of the boutiques
in Korea got these.

83
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,909
I got it through my mom.

84
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,880
Apparently, she thought of me
while she was in France.

85
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,679
You see, I really like this color.

86
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:25,219
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

87
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,159
It's so pretty.
It fits you perfectly.

88
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,589
- Do you think so?
- It's really pretty.

89
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,589
Oh, my.

90
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:34,299
My gosh.

91
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:51,549
Last night,

92
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,979
I watched the video
of when I took Mom to karaoke.

93
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,890
My mom's only favorite song...

94
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,349
is "Spring in My Hometown."

95
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:06,659
I realized that my mom was missing
her hometown that day too.

96
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,099
I should've listened to her
talk about her hometown that day.

97
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:13,969
What? Wasn't Kkotsan her hometown?

98
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
No.

99
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,909
I heard it was called Myeongwol.

100
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:20,169
She started living in Kkotsan...

101
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:21,510
once she got married.

102
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,779
When my mom talked about
her hometown,

103
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,810
her eyes would glisten with tears.

104
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,349
She missed the place where she used to run
and play with her sister.

105
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,020
That's how things were back then.

106
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,520
You couldn't go home...

107
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,589
just because you wanted to.

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,630
It was over once your daughter
left home to get married.

109
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,799
Goodness, they used to say...

110
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,359
married daughters
were no longer family.

111
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,299
Oh, right.

112
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,140
Mom's hometown.

113
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
What?

114
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,539
I should go there.

115
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,380
Myeongwol.

116
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:56,479
Oh, my.

117
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,909
I never thought to go
all the way to her hometown.

118
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,450
She wouldn't have gone somewhere
she had no connection to.

119
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,120
So, do you mean you'll go there
this instant?

120
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,190
Oh, I should go
after the large group order.

121
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,130
Gosh, do you think I'm saying this
because of customers?

122
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,169
I mean,
you shouldn't overwork yourself.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,739
Can't you leave it to Gyeong Tae?

124
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,599
Myung Ja.

125
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,609
My goodness.

126
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,679
My gosh.

127
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,080
How is it...

128
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,650
that he has gotten more gaunt
since getting married?

129
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,690
Other people say...

130
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,789
their sons' faces simply glow
in their newlywed phase,

131
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,929
as if they're wearing a sign
that says, "I'm happy."

132
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,299
I think he looks a lot better
after his wedding.

133
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,370
What are you going on about?

134
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,770
It's because I've been busy lately.

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,299
I'll take care of myself,
so don't worry too much.

136
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,110
Even yesterday,
you went out to have dinner,

137
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,010
but the chairwoman called you back
into the office.

138
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:04,409
What's wrong
with that chairwoman of yours?

139
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,279
Is your dad not enough?

140
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,520
She even orders you to come and go?

141
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,579
Why did she call you back in
when you'd left for the day?

142
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,020
What are you talking about?

143
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,590
The chairwoman was at home
last night.

144
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,590
She wasn't feeling well,

145
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,059
so I took her home early.

146
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,630
Well, I...

147
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,029
It wasn't Chairwoman Hwang.

148
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,370
I met with my contact at Heirmez.

149
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,370
It ran late because we were talking
with their headquarters in France.

150
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,939
Gong Hee said
the chairwoman had called you in.

151
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,049
So that's what I thought.

152
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,779
Were you mistaken?

153
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:41,980
How could you confuse such a thing?

154
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:44,590
That could happen.

155
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,620
Don't mind her, okay?

156
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,789
You're right.

157
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,230
It's hard to confuse such things.

158
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,159
I must've misheard.

159
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:06,909
- Here.
- Thanks.

160
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:11,449
Last night,

161
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,279
the chairwoman did call me.

162
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,079
So, I rushed to the office
but she wasn't there.

163
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,020
So, you rushed over
to your contact at Heirmez?

164
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,559
That's what happened.

165
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,799
They're being so nitpicky.

166
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,900
You can stop now.

167
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,470
Let's not talk about something
that will only tire us out.

168
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:13,510
Oh, my. You must not have gone
with my brother today.

169
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,840
We decided to split up
and search different areas today.

170
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,779
I see.
I'll bring you some dumplings.

171
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,179
- You should have a seat...
- That's not it.

172
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,319
So...

173
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,949
I have something to tell you,
Myung Ja.

174
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,289
Me?

175
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,590
Could you take a look at this?

176
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,130
(Namyangju Nursing Home,
Golden Senior Care Center)

177
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,529
(Spring Nursing Home,
Oasis Care Home)

178
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,539
What is this?

179
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,709
These are the places
where Gyeong Tae went...

180
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,470
to track your mother down
these past few days.

181
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:47,709
Oh, my.

182
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:51,150
Gyeong Tae went to
all of these places?

183
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,150
Yes.

184
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,480
Oh, my goodness.

185
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,650
He went to so many places that
Gyeonggi Province is covered in red.

186
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,329
I guess his detective skills
are still intact.

(Yeongwon Adult Daycare)

188
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,309
Gyeong Tae is really worried
about you, Myung Ja.

189
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,110
He wants to find your mother
as soon as possible...

190
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,049
to help take
the burden off your shoulders.

191
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,350
He has been skipping meals
to run around all day.

192
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,459
I was hoping you'd understand
how Gyeong Tae feels the least bit.

193
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,199
That's why
I wanted to tell you this.

194
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,029
From my perspective,

195
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,970
I feel so bad for him.

197
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,370
Then, I'll be on my way.

198
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,799
Hang on.

199
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,939
You should have some dumplings
before you go.

200
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,880
Once I find Myung Ja's mother,

201
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,610
I'll have ten servings then.

202
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,750
Gosh, ten servings is no big deal
once we find Myung Ja's mother.

203
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,049
I could even give you
100 or 1,000 servings.

204
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,720
But 100 or 1,000 servings...

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,860
Then I could eat dumplings for life.

206
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,860
For life?

207
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:18,130
Well, I guess I could serve you
dumplings for life.

208
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:19,500
You promised me.

209
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:27,370
Then, I'll be back, Myung Ja.

210
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,059
This is yours now, Mom.

211
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,789
What?

212
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:46,429
I bought this place.

213
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,230
Now, you don't have to pay rent.

214
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,630
You can do what you like,
for as long as you want.

215
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,140
But I haven't done anything for you.

216
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:05,549
I'm going to get everything
you owe me from now on.

217
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,079
You should be on your toes.

218
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,520
I'm going to act like a little kid.

219
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,689
Okay.

220
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,890
You can act like a kid now
since you never got to do that.

221
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
You can get annoyed with me...

222
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,260
and get sulky too.

223
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,900
Then,

224
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,429
will you nag me like other moms...

225
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,970
and scold me too?

226
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,510
Actually, I deserve
a good nagging about something.

227
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
What?

228
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,350
I skipped work today
and played hooky.

229
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,650
What?

230
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:42,819
Gosh, you can't do that.

231
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,090
I mean,
you're an executive director!

232
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,390
My mom's nagging...

233
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,789
sounds really nice.

234
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,130
Hey, don't worry about me.

235
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,860
Go to work now
before it's too late, okay?

236
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,500
Can't I just stay?

237
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,870
Come on. Get going already, son.

238
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,240
Okay, I'll be back.
See you in the evening.

I've always wanted
to do these things too,

Thank you for finding me.

245
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:45,409
Thanks so much.

246
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:01,959
Why are you staring at me like that?

247
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:06,900
I want to ask you something.

248
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,169
I have to step out for a meeting.

Hey, Ms. Eom's resignation letter...

251
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,490
must be in her drawer.
Open the drawer.

252
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,789
What's the matter, Director Lee?

253
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,199
She used up her vacation days
for her honeymoon.

254
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,929
Yesterday, she asked
to use her vacation days...

255
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,770
for next year up front,
and I kindly let her.

256
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Look.

257
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,140
Look at this.

258
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,909
Director Lee,
whom I admire and love.

259
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,380
It's cold these days.

260
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,079
You're in good health, right?

261
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm texting you because...

262
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,419
my son has a really bad cold,

263
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,750
so I unfortunately have to
stay home today.

264
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,260
I know everyone picks on me at work,

265
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,959
but I'm a mom at home.

266
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,130
Please understand my situation
just once more,

267
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,529
and I'll call you my savior
for the rest of my life.

268

269
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,870
Help me.

270
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,409
Oh, I guess
Ms. Eom's son is very sick.

271
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,510
When she's here tomorrow,

272
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,510
you can ask her
to explain what happened.

273
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,140
No, forget it!

274
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,850
Does she think
this place is a playground?

275
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,949
How could she ask for time off
every single day?

276
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,650
She said she had been writing
resignation letters every day.

277
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,090
I heard she had a collection of them
in her drawer.

278
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,489
I'll take them
to the HR department myself...

279
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,659
and let her go.

280
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,499
So, go ahead
and open her desk drawer.

281
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,860
Now!

282
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,999
- Please...
- What? Open it!

283
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,169
- Come on, Director Lee!
- What?

284
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,540
- Hey.
- Please...

285
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,570
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Let it slide just this once.

286
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,370
- My goodness!
- Oh, no.

287
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,469
Darn it!

288
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,140
You're so adorable.

289
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,409
Do you like the porridge
Mom made for you?

290
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,949
Wait, this is porridge?

291
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,550
Not cereal?

292
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,890
It is porridge.

293
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,820
But there are crunchy bits,
like cereal.

294
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,919
They're hard.

295
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,459
My goodness.
You're just like your dad.

296
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,759
You always have to be so blunt.
Goodness me.

297
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,699
Oh, boy. Director Lee
must be fuming mad again.

298
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:25,310
He'll chew me out again.

299
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:27,540
What am I supposed to do?

300
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,780
I'm the only one
who can look after No Ah now.

301
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,610
Weird Mommy.

302
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,219
You'll get chewed out because of me?

303
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,050
What?

304
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:40,719
No. No way.

305
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,489
I won't let anyone
chew me out for no reason.

306
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,290
You saw me that day, No Ah.

307
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,530
Thanks to your help,
I fought courageously like this...

308
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,530
and won.

309
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:50,759
That's right.

310
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,130
So, don't worry.

311
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,409
To me, nothing's more important
than you, No Ah.

312
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,249
I was torn between
my career and love...

313
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:06,850
back in my 20s.

314
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,550
Oh, boy. When did Eom Hong Dan
become a woman in her 40s,

315
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,419
who has to juggle work
and motherhood? My goodness.

316
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,620
Mom, I'm happy
we can play together at home.

317
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,890
What?

318
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,959
No Ah, do you know
what it means to be happy?

319
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,259
What does being happy mean?

320
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,669
It gives you that warm,
fuzzy feeling in the heart.

321
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,100
My gosh! You're such a sweetheart.

322
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:34,409
Yes, you're my love too.

323
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,509
Your mom, Eom Hong Dan,
will take care of those she loves...

324
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,509
and do a good job at work too,
you know?

325
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,350
I'll pull off everything,
no matter what.

326
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,380
No matter what.

327
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,479

I don't have any appointments
in the afternoon, do I?

330
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,090
No, do you want
to go home early today?

331
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,560
No Ah is sick. My wife is
looking after him alone at home.

332
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,499
Without the appointment
with the patient who's due soon,

333
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,530
I would've just stayed home too.

334
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,169
Anyway, let's call it a day.

335
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,340
- Okay, sure.
- Thank you for everything.

(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

337
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,509
Goodness.

338
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,219
What's up?
Why are you calling me again?

339
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,880
It's about No Ah, obviously.

340
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,590
You must've heard about yesterday.

341
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:22,560
I treated him.

342
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,959
His fever broke,

343
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,759
but he should be careful
for the next few days.

344
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,300
Observe him closely.
If his symptoms come back,

345
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,729
bring him back to the clinic.

346
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,100
Okay, whatever.

347
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,229
I heard you loud and clear, Doctor.

348
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:35,570
But even if he's sick as a dog,

349
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,340
I won't take him to the clinic
where you work, so hang up now.

350
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:39,909
Where's that woman?

351
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,179
Is she with No Ah now?

352
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,749
And why are you curious about that?

353
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,320
I'm asking just in case.

354
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:50,780
She went on about
how she is No Ah's mom now,

355
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,620
so she'd better not leave him alone
and go to work.

356
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,290
If you keep this up,
karma will get you.

357
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,560
I don't really care what you think,

358
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,189
but Hong Dan is No Ah's mom now.

359
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,100
You're just the selfish woman...

360
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,360
who abandoned No Ah
and moved to the US alone.

361
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,300
Don't call me again.

362
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,479
(Han Internal Medicine Clinic)

363
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,090
Hang in there.

364
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,019
I need a little more time.

365
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,360
Let's shut down
the Holly project now.

366
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,269
What do you mean?

367
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,370
You want to shut it down
when it's going so well?

368
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,870
You have achieved enough
by selling Holly's name.

369
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Drop the project and call it quits.

370
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,050
Min Gi's collaboration
with Heirmez...

371
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,050
will be the main project
of our next season.

372
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,650
Thank you
for putting your trust in me.

373
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,689
But Mr. Gu and Gong Hee...

374
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,459
have been working
on the Holly project.

375
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,659
What will happen to them, then?

376
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,229
Well, nothing will happen.

377
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,400
They should help you.

378
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
Why?

379
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,570
Is there someone specific
you want to work with?

380
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,969
I'll give you who you want, Min Gi.

381
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:22,340
I'll think about it
and let you know, ma'am.

382
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,009
All right. You can go.

383
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,689
Treating me like this...

384
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:36,620
Don't you think it's childish?

385
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:39,759
I know what you're doing.

386
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,429
You're trying to punish me
for rebelling against you.

387
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,630
So, you know everything,
yet you still have something to say?

388
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,870
When you defended your mom
in front of me,

389
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,439
you should've known I'd do this.

390
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,169
I do know everything now.

391
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:54,040
Everything you told me about Mom.

392
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,780
It was all a lie.

393
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,709
I know Mom would never abandon me
for money.

394
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,120
Keeping your mom close
won't do you any good.

395
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,390
That woman got Hae Joon killed.

396
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,519
That's a fact.

397
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,929
So?

398
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,659
Are you trying to single me out
at work?

399
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,969
By blatantly taking Min Gi's side?

400
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,300
I think I understand
why Dad kept running away from you.

401
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,509
I get it now.

402
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,310
What?

403
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,080
He was sick of putting up...

404
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,580
with your overbearing approach
to everything.

405
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:38,590
Go ahead and do what you want,
Grandma.

406
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:40,989
I'll figure things out on my own...

407
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:42,989
and find my own way.

00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,110
(Executive Director's Office)

409
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:02,409
Hey.

410
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,679
Did the meeting go well?

411
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,679
What did Chairwoman Hwang say?

412
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,719
Our project is getting
good feedback,

413
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,019
so she must be pleased.

414
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:14,790
But Mr. Gu and Gong Hee...

415
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,659
have been working
on the Holly project.

416
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:17,959
What will happen to them, then?

417
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,229
Hey, what's wrong?

418
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,630
Did something happen?

419
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,330
Why do you...

420
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:29,100
work so hard?

421
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,469
What?

422
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,439
I'm suddenly curious.

423
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,040
Now that you've achieved your goal
of getting a permanent position,

424
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,179
you can take it easy for a while,

425
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,449
but you always work so hard.

426
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,249
Isn't it stressful?

427
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,320
It is, of course.

428
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,219
But I...

429
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,689
truly enjoy my job as a designer.

430
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,929
We make clothes
for other people, you know.

431
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:56,759
I design clothes...

432
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,600
while hoping
they'd make people happy...

433
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,330
when they wear them.

434
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,140
The process makes me feel useful,

435
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,900
and I feel like it helps me
become a better person.

436
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,310
So, I'm happy.

437
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,009
So happy that
I can forget all the stress.

438
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:13,449
Hey.

439
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:15,919
You're acting so weird today.

440
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,390
Why would you suddenly ask me
such a question?

441
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,959
Did you get into an argument
with the chairwoman or something?

442
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,590
About what?

443
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,360
Everything is smooth sailing.

444
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,669
So, please keep working hard,
Designer Maeng.

445
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:35,669
What?
You made me nervous for no reason.

446
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,469
That thing you cherish so much.

447
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:41,169
I'll be sure to keep it safe.

448
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,280
I will change Grandma's mind,
no matter what it takes.

449
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,979
Don't you worry, Maeng Gong Hee.

450
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,489
We don't have a patient
named Im Sun Yi.

451
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,219
You said she was your mother, right?

452
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,360
She disappeared without a word?

453
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,860
You must be so worried.

454
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,100
I'm sure you'll find her.

455
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,870
Thank you.

456
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,979
When I die,

457
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,380
I want to become a cloud.

458
00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:28,659
I could go here and there...

459
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,659
without a care in the world.

460
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,400
I could see my daughters, sons,
and grandkids.

461
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,169
I'll be there quietly...

462
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,140
so the kids won't have to worry
about me.

463
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,540
Just like that,
so I'm not a burden to them.

464
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,880
I want to wander around freely.

465
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,219
(We're waiting
for seniors to join us.)

466
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,890
She'll get a call once I die anyway.

467
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,860
Why does she keep looking for me?

468
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,229
I left after buying
my own burial gown.

469
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:47,370
Why are you looking for me,
Myung Ja?

470
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,880
I will take my ill body with me
until the end.

471
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,050
This is my wish, Myung Ja.

472
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,090
Please don't cry.

473
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:13,189
If you cry,

474
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:18,570
your mom's heart aches
as if it's being torn to shreds.

476
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,040
Oh, goodness. Myung Ja.

477
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,979
Please find my mom.

478
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:34,409
All right.

479
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:37,080
It will never end
if I only have suspicions.

480
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,419
- I must...
- I need to ask you something.

481
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,390
What could it be? I'm dying to know.

482
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,759
I guess
Seo Min Gi has done something wrong.

483
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
What is it?

484
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,860
What did he do wrong...

485
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,600
that you're here with a gloomy face?

486
