1
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,490
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,160
(Episode 90)

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,169
I can't...

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,230
live with you.

5
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,510
I can't live with you anymore!

6
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,750
I asked you to visit my mom with me,

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,090
but you left a note and went out.

8
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,119
And what? You were out
looking for Audrey until this hour?

9
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,829
I had a situation.

10
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,630
I was going to go to Kkotsan
and join you later.

11
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,570
If it was your plan
to join me later,

12
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,299
why didn't you call me once all day?

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,969
Myung Ja.

14
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,079
Let go! You make me sick.

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,149
What am I to you?

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,250
Just someone you live with?

17
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,350
Even if that were the case,

18
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,689
you shouldn't do this to me.

19
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,189
You made me suffer
for dozens of years.

20
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,590
How could you do this?
How dare you do this to me?

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,030
My mom...

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,959
left a letter...

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,299
and vanished.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,000
Mother vanished?

25
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,010
What do you mean?

26
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,109
Grandma is gone?

27
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,409
Oh, no. What do we do?

28
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,980
What should we do?

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,090
She prepared her own burial dress...

30
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,959
and her children's mourning clothes.

31
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:04,790
She left a letter...

32
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,459
telling us not to look for her
and disappeared.

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,230
She cleaned out her place...

34
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:12,870
and won't even answer her phone.

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,140
I spent the whole day...

36
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,370
checking all the care homes
near Kkotsan to look for her.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,209
Care homes?

38
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,250
Why would Mother go to a care home?

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,650
I bet she felt...

40
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,520
that we couldn't afford
to take care of her.

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,789
She must've felt like
she had no one to rely on.

42
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,289
She didn't want
to be a burden to us,

43
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,889
so she prepared
for her own funeral...

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,860
and left to get ready
to die all alone.

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,530
When I think about that,

46
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,370
I can't even breathe!

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,509
But you...

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,349
You went around looking for Audrey?

49
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,120
Does she mean that much to you?

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,819
To the point
that you had to ignore...

51
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,520
your family and everything else
to find her?

52
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,189
My goodness. I can't believe this.

53
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,960
Why didn't you call me?

54
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,330
I will find my mom.

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,469
You can go and look for Audrey.

56
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,900
From now on, I won't care
who you have to look for...

57
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,199
and why you have to find them.

58
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,110
I don't care.
It's none of my concern.

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,870
I won't even be curious,

60
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,979
so do as you please.
Do whatever you want.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
I will look for places
where Mother might be.

62
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,979
Forget it!

63
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,349
I...

64
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,389
stopped having
expectations of you...

65
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,360
ages ago.

66
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,330
Looking after the family...

67
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,800
has always been my duty.

68
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,569
Worrying about the family,

69
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:54,400
taking care of your parents
and siblings,

70
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,669
and worrying...

71
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,310
about my mom too.
It was always on me.

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,210
I have no energy left
to be angry at you.

73
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,419
You...

74
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,050
Get out...

75
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,650
of my life.

76
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,599
Will Mother and Father be all right?

77
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,270
What's going on?

78
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,900
What does she mean Grandma vanished?

79
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,939
- Goodness, what do we do?
- Oh, no.

80
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,439
Get closer.

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,509
- Oh, my.
- That scared me.

82
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,509
My goodness.

83
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,889
Gyeong Tae,
why aren't you going after her?

84
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:55,360
Mother seemed furious.

85
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
Seriously, Dad. What's with you?

86
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,370
Mom has put up with you
for long enough.

87
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,170
Even if Mom wants
to split up with you,

88
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,170
I understand.

89
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,250
I need to go and see my family.

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
At this hour?

91
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,519
Grandma's gone.

92
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,420
Grandma? How come?

93
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,050
I don't really know yet.

94
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,660
I should go now to find out
and be there for my mom.

95
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,360
Well, I'd like to go with you,

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,959
but I have work to finish off.

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,800
Right, I'll go alone.

98
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,129
Take a taxi.

99
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,600
Was that a blind date?

100
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,699
Yes.

101
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,500
The marriage talks with Jayce Group
have gone out the window,

102
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,910
so my mom is looking
for other options.

103
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,079
You know my mom never gives up.

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,110
But that guy was a no-go.

105
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:21,649
Look for someone else.

106
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,949
I have no plans
to look for someone else.

107
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,589
I was simply curious to see
what kind of face you'd make...

108
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,389
if you were to see it.

109
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,689
Will you really be okay with me...

110
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,000
marrying someone else?

111
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,370
Will you not waver
even for a second?

112
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,769
I wanted to find out.

113
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,300
Don't get the wrong idea.

114
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,569
I only stepped in
because it was painful to hear that.

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,209
I was hoping you'd waver.

116
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,750
Did you?

117
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,490
Did you regret
breaking up with me...

118
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,389
even for a split second?

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,529
Even if I did,

120
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,769
it'd be wrong to feel that way.

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,100
It only lasted for a moment.

122
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,899
A fleeting emotion.
It's nothing more than that.

123
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,870
So, you did waver.

124
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,540
It means nothing.

125
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,810
Don't put it like that.

126
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,449
Seo Min Gi, I know...

127
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,250
how you feel now.

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,490
Everything has gone wrong.

129
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,120
All of it.

130
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:40,959
We must fix everything.

131
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,529
What excuse must I make...

132
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,699
for you to stop pushing me away?

133
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,310
I have to go.

134
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,750
Myung Ja.

135
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,790
What do you mean Mom disappeared?

136
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,819
Tell us the details. Come on.

137
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,819
Myung Ja. You're joking, right?

138
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,060
What are we going to do
about Mom now?

139
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,500
I think Mom...

140
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,269
has admitted herself
to a care home...

141
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:53,970
all by herself, without telling us.

142
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,340
I had a bad feeling...

143
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,769
but didn't give her a call.

144
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,639
I was busy with my own life.

145
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,049
I was all over the place,
taking care of my kids.

146
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,549
I had no idea Mom was thinking
of doing such a thing.

147
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,450
What do I do?

148
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,789
What am I going to do...

149
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:12,990
if Mom passes away like this?

150
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,059
Calm down.

151
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,789
Have you checked the care homes
in Kkotsan?

152
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,799
I have but couldn't find her.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,330
Hey, I'm scared.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,740
What if we suddenly get a call
that Mom has passed away?

155
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,769
Myung Ja,
why would you say such a thing?

156
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,779
Mom will be fine.

157
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,909
You know Mom would never
leave us that easily.

158
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,820
Myung Ja, you should check
other care homes in the area.

159
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,389
I'll look into it too.

160
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,559
Mom...

161
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,389
While Mom was preparing
for her own funeral alone,

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,860
why did I not know about it?

163
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,429
Mom must've been...

164
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,669
terribly lonely all by herself.

165
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,110
It's not your fault, Myung Ja.

166
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,080
Don't beat yourself up.
Pull yourself together.

167
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,049
We should find Mom, right?

168
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:20,750
I'll search more places
and let you know.

169
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,120
(Maeng Dumplings)

170
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,429
Mom.

171
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,799
Why did you come here at this hour?

172
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,100
Mom...

173
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,289
Dad.

174
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,200
Mom's back.

175
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,870
Hey, are you okay?

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,470
Oh, boy.

177
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:14,909
Dad.

178
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,750
I heard you went fishing again
when Mom wanted you...

179
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,279
to visit Grandma with her.

180
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,080
Goodness. No, I didn't go fishing.

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
I...

182
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,419
asked him to do me a favor.

183
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,159
I'll explain everything to Ms. Kang.

184
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,309
Mom.

185
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,909
Dan Soo had asked Dad
to look for Ms. Audrey.

186
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,110
I asked...

187
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,509
for Mr. Maeng's help.

188
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
She is...

189
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,620
my mom, after all.

190
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,789
Like you said, Ms. Kang.

191
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,629
She was my mom while she was here.

192
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:09,259
That was why I wanted to find her.

193
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,799
I must find her because
I still have questions for her.

194
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,909
I didn't know where to begin
to look for her by myself,

195
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,879
so I asked Mr. Maeng for help.

196
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,649
After all,
he used to be a detective.

197
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,179
If there was a misunderstanding,

198
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,149
please scold me instead.

199
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,220
Why would I scold you?

200
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,690
I totally understand
why you did that.

201
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,129
My husband always
went out of his way to help Audrey.

202
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,299
He did?

203
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,700
Those two must share some secrets
that I don't know about.

204
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,639
I guess that was
what made me so angry.

205
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,769
Seeing that taciturn man
going the extra mile for her.

206
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,879
Dan Soo, your mom will be fine.

207
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:01,980
We should be able to find her soon.

208
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,120
Thank you.

209
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,659
I know you'll find
Grandma Sun Yi soon too.

210
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:14,799
Yes.

211
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:29,809
I think both Ms. Audrey
and my grandma...

212
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,610
decided to leave...

213
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,850
because of their children.

214
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,549
But their children
are heartbroken...

215
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,120
because of their moms
who disappeared.

216
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,019
They probably left...

217
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:48,159
without realizing that
it'd break their children's hearts.

218
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:50,899
They just thought...

219
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,399
their kids would forget everything
and move on with their lives.

220
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,679
I guess moms don't fully understand
how their children feel.

221
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:04,980
Ms. Audrey...

222
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,279
loves you.

223
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,980
She decided to leave
because she loves you very much.

224
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,889
Her decision
to suddenly leave now...

225
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,519
and leaving you alone in Kkotsan
when you were little too.

226
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,389
She did it out of love.

227
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,330
The bus is here. I'm off.

228
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,500
Hey, don't run!

229
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,690
Oh, boy.

230
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,990
Mr. Maeng.

231
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,929
I want to ask you something.

232
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:00,669
All right.

233
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,539
Gong Hee's mom told me...

234
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:06,409
that Ms. Audrey and you...

235
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,179
had confided in each other.

236
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,549
She said you told each other
your secrets.

237
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,320
I took Audrey
to the hospital once...

238
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,320
when she nearly
got into a car accident.

239
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,259
What?

240
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,629
That day,

241
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,500
I heard her
calling your name in her sleep...

242
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,529
at the hospital.

243
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,500
Then she told me...

244
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,509
how miserable she was.

245
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,139
What...

246
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,279
made her so miserable?

247
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,580
Dan Soo, I don't know what you heard
from your grandmother...

248
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,519
to misunderstand Audrey like that.

249
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:52,389
Until now,

250
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,519
I wanted to leave it to you
to get it sorted out.

251
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,129
If there's a misunderstanding
to be cleared up,

252
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,659
it should be done
by those who are directly involved.

253
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,659
What misunderstanding?

254
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,669
Here's what I can tell you.

255
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,309
Audrey tried her best
to stay by your side.

256
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,679
Even while trembling in fear,

257
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,809
she held out and did her best...

258
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,750
not to leave you.

259
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,190
In fear?

260
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,389
Of what?

261
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,490
Audrey's in-laws.

262
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,289
Your grandmother,

263
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,830
to be more exact.

264
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,710
Dan Soo, your father...

265
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,509
truly loved Audrey.

266
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,409
Until his last breath,

267
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,750
he desperately called out for her.

268
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,820
Mr. Maeng,
do you know how my dad died?

269
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,559
You know something more
about his death, don't you?

270
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,000
First, let's find Audrey.

271
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,100
I think...

272
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,440
you should hear it from her.

273
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,259
Hey, Myung Ja.

274
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,660
If you're heading out
to look for Mother,

275
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
I'll go with you.

276
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,200
Don't you dare call her "Mother."

277
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,430
She doesn't need
a son-in-law like you.

278
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,730
There are many care homes.
How will you check...

279
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,039
every single one of them
by yourself?

280
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
I won't go with you.

281
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,170
I'll find my mom on my own.

282
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,880
So, just do what you need to do.

283
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,859
Try it on.

284
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:18,230
Oh, no. The stitching here
needs a little more work.

285
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,470
I'll fix it right away.

286
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,009
How can I forget her...

287
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,009
just because she disappeared?

288
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,430
Ma'am.

289
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,500
You don't look so well.

290
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,799
What is Dan Soo up to?

291
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,910
He hasn't given up
on looking for her.

292
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,940
He knows that
I'm trying to track her down too.

293
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,880
And?

294
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,750
What did you tell him?

295
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:10,680
I told him
you'd ordered me to find her.

296
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,990
Dan Soo is all grown up now.

297
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,490
He's no longer a little boy.

298
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:22,400
If he meets her again,

299
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
he'll find out everything.

300
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,930
Then he'll resent me.

301
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,339
He can hate me.

302
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,369
That doesn't scare me.

303
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,380
I can't stay by his side
for much longer anyway.

304
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,039
I don't have much time left.

305
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,450
Ma'am.

306
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,720
However,

307
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:46,589
I can't leave, knowing that woman
will linger around Dan Soo.

308
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,559
Dan Soo has to lead Jayce Group,

309
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,500
so he shouldn't let his sympathy
confuse him.

310
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,599
He's tenderhearted,
just like Hae Joon,

311
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,970
so he'll falter.

312
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,109
When you find her,

313
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,079
you have to send her abroad
this time.

314
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,519
That won't be easy, ma'am.

315
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,490
I know she'll be stubborn again.

316
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,789
She seemed to be thinking
that it was unfair.

317
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,990
She probably feels
that she's being blamed...

318
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,359
when her father was the one
who extorted money from me.

319
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:39,809
Dan Soo.

320
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,920
Why did you do that, Grandma?

321
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,589
You didn't want her living with Dad,

322
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,960
so you harassed her
and kicked her out?

323
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
What?

324
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,500
What exactly did you hear?

325
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,900
Just tell me the truth.

326
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,039
Stop making me look like a fool.

327
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,309
Don't make me live
with more regrets, please.

328
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,309
Dan Soo.

329
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,410
How could you...

330
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,650
Don't you pity her?
How could you make her look so evil?

331
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,980
How could you make me resent her?

332
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,019
I said such mean things to her!

333
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:29,359
How could you do this?

334
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,730
I did all of it for your sake.

335
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,099
You're my one and only grandchild.

336
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,430
With Hae Joon gone,

337
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:44,299
you're all I have now, Dan Soo.

338
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,269
Grandma.

339
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,009
You took my mom away from me.

340
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,609
No, I didn't...

341
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,309
That is not true.

342
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,279
It's been giving me nightmares
for 20 years.

343
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,089
I haven't been able to get back up
since the moment Mom left that day.

344
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,130
How could you say
you did it for my sake?

345
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,630
Dan Soo.

346
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,269
Look at me.

347
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:19,309
Please?

348
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,309
I didn't want her
to take you away from me.

349
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:26,579
You were...

350
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,920
the only one I had.

351
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,430
What you did...

352
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,930
completely destroyed...

353
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,170
someone's life.

354
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,069
Dan Soo!

355
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,940
Oh, no. Ma'am!

356
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:55,509
Goodness.

357
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,680
My poor Dan Soo. What do I do now?

358
00:22:58,579 --> 00:22:59,579
Dan Soo.

359
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,549
Dan Soo...

360
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,089
Gong Hee.
Operation Code Yellow, activated.

361
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,400
What?
But the meeting will start shortly.

362
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,970
Come on. I have a consultation
at No Ah's daycare center today.

363
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,369
Cover up for me, okay?

364
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:23,900
I prepared this to make it look like
I'm still here. Got it?

365
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,440
Well, I don't think it's a good idea
to miss this meeting.

366
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,410
This is the most important thing
in my life right now.

367
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,710
I can't let anyone steal
my position as No Ah's mom.

368
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,519
I'm counting on you, okay? Oh, no.

369
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:46,960
Mr. Gu.

370
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,930
Are you slacking off?

371
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,710
You didn't attend the meeting,

372
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,210
and you weren't in your office.

373
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,579
I thought you might be here,

374
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,950
and here you are.

375
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,220
And your face tells me
that something's up.

376
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,589
I tried to hide,

377
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,390
but you managed to find me.

378
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,900
Hey. Don't you recall...

379
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,759
how I always found you
when we were kids?

380
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,099
Even when you hid under the sink...

381
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,470
and behind the crocks.

382
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,799
Then...

383
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:35,710
find her for me.

384
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,380
What?

385
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:39,910
I want to find her.

386
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,049
I have something I must tell her.

387
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,289
I think I can tell her now.

388
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,019
But I don't know where to go.

389
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,259
I was too harsh on her.

390
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:59,099
I told her not to appear
before me again.

391
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,569
Those words...

392
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,900
I regret saying that.

393
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,269
Don't you think...

394
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:11,309
Ms. Audrey
would also regret it by now?

395
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,849
If she could go back in time,

396
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,119
I'm sure she would.

397
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,660
To the moment
when she made the wrong decision.

398
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,569
I have to go.

399
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,039
Where are you going?

400
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,940
To the moment I regret the most.

401
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,940
The place
where I'm still on the ground.

402
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,660
Gu Dan Soo.

403
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:01,829
Please forgive her.

404
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,900
I really want you to be happy.

405
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,119
I kept walking...

406
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,549
while recalling the memories...

407
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,660
of the day filled with regret.

408
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,400
If only I could turn back
20 years...

409
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,130
If only I could turn around...

410
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:41,829
and run back to you...

411
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,359
Mom.

412
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,599
Mom!

413
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,759
Mom...

414
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,269
Mom!

415
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:16,539
Mom!

416
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:22,039
It's too late to regret it now,
isn't it?

417
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,910
We can't go back to that day,
can we?

418
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:30,579
Geon. In my dreams,

419
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:35,390
I went back to you
hundreds of times.

420
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:40,029
I went back, helped you up,

421
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,099
and held you in my arms.

422
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,970
Mom!

423
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:24,099
Mom.

424
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,140
(My Merry Marriage)

425
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,579
I should go on a date
with that man again.

426
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,349
What are you doing?

427
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:37,579
I should make some effort
not to confuse you.

428
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:39,490
You're totally tied up.

429
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,190
Just accept your fate.

430
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,259
- You're quite late.
- I asked you to come...

431
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:44,420
because there's an open class soon.

432
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,630
- I'll be there!
- I'll be there!

433
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Cancer? What do you mean?

434
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,299
She should undergo treatment
right away.

435
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,869
