1
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,179
Goodness,
is there a hole in the sky?

2
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,479
Why is it pouring down so hard?

3
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,520
The road is so dark too.

4
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,389
It's the perfect night
to see a ghost.

5
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,629
Oh, my!

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,900
What's that?

7
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,470
Is that a person?

8
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,440
Gosh, my heart nearly jumped out
of my throat.

9
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,239
Hey, are you okay?

10
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:55,540
Are you okay?

11
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,640
Goodness, why are you standing
on the road like that?

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,150
I thought you were a ghost.

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,349
Are you going to the bus stop?

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,750
I doubt the buses are running
at this hour.

15
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,760
Just go on your way.

16
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,519
The road is dark at night.

17
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,290
The weather is bad too.

18
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:16,290
You should just go home already.

19
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,300
I told you to just keep going.

20
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,169
I'm...

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,500
a detective in Kkotsan Police.

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,269
You look like
you're going somewhere far.

23
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,780
If anything happens
on your way to your destination,

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,580
give me a call.

25
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,519
(Kkotsan Police Station, An Sang Ho)

26
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,550
- Make sure you contact me, okay?
- Okay.

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,289
So, you think...

28
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,830
that woman was Audrey?

29
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,830
Are you sure?

30
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,030
It was almost 20 years ago,

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,700
so the memory is blurry.

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,039
I wasn't too sure,

33
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,810
so I wasn't going to tell you,

34
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,980
but I can't help but think
that Audrey and Oh Jung Eun...

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,179
have so much in common.

36
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,310
You said
you didn't know her real name...

37
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,450
or her age.

38
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:17,289
(Episode 42)

39
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,590
There is...

40
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,690
something I want to ask you.

41
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,739
What is your real name?

42
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,850
Gyeong Bok.

43
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,749
Is there someone
in Dan Soo's family...

44
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,519
who passed away?

45
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,860
Well, Dan Soo brought a suit
to be altered,

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,860
and it looked like a mourning suit.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
I can't take this anymore.

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,429
You should come clean first, Audrey.

49
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:05,999
What is it?

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,309
Did one of Dan Soo's
family members...

51
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,709
take your money and run off
or something?

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,410
Tell me the truth.

53
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,749
My brother is an ex-cop.

54
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,619
If he does some digging,

55
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,050
he can find everything out.

56
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,459
Why do you want to know
about my real name?

57
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,769
There is a reason why I must know.

58
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,809
Please tell me honestly.

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,140
What's real or fake about a name?

60
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:49,779
I only have one name,
and that's Audrey.

61
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,450
Just call me Audrey.

62
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,219
Then, let me ask you one more thing.

63
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,189
Back in the day, did you perhaps...

64
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:04,600
- What?
- Oh, hi.

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,769
Mr. Maeng,
I didn't know you were here.

66
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,630
Oh, yes.

67
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,540
I was wondering
if my suit was ready.

68
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,769
Oh, I have a few questions
to ask before I finish.

69
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,510
I think we'll have to discuss things
for a bit.

70
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,080
Then,

71
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:26,249
I'll be going now.

72
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,850
Okay, then.

73
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,259
(Tiffany Alterations)

74
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,569
(Maeng Dumplings,
Tiffany Alterations)

75
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm sure I saw her in Kkotsan
20 years ago.

76
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,980
I thought the suit looked too plain.

77
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,619
Bright tones look good on you,

78
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,189
so I was thinking of adding...

79
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,860
an epaulet-style decoration.

80
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,290
- What do you think?
- You sure are the best.

81
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,660
You can pick it out.

82
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,230
I'll show you a few sample patches.

83
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,670
But the thing is...

84
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,770
Please hold back
on your artistic talent this once.

85
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,139
Pardon?

86
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,280
This is...

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,410
a rather special suit.

88
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,710
I see.

89
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:33,249
Then,
should I just let out the length?

90
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,689
Yes, please.

91
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,220
Goodness.

92
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,790
If I had known,
I would've finished it by now.

93
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:43,059
I guess I got overly zealous
about doing a good job.

94
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:44,059
Goodness.

95
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,059
That's okay. You can finish it
by tomorrow morning.

96
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:48,869
All right.

97
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,679
I thought you didn't want
to set Min Gi up on dates.

98
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,939
Have you changed your mind?

99
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,579
Didn't you say the daughter
of the Dodo Group family...

100
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,610
will become your daughter-in-law?

101
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,379
Goodness, don't even mention
that family to me.

102
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,090
I won't associate
with the likes of them.

103
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,920
That Dodo Group
or whatever they're called.

104
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,689
They can't have my son.

105
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,660
You were bragging about it
until recently.

106
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,800
Anyway, I had to work hard...

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,230
to meet your requirements.

108
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,900
But I don't know
if he'll be satisfied...

109
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,540
with dating the daughter
of a smaller company...

110
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,439
after dating the daughter
of a conglomerate.

111
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,139
Well, it is a bit of a shame,

112
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,780
but I'm sure she'd be better
than Kang Myung Ja's daughter.

113
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,210
Myung Ja? What about her daughter?

114
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,420
Oh, it's nothing.
It's not even worth discussing.

115
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:41,749
Hey.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Order anything you want to eat.

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,989
It's on me.

118
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,559
A meal won't be enough to thank me.

119
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,059
If the date goes well,

120
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,989
you have to buy me a purse.

121
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:52,030
All right.

122
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,840
Did you seriously need us
to come here from the head office?

123
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,509
We received the goods,

124
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,840
but we're missing exactly one box.

125
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,749
The distribution team
keeps saying there was no issue.

126
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:11,520
And the head office keeps saying
it's the store's fault.

127
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,980
Of course, it's the store's fault
for not taking care of inventory.

128
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,590
I'll check the quantity.

129
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,889
Will you look through all of it?

130
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,460
I'll have to. Where is it?

131
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:21,889
Over there.

132
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, thank you.

133
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,739
- I'll go and wrap things up.
- Okay.

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,110
What a relief.

135
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,710
The distribution team found
the missing box and sent it over.

136
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,850
Who told you to look through
the entire storage like a fool?

137
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,949
You know the store has to pay
for any lost inventory.

138
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,960
And if their sales figures
are a minus,

139
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:53,489
their performance records
will be ruined.

140
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:56,059
You sure care so much.

141
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,600
Why would you worry
about someone else's store?

142
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,030
It's not someone else's store.
It's our store.

143
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:02,400
A Jayce Fashion store.

144
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:03,569
My goodness.

145
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,210
I have a meeting in this area
in two hours.

146
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,780
I feel a little hungry.

147
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,980
This is your neighborhood, isn't it?

148
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,449
You said your parents owned
a dumpling shop, right?

149
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,550
Let's go there.

150
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,420
Oh, there are other places nearby
with good food.

151
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,819
- I will...
- Why would we do that?

152
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,389
It would be nice
to boost your parents' sales.

153
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,429
Let's go somewhere else...

154
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:33,499
Maeng Dumplings.
Oh, this must be it.

155
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,470
Let's not do that.
I'll buy you something else...

156
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,340
It's rude not to drop by
when we're right around the corner.

157
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:39,699
Let's go.

158
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,710
Mom.

159
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:50,509
I'm here.

160
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,550
Oh, my. What brings you here
at this hour? Didn't you go to work?

161
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,790
Oh, Mom. I had to come to this area
to take care of something.

162
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,559
You must be Gong Hee's mother.

163
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Hello.

164
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:03,359
Well...

165
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:05,959
This is my manager at work.

166
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,170
Oh, my!

167
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:09,729
Your manager?

168
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,140
I didn't realize
you were her manager.

169
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,439
Come and have a seat.
Where are my manners?

170
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,579
- I haven't even said hello.
- Oh, my.

171
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:21,079
No, you really don't have to.

172
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,309
Gong Hee mentioned
that her family ran a dumpling shop.

173
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:24,420
I thought I'd try some too.

174
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,120
Oh, I'm glad you came.
I'll bring out some dumplings now.

175
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:30,920
Goodness. Come and sit here.

176
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,620
Have a seat. Right there.

177
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,670
I'm Gong Hee's aunt.

178
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,199
So, does our Gong Hee do well
at work?

179
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:50,069
- Auntie.
- Right.

180
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,079
Our dear Gong Hee.

181
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,849
We thought she would get rid of...

182
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:57,109
that temporary employee label
this time.

183
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:00,420
What happened, though?

184
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,660
I'm sure
our Gong Hee is a good worker.

185
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:13,859
Gong Hee does try very hard, but...

186
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,099
Well, isn't that enough?

187
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,469
What more do you expect?

188
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,770
Well, I didn't make her lose.

189
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:20,969
What?

190
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:25,209
Oh, well, of course not.

191
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Mom.

192
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,030
Did you know?

193
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,400
Your aunt is such a blabbermouth.

194
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,030
I wish I could just
zip her mouth shut.

195
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:49,429
I'm sorry, Mom.

196
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,170
For what?

197
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,640
If not this time,
you can always try again.

198
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Don't get down on yourself.

199
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,370
I won't.

200
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,280
So, you shouldn't be upset either.

201
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,510
I'm okay.

202
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:10,949
But Gong Hee does
a good job at work, right?

203
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,390
She does.

204
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,530
She does such a good job...

205
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,689
that her superiors
have to tiptoe around her.

206
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,829
A temporary employee
goes on a business trip...

207
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,329
and changes
the entire advertisement plan.

208
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,829
Today,
she went to one of our stores...

209
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:25,140
and told the distribution team
that they made a mistake.

210
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:29,339
Is this a compliment?
Or is she trying to bad-mouth her?

211
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,179
Well, I wasn't sure what you'd like.

212
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,609
- This is the assorted platter.
- My gosh. Thank you.

213
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:36,849
Well...

214
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,650
This is our first time...

215
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,679
meeting someone
from Gong Hee's work at our shop.

216
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,719
Right?

217
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,089
My gosh. Two people in our family...

218
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:47,059
are temporary employees
at that company.

219
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,059
Perhaps, the higher-ups
should pay a little more attention.

220
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,800
Oh, two?

221
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,670
Auntie Gyeong Bok.

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,069
Listen, Ms. Manager.

223
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,010
Please treat our dear Gong Hee well.

224
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:06,640
Her mother and I worry about her
every single day.

225
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,620
- Oh, no!
- My goodness.

226
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,079
- My gosh!
- Oh, no.

227
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,920
Gosh, what do we do?

228
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,189
- My gosh.
- Goodness. Let's wipe it off. Here.

229
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:19,660
- Oh, no.
- No, just leave it.

230
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,990
Okay.

231
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,729
My goodness.

232
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,829
What should we do?
That skirt looks expensive.

233
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,870
Well, I have a meeting,

234
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,069
so I need to figure something out.

235
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:32,469
A meeting?

236
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:36,740
Hey, Gong Hee.
Why not lend her your clothes?

237
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,179
Our house is very close.

238
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,609
- My clothes?
- Yes.

239
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,709
Dan Soo called and said...

240
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:46,219
he was on his way home too.

241
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:47,819
"Dan Soo?"

242
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,750
"Dan Soo," as in
our water supply has been cut off.

243
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,689
Our water supply has been cut off.

244
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:00,500
(Alterations, Dry Cleaning)

245
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,929
Ms. Kang is headed home now.

246
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,140
Get out of there now.

247
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,040
Hurry up and hide!

248
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,209
Gong Hee.

249
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Which way is it?

250
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,679
This way.

251
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,209
It's this way.

252
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,920
I have a bad feeling.

253
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:24,859
Do you think
that manager is mean to Gong Hee?

254
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,859
Whether that's the case or not,
it's something she has to overcome.

255
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,900
You're so harsh on Gong Hee.

256
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,859
Even when she was little,

257
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:36,400
you never once helped her get up
when she fell.

258
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
She needs to get up on her own.

259
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,969
Her parents can't follow her
and help her up every single time.

260
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,660
We might get caught living together!

261
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,189
Please...

262
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,829
(Bubble Up Laundry)

263
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:08,829
Is it here?

264
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:10,429
Pardon?

265
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:12,400
Oh, yes.

266
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:17,670
Why are you standing? Open the door.

267
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:19,979
Right.

268
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,719
Oh, my.

269
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,260
The Almighty has no conscience.

270
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,520
How could he think...

271
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,089
to put this face
and this body together?

272
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,800
Don't his clients complain?

273
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,059
This is too much.

274
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:43,729
I look too perfect.

275
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,870
Others will complain to him
that he made me too perfect.

276
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,109
What is this?
What's with all these text messages?

277
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,050
(Maeng Gong Hee)

278
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:56,510
Ms. Kang is coming here?

279
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:57,849
What's she saying?

280
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,319
Why did they build rooms
on the rooftop?

281
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,719
Shoot.

282
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,490
Oh, right.

283
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
So, this is where you live?

284
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,150
Pardon? Yes.

285
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,079
By yourself?

286
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,449
Yes, of course.

287
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:36,819
Really?

288
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,459
Let me grab some clothes quickly.
One moment.

289
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,839
Thank goodness
she didn't run into him here.

290
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,609
What's with Dan Soo?
He didn't even come to work today.

291
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,880
Hold on. Our place is tiny.

292
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,939
Where is he hiding?

293
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,010
He drives me nuts, seriously.

294
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,890
Hey!

295
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:11,459
You...

296
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,319
Hey! What...

297
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,589
Why are you here?

298
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,589
What is Ms. Kang doing here?

299
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,900
Is someone else in the room?

300
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,559
Are you talking to someone?

301
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,000
No, I'm not!

302
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,969
Stay right here.

303
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,199
Don't even breathe.

304
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,569
No, hide here as if you're dead.

305
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:31,439
Why do I have to hide like this?

306
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:32,709
Forget it.
I'll just go out and tell her.

307
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,880
No! Have you lost your mind?

308
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,380
Hey, why did you take your top off?

309
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,920
What would she think
if you went out and saw her now?

310
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,990
"Oh, they said they were friends.
I guess they live together."

311
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,390
"They must be very close."
Would she just think that?

312
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,589
Do you still need more time?

313
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,630
No, I'm almost done. Just a moment!

314
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,920
(Jayce Fashion, Gu Dan Soo)

315
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,359
So, they actually live together?

316
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,790
I thought
it was just me speculating.

317
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:35,569
Don't come out.

318
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:37,069
Hey, you want me to stay here?

319
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:38,079
- Shut it.
- Wait, but...

320
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,220
Ms. Kang.
I kept you waiting, didn't I?

321
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,190
I don't have a lot of clothes,
but I found these...

322
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:54,889
Where did she go?

323
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,399
What is this?

324
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,010
We're meeting with the buyers.

325
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,609
Why did you come so late?

326
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,480
They just import and sell clothes.

327
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,619
Buyers, my foot.

328
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,550
- We still have some time left.
- What's your problem?

329
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,020
Before that, you should be asking me
why I came late.

330
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,129
About Gu Dan Soo.

331
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,629
Do you know where he is?

332
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,930
Why do you assume
that I'd know his every move?

333
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:38,800
Why don't you call him?
I guess you miss him.

334
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,399
No, I do not.

335
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,879

earlier.

336
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:47,809
What?

337
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:50,050
Gu Dan Soo and Maeng Gong Hee.

338
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,250
They live together.

339
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,450
What?

You were out fishing all day.

345
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:23,409
Now, you're listening
to "Whale Hunting" again?

346
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,550
Eat something, at least.

347
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,690
Do you have to fall ill
to learn your lesson?

348
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,919
You know...

349
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,290
About Audrey.

350
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,300
She seems to confide in you
and tell you everything.

351
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,730
Has she told you anything?

352
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:45,569
Like what?

353
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:49,970
Things like where she used to live,

354
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,909
whether or not
she's been married before,

355
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:55,809
and if she has any kids.

356
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,319
Why are you trying to do
a background check on her?

357
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:03,919
Well, I just need
to look into something.

358
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,819
Why? Do you want
to set her up with someone?

359
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:07,619
Goodness.

360
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:10,629
Forget it. I can't talk to you.

361
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,659
Then what is it about?

362
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:14,159
Why are you curious
about such things?

363
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,730
Tell me.

364
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,339
Why do you want to know
about Audrey?

365
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,839
"Why?"
Why are you curious about that?

366
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,879
Because it's important.

367
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,680
First, tell me why you want to know
such things about her.

368
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,409
Only then can I help you.

369
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:32,319
Darn it.

370
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,119
Come on!
Why do you want to know such things?

371
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,319
I'm pleading the Fifth.

372
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,190
Enough of your nonsense.

373
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,129
Is Audrey is important now?

374
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,530
What are we going to do
about Gong Boo?

375
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,730
What are we going to do
about his wedding?

376
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,230
He doesn't own a home
and has no money.

377
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:52,540
How is he going to get married?

378
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,569
You always neglect
your own children like this.

379
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,040
Where's your mind at?

380
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
But I can't help but think
that Audrey and Oh Jung Eun...

381
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,569
have so much in common.

382
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,339
You said
you didn't know her real name...

383
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:33,240
or her age.

384
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,089
I was so cool as I gave him
my letter of resignation,

385
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:45,819
and Director Lee
seemed so flustered.

386
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:49,629
They must really need me at work.

387
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:50,629
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

388
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,129
Don't make me laugh.

389
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
Right.

390
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:57,430
You should go in tomorrow...

391
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,599
and take back
your letter of resignation.

392
00:22:00,139 --> 00:22:02,540
Deciding to quit your job
based on fleeting emotions...

393
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,770
is foolish.

394
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:06,579
These aren't just fleeting emotions.

395
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:10,180
I've worked more than enough.

396
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,220
I mean, why shouldn't I become
a stay-at-home mom?

397
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,220
I'm a doctor's wife.

398
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,829
Gosh, I feel so free.

399
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,800
Do you know how sly that man is?

400
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,129
He adores Seo Min Gi
and Kang Ji Na so much,

401
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,800
but he's always nitpicking
everything I do.

402
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,540
I'm telling you. You shouldn't let
such mere things affect you.

403
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,010
Why should I have to bow my head
to such an old fogey like him?

404
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,750
There's something
I haven't told you.

405
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
What is it?

406
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,520
Well, actually, my clinic...

407
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,720
is having a hard time
paying the interest on our loans.

408
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,230
"Loans?"

409
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,829
If I work really hard
and live frugally for ten years,

410
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,930
I might be able to pay off
most of the loans.

411
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,470
I'm sure this is soda.

412
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:11,980
Did I drink soju? Am I drunk?

413
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,780
Oh, my. I think I'm hearing things.
What's wrong with me?

414
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,450
So, I think you should rethink
quitting your job...

415
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,250
Hey.

416
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,290
You said you weren't lying to me.

417
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,460
You said you didn't have
any more secrets!

418
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:26,720
I wasn't lying to you.

419
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,930
It was a small mistake
due to willful negligence.

420
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,099
I can't believe it.
You're nothing but a facade.

421
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:37,970
When Ssook Ssook is born,

422
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,339
we will need so much money.

423
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:41,200
What do you plan to do?

424
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,139
That's why wise men used to say
that you shouldn't quit your job...

425
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,849
- Seriously, you little...
- Wait. Hey!

426
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:50,950
Die. Just die!

427
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,980
- Did I ever tell you I had money?
- Oh, dear.

428
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,419
Not all doctors make a lot of money.

429
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:56,419
That's just a stereotype.

430
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,819
Are you kidding me? Darn it!

431
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,559
Why are you fighting again,

432
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,589
just like you did
at the family meeting?

433
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:02,760
Let go of him and talk.

434
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,460
Who said to hand in your resignation
without talking to me?

435
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,599
You said you weren't lying to me
about anything else.

436
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:10,800
My goodness.

437
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,669
I'm the fool
for trusting a man like this.

438
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:17,409
Goodness.

439
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:19,079
Seriously...

440
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,079
Hey, but...

441
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Hey.

442
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,450
Go after her.

443
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,879
Go and beg her not to leave!

444
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,419
Forget it.

445
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,859
I won't have any hair left
if I have to live with that woman.

446
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,790
Gosh, my hair...

447
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,260
Darn it!

448
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:36,629
My gosh.

449
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,210
Why are you dressed in a black suit?

450
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,470
Are you going to a funeral?

451
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,079
You won't talk to me again.

452
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,680
Why do I even bother to ask?

453
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:01,950
I will tell you.

454
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,450
What?

455
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,190
So, there is something to tell me,
isn't there?

456
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,389
Just hold on.

457
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:11,960
It won't take long.

458
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,329
It won't take long?

459
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,099
It's been over 20 years,
and you say it won't take long?

460
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:18,869
What on earth is it?

461
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,569
Just get it off your chest already.

462
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:25,609
Darn you!

463
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:33,379
I let out the seams.

464
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:34,780
Do you want to try them on?

465
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,050
I trust your skills.

466
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,659
I can tell it will fit just right.

467
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,089
You must be seeing your father
for the first time in a while.

468
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,329
Your father must be
so happy to see...

469
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,069
such a handsome son.

470
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,399
Well, of course.

471
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,240
What are you celebrating today?

472
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,309
You're wearing
such a nice suit for it.

473
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:58,909
Well...

474
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:00,639
Today is...

475
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:02,950
my father's death anniversary.

476
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:07,780
His death anniversary?

477
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,319
I already wired you
for the alteration.

478
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,520
Then, I'll be going now.

479
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:15,629
Wait a minute.

480
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,230
Do you mean...

481
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:24,230
your father passed away?

482
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Yes.

483
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:32,180
When?

484
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,909
He passed away when I was young.

485
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,980
It's been 20 years already.

486
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:44,020
I'll be going now.

487
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,629
Goodness, who's here?

488
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,359
What are you doing here like this?

489
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,430
Why?

490
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,669
Why, Hae Joon?

491
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,970
(In Loving Memory of Gu Hae Joon)

492
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:34,399
No way.

493
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,079
(My Merry Marriage)

494
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,609
Audrey really was Oh Jung Eun.

495
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,079
Stop!

496
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,220
My letter of resignation...

497
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,879
What about my letter of resignation?

498
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,419
I submitted it to HR.

499
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,389
No.

500
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:28,059
What do you think about marriage,
Gong Hee?

501
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,329
I have a fantasy about marriage.

502
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:32,800
What about you, Mr. Seo?

503
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,030
Who's that?

504
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,430
I want to get married too.
As soon as possible.

505
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:39,139
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
