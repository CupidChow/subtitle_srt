00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,609
(Episode 89)

2
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,619
Mom.

3
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:04,860
Mom, where are you?

4
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,680
Dear Myung Ja.

5
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,320
Whenever your brothers
were starting a new school year,

6
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,990
your younger sisters pestered me
to buy them new clothes,

7
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,490
but you'd just quietly go to school.

8
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,660
For some reason,
seeing that broke my heart...

9
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,660
more than anything else.

10
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,930
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

11
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,369
Have you seen my mom?

12
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:27,009
No, I haven't.

13
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,279
You rarely cried,

14
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,949
and you never made a fuss
about anything.

15
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:40,290
You always took care
of your brothers and sisters.

16
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,520
You really were
the pillar of the family.

17
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:46,089
Mom.

18
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:49,859
Mom...

19
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,439
Children shouldn't mature
so quickly,

20
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,240
but because of your parents
who had to eke out a living,

21
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,080
you had to learn to forgive...

22
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,610
at the age when it was more natural
to be a whiny child.

23
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,950
For that, I'm really sorry.

24
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:13,589
But you know, Myung Ja.

25
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,819
Would you please forgive...

26
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,559
- your foolish mother once more?
- Mom...

27
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,270
Mom.

28
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,779
I bought clothes...

29
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,050
for all of you to wear
at my funeral.

30
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,980
Myung Ja.

31
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:46,490
Don't cry, and don't be sad.

32
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,920
Don't look for me.

33
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,129
I'll be fine,

34
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,490
so don't worry about a thing.

35
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,860
When you hear that I've passed away,

36
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,330
you can look for me then.

37
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,909
I want my body to be cremated...

38
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,339
and my ashes to be cast to the wind
in my hometown.

39
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:34,300
I was abandoned too, you see.

40
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,670
By my own mother.

41
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,170
How would a parent feel...

42
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,010
after abandoning their own child?

43
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm curious.

44
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:44,809
Did you abandon your son?

45
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,010
My gosh.

46
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,309
Who called this woman here?

47
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:51,619
Did you want to see what it was like
to play a guardian?

48
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:53,550
To show up as my mom
and get a feel for it?

49
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,920
Geon. That's a misunderstanding.

50
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,319
- Mom was...
- "Mom?" How dare you?

51
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,990
Don't even dare...

52
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,830
to speak that word out loud.

53
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,029
Grandma is...

54
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,000
my only family now.

55
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,580
Check the marketing proposal.

56
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,419
It's been updated
with the revisions we talked about.

57
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,159
There aren't many changes,

58
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,960
and I've already checked everything.

59
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,429
Hey, are you all right?

60
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,799
I don't know what to believe.

61
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,270
Should I trust my grandma
who's been by my side all my life?

62
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,570
Or...

63
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:49,979
I can't...

64
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,109
fathom what you're going through
and how confused you must be,

65
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,750
but I know this one thing.

66
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,020
Both Chairwoman Hwang
and Ms. Audrey...

67
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,200
are your family.

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
"Family?"

69
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,440
Dan Soo, try this too.

70
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,710
Okay, thank you.

71
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,330
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

72
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,570
- Please leave a message...
- What? That's odd.

73
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,700
Why isn't Mother
answering her phone?

74
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,440
Didn't she go to Kkotsan
to see Grandma?

75
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,169
Yes, she did.

76
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,839
She said she'd go there
and pick up Grandmother.

77
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,750
I want to book health checkups
for Grandmother, Mother, and Father.

78
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,450
My gosh, Hong Dan. Thanks so much.

79
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,320
Hey, why are you thanking me?

80
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,489
I'm like their daughter too,
you know.

81
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:11,159
Oh, you're right.

82
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,460
I wanted to ask her
when would be the best time...

83
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,700
to book the appointments,

84
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,630
but she's not picking up.

85
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,630
Maybe she took Grandmother
somewhere nice.

86
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,169
That's strange.

87
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,469
It's rare for Mom
not to answer her phone.

88
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,510
Myung Ja.

89
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,750
- My goodness. What happened?
- Ma'am.

90
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,820
My neighbors were all talking
about you.

91
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,560
They said you were...

92
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,989
running around frantically
in a daze.

93
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:49,729
Oh, dear.

94
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,729
You must know.

95
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,599
Where is my mom?

96
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,799
I saw the burial dress
and the mourning clothes.

97
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,810
What is going on?

98
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,479
Oh, dear. I tried so hard
to talk her out of it.

99
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,909
My goodness.
I really tried my best to stop her.

100
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
Oh, boy.

101
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,179
A care home?

102
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,460
Should I look into it too?

103
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,560
What? Why?

104
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,060
You want to move into a care home?

105
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:24,029
My gosh. Forget it.

106
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,900
You have your children.
Why would you do that?

107
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,000
My goodness.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,169
From now on, I'll be nothing
but a burden to my children.

109
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,310
Death is the only thing
that awaits me.

110
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,979
Every time I fall ill,
my children will be stressed.

111
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,950
They'll run around,
trying to save their mother.

112
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,150
It'll be so exhausting.

113
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,159
Your mother didn't want
to be a burden on her children.

114
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,539
Mom...

115
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,450
Mom...

116
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,120
Why would you think
that you're a burden to us?

117
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:24,620
Mom, why would you hide from us?

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,289
Mom...

119
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,929
Where on earth are you, Mom?

120
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,100
Mom...

121
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:38,939
Oh, dear.

122
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,110
(Folic Acid, Iron)

123
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,350
This is folic acid,
and this is iron.

124
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,380
Oh, you should never skip a meal.

125
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,250
Even if you feel queasy,
be sure to eat at regular intervals.

126
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,919
And don't skip the supplements.

127
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,120
Stop overreacting.

128
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,329
Didn't you call me over
because you missed me?

129
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:04,360
Hey, your brother is
an OB-GYN doctor.

130
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,699
Enjoy the perks of having
a doctor brother once again.

131
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,140
"Once again?"

132
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,970
Isn't this the first time?

133
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:17,709
Do you know how scared I was
when I heard about your accident?

134
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,980
You're becoming a mom now.
Think about your baby.

135
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,819
I know.

136
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,919
How's work? Are things going well?

137
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,419
I heard about it.

138
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,459
So, the woman your husband
almost got married to...

139
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:33,789
is your manager.

140
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,230
Oh, that.
Are things all right with you?

141
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
It seemed like
Ms. Eom had a lot on her mind.

142
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,240
Why? Did she say something to you?

143
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:44,970
I heard Soo Yeon...

144
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,340
even went to No Ah's daycare center.

145
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,779
Goodness.
Why did she have to tell you that?

146
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,140
She told me I had a loose tongue.

147
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,480
This family keeps no secrets.

148
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,520
Get your act together.

149
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,549
If you make Ms. Eom cry,

150
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,189
I'll beat you up to a pulp.

151
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,720
Behave yourself unless you want...

152
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,230
a taste of my punch.

153
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,600
Hey, come on. Momo is watching you.

154
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,529
Unless you want Momo
to grow up to be a boxer,

155
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:13,730
you should put that fist away.

156
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,069
What's wrong with becoming a boxer?

157
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,470
I want Momo to have many dreams.

158
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,610
Momo, how about...

159
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,069
becoming a kind, amazing doctor
like your uncle here?

160
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,640
Momo, you can become
anything but him.

161
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,520
Trust me. He's a real catch.

162
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:32,220
Is it so hard to go on a blind date?

163
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Mom.

164
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,819
I told you
I'd never go on a blind date.

165
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,319
And right now, a blind date
is not important to me at all.

166
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,559
What's wrong with you, Mom?

167
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,000
You said no to the grandson
of Jayce Fashion's chairwoman...

168
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,059
and the eldest son
of the Omin Industry family.

169
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,500
You tell me. What do you want?

170
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,870
Don't tell me you're still hung up
on that chauffeur's son.

171
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,539
Forget it. Let's talk later.
I'm at work.

172
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:03,449
All right. I'll see you then.

173
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,559
I guess working alone
isn't that bad after all.

174
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,730
Thanks to you,
the talk with Heirmez went well.

175
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,900
We're going to meet today
and finalize the schedule.

176
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,510
It makes me jealous to hear...

177
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,510
that things are going smoothly
even without me.

178
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,480
Let's not talk about this.

179
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,250
You promised
to take your hands off the project.

180
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,809
You simply notified me
that I had to do so.

181
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,990
I haven't had lunch yet. Excuse me.

182
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,659
(Heirmez meeting at J Cafe, 7 p.m.)

183
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,799
How much longer
will you be able to ignore me?

184
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,439
That is what I want to know,

185
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,039
Seo Min Gi.

186
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,020
Mom, I'll go on the blind date.

187
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,490
But it has to be tonight.

188
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,490
I'll decide where to meet.

189
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,340
My gosh, Mr. Ryu.

190
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,309
What brought you
to our dumpling shop again?

191
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:40,309
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

192
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:42,409
Sorry?

193
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,020
Oh, I see. Our...

194
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,789
Our dumplings are hard to forget,
aren't they?

195
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,730
You see,
some may have never tried it,

196
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,459
but those who have tried it
come back for more.

197
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,029
I did miss these dumplings too.

198
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,539
Oh, dear. "Dumplings too?"

199
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,970
Does that mean...

200
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,640
there was something else
you could not stop thinking about?

201
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:12,809
Well...

202
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:15,610
When I take a bite,

203
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,250
it feels as if flowers are blooming
inside my mouth.

204
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,490
The cook's heart must be
as beautiful as flowers.

205
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,789
That's probably why
the dumplings taste so good.

206
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,659
My goodness, Mr. Ryu.

207
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,699
You sure have an extraordinary way
of describing things.

208
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,669
(Maeng Dumplings)

209
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,610
Kang Myung Ja.

210
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:43,039
How dare she call my son over
and scold him?

211
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:47,309
She should've vented
her anger on me.

212
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,520
How could she take it out
on my dear son?

213
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:52,949
I will...

214
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,750
have it out with you today,
Kang Myung Ja.

215
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,230
- Please have more.
- Okay.

216
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,230
My goodness.

217
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,529
- My gosh! Mr. Ryu.
- What...

218
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,169
- Who knew I'd run into you here?
- Goodness.

219
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,669
Hey, why are you here?

220
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,010
Where's Kang Myung Ja?

221
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,809
Myung Ja went to Kkotsan.
I asked why you were here.

222
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:23,679
She sure wanders around a lot
for someone who has to run a shop.

223
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,120
I came to complain about something.

224
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:29,390
The three of you must be very close.

225
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,689
- No way.
- No, we are not.

226
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,900
Mr. Ryu, you must like dumplings.

227
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,699
Well, actually...

228
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,669
I don't eat dumplings that often,

229
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,309
but it's been popping up in my head.

230
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,510
Even as I'm walking the streets,

231
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,679
out of the blue.

232
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Oh, I guess you have
simple taste buds, Mr. Ryu.

233
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,090
Then what else do you like?

234
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,789
And are you dating anyone?

235
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,590
I read your interviews.

236
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,029
They said you were still single.

237
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Well, yes.

238
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:18,439
I love poetry.

239
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,539
Poetry is my lover.

240
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,539
My gosh.

241
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,140
You write many love poems,

242
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,549
so I thought
you were in love with someone.

243
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,720
I was once deeply hurt
by an unrequited love.

244
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
But...

245
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
"But?"

246
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,059
Even a lake frozen
in the middle of winter...

247
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,990
suddenly cracks
and explodes at times.

248
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,990
Spring might be...

249
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:45,730
coming to my lake too.

250
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:48,329
A lake?

251
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,209
I see.
You must live near the Lake Park.

252
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,640
I sometimes take a walk over there.

253
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,539
Why don't we go together next time?

254
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:00,579
Well...

255
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,850
Oh, dear. I have business
at a nearby publisher.

256
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,520
- Please excuse me.
- All right.

257
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,260
- How much is it?
- No, it's okay.

258
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,760
I got this.

259
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,689
- No.
- Just get going, okay?

260
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,559
- But...
- Please get going.

261
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,529
Okay, then.

262
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:21,370
- Thank you for the meal.
- No problem.

263
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,400
- I'll see you at the workshop.
- Okay.

264
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,100
- Okay.
- Bye.

265
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,909
Bye.

266
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:28,909
Bye.

267
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:33,909
Do you have a stuffy nose?

268
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,179
What was with that voice?

269
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:40,419
Why did I sit there and wait
while you were yapping away?

270
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,990
That was such an eyesore.

271
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,220
Whatever. Did Kang Myung Ja
not say anything to you?

272
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,760
About what?
What are you trying to get at?

273
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,499
Stop beating around the bush.

274
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:52,259
Just get straight to the point.

275
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:55,370
I didn't scold Gong Hee
for no reason the other day.

276
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,600
When her coworker came over,
she was being inhospitable.

277
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,939
She wasn't being nice,
so I told her off for being mean.

278
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,009
I think Myung Ja only saw that
and got the wrong idea.

279
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,509
So I came to explain.

280
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:11,880
Hey, isn't that team manager
or something...

281
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,350
your son's ex-girlfriend?

282
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,229
That wench has it out for Gong Hee,
doesn't she?

283
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:23,929
No way. She's very kind and amiable.

284
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:27,600
She booked facials for me
to de-stress...

285
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,870
and got opera tickets to watch...

286
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:30,939
What's this?

287
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,209
Are you saying
you still hang out with her?

288
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:39,140
Give me a straight answer.

289
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,909
Is that why you're being hard
on Gong Hee?

290
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:45,320
My goodness.
You're making me look bad.

291
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,219
Good grief. I should get going.

292
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,790
Pack me some dumplings.

293
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,659
It's for your precious niece.

294
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,830
You should be careful.

295
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,030
I'm going to tell Myung Ja
everything you just said...

296
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,540
without leaving a thing out. Got it?

297
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
My gosh!

298
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:11,179
What? You...

299
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,979
- How dazzling.
- Good grief.

300
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,419
- Goodness me.
- Really, I wish I hadn’t seen that.

301
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,120
Can you please look her up again?

302
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,890
I'm sure she couldn't have gone far.

303
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,320
This is the only place in the area.

304
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,130
Im Sun Yi, right?
There's no one by that name.

305
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,659
She must've gone somewhere else.

306
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:32,300
I'm sorry for not being helpful.

307
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,729
I see.

308
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,699
(Saemmul Sanatorium)

309
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,810
You have bad knees.

310
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,439
How far did you go, Mom?

311
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:53,689
Mr. Seo.

312
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,979
Oh, you're home.

313
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,719
What are you up to?

314
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,949
I bought some clothes
and shoes for my baby.

315
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,560
My goodness. It's not like
your baby can wear them now.

316
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,259
Why buy them already?

317
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:35,630
You don't even know
if it's a boy or girl yet.

318
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:39,999
I bought them,
hoping to keep Momo healthy.

319
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,199
It's like a lucky charm for Momo...

320
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,239
to stay healthy
until the day we meet.

321
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:47,870
You said you were going
to your brother's clinic.

322
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,709
What's the matter?
Did you hear some bad news?

323
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,249
He just told me to be careful
not to be stressed.

324
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,479
I see.

325
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,019
What's your baby's nickname again?
Momo?

326
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,050
Yes.

327
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,019
What a bizarre nickname.

328
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,290
You should've put
more thought into it.

329
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,429
You don't have a knack
for coming up with names.

330
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,830
When your baby is born,

331
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,199
I'll hire a famous naming expert
to get a good name for the baby.

332
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,870
Really?

333
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,070
Thank you, Mother.

334
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:21,209
I'm linguistically talented.

335
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm learning to write poetry,
you know.

336
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,679
I can tell from the expressions
you use, Mother.

337
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,249
Is that right?

338
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,780
You should read
some poetry books too.

339
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,550
Don't use them as trivets.
That's ignorant.

340
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Okay.

341
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:39,489
Oh, here. I went to your mom's shop
and got these for you.

342
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:43,759
Mother, thank you.

343
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,199
I'm so touched.

344
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,929
Oh, please. It's nothing.

345
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,199
Did you have dinner?

346
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,900
I'll eat with Mr. Seo
when he gets home.

347
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,999
All right.

348
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:56,669
By the way, can you please
stop calling him like that?

349
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,280
It makes me uncomfortable
because it sounds way too formal.

350
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,550
It makes you sound like
you're working at home.

351
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:05,479
Right, I'll try to change that.

352
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,919
All right. I'll be in my room.

353
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,759
Yes, Mother.
Thank you for the dumplings.

354
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, he should be home very soon.

355
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,870
I should heat up the dumplings.

356
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Really?

357
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:33,650
So many people said
you were as cold as ice.

358
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,880
I guess it was a groundless rumor.

359
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,919
Are any of the rumors
in this industry ever true?

360
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,749
If I was cold to someone,

361
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:43,090
it was probably because
I didn't like the person.

362
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,189
It sounds like
you're saying you like me.

363
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,659
So, you've caught on.

364
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,530
That's right.

365
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,699
I wouldn't be sitting here now
if I found you unattractive.

366
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,300
You're very honest
and straightforward.

367
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm attracted to women
who are straightforward.

368
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:06,780
Get your hand off mine.

369
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:09,709
Let's stop testing the waters.
It's boring.

370
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:11,120
Let's get down to business.

371
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,650
I told you
to get your hand off mine.

372
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:21,259
Who are you?

373
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:22,590
She said to get your hand off her.

374
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,939
Oh, no! Fire! What do I do?

375
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:32,939
- My gosh, fire!
- You scared me. What is it?

376
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:35,739
You said you were making dinner.
Why would you start a fire?

377
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:37,439
My gosh. It's not like
I knew this would happen.

378
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:39,580
- Hurry up and do something!
- It's hot!

379
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,009
- It's so hot.
- Hey, what is going on?

380
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,249
My goodness! What happened here?

381
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,780
- Good grief.
- Hong Dan said...

382
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,050
- Oh, boy.
- she'd make dinner today.

383
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,019
Well, Mother went to Kkotsan
to see Grandmother,

384
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:53,759
so I wanted to prepare dinner today.

385
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,259
You'd burn this house down
if you had to make dinner again.

386
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,600
We should get fire insurance
before you cook again.

387
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,400
Well, this soup is ready.
Oh, it's hot.

388
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,570
Rice is ready too.

389
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,239
My goodness.

390
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,880
Be honest. The soup is good, right?

391
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,820
- I'm skipping dinner today.
- What?

392
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,120
I've lost my appetite.

393
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,989
- What?
- It's just a soup.

394
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,489
How bad could it taste?

395
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,519
My gosh, that scared me.

396
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,729
Hey, come on.

397
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:31,929
You didn't have to scream, did you?
How mean!

398
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,100
Did someone just stab you
or something?

399
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:36,100
The salt stabbed my tongue,
for real.

400
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,570
Right, Auntie Gyeong Bok?

401
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,400
Goodness.

402
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,110
No Ah, it's dangerous here.
Don't come in here.

403
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,439
- Go. Get out.
- Yes, go.

404
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:46,140
You're all having fun here
without me.

405
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,650
"Fun?"

406
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,449
Mom told me
there was nothing more fun...

407
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,790
than watching people fight
or seeing things burn.

408
00:24:58,659 --> 00:24:59,659
Oh, my.

409
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,290
Hey, when did I say such a thing?

410
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,130
What? What's this?

411
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,870
It's from my teacher.

412
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,429
"Hello, No Ah's mother."

413
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:11,040
"Please visit us
for your consultation."

414
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,909
Oh, no! It's tomorrow.

415
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,679
Hey, you have to go to work,

416
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,040
and so do I.

417
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:24,419
No.

418
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,550
I will do this, no matter what.

419
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,050
What? What are you going to do?

420
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,719
I don't know.
I don't have a plan yet.

421
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,919
But I will visit
the daycare center tomorrow,

422
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,860
no matter what!

423
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,729
You'd win a gold medal
in a bluffing competition.

424
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,769
They want his mother
to come in for a consultation.

425
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,499
As No Ah's mom,

426
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,340
I can't lose to other moms.

427
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,840
I know I'm Ssook Ssook's mom,

428
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,340
but No Ah is my son too.

429
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,550
I will not cut anyone out
of my ideal family portrait.

430
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,219
I'm getting a headache.

431
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,650
How admirable. Way to go.

432
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,860
Hey, Dan Soo. You're back.

433
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,530
Hello, have you heard anything?

434
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,999
Well, she doesn't really have
anywhere to go,

435
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,900
so we'll find her soon.

436
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:21,140
Don't worry too much.
Just wait for now.

437
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,479
I promise I'll find Audrey for you.

438
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,780
I'll do whatever it takes.

439
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,850
You're back.

440
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,030
Hey, Myung Ja. Wait!

441
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,259
Let's talk.

442
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
You want to talk?

443
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:50,939
Let me explain. Today...

444
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,239
I don't want to hear...

445
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,070
another word
that comes out of your mouth.

446
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:58,209
You said you'd go to Kkotsan with me
to see my mom, but you blew me off.

447
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
What did you do all day?

448
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:01,749
You were so busy
looking for Audrey...

449
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:04,219
that you didn't call me once
all day?

450
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,780
Well, you see...

451
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,219
You know Audrey looked like
she was having a hard time.

452
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,060
So I...

453
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,519
She looked like
she was having a hard time?

454
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,590
Then what about me?

455
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:16,759
What about me...

456
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,030
who has to wait in the dark
when you're out and about like this?

457
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:21,800
Have you thought about
how hard that might be?

458
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,840
Has it ever crossed your mind?

459
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
I just...

460
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,739
wanted to help her. That's all.

461
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,650
Oh, no.

462
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,249
Hey, you're back.

463
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:40,280
Where's your mother?
You said you'd come back with her.

464
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,390
- Hello, Mother.
- Hi, Mom.

465
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:44,790
- Grandma's back.
- What's with her?

466
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,959
Oh, dear.

467
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,530
My goodness.

468
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,739
I can't...

469
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:06,840
live with you.

470
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:14,949
I can't live with you anymore!

471
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,610
(My Merry Marriage)

472
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,870
Seriously, Dad. What's with you?

473
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,640
Mom has put up with you
for long enough.

474
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,140
Even if Mom wants
to split up with you, I understand.

475
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,709
Dan Soo, I don't know what you heard
from your grandmother...

476
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:44,350
to misunderstand Audrey like that.

477
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,650
"Misunderstand?"

478
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,419
Here's what I can tell you.

479
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:50,489
About your grandmother.

480
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:51,489
Dan Soo.

481
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:52,489
Why did you do that, Grandma?

482
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:53,560
Dan Soo.

483
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,159
