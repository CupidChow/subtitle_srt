1
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,409
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,620
Gu Dan Soo.

3
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,650
Gu Dan Soo!

4
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:17,529
Hello?

5
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,529
Someone's hurt!

6
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,200
(Dry Cleaning, Alterations)

7
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Maeng Gong Boo!

8
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,740
Hey, come here.

9
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,680
Hey, Mom! I'll tell Hong Dan on you.

10
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,049
You'll get in trouble
for treating me like this.

11
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,309
I'm not your man, you see.

12
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,019
Go ahead and tell her.

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,990
- Come on. Come here.
- Hold on. Let go.

14
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,919
Oh, you're back early.
You said you'd be home late.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,820
Hey, you're home.

16
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,630
Yes.

17
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,529
Grandma, how was business today?
Did you turn a profit?

18
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,370
What? Yes, I sure did.

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,870
Hey, where did you learn
to say that?

20
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,710
Great-aunt taught me.

21
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:08,109
She said, "We never turn a profit."

22
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,719
My, living with the elders...

23
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,980
is helping him absorb
good manners so quickly.

24
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,719
No Ah, did you have a good day
at daycare?

25
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,290
- What?
- What toys did you play with?

26
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:26,460
What did you do
with your teacher at daycare today?

27
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,900
We played with some toys.

28
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,769
You played with toys?

29
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,570
Hey.

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,739
Do you know where Soo Yeon is now?

31
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,209
Mom.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
You know too?

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,010
My goodness.
What are you going to do?

34
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,410
I took No Ah to the clinic
and saw her.

35
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,419
You know too, right?

36
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,489
You see, I tried so hard
to talk her out of it,

37
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,419
but you know
how ridiculously stubborn she is.

38
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,959
Seriously,
what on earth is she thinking?

39
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,290
She was the one
who abandoned her child and left.

40
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,730
Why is she doing this now?

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,769
Mom, why would you ask me?
As if I'd know the answer.

42
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:01,769
You fool.

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,600
Wait. Hong Dan doesn't know yet,
does she?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,570
Hey, what are you going to do?

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,410
We should keep it from her
for the time being.

46
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,639
They say it's very stressful to know
about your husband's ex-wife.

47
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:13,850
Living with No Ah too.

48
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,609
We're finally beginning
to feel like a stable family now.

49
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,419
You went to see a doctor
with Grandma?

50
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,649
Were you feeling sick?

51
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,549
Yes, I went to the clinic
with Grandma.

52
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,290
Oh, no.

53
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:25,720
Maeng No Ah!

54
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,459
Did you have fun at daycare today?

55
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,130
I had to go to the clinic
with Grandma.

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,829
Oh, you have something here.

57
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,869
You feel fine now, right?

58
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:38,600
How about we go out
and exercise together?

59
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,440
My goodness. It's cold outside.

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,739
He's sick. Where would you take him?

61
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm not sick anymore.

62
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,410
I feel totally fine
after taking my medicine.

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,880
The medicine
my mom gives me always...

64
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,579
I know! You must exercise regularly
to keep illness at bay. Yes.

65
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,549
You'll feel worse
if you stay at home all day.

66
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,359
You need to move around
and stay active. Let's go.

67
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:02,130
- Yes, let's go. Put on your shoes.
- What's with him?

68
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,359
- Let's put on our shoes. That's it.
- My goodness.

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
- Hong Dan.
- Yes.

70
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,000
You're home early for a change.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,269
You can prepare dinner today, right?

72
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,239
Oh, Mother. I'm pretty tired today.

73
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,179
Hong Dan. Even if you're tired,

74
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,310
you should make dinner
or at least help out...

75
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,950
when you come home early.

76
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:24,780
Every morning, you do nothing
to help out and just go to work.

77
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,419
In the evening,
you come home late...

78
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:27,790
and do nothing but eat dinner.

79
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,250
Must I do the housework alone?

80
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:33,660
What do you mean I do nothing?

81
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,829
I help out too, Mother.

82
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:38,260
Okay, so do some housework
and show me.

83
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,399
I'm stepping out to go to the shop.

84
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,310
So, you ran away alone.

85
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,139
Maeng Gong Boo!

86
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,240
Seriously.

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,479
Listen, No Ah. Don't tell anyone
you met Mom at the clinic today.

88
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,620
You bought me gummies,

89
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,320
so I'll keep it a secret.

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,019
My gosh, you little rascal.

91
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,560
Must you be so calculating already?

92
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:09,729
But why is it a secret
that I saw Mom today?

93
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,029
Well, that's...

94
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,769
It's the adults' problem,

95
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:17,769
so you don't need to know.

96
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,670
Then buy me more gummies.

97
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,539
I know you're my son,
but you really are just like me.

98
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,380
Hey, men must keep secrets
for each other.

99
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,750
I don't care about that.
I like my gummies.

100
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,479
Okay, fine.

101
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,589
Anyway, what did Mom do?

102
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,519
How did you meet your mom
at the clinic?

103
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,589
When Grandma and I
walked into the clinic,

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,459
Mom was right there.

105
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,370
So, she deliberately got a job
in the area.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,440
Mom is an amazing doctor.

107
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,769
I feel totally fine after taking
the medicine Mom gave me.

108
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,279
But I like Mommy Hong Dan too.

109
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,909
She's funny.

110
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,479
Right? That's my boy.

111
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,560
(Tiffany Alterations)

112
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,060
(Maeng Dumplings,
Tiffany Alterations)

113
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,300
What are you doing?

114
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,700
What are you doing here?

115
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,870
Well...

116
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,510
I want to help you in any way I can.

117
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,880
I want to apologize to you.

118
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,680
Can't you try
to put yourself in my shoes?

119
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,349
It makes me uncomfortable
to see you do this.

120
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,490
You're digging into my wounds.

121
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,089
Do you want to be forgiven?

122
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,060
I'm a wreck now.

123
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,200
Yet, you want to force me
to get up and accept your apology?

124
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,370
Is that what you want from me?

125
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,039
That's not it.

126
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,039
Please hear me out.

127
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,709
I told you. It's painful
for me to see you do this.

128
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:07,579
Don't ever do this again.

129
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,510
Oh, dear. Audrey.

130
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:13,450
It's just anemia.

131
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,050
Leave. Go!

132
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,889
Oh, my.

133
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,300
I told you...

134
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,029
to take good care of the shop.

135
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:29,300
So, what are you doing here?

136
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,110
- Thank you.
- Yes, come again.

137
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,779
Gyeong Tae isn't here,
and neither is Myung Ja.

138
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,620
I'm practically the owner
of this shop. My goodness.

139
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,820
They think
they're the only busy ones.

140
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:56,589
Hey, Gong Hee.

141
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,099
What? Dan Soo?

142
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,639
Audrey, you tell me.

143
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,409
I felt like I was talking to a wall
with my husband,

144
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,010
so why is he telling you
about his concerns...

145
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,440
and even picking out the shoes
to gift my mom with you?

146
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,979
There's bad news!

147
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,479
Oh, dear.

148
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,820
Gong Hee was in an accident.

149
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:23,219
What?

150
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,990
Gong Hee? What about her?
What accident?

151
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,560
I just got a call from Gong Hee.

152
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,599
She said she couldn't reach
either of you.

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,959
She said
it was a motorcycle accident...

154
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,700
- outside the office.
- What?

155
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,599
Dan Soo was by her side and also...

156
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,500
Wait. What did you say?

157
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,310
What did you just say?
Dan Soo was with her?

158
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,909
What? Dan Soo... Oh, right.

159
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,409
Well, Dan Soo was with her
and got into an accident,

160
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,250
so they went to the hospital.
Oh, my.

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,149
What?

162
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,280
Oh, dear. Let's go.

163
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:58,060
Wait. Why is she running?
My goodness.

164
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,060
(Ambulance,
Emergency Center Entrance)

165
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,060
Oh, my.

166
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,459
Where is she going? Hold on. Here.

167
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,170
- Hey, let's ask.
- Excuse me. Maeng Gong Hee...

168
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,629
- Dad.
- Oh, my.

169
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,839
- My gosh.
- Mom. Auntie.

170
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,170
Did you get hurt?
You were in an accident?

171
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,440
Were you badly hurt? Are you okay?

172
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,209
What is going on?
You went to work at the office.

173
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,509
On my way to an off-site meeting...

174
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,349
I wasn't being careful.

175
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,749
I'm fine. The baby is fine too.

176
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,290
But...

177
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,390
You said Dan Soo was with you.

178
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,989
Did Dan Soo save you?

179
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,660
Yes, Dan Soo is in there.

180
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:38,629
My goodness.

181
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,640
You're okay.

182
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,140
You're all right.

183
00:09:58,979 --> 00:09:59,979
Over here.

184
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:01,390
Oh, my.

185
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:02,619
Oh, dear.

186
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
My goodness.

187
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,790
Who's Mr. Gu Dan Soo's guardian?

188
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,660
Yes, it's me. I'm his guardian.

189
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,430
- What?
- Doctor, I am...

190
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,170
I'm his mother.

191
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,770
Please tell me.

192
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:23,369
Mother? What?

193
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,940
Is my Dan Soo okay?

194
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,810
How badly was he hurt?

195
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,780
Why isn't he awake?

196
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,650
Please calm down, ma'am.

197
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,050
Dan Soo. No...

198
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,050
Geon.

199
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,060
Geon, I'm here.

200
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,290
Your mom is here.

201
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,690
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,700
For leaving you like that.

203
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,670
Mom is so sorry
for leaving you alone.

204
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,270
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,940
Mom... Geon?

206
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,379
Oh, my.

207
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,800
If you're done wrapping up,

208
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,129
let's have dinner before we go home.

209
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,540
Seeing how Gong Hee isn't back yet,

210
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,499
her meeting must be running late.

211
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,180
Or maybe she's having dinner
with Executive Director Gu.

212
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,020
(Missed Call, Maeng Gong Hee)

213
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:46,459
- The person you have reached...
- See? She's not answering.

214
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,489
She must still be with Gu Dan Soo.

215
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:53,400
We still have stuff
to discuss about work too.

216
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,030
Can't we have a meal together
as colleagues on the same team?

217
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,969
Fine, let's eat together.

218
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,070
I think...

219
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,509
things were the best between us
when we were just friends.

220
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,450
You didn't stress me out
about marriage,

221
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,520
and I could be comfortable
around you without any pressure.

222
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:14,989
Is that so?

223
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,920
I guess I was hung up over
something impossible to begin with.

224
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,089
Your inferiority complex
was your charm.

225
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,259
Should I say
you had a fighting spirit...

226
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:25,999
that immature,
rich guys didn't have?

227
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,530
Every time we fought, you criticized
my inferiority complex.

228
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,770
Now, you're changing your tune?

229
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,410
It drew me in before we dated
because it was charming,

230
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,570
but once we started dating,

231
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,479
it was hard for me to handle.

232
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,810
I was lacking in that way,

233
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,509
not you.

234
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,719
Let's go.

235
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:50,489
Hey.

236
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,820
- Come on.
- Goodness.

237
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,629
My goodness.

238
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:58,499
(Emergency)

239
00:12:58,499 --> 00:12:59,499
- Hey.
- Oh, my.

240
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,070
You should all go home now.

241
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:05,369
Hey, you should come with us.

242
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,270
The baby must've had a scare too.

243
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,140
Right, you should get some rest
before you head home. Okay?

244
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,440
I'll tell Ssang Sook what happened.

245
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,249
No, I'm really fine.

246
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,950
I should stay and watch Dan Soo too.

247
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,719
Gosh, I wonder if he'll be okay.

248
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,190
I'm worried too.

249
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,219
Why is he still lying there,
unconscious?

250
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,890
I think he hit his head
on the ground...

251
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,430
as he fell while trying to save me.

252
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:32,700
The doctor says
he should be fine, though.

253
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,800
Anyway, I'll stay here.

254
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,770
I'll leave
once I see Dan Soo wake up.

255
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,800
When Dan Soo wakes up,

256
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,440
you should just come home with him.

257
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:43,739
An accident is still an accident.

258
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,680
You can't just ignore it.

259
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Right.

260
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:48,579
Oh, by the way,

261
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:51,249
Sleepwalker said...

262
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:54,249
she was Dan Soo's mom.
What was that about?

263
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,219
I know, right? I was so surprised...

264
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,790
that I couldn't believe
what I heard.

265
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,430
Oh, boy.

266
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:09,969
What's up with Gyeong Tae?
That's suspicious.

267
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,400
Did he know all about it?

268
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,839
Gyeong Tae.

269
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:21,079
Mom, you can stop worrying
and go home too, okay?

270
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:25,650
You're pregnant.
You should always be careful.

271
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:29,219
I know. I should keep Momo safe.

272
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,050
Did you call Min Gi?

273
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,259
Oh, no. Not yet.

274
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,290
I didn't want
to worry him for no reason.

275
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,999
But still,
how could your husband not know?

276
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,300
Hurry up and call him.

277
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,229
All right, Mom. You should go home.

278
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,969
I wish you'd come home with us.

279
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:49,670
You could have some porridge
and get some rest.

280
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,839
Gosh, Mom. I said I was fine.

281
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,379
Go home, okay?

282
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,450
Well, if Audrey is Dan Soo's mom,

283
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,920
what does it mean?

284
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:09,190
Goodness, that must've been
why she kept asking about Dan Soo.

285
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,900
It was so suspicious...

286
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,999
how she kept asking
about Dan Soo's dad too.

287
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:15,300
I know.

288
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,270
And she kept bringing us
side dishes too.

289
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,469
You're right. Last time,

290
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:26,040
the neighbor ladies made a fuss
and tried to kick her out.

291
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,879
And she acted like
she was about to leave,

292
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:31,450
but she ended up staying.

293
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,089
Dan Soo must've been the reason
she insisted on staying.

294
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,259
Then, Geon's mom who ran away
back in Kkotsan was...

295
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,589
My goodness.

296
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:47,930
The wife Geon's dad kept looking for
was Audrey.

297
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,099
I thought
she was such an awful woman.

298
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,469
I wonder what her story is.

299
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,570
And I wonder why
we only just found out.

300
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,310
Honey, you've been acting weird.

301
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,020
Did you know something?

302
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,219
No.

303
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:08,920
What would I know?

304
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,320
My goodness.

305
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,060
Tell me the truth.

306
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,200
Did you know about this?

307
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,099
I...

308
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,640
didn't know
from the beginning either.

309
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,079
Why didn't you tell me
something so important?

310
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,310
We took care of Dan Soo
when he was a kid.

311
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,579
And he's staying with us now,
like a member of the family.

312
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,579
How could you keep this to yourself?

313
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:43,790
Will you just act dumb
and keep your mouth shut again?

314
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,719
You kept meeting Audrey,

315
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,489
so I was wondering
what you were talking about.

316
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,790
Are you so close to her
that you'd keep this between you?

317
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,999
Is that what it is?

318
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:53,660
Come on.

319
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,430
It was because of
something I couldn't tell you.

320
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,670
Right, so what is that "something?"

321
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,440
How much longer
are you planning to keep it from me?

322
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,810
Am I not your wife?
Am I a stranger to you?

323
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,180
It's because I have sinned.
I'm a sinner!

324
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,820
Hey, Gyeong Tae.

325
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,150
My goodness.

326
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,890
Gosh, hey.

327
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,489
Don't do this to yourself.
It'll only upset you.

328
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,959
You know Gyeong Tae likes
to keep things to himself.

329
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,089
Shouldn't you get used to it by now?

330
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,900
I feel so anxious.

331
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:32,140
What could be a bigger secret
than this?

332
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,469
Oh, boy.

333
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,489
I'm good.

334
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,269
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,799
I didn't see the motorcycle.

336
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,610
Dan Soo saved me.

337
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,239
And he saved my baby too.

338
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,950
Why won't he wake up?

339
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,989
I think it's because
he hit his head a little.

340
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Maeng Gong Hee.

341
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:40,739
Are you all right?

342
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,469
Yes, I'm fine.

343
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:45,739
Are you really okay?

344
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,739
What about your baby?
Is the baby okay too?

345
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,150
Yes, the baby is okay too.

346
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,979
Hey, why did you jump in like that?

347
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,249
I never asked you to save me.
Why did you do that?

348
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,559
You really are fine, seeing how
you're nagging me like that.

349
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I'm relieved.

350
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,729
Dan Soo.

351
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,299
You woke up.

352
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
My gosh.

353
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:16,910
Hey, Dan Soo.

354
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,709
Don't be like this.
Hear me out first.

355
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,680
Who called this woman here?

356
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,319
Dan Soo.

357
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,719
Don't be like this.
She was so worried about you.

358
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:31,620
If you were truly worried about me,
you shouldn't be here.

359
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Why?

360
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,729
Did you want to see what it was like
to play a guardian?

361
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,590
To show up as my mom
and get a feel for it?

362
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,999
Then...

363
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,499
you should've turned around
to help me up 20 years ago.

364
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:45,340
If you would actually worry
about me getting hurt,

365
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,870
you should've turned around
back then.

366
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,910
Dan Soo, you need to rest now.

367
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,039
Lie down and...

368
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,549
If you know that, just leave.

369
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,120
Don't show yourself
in front of me again.

370
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,289
The person
who's torturing me the most...

371
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,219
is you.

372
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,370
I'll go and talk to him.

373
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Gu Dan Soo!

374
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,110
You can't leave like this.

375
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:33,219
Hey.

376
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:34,989
You're really okay, right?

377
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,390
So why did you do that?

378
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,719
While trying to save me,
you ended up...

379
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,090
Why are you so careless?

380
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,459
What if you got hurt?

381
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,529
All right. I'm sorry.

382
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,930
And thank you.

383
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:50,700
But...

384
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:54,170
Ms. Audrey was really worried
about you.

385
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,769
Why did you have to say
such mean things?

386
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:04,850
It's a price she has to pay,
don't you think?

387
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:07,549
The memories...

388
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,420
of being abandoned...

389
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,920
will haunt me forever.

390
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,190
Don't be like this.

391
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,090
She stayed right by your side
because she was worried.

392
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,600
Why bother now?

393
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:24,269
It's all pointless now.

394
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,279
You...

395
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:41,890
Please take good care of yourself.

396
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,049
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

397
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,989
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry.

398
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,989
But you were in an accident.

399
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,930
Follow the doctor's instructions
and keep up with your treatment.

400
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:57,789
Okay.

401
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,700
When you were staying with us
as a little boy,

402
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,529
I always felt so bad for you.

403
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:07,739
You rarely cried.
You were always so quiet.

404
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:10,509
You never asked for your mom
even though you must've missed her.

405
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:11,940
I thought,
"That kid must be heartbroken."

406
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,410
I knew...

407
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,749
she'd never come back
even if I asked for her.

408
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,049
She left when her own son
called out for her in tears.

409
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,519
She's a heartless person.

410
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,430
If I hadn't had you
and your family back then,

411
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,799
something bad
would've happened to me.

412
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,630
My gosh. We didn't even do anything.

413
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,029
Although, Gong Hee
was always looking out for you.

414
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:42,709
Thank you for saving Gong Hee today.

415
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,309
Thank you so much, Dan Soo.

416
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,039
So...

417
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,779
consider this
a gesture of gratitude...

418
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,549
and have some food. Please?

419
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,719
Here, hold on.

420
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:55,049
Try it.

421
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,590
You can eat
if you force yourself to eat, right?

422
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,590
Thank you.

423
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:09,170
The side dishes you loved
while staying with us...

424
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,029
were all made by Audrey.

425
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,340
At first, I didn't think much of it.

426
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,039
But now that I think about it,

427
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:20,580
I bet it was because
you were used...

428
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,979
to your mom's cooking.

429
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,249
She brought this braised beef too.

430
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,890
She abandoned her child and left,
and there's no need to justify it.

431
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,660
But I know this one thing.

432
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,959
The reason Audrey didn't leave
and held out...

433
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:40,799
even when the neighbors
hounded her to leave.

434
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,330
Now, I know that
it was all because of you, Dan Soo.

435
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,200
Maybe...

436
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,739
she was after something.

437
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:52,309
Well...

438
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,080
When I saw Audrey
at the hospital earlier,

439
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,910
she was there as your mother.

440
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,019
"I'm his mother."
No mom wails in tears like that...

441
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,690
for an ulterior motive.

442
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,959
She did that
just because she is a mom.

443
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,390
She couldn't help it
because she is your mom.

444
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Hurry up and eat.

445
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,420
I'm home.

446
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:36,120
What time is it now?
Why are you getting home so late?

447
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,650
You didn't even answer your phone.

448
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,319
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,319
- An accident...
- You barely...

450
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,529
just became a permanent employee.

451
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:44,890
Why do you have so much work?

452
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:49,299
You had dinner, right?

453
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,069
I've eaten too.

454
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,569
I'm running the dishwasher.

455
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,479
Put away the dishes
once the cycle is done.

456
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,400
Oh, you got home before I did.

457
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,239
You're getting in late.

458
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:28,039
I called you,
but you didn't pick up.

459
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,640
Right. I called you back,
but you didn't answer,

460
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,840
so I assumed you were busy.

461
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:39,420
There was an accident
in front of the office.

462
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
An accident?

463
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:44,789
Yes.

464
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,729
On my way to my meeting,

465
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,759
I saw you...

466
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,360
getting into the car with Ms. Kang
in front of the office.

467
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,670
- Buckle up.
- Okay.

468
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,120
I didn't realize what I was doing,
but I chased after the car.

469
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:16,549
And I was standing in the road...

470
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,459
when I was nearly run over
by a motorcycle.

471
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,930
Are you okay?

472
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,489
Had it not been for Dan Soo,

473
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,029
I might've been in a huge accident.

474
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,239
Dan Soo saved you?

475
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,870
Yes.

476
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,610
But you didn't even answer
your phone,

477
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:41,539
and you're just getting home now.

478
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,709
Sorry.

479
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,920
I never imagined something like this
would've happened.

480
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,150
My baby and I...

481
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,190
were in an emergency.

482
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,259
It was when I needed...

483
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,930
my husband
and my baby's father the most.

484
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:04,200
If you can't come running right away
in that situation,

485
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,170
I'm not really sure
how I'm supposed to trust you...

486
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,809
and live with you.

487
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:13,110
What do you mean by that?

488
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,789
(My Merry Marriage)

489
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:31,959
Did Mr. Seo get home all right
last night?

490
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:34,559
Did he not mention
that we had drinks together?

491
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,769
Please stop
with your useless tricks.

492
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,370
I just don't get it.

493
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:41,539
If she abandoned her son
and got money for it in return,

494
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,009
shouldn't she be living it large
by now?

495
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:46,380
Why is she still living
in that state?

496
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,809
I just don't understand.

497
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,249
Geon, this is the last birthday gift
you'll get from me.

498
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,080
