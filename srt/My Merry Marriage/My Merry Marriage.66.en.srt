1
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,090
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,859
(Episode 66)

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,999
What's going on?

4
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,870
I told you the designer
wouldn't be making an appearance.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,100
Well, the thing is...

6
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:42,280
Stage management team,
please bring the models backstage.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,109
Stage team!

8
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,109
What is this?

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,220
I thought Holly wasn't coming.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,220
How would I know?

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,350
Is Holly here or not?

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,390
What is this?

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,260
What's going on?

14
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,540
- What?
- Go and find out what's going on.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,900
- What is this?
- Yes, sir.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
My goodness.

17
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:20,720
Holly.

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,050
Please show up.

19
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:24,920
Please.

20
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,129
- Holly!
- Holly!

21
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,569
- Holly!
- Holly!

22
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,330
- Holly!
- Holly!

23
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,140
- Holly!
- Holly!

24
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,909
- Holly!
- Holly!

25
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,640
- Holly!
- Holly!

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,509
- Holly!
- Holly!

27
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,179
- Holly!
- Holly!

28
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,209
- Holly!
- Holly!

29
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,149
- Holly!
- Holly!

30
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:28,649
- Holly!
- Holly!

31
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,749
No way.

32
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,619
I don't believe this.

33
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,489
- Holly!
- Holly!

34
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,029
- Holly!
- Holly!

35
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,459
- Holly!
- Holly!

36
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,459
Oh, look!

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
What is going on?

38
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,739
What is Gu Dan Soo doing up there?

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,679
Thank you all for joining us today
and enjoying the show.

40
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm Holly, the designer
in this collaborative project.

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,820
Holly, please look here.

42
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,989
- On your left.
- Look here.

43
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,489
- Look here.
- Over here, Holly!

44
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,059
- Please look at the camera!
- Over here.

45
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:32,610
Hey, what are you doing?

46
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,550
You're Holly?

47
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:38,189
I'm sure I told you I was Holly,

48
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,550
Ms. Maeng Gong Hee.

49
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,630
Holly, why did you keep
your identity a secret?

50
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,989
Why did you suddenly decide
to reveal yourself?

51
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,429
What was the reason you decided
to collaborate with Jayce Fashion?

52
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:57,410
The collaborative project
and this fashion show...

53
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,640
were all Ms. Maeng Gong Hee's ideas.

54
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,679
All I did was respond
to Ms. Maeng's sincerity...

55
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:10,390
because she knows...

56
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,420
she's not alone.

57
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:27,070
Does it make any sense
that no one knew Dan Soo was Holly?

58
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,809
Min Gi, why do you think
I had you stay by Dan Soo's side?

59
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,380
It was to become your eyes
and to watch Dan Soo from close by.

60
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,110
So, how could you miss
such an important thing?

61
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:39,509
Did you not know?

62
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,980
Or did you not report it to me
even though you knew about it?

63
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,520
I didn't know either.

64
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,420
From what I've found out,

65
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,360
he entered a contest
while studying abroad...

66
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,989
and has been working as a designer
named Holly since then.

67
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,790
I should ask Dan Soo myself.

68
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,100
Have him come to the office
this instant.

69
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,369
He disappeared
after the fashion show,

70
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,800
and he won't answer his phone.

71
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,540
What on earth is going on?

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,770
I didn't even know that
and kept nagging him so much.

73
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,840
I thought he was neglecting
his business management training...

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,239
because he was busy wandering around
with a guitar on his back.

75
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:13,720
But he had been building such a career
even without my help.

76
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,879
You must be very happy.

77
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,790
Congratulations, ma'am.

78
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:19,989
Yes.

79
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,559
I guess I feel confused
because I'm so overjoyed.

80
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,999
I should hurry up
and announce him as my successor.

81
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,179
I knew it.

82
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:45,610
He was just hanging around,

83
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,920
but he had this vibe about him,
like he wasn't just slacking off.

84
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,220
Something like a genius.

85
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:53,989
I felt that about him.

86
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,129
Gu Dan Soo,
you're a man of many secrets.

87
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,960
He's smart, handsome,
and multitalented.

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,199
What is a man like me
supposed to do?

89
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,999
Gosh, but it's so weird.

90
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,540
Why do you think he kept it a secret
all this time?

91
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,970
I know how that feels.

92
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,069
Freedom.

93
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,480
That's what geniuses want.

94
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,850
What's so good about
letting the whole world know?

95
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,249
They don't need money or fame.

96
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,850
All they want is freedom.

97
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,520
That's it.

98
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,150
How do you know so well?

99
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,259
Well, a genius can relate to
a fellow genius, you know?

100
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,660
Is that right?

101
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,800
That must be why
you seek freedom so badly.

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,730
Oh, my. Director Lee!

103
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,329
Are you acknowledging me
as a genius?

104
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,300
- Thank you.
- What in the...

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,699
Well, anyway...

106
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,009
Thanks to him, Gong Hee
will become a permanent employee.

107
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,480
Oh, I'm so happy.

108
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,179
By the way,
didn't Gong Hee and Dan Soo say...

109
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,449
they had been friends
since childhood?

110
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,790
- Oh, gosh.
- Look where you're going.

111
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,790
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,829
I came back after cleaning up
the fashion show venue.

113
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,360
Gong Hee. You knew, didn't you?

114
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,369
That Gu Dan Soo was Holly!

115
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,040
I really didn't know either.

116
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,369
Come on. Really?

117
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,710
Did you never even suspect him?

118
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,710
No, I still can't believe it.

119
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,309
The chairwoman's grandson is Holly,

120
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:27,579
and I didn't even recognize him.
My goodness.

121
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,150
I didn't make
any other mistakes, did I?

122
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,150
Pardon?

123
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,819
What?

124
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,660
Oh, no! It's nothing.

125
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,929
You know
we're in emergency mode now, right?

126
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:39,360
We're having a meeting in an hour.

127
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,759
Since the real Holly has shown up,

128
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,530
we will revise
our entire marketing strategy!

129
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,869
What? Another meeting?

130
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,110
When can we go home, then?

131
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
What?

132
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,009
(Daycare Center)

133
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,050
Hello?

134
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
What?

135
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,249
My gosh.

136
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,689
Can we have
some more pickled radishes?

137
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,360
Oh, yes. Here you go.

138
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,189
- Thank you.
- Two mixed dumplings, please.

139
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,429
- Here it comes.
- Great.

140
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
- Enjoy. Oh, dear.
- Yes, thank you.

141
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,270
Mom, it's me.
Go to the daycare center quickly.

142
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,069
No Ah is sick.

143
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,270
What? What's wrong with him?

144
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,210
He has a stomachache.

145
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,110
Hong Dan is busy
because of the fashion show today.

146
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,340
Can you go instead?

147
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,480
And aren't I busy?

148
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,910
Mom, I have to consult
on a case today,

149
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,420
so I have to go
to the university hospital.

150
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,749
Do me this favor. I love you!

151
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,819
I love you!

152
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,389
Goodness, you only love me
when you have a favor to ask.

153
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,920
By the way,
where has this man gone now?

154
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,759
We're so busy now.

155
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:52,170
Detective An will stay by your side
and protect you for the time being.

156
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,740
You don't have to do that.

157
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,140
I don't have much to do these days,
so it's fine.

158
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,280
Don't feel burdened.

159
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,910
Just go where you want to...

160
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,650
and do what you want.

161
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,380
Then, this guy will take care
of everything.

162
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,559
I won't do as you wish anymore.

163
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:18,990
I won't move aside just like this.

164
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,729
Even if I end up leaving,

165
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,929
I will see my son before I go.

166
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,000
Then, Detective An.

167
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,709
I'll depend on you
for just a little while.

168
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,109
You got it.

169
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,319
Why won't you pick up
after making such a mess?

170
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,089
Reporter Park? What happened?

171
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,630
This isn't what we agreed on.

172
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,500
Aren't you the one
who isn't sticking to her word?

173
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,800
I had everything planned,
thinking Holly wouldn't show up.

174
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,530
What on earth is going on?

175
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,870
Still, how could you
just stand there...

176
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,569
to get an interview
with the person in charge?

177
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,069
That's not why I gave you
this information beforehand!

178
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,010
Everyone is going crazy
because of Holly right now.

179
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,949
I have to get to a meeting
because of that too.

180
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,410
Don't call me for the time being.

181
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,679
My goodness.

182
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,650
Hello?

183
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,459
Everything would've been fine
if Holly hadn't shown up.

184
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:28,429
Then Gong Hee's promotion
and everything else...

185
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,400
could've been taken care of
all at once.

186
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,300
Gu Dan Soo was Holly?

187
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
What kind of joke is this,
Gu Dan Soo?

No Ah.

190
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,390
No Ah.

191
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,459
No Ah, are you okay? What's wrong?

192
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:57,890
My gosh. Hello, ma'am.

193
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
No Ah.

194
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,329
No Ah.

195
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:02,729
You're here.

196
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,429
I called No Ah's dad too.

197
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,300
How long has he been like this?

198
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,400
It's been a while.

199
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,540
He said he had a stomachache
and has been like this ever since.

200
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,640
He didn't want to go
to the doctor either.

201
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:15,240
No Ah, wake up. No Ah?

202
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,079
Gosh, this won't do.

203
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:21,050
I'll carry him
and go to the hospital. Come on.

204
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:31,459
You...

205
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,290
What are you doing?

206
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,130
I'm pretending to be Dad
who stays in bed all day...

207
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,329
on the weekends.

208
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140

211
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,589
Yes, Director Lee.

212
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,630
Why aren't you coming
to the meeting, Ms. Genius?

213
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,030
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

214
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:14,740
I thought geniuses wanted freedom.

215
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:18,069
Why don't you just quit your job
and become free?

216
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:21,609
Well, I said I'd be there soon.

217
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:22,609
I...

218
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,179
Gosh, seriously.
This is driving me crazy.

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
What's up with you?

220
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,459
Did you do that
to pull a prank on me?

221
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:40,030
I didn't call you, lady.

222
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
What?

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,699
I thought you asked for your mom
because you were sick.

224
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
I asked for my mom.

225
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,339
My mom who's in the US.

226
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,469
Your mom is in the US.
How can she come here?

227
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Why, that...

228
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,550
Hey.

229
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,780
Why are you yelling
at a kid who's sick?

230
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,819
- Grandma.
- Hey.

231
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,420
All right. Where does it hurt?
Oh, my sweet baby.

232
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,260
Mother, why are you here?

233
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,329
Gong Boo called me.

234
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,699
How did you leave the office?

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,800
I got the call at work
and hurried over, but he...

236
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,439
He was pretending to be sick.

237
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,439
Goodness, he's just a kid.

238
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:25,910
I'm sure he had a reason
for pretending to be sick.

239
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,709
What reason can there be
for pretending to be sick?

240
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,479
If you do that again,

241
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:33,410
I'll really scold you.

242
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,479

243
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,479
Oh, my...

244
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Mother, I have to get back to work.

245
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Tell Gong Boo to pick up No Ah.

246
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:51,170
It's okay. Mommy is just busy.

247
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,170
She's not my mom.

248
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
What?

249
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:58,209
My mom is Lee Soo Yeon.

250
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,240
She's a doctor,

251
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,479
and she's in the US.

252
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,339
Oh, dear.

253
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,679
Goodness, what will we do with you?

254
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,719
I made sure Holly's interview
won't be released for now.

255
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,520
Until he shows up in person
and makes his position clear,

256
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,089
we will observe the situation
and see how it goes.

257
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,959
What did the chairwoman say?

258
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,459
Until we decide
on our marketing direction,

259
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,130
she wants to keep the media out,

260
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,370
and she said
we should all keep our lips sealed.

261
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:29,170
But the collaboration
will continue, right?

262
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,709
Yes. In addition
to Holly's appearance,

263
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,410
all the pieces at the show
got amazing feedback.

264
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,849
I'll be in charge of the project
with Holly going forward.

265
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,880
What? Gong Hee started the project,

266
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
so we should let her wrap it up.

267
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,819
Besides, Gong Hee
will soon become a permanent employee,

268
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,819
so she's more than qualified.

269
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:53,859
Anyway, the show was a success
thanks to Gong Hee's hard work.

270
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,959
Let's give Gong Hee
a big round of applause!

271
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,030
Gong Hee, you're amazing.

272
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,670
Well done.

273
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,500
Thank you.

274
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,109
My gosh.

275
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,479
The meeting is over.
You just got here?

276
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,719
Well, the thing is...

277
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,990
I see. "The thing is."

278
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,760
Thanks for your explanation.

279
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,990
What? Wait.

280
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,760
What was decided at the meeting?

281
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,099
For now, we'll focus on calming the storm
after Holly's appearance.

282
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:39,469
My gosh. I hope someone
can calm the storm in my life now.

283
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,380
Gong Hee, shouldn't you
go on a vacation or something?

284
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,609
You need a vacation.

285
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,750
No, I'm good.

286
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,189
Don't you get it?
Or are you just playing dumb?

287
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,729
Are you excited
to become a permanent employee?

288
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,660
Try all you want.

289
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,260
You can't stop us
from getting married.

290
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,530
Congratulations in advance
on your wedding.

(Bubble Up Laundry)

292
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,120
Mom, I'm home!

293
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:42,069
I came so late, didn't I?
Where is No Ah?

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He's asleep.

295
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,969
I have to take him home.

296
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,469
Just let him sleep here tonight.

297
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,740
Well, Hong Dan called me.

298
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:54,109
My gosh. He feigned sickness,
just like I used to.

299
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,020
Have you wondered
why he pretended to be sick?

300
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:01,660
- What?
- He said he missed his mom.

301
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,760
You think he's okay
because he's not sick physically?

302
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,790
He's heartbroken.

303
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,000
Well...

304
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,859
He can't see his mom now
because she's in the US.

305
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,030
What on earth is the matter
with Hong Dan?

306
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,670
She took him,
saying she'd raise him well.

307
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,140
I don't expect her
to think of him as her own,

308
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,699
but she should
at least act like she cares.

309
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,849
Gosh, it's so cold.

310
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,889
Why did you come home alone?
What about No Ah?

311
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,020
Oh, Mom wanted
to let him sleep there tonight.

312
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,419
No Ah said
he didn't want to come home.

313
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,329
What? He didn't want to come home?

314
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,559
I guess he misses his mom.

315
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:46,169
You know, when I was little,

316
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,899
I missed my mom,

317
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,040
so I always told my kindergarten teachers
that my tummy hurt.

318
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,909
Clearly, he takes after me.

319
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,369
Goodness.
I get that he takes after you,

320
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:56,210
but he even got
his malingering skills from you?

321
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,909
Anyway,
why did you have to spank his butt?

322
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,379
Don't you feel bad for him?

323
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,079
When did I spank his butt?

324
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,849
Did No Ah say that?

325
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:07,119
My goodness. That rascal...

326
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,960
even accused me
of something I never did?

327
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,389
Forget it. That's enough.
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

328
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,730
You didn't make dinner?

329
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Me?

330
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:16,930
Yes, who else?

331
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:18,869
Oh, well...

332
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,300
You didn't prepare dinner?
What do you want me to do?

333
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,809
So, you want me to take care
of housework, go to work,

334
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,569
deal with No Ah
and everything at daycare,

335
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:27,909
and make dinner too?

336
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,780
I'm pregnant too.

337
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,109
Hey, is Ssook Ssook not your child?

338
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,919
I should've had dinner
at Mom's place.

339
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,690
Why did you only leave No Ah there?

340
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,790
You should live there too!

341
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,819
Darn you.

342
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,990
Come on, Hong Dan. Let's eat out...

343
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,730
Unbelievable.

344
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,430
I'd rather enlist
than deal with this. Yes.

345
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:55,300
The army is
a hundred times better than this!

346
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,909
Hong Dan is scarier...

347
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:59,470
than any senior military officer
I've met.

348
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,010
Honey, did you hear that?

349
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,349
Darn you.

350
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,760
That immature kid was
the mysterious fashion designer?

351
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,490
Is that really true?

352
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,030
Because of it, Chairwoman Hwang...

353
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,059
seems to think differently
of Dan Soo now.

354
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,030
My goodness.

355
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,270
In the past, she treated him
like a clueless, reckless child,

356
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,540
but things will change now.

357
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:33,470
Work harder
to assist Dan Soo well at all times.

358
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,280
Work is very busy now,

359
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
but my wedding...

360
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,079
will happen as planned.

361
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,889
Yes, of course.

362
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,589
Just because the immature Dan Soo
is actually a famous designer,

363
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,790
it doesn't mean your wedding plans
should be affected.

364
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,829
Nothing can or will stop you two...

365
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,599
from getting married,
no matter what.

366
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,430
The meeting with Ji Na's family
has been scheduled.

367
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,599
You should be there too, Dad.

368
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:01,569
My gosh.

369
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,740
My son really is getting married.

370
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,740
My goodness.

371
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,639
How do you plan on telling
Chairwoman Hwang about it?

372
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:14,180
I'll tell her
as I invite her to my wedding.

373
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,190
She'll be livid.

374
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:21,319
You'd better be ready.

375
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,220
What? Why would she be livid?

376
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,430
Just tell her
we'd appreciate a big cash gift.

377
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,430
Seriously.

378
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,599
Good grief.

379
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,329
Ji Na didn't say anything else,
did she?

380
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,839
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

381
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,839
What?

382
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,079
If there's something you're hiding,
just tell me.

383
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,649
Ji Na has been acting weird too.

384
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,849
Weird, how?

385
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,149
She seems to be on edge and...

386
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,319
Oh, don't worry about that.

387
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
All women get like that
before their wedding.

388
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,930
There's a term for it, you know.

389
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:00,990
Pre-wedding blues.

390
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,430
You know.

391
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,700
You're sure you're not hiding
anything from me, right?

392
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,240
Yes, I am sure.
Why do you keep asking me that?

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,869
Here. Eat up, okay?

394
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,250
Only trouble awaits
if I don't step in now.

395
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,609
I must act quickly.

396
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:38,700
Hey, what are you doing?

397
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,599
You're Holly?

398
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,300
I'm sure I told you I was Holly,

399
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:45,639
Ms. Maeng Gong Hee.

400
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:49,379
I still can't believe it.

401
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,879
Snot Face Geon is Holly?

402
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,450
The fashion designer I had admired
for so long was Gu Dan Soo?

403
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,419
My goodness.

404
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:18,639
Because she knows she's not alone.

405
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,079
This is considered cheating.

406
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,079
How could you do this?

407
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,809
And you disappeared again.

408
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,010
You won't even answer my calls.

409
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,020
There are so many things
I want to ask you and tell you.

410
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,119
So many things.

411
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,220
My gosh.

412
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:42,500
No Ah doesn't want to go to daycare.
What should we do?

413
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,930
Goodness, I know.

414
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,129
What can we do?
We should send him to daycare.

415
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,300
He kept saying he didn't want to go.
I felt bad after making him go.

416
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,109
I feel bad for you, Myung Ja.

417
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:55,579
You'd be sighing nonstop
even if you had...

418
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:58,510
no one else to worry about
except for your children.

419
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,409
Now, you even have to worry
about your grandson. Oh, boy.

420
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:04,220
I think you'll end up raising No Ah
at this rate.

421

Why are you here again?

424
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,700
Has your daughter
still not told you?

425
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:20,770
Why do you keep bringing up
my daughter?

426
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,839
What is it?

427
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,770
Go on and tell me.

428
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:30,440
What has happened to my daughter?

429
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,819
Fine, I'll tell you.

430
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,319
I must tell you for her own sake
as this is wrong.

431
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:39,990
Your daughter is...

432
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:41,760
pregnant.

and checked.
