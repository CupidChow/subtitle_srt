1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,140
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,380
(Court)

3
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,920
I wish you happiness.

4
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,020
As Momo's dad,

5
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,990
be happy.

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Until the end,

7
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,690
you leave me with nothing to say.

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,510
My gosh.

9
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,510
(Episode 104)

10
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,510
(Maeng Dumplings)

11
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,150
I heard about Gong Hee.

12
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,480
You must have a lot on your mind.

13
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,490
I regret what I did.

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,520
If only...

15
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,030
I hadn't pressured her like that
back then...

16
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,200
About what happened
to Dan Soo's dad...

17
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,830
I know
it wasn't entirely your fault.

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,800
It was an accident.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,340
It couldn't have been avoided.

20
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,940
But if only...

21
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,810
you hadn't called Hae Joon there,

22
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,180
and if only...

23
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,680
you'd cared more about
Hae Joon's safety...

24
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,420
than catching the criminal...

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,790
I still resent you
throughout the day.

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,330
Still to this day,
I can't forgive you.

27
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,060
Right.

28
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,930
I know.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,770
But Chairwoman Hwang is scarier
than my resentment.

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,480
She turned...

31
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,510
the guilt of losing her son...

32
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,980
into hatred in order to survive.

33
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,290
That's why
she blamed me for everything...

34
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,790
and was so obsessed with Dan Soo.

35
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,190
You know all about it.

36
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,700
If Dan Soo says
he wants to marry Gong Hee,

37
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,160
she won't sit idly by.

38
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,270
She'll do a thorough background check
on your family.

39
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,500
And if she finds out
about your past...

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,410
Then I don't know what she would do.

41
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,510
My son, Dan Soo,

42
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,410
has had to struggle so much
because of me.

43
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,250
I really don't want to see him...

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,150
get hurt again.

45
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,630
Please stay strong.

46
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,130
Yes.

47
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,700
I should.

48
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,530
Let's go inside.
The family is waiting.

49
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,070
Okay, let's go.

50
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,010
I'm home.

51
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,550
Yes, just in time for dinner. Sit.

52
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,420
Dinner? We shouldn't miss it.

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,550
Everything looks delicious.

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,620
Did everything go well?

55
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,690
Yes, Mom.

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm your aunt, Ssook Ssook.

57
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,170
When can Momo come home?

58
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,940
I think they need to keep him there
for a little longer.

59
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,110
Goodness. Don't worry too much.

60
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,780
Babies born a few months early
grow up just fine.

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
That's right.

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,690
I was born way after you,

63
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,750
but I'm much taller than you.

64
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,120
That's different.
Stop talking nonsense.

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,530
Don't be so down.

66
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,590
You need to eat well...

67
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,630
so Momo can get all the strength
he needs to grow up well.

68
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Oh, gosh.

69
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,350
Did you close up the shop?

70
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,420
Yes, it was dead quiet.

71
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,890
Dad.

72
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,130
It all went well.

73
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Oh, boy.

74
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,470
Oh, dear.

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,780
What's wrong?

76
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,010
She barely
pulled herself together...

77
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,750
and started eating.
Don't pressure her like that.

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
My gosh.

79
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,050
Goodness.

80
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,290
What? Brighten up and come on out.

81
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,520
Let's eat together.

82
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,460
I ruined...

83
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,200
Gong Hee's life.

84
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,440
My goodness.

85
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,770
What's wrong this time?

86
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,070
You always look so glum
and go around sighing all the time.

87
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,240
Whose life is ruined?

88
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,510
My daughter's life
hasn't been ruined at all.

89
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,880
Don't you dare say that again.

90
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
She can still live a good life.

91
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,320
Does getting a divorce mean
that her life is in shambles?

92
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,460
What's wrong with you?
Stop this and get out there.

93
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,030
Why are you doing this?
You'll hurt Gong Hee's feelings.

94
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,260
It's my fault.

95
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,030
It's all my fault.

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,870
Fine, it's your fault.

97
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,240
So what are you going to do?

98
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,770
How will you take responsibility?

99
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,060
I knew this might happen.

100
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,300
I didn't want Mom and Dad
to be sad because of me,

101
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,160
so I wanted
to make my marriage work.

102
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,570
I didn't want them to see me
go through something like this.

103
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,370
That's why I put up with everything.

104
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,410
No matter what you go through,

105
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,010
your family should be there
to see it. Who else?

106
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,750
That's what family is.

107
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,080
It's okay to show them everything...

108
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,780
like your weaknesses
you want to hide from everyone...

109
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,520
or how you stumble and fall apart.

110
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,620
How could you only show them
the good parts of your life?

111
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,660
You can fall apart
as much as you want...

112
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,930
and struggle.

113
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,600
This is your home.

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,530
You're allowed to be weak here.

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,140
As soon as I got married,

116
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,740
this house wasn't my home anymore.

117
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,410
It became my parents' home.

118
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,440
When I came home,

119
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,880
everyone would start worrying,

120
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,150
thinking something
might have happened.

121
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,750
So, I couldn't come here so easily.

122
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,690
But then, something did happen,

123
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,590
and I actually moved back in.

124
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,260
Seeing that my family is sad
because of me...

125
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,400
It really breaks my heart.

126
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,180
As life goes on,

127
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,850
records of sadness keep adding on
in layers.

128
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,090
Seeing my daughter feeling dejected
from her failed marriage...

129
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,190
and seeing my mom growing weaker
as each day goes by...

130
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,530
both hurt.

131
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,000
The weight of sadness...

132
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,700
slows down my footsteps.

133
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,650
I'm here, Mom.

134
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,090
Mom.

135
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,890
Mom.

136
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Mom.

137
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,970
Are you here again?

138
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,900
Yes, Mom.

139
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
(Kang Myung Ja's Book of Poetry)

140
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,360
"White clouds in the sky."

141
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,630
"At the sudden rain,
'Oh, how cold.'"

142
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,670
"I put on my coat..."

143
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,330
"as the raindrops blow in the wind."

144
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,670
As Mom read
her young children fairy tales,

145
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,270
I now read poetry for my mom...

146
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,080
who has become a child again.

147
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,850
Just like the warm sound
of Mom's voice...

148
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,850
as she read each word out loud,

149
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,720
I am now holding Mom's hand...

150
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,560
as I read to her slowly.

151
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,420
Mom smiles.

152
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,830
Sometimes, she tears up...

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,570
and speaks quietly.

154
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,800
"Oh, how nice."

155
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,900
"This is so nice."

156
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,870
This is nice.

157
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,440
This is so nice.

158
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,380
Mom. Thank you.

159
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,350
For what?

160
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,850
For staying by my side like this.

161
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,460
Thank you so much.

162
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,200
No matter how sad I get,

163
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,800
and no matter how hard things are,

164
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,970
I'm glad...

165
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,670
that you're alive.

166
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,880
Because you're here with me,

167
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,810
it feels so warm...

168
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,080
and peaceful.

169
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,860
My goodness.

170
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,840
Is this what you call cleaning?

171
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,880
Do it again properly.

172
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,190
I could do such mere tasks...

173
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,650
over and over again.

174
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,590
Do you think this will make me
accept you as my family?

175
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,360
In your dreams.

176
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,700
When I look at your face,

177
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,730
a fire rages inside me.

178
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,540
At first,

179
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I came here because
I wanted to grant Dan Soo's wish.

180
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,610
But now, I've also realized...

181
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,280
there's so much to resolve
before I leave.

182
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,120
I won't run away...

183
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,250
or avoid things.

184
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,290
Do you know how I raised Hae Joon?

185
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,130
I lost my husband at a young age...

186
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,030
and worked in a clothing factory
until I couldn't stand up straight.

187
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,070
I only endured everything
and hung in there...

188
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,130
because of Hae Joon.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,170
I'd starve...

190
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,970
or eat the least bit...

191
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,010
to start my company
just so I could raise my son.

192
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,010
I bet my entire life...

193
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,380
on my son.

194
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,050
That son of mine,

195
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,620
who had never once
rebelled against me,

196
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,760
met you,

197
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,330
and because of
a mere thing like you...

198
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,660
Yes, I know that too.

199
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,360
Hae Joon was...

200
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,330
a warmhearted and strong person.

201
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,140
You...

202
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,070
don't have to forgive me.

203
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,540
But please don't hate the choice...

204
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,880
your beloved son made.

205
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,680
If Hae Joon were here,

206
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,280
he wouldn't want you...

207
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,850
to spend the rest of your life...

208
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,690
in resentment and rage.

209
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,060
As I turned away
after burying my son in the cold ground,

210
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,070
I made myself a single promise.

211
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,700
That I'd never let the person
who did that to Hae Joon...

212
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,240
get away with what they did.

213
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,580
That I'd track down
every last person who was there...

214
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,610
and even their families
and relatives...

215
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,480
to get my revenge on all of them.

216
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,220
The same goes for you.

217
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,660
You drove my son to his death.

218
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,300
I can't forgive you.

219
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,030
I will never forgive you.

220
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,040
Gong Boo, this is...

221
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,450
a name that the relatives
came up with for Ssook Ssook.

222
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,680
- Okay.
- What?

223
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,920
But we should get to name
Ssook Ssook.

224
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,020
Apparently, they went to
a famous naming specialist for it,

225
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
so take a look.

226
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
I see.

227
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,030
Maeng...

228
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Se Han?

229
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,500
It sounds like she'd be really good
at taking an oath.

230
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,140
Hey, how about naming her
Maeng Rang Hee...

231
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,840
so she grows up to be cheerful?

232
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Come on, Auntie.

233
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,070
Gong Hee and I were teased so much
for our names too.

234
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,540
Still, it's all thanks to
your studious-sounding name...

235
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,680
that you got good grades
and went to medical school.

236
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,850
Come on. So what if
he was a good student?

237
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,620
A good character comes first.

238
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,490
Character over grades.

239
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,520
Let's go with Maeng In Sung.
In Sung as in "character."

240
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,560
I see, Gyeong Tae.

241
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,360
I guess you want to name
your own grandchild.

242
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Goodness.

243
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,300
How about Mi So, as in "smile?"

244
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,770
So she can always smile.

245
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
"Laughter" will be better.

246
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,610
If she'll smile and laugh anyway...

247
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,880
She might as well
laugh her head off.

248
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,950
My goodness. Just choose...

249
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,620
a soft-sounding name
that rolls off the tongue.

250
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,920
As for Ssook Ssook,

251
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,590
I want to name her myself.

252
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,360
It looks like Hong Dan
has a specific name in mind.

253
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,930
She is No Ah's sister.
Hence the name, Maeng Re Ah.

254
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,230
Rhea is the name of a female deity.

255
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,330
My goodness.
That name sounds so foreign.

256
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,440
Re Ah?

257
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,970
I like it.

258
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,240
These days, many people
go for names that sound foreign.

259
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,510
They don't need a separate English name
when they go overseas.

260
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,180
Re Ah, so she can live
and work globally later on.

261
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,850
I like that. It's nice.

262
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,180
No Ah's little sister, Re Ah.

263
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,720
From now on, you're Re Ah.

264
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,220
Call Re Ah's name
as often as you can.

265
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,230
Okay! Re Ah.

266
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,890
- Re Ah.
- My gosh.

267
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,630
You should name Momo soon too.

268
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,130
Hold on.

269
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,100
Then will his surname be Seo...

270
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,610
or Maeng?

271
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,740
I want it to be Maeng.

272
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,180
Momo is my child, you know.

273
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,150
- Right.
- Yes.

274
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,450
Yes, that's nice.

275
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,190
(Birthing Center)

276
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,360
You can see him for 30 minutes.

277
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,460
Thank you.

278
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,670
(Hankuk University Hospital)

279
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,670
(Neonatal Intensive Care Unit)

280
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,640
(Hankuk University Hospital)

281
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,640
I was supposed to see him today.

282
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,410
It looked like today was
the only day that could work,

283
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,410
so I came to see him.

284
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,610
What are you saying?

285
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,480
The visiting hours are set.

286
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,250
I can't see Momo if you show up
without even telling me.

287
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,320
You've been taking up
all the visiting hours,

288
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,560
so it was hard for me
to find the time to see Momo.

289
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,790
I'll go in and see Momo now.

290
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,830
Oh, right. My mom...

291
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,430
went to a naming specialist
and got some names for Momo.

292
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,870
I'll text you the names.

293
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,540
I will name Momo myself.

294
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,910
You know children must take...

295
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,110
their biological father's surname
under the current law.

296
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,340
She got the best names
for the surname, Seo. Take a look.

297
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,950
There is no such law.

298
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,310
Even after divorce,

299
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,150
children must keep
their father's surname.

300
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,980
If we'd wanted our child
to take your surname,

301
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,950
we should've specified it
when registering our marriage.

302
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,260
We agreed that
you'd get full custody of the child.

303
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,430
And I won't raise an issue with it.

304
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,660
As for our baby's surname,
let's just follow the law.

305
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,330
He's my child too,
so I think I can expect this much.

306
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,010
(Hankuk University Hospital,
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit)

307
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,410
It's getting late,

308
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,720
so I made some green tea
instead of coffee.

309
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,150
That's okay, right?

310
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
Mother.

311
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,320
Don't you know
green tea also contains caffeine?

312
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,360
Caffeine is like poison at night,
so I avoid it at all costs.

313
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,490
Do you?

314
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,030
I'd like some freshly squeezed juice
next time.

315
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,070
Something
that's not so high in sugar.

316
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,640
Look at this brat. Does she think
I'm her daughter-in-law?

317
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Anyway,

318
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,010
what brings you here so late?

319
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,810
Every time I bring up marriage
in front of Min Gi,

320
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,510
he just keeps telling me to wait.

321
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,180
He says it's not the right time yet.

322
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,050
But putting it off
won't change anything.

323
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,480
I hope
we can make up our minds soon...

324
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,120
and try to convince my mom first.

325
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,060
You should try putting yourself
in Min Gi's shoes too.

326
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Even if
Min Gi is completely determined,

327
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,530
it won't be easy to convince my mom,
as you already know.

328
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,470
Mother,
please convince Min Gi for me.

329
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,370
I'm home.

330
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,170
My gosh. You're here.

331
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,940
Is the baby doing well?

332
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,710
How is he?

333
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,240
When will he be discharged?

334
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,780
He has almost fully recovered.

335
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,750
They said he'd be discharged soon.

336
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,480
Really? Then when can he come home?

337
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,490
I'll see. I'll try to bring him home
on the weekend.

338
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,620
What about his name?

339
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,590
Is she going to pick
one of the names I got?

340
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,160
I think Gong Hee wanted the baby
to take her surname.

341
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,530
But we looked into it,

342
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,000
and it can't be done legally.

343
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,300
We can't let him take
his mother's surname.

344
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,140
I'm upset that she divorced you
and got full custody.

345
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,840
She wanted him to take her surname,
Maeng? No way.

346
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,380
Thank goodness
we can count on the law.

347
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Oh, boy.

348
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,220
How could you
only talk about the baby...

349
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,760
as soon as you get home
while I'm here?

350
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,030
Am I invisible to you?

351
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,190
Is your child
your number one priority now?

352
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,460
It's not like that.

353
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,600
Then what is it?

354
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,700
You've changed
since your baby was born.

355
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,540
While going through
the divorce process,

356
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,270
you kept talking about your baby
and neglected me.

357
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,270
It was something
Gong Hee and I had to take care of.

358
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,280
It was an important matter.

359
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,280
Then what about how I feel?

360
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,510
Do you not care about me at all?

361
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,450
You got divorced
to start over with me.

362
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,120
So why do I have to
get pushed off to the side?

363
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,530
Why is that still on your wall?

364
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,870
Kang Ji Na!

365
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,770
Why?
Do you still have feelings for her?

366
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,970
Do you want to cancel the divorce?

367
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,240
I didn't have time to take it down
because I've been so busy.

368
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,750
That's enough, okay?

369
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,520
I've come this far only for you,
Seo Min Gi.

370
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,550
Never forget the choice I made.

371
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,760
Do not make me regret my choice.

372
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,530
Yes.

373
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,200
I'll be more attentive.

374
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,580
(Yu Hyun, Do Hoon, Ji Oh)

375
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,310
Well...

376
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,690
"Eun Woo, Seo Joon, Han Bin."

377
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,320
Did you get these baby names
off some blog post?

378
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,260
They say common names are better.

379
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,200
Other kids always made fun of my name
and called me Maeng Ggong.

380
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,730
Hey,
Maeng Ggong the Toad is so cool.

381
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,770
It may be tiny,
but it can beat any predators.

382
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,600
I like my name too. My dad named me.

383
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,570
But Momo might feel differently,
you know.

384
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,010
Then how about...

385
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,610
We want Momo to live freely,

386
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,150
so how about Ja Yu as in "freedom?"
Maeng Ja Yu.

387
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,020
What is that?

388
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,850
Maeng Ja Yu? That sounds absurd.

389
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,160
Also, I learned that Momo...

390
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,030
couldn't take my surname, Maeng.

391
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,530
What? Why not?

392
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,930
The law requires children
to take their father's surname.

393
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,330
What kind of law is that?

394
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,730
My point, exactly.

395
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,000
If you want your baby
to take the mother's surname,

396
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,900
you have to specify it
when registering your marriage.

397
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,940
What? You could do it
when registering the baby's birth.

398
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,340
How could you have done it
when you got married?

399
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,440
I know. It makes no sense.

400
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,620
Come on. The baby's surname
isn't really important.

401
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,750
His name is what matters.

402
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,460
Gu Reum. How about Gu Reum?

403
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,960
Gu Reum?

404
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,790
Yes, Gu Reum as in "cloud."

405
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,690
A cloud is like
a work of art in the sky.

406
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,530
Cumulus clouds, cirrus clouds,
and sheep clouds.

407
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,470
They come together and scatter...

408
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,900
while leaving beautiful drawings
in the sky.

409
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,540
Yes, I like that.

410
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,270
Most importantly, clouds are free.

411
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,410
They can change their shapes
freely...

412
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,610
and float around freely
to see the whole world.

413
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,450
Yes, Momo's name is Gu Reum.

414
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,390
All right!
Let's get up and get moving.

415
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,660
Why? What are we doing?

416
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,390
We need to deep-clean the house
to bring Gu Reum home.

417
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,290
I bet you've been cutting corners
with cleaning while I was gone.

418
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,900
I won't leave
a single dust particle behind.

419
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,960
I will deep-clean everything here!

420
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
- What?
- Come on.

421
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,490
Oh, I guess the light bulb went out.

422
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
Got it.

423
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,050
Hand that over. I'll do it.

424
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,490
No, I'm a single parent now.

425
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,720
I should do these things on my own.

426
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,790
Hey, I can reach it so easily.

427
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,790
Why would you do it yourself?

428
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,430
When you're not here,

429
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,030
I'd have to do these things
on my own.

430
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,630
Why wouldn't I be here?

431
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,900
I'll always be here from now on.

432
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,340
Whatever. Hand that over.

433
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,380
There, it's done.
Turn on the switch.

434
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Okay.

435
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
Nice.

436
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,280
Oh, my.

437
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,790
Hey, that ring...

438
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,020
Why do you have that
around your neck?

439
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,860
Didn't you throw it out?

440
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,490
Why would I throw this out?

441
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,060
This is irreplaceable.

442
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,060
- Give it here.
- Come on. This is my talisman.

443
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,630
Even in France,
I kept this on me every day.

444
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,900
I'd never give this up.

445
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,410
Gu Dan Soo...

446
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,110
Why?

447
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,180
Were you touched?

448
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,780
Come on. Touched? As if.

449
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,580
I'm too anxious...

450
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
to let you change lightbulbs
on your own.

451
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,720
I'll be right by your side
and watch you for life.

452
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Just letting you know.

453
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,920
Hey, get away from me.

454
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,690
Why should I?

455
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,490
Hey, go away.

456
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,230
- But why?
- Hey, put this away.

457
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,000
Go.

458
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,140
(Birthing Center,
Hankuk University Hospital)

459
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,780
My Gu Reum.

460
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,980
You've gotten big and strong
since last time.

461
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,120
You're going home with Mommy.

462
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,420
(Hankuk University Hospital,
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit)

463
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,860
We agreed that I'd take Momo home.

464
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
I know.

465
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,560
But I just had to come
and see him leave the hospital.

466
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,930
I'll take you guys home.
Let's go to my car.

467
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,040
Come with me, Maeng Gong Hee.

468
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,280
This is my child.
You stay out of this.

469
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,830
Gu Dan Soo.

470
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,800
Hurry up, will you?

471
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,370
Indeed.

472
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,630
No matter
what kind of predator you face,

473
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,170
you never lose,

474
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
Maeng Ggong.

475
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,190
(My Merry Marriage)

476
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,900
Did Dan Soo decorate
the baby's room for you?

477
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,370
Gu Reum,
this is your room from now on.

478
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,730
How is it? Do you like it?

479
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,470
You want to marry Ji Na again?

480
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,070
What must I do?

481
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,670
- Live as if your kid doesn't exist.
- Mom.

482
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,810
What is all this?

483
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,180
Have I ever eaten...

484
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,540
anything you cooked?

485
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,410
What? Who will be released?

486
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,010
The murderer who killed Hae Joon.

487
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,220
