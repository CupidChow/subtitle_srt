1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,309
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:25,309
A diamond ring?

3
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:26,309
(Episode 50)

4
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,810
It's not like the jade ring
became a diamond.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,680
What is this doing here?

6
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,619
Hang on a minute.

7
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,020
Oh, I get it.

8
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,319
What?

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,600
It's your wedding anniversary
the day after tomorrow.

10
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,999
Gosh, Gyeong Tae
must've put it there.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,670
What are you saying?

12
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,840
Have you ever seen your brother
care about such things?

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,779
He must've made up his mind
to get you something big this time.

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,810
A diamond? As if.

15
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:03,550
I'm sure it isn't real.

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,950
Whether it's real or not,
at least he got you something.

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,789
Don't you go and tell him
to return this or whatever.

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,289
Where did he get the money?

19
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:16,029
You know, maybe...

20
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,100
Gyeong Tae worked part-time...

21
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,539
for something
Detective An was doing.

22
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,140
I think that's a reasonable thing
to suspect.

23
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,110
Do you think so?

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,839
That's right.
He always said he was going fishing.

25
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:35,209
It was so strange
how they were always stuck together.

26
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,050
They were always going fishing,

27
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,220
but did you ever see him
bring back a single anchovy?

28
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,520
You should just put it back inside.

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,229
You should act like
you don't know about it...

30
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,530
so he feels good
when he gives it to you.

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,740
Should we cook...

32
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,339
a big chicken this evening?
It's been a while since we had some.

33
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:08,209
Look at you! Why do you want
to cook a whole chicken?

34
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,449
I mean,

35
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,149
the kids are coming in the evening.
Hong Dan and Gong Boo.

36
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,660
My goodness.
I guess she likes the ring.

37
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,059
Seriously, that girl is a funny one.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,459
A big chicken.

39
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,299
Hey, what's this?

40
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,539
Did you steal it?

41
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:38,979
Just get in.

42
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,880
Where did you get this?
Hurry up and tell me.

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,449
Stop talking and just get in.

44
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,850
Today,

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,680
I'll give you the full treatment.

46
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,380
Thank you.

47
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,460
Please prepare
another serving of steak.

48
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,090
She'll finish this
in about three minutes.

49
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:29,430
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,669
Hey.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,100
Go ahead and eat.

52
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,340
I rented the whole place...

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,600
so you could eat
without feeling shy.

54
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,470
Why do you keep looking around
at people?

55
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,810
That's because this is weird.

56
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,509
Where did you get the money
to rent this whole place?

57
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,250
I won a raffle.

58
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,210
Why won't you believe me?

59
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:51,449
How can I believe something
so ridiculous?

60
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,250
How can you win something
out of nowhere?

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,789
You know,

62
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,160
you wouldn't believe me
even if I said I liked you, right?

63
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,759
My gosh.

64
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,970
Seeing how you're talking nonsense,
you sure are the Gu Dan Soo I know.

65
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,169
What if I tell you...

66
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,169
that you're my first love
and that...

67
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,880
I never forgot about you?

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,049
Will you still not believe me?

69
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:27,919
Why are you saying
stuff like that...

70
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,190
after ordering fancy food?
You're making me lose my appetite.

71
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,129
Give me that.

72
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,020
The shoes are nice and comfortable.

73
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,419
My feet don't hurt.

74
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,450
You appreciate it, don't you?

75
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
Then,

76
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,289
give me.

77
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,330
All right, then.

78
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,330
Good boy, Dan Soo.

79
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:12,830
You're so cool, Dan Soo.

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,070
I'm glad you like them.
They look good on you.

81
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,470
I guess I should wear shoes
that suit me.

82
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,510
Ones that fit me well.

83
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,410
Since I took off the shoes
that didn't fit me,

84
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,580
I feel so relieved.

85
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,650
Still,

86
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,479
since they're new shoes,

87
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,119
you'll need some time
to work them in.

88
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,390
They're comfortable
as if I've worn them for a while.

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,289
I don't think I'll need any time.

90
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,359
Is that so?

91
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,960
Why do you keep smiling like that?

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,100
It's weird.

93
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,830
What?

94
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,039
What? Hey, let's go over there.

95
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,739
- Hello.
- Hello.

96
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,739
Goodness, they're so pretty.

97
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,119
Ma'am,
we'll take all of these flowers.

98
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,320
My goodness. Thank you so much.

99
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,189
Oh, my goodness.

100
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,160
Hey, what am I supposed to do
with all of these?

101
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,400
I guess this is
why people give others flowers.

102
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,129
They're pretty.

103
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,739
You two are a beautiful couple.

104
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,010
You look lovely.

105
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,539
I hope you're happy for a long time.

106
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,379
- What? It's not like that...
- Okay, ma'am.

107
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,150
We'll live happily ever after.

108
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,850
- Be healthy.
- Okay. Bye.

109
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,820
Wedding presents?
You don't have to prepare anything.

110
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:47,330
We can't afford
to buy you anything either.

111
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,460
Okay, then.

112
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:52,330
But still,

113
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,169
they should give our aunt and uncle
a set of blankets...

114
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:55,700
as a thank-you gift.

115
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,539
They'll make such a fuss.

116
00:06:58,539 --> 00:06:59,840
When their son got married,

117
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,039
they gave everyone presents.

118
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,710
Gosh, why are you talking
about things from way back when?

119
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,710
The whole concept of the groom
buying the house...

120
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,410
and the bride
buying all the furnishings...

121
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,210
is all in the past.

122
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,919
Since you're going to be newlyweds,

123
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:15,749
will it be okay if you start out
with a rented apartment?

124
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,989
We started out like that too.

125
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,129
Mom, we're just going to live
in Hong Dan's house.

126
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,229
Will that be okay?

127
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,999
Well...

128
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,070
It's not like we can come
and live here.

129
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,179
I wish I could buy you
a whole list of presents, but...

130
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,950
You should take this, at least.

131
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,950
Oh, but...

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Well...

133
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,530
What is this?

134
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,499
When I got married,

135
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:00,030
my mother-in-law passed down
this jade ring to me.

136
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,530
It's a Maeng family heirloom.

137
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,830
I hope you'll accept it
for the meaning of it.

138
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,970
I see.

139
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,109
Okay.

140
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,140
Jade!

141
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,010
Even still,
what's up with her reaction?

142
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,950
Her mother-in-law is giving it
to her.

143
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,520
She won't even thank me.

144
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,799
Goodness, I've never gotten
so many flowers at once.

145
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,439
I told you
I'd give you the full treatment.

146
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,809
So, are you all done now?

147
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,979
What time
do you have to return the car?

148
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:52,720
No, it's not over yet.

149
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,690
I...

150
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,159
still have this, Gong Hee.

151
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
This...

152
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,979
Oh, my.

153
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,279
(50 cents, Turn the handle)

154
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,600
Darn it. It's a dud.

155
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,029
What is this?

156
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,869
This is a ring.

157
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,729
You put it on your finger.

158
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,139
Why do you put that on your finger?

159
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Gu Geon.

160
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,820
Marry me?

161
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
What?

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,119
That's what you call a proposal.

163
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,519
A ring is a must.

164
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,960
You slip it on the finger like this.

165
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Oh, my.

166
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,229
Then, do I have to marry you?

167
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:15,470
Of course.

168
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,499
Once you put the ring on,

169
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:19,139
you can't take it back.

170
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,409
It's from that capsule toy machine.

171
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,210
Why did you...

172
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,609
I've never forgotten about you.

173
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,350
Maeng Gong Hee.

174
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
You.

175
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:37,720
I was happy when we met again.

176
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,889
Every day we spent together
gave me so much joy.

177
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,399
I guess I realized my feelings
a little too late,

178
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,399
but I...

179
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,200
don't want to lose you again.

180
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:55,109
Hey, Gu Dan Soo.

181
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,109
Those shoes.

182
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,080
You said
you didn't need to work them in...

183
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,409
because they were so comfortable.

184
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
I want to be...

185
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,580
someone like those shoes for you.

186
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Can't you...

187
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,159
please look at me?

188
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,729
Hey, go inside first.

189
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,700
I need to walk for a bit.

190
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,300
What? Where are you going?
It's late.

191
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:57,670
I just want to take a walk alone.

192
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,040
Hey, Maeng Gong Hee.

193
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,080
Hey, Maeng Gong Hee!

194
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,820
Should I have waited a bit?

195
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:28,300
(Bubble Up Laundry)

196
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,149
Gu Dan Soo.

197
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,810
What do you want me to do?

198
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,550
Maeng Gong Hee.

199
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,190
What are you thinking?

200
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,720
Normally, you like to think simple.

201
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,159
What's so complicated?

202
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:30,790
Whatever. I don't know.

203
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:36,129
Should I go...

204
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,399
and beg her to forget what I said?

205
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,670
No, I did nothing wrong.

206
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,239
I held back for long enough.

207
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,749
Gosh, what should I do?

208
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,090
Mom!

209
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,420
My goodness. Why did you come here?

210
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,830
I can go to your place by myself.

211
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,560
I came because I wanted
to see you an hour earlier.

212
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,100
Why? Did you think
I came to pick you up...

213
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,330
so my old mother wouldn't get lost?

214
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,330
My goodness.

215
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,670
Let's go, Mom.

216
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,139
My gosh!

217
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,440
Look who's here.

218
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,580
Why are you here?

219
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,239
My aunt left for Kkotsan.

220
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,350
I saw her off
and was about to leave.

221
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,210
Then I saw you.

222
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,350
Hello, ma'am. It's me, Joo Ri.

223
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,350
- Joo Ri?
- Ssang Sook.

224
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,320
She said she'd drink pesticides
and die...

225
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,060
if her parents didn't let her
change her name.

226
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,129
She was the only one
who did that in the whole town.

227
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,129
Hey.

228
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,560
- Oh, Ssang Sook.
- Yes.

229
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,869
My gosh. I must say,
you haven't aged a bit.

230
00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:45,800
She gets Botox injections
all the time.

231
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,100
My goodness.

232
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,310
You haven't aged at all either.

233
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Really?

234
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,409
Are you visiting Seoul?

235
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:57,210
Yes, I'm here because
my grandson is getting married soon.

236
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,619
My gosh.
My son is getting married soon too.

237
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,460
My future daughter-in-law
is so good to us.

238
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,889
Even yesterday, she visited us...

239
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,560
and offered to buy us new furniture.

240
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,590
She asked me if I needed anything.

241
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:12,159
She said
I should get a new jewelry set,

242
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,830
with a ring and a necklace.

243
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,239
Well, it's not why I'm getting
a rich daughter-in-law,

244
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,170
but I have to say
it was nice to hear her say...

245
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,670
that she'd get us all those things.

246
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,239
So, your son is getting married too.

247
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,180
Why didn't you tell me?

248
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,249
Oh, that's right.

249
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,350
He's been married before.

250
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,450
Hey, I told everyone but you.

251
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,119
Is that so?

252
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,889
I was planning to invite you
to my son's wedding.

253
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:44,190
The wedding will take place
at a hotel.

254
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,560
At a five-star hotel.

255
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Let's go, Mom.

256
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,470
Why? Let's go somewhere
and grab a bite to eat.

257
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,170
I want to treat your mother.

258
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,170
You can go and stuff your face.

259
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:02,450
Ma'am, then I'll see you
at your grandson's wedding.

260
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:06,619
Let's go

261
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,389
To the East Sea

262
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:11,590
My gosh, Ms. Im! You're here.

263
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,560
- Hello.
- Take a seat.

264
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:16,290
- It's cold outside, isn't it?
- Yes.

265
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,129
Goodness. Why is Myung Ja so angry?

266
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,840
We ran into Ssang Sook
at the bus terminal.

267
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,970
I feel like she lives
to make me angry.

268
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,739
What happened this time?

269
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,840
How rich
her future daughter-in-law could be?

270
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,379
She offered to buy
brand-new furniture for their home.

271
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,580
And she'll buy her a jewelry set
as a gift.

272
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,989
I'll be honest.
I couldn't help but compare.

273
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,659
I know we're not giving Hong Dan
anything,

274
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,290
except for that jade ring.

275
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,430
But still, I can't believe
she said yes right away.

276
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:52,960
It's not like I expect her to buy us
tons of gifts like others do.

277
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,970
But couldn't she at least offer?

278
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,769
Of course, I would've told her
not to buy anything.

279
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,670
My in-laws will make a big fuss
about it.

280
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,100
I should buy them bedding sets
or something.

281
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,070
I'm so embarrassed.

282
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,070
Enough!

283
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,639
You shouldn't think like that!

284
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,850
Even if your daughter-in-law
isn't up to your standards,

285
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,180
she is like a gift to the family.

286
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:14,379
Wedding presents?

287
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,950
If you're going to sulk
over something like that,

288
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,519
tell them
to just call off the wedding.

289
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,859
Mom, I never said
I didn't want them to get married.

290
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,189
What's the big deal about
exchanging wedding presents?

291
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,659
Is that how I taught you?

292
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,530
It made me unhappy for a moment.

293
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,830
I mean, I'm human too.

294
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,270
You shouldn't think like that
because you're human.

295
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,270
Because you are human.

296
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:46,149
Thank you.

297
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,590
This is why I come to work.

298
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,590
You must be stressed out
because of Holly.

299
00:17:58,399 --> 00:17:59,830
Holly or whatever.

300
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,399
Who does she think she is?
She's being so difficult.

301
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,730
She's annoying.

302
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,369
We should just find
a different designer.

303
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,540
A company that proposed
a project to her last year...

304
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,179
was turned down even though
they offered her a cash bonus.

305
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,480
They even offered
90 percent of all profit earned.

306
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,379
My gosh. Seriously?

307
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,719
Then I guess it'll be impossible
to get her on board.

308
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,350
To find a different designer
and start over...

309
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,459
No, it's too late to start over.

310
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:28,889
Let me take care of this.

311
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:32,929
But you might end up
having to handle the risk alone.

312
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,869
You know there's someone else
who can do that.

313
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,010
(A sip for a relaxing day)

314
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,780
It's for you.

315
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,149
Enjoy, sir.

316
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,050
I told you not to do this.

317
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,919
All right. Let's start the meeting.

318
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:04,459
Mr. Gu Dan Soo,
is everything all right with you...

319
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:06,959
Yes, you seem fine.

320
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:09,369
Aren't you cold...

321
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,000
It's not cold in here.

322
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,980
So, what's going on with Holly?

323
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:22,250
Director Lee, about Holly.

324
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,510
How about we put Gong Hee in charge?

325
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:27,919
What?

326
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,790
Me?

327
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,090
You sounded very confident
at the last meeting.

328
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,189
You said
you were a longtime fan of hers...

329
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,100
and that you knew her best.

330
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,530
Oh, right.

331
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,629
I did, but...

332
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:44,800
If you lead this project,

333
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,340
you can get a permanent position.
Wouldn't it be nice?

334
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,669
A permanent position?

335
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:52,980
But if we lose Holly,

336
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,240
we'll have a big problem.

337
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,080
Gong Hee, do you want
to be in charge of the project?

338
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,850
Can we trust you?

339
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,020
This is dangerous.

340
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,659
She wants to dump it on Gong Hee.

341
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:11,929
Don't do it by yourself, you fool.

342
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,330
Yes, I'll be sure
to convince Holly...

343
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,429
I'll do it.

344
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,209
No, it's okay.

345
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,040
Mr. Gu Dan Soo,
you don't need to get involved.

346
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,580
This is no joke.

347
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,679
If this deal doesn't go through,

348
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,649
you might have to take
big responsibility...

349
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,179
I have a connection with Holly.

350
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,490
I studied abroad.

351
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,719
I'll get Holly.

352
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:38,859
And if Holly refuses,

353
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:41,060
we can find another designer, right?

354
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,459
No,
I'll be in charge of this project.

355
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Hey.

356
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Mr. Gu.

357
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,699
You can't rely
on personal connections for this.

358
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,500
I will take charge personally.

359
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,340
I can't miss this opportunity.

360
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,240
- All right!
- Gosh, you scared me.

361
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,609
Gong Hee, you can take charge.

362
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,379
I'll put my trust in you.

363
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,689
My, you look nice.
I told you this would look good.

364
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:17,459
Why do you want me
to wear something like this?

365
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,600
It's so uncomfortable.

366
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,760
Today is your wedding anniversary.

367
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,030
Do a good job, okay?

368
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,939
Gosh, since when
did we care about such things?

369
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,439
Come on.
I know you prepared a lot this year.

370
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,080
Prepare? Me? What?

371
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,580
Come on!

372
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,480
Don't play dumb.

373
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,449
Fine. You're doing well, Gyeong Tae.

374
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:40,879
Just keep doing
what you're doing, okay?

375
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,949
My goodness. What are you saying?

376
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:44,189
Oh, my!

377
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:48,659
My gosh. I didn't know you had
an outfit like this, Myung Ja.

378
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,290
You look like an angel.

379
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,399
Let's go.

380
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Gosh, you.

381
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,939
I should prepare breakfast for Mom.

382
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,310
Hey, do you think I'll let
your mother starve without you?

383
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,080
Don't worry. Have fun.

384
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,780
Goodness.

385
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:14,250
My goodness.

386
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:21,929
Did he put the ring in the soup?

387
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,199
Hey, why aren't you eating?

388
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,570
I'm eating.

389
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,280
Gosh, that tastes refreshing.

390
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
You didn't have to do anything
for our wedding anniversary.

391
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,780
It's not like you.

392
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:46,119
To me, our wedding anniversary
is a bad reminder.

393
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,419
Oh, my.

394
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,889
The cubed radish kimchi
tastes great.

395
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:58,929
Try some, honey.

396
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,100
There you go.

397
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:03,869
You should be giving me...

398
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,939
the ring,
not this cubed radish kimchi.

399
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,040
When does he plan on taking it out?

400
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Excuse me.

401
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Finally.

402
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,379
Do you need something?

403
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Well...

404
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,649
We're out of salt.

405
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,119
Can we get some more salt?

406
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,119
Sure.

407
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,359
Honey.

408
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:32,629
Haven't you forgotten anything?

409
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:35,899
Oh, right.

410
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:38,169
You have, right?
You've forgotten something.

411
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,139
My goodness, honey.

412
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:43,270
One second.

413
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,379
It's right here.

414
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,649
Where is it?

415
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:52,219
My gosh.

416
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,449
Why won't it come out?

417
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,119
Here.

418
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,290
Isn't it pretty? It's my heart.

419
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,889
Go on and eat.

420
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,899
Ox bone soup is the best.

421
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,169
Hey, Myung Ja.

422
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,439
Here.

423
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,139
You didn't even eat that much.

424
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,010
You should head in first.

425
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,780
I have to stop by somewhere.

426
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,209
I'll be back.

427
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:27,050
Are you sure
there's nothing you've forgotten?

428
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,790
What?

429
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
My goodness.

430
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:34,159
- I love you.
- My gosh.

431
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,359
My goodness. What...

432
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,800
Why on earth
is she acting like that?

433
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,629
Goodness gracious.

434
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,770
Hey.

435
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,879
Did you have a good meal?

436
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,310
Sure, we went out for a meal.

437
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,350
All we did was eat out.

438
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,149
Still, Gyeong Tae remembered
to celebrate your anniversary.

439
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,719
He put in a lot of effort.

440
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,159
- Oh, it's not here.
- What?

441
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,359
What are you looking for?

442
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,000
Where did that go?
I can't believe this.

443
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,770
I'm sure Gyeong Bok and I saw it.

444
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,840
I saw Gyeong Tae
take something from there earlier.

445
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,980
When did he do that?

446
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,109
Before he went out to eat with you.

447
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,709
He took something out of there.

448
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:31,550
Then he should've given it to me.

449
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,179
Why didn't he give it to me?

450
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,429
Where has he gone until this hour?

451
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,330
He didn't even mention the ring
all day.

452
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,629
I'm a fool for getting my hopes up.

453
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,469
Are you just getting home now?

454
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,270
Yes, Mother is asleep, right?

455
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,840
I'll sleep in Gong Boo's room
for the time being.

456
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,609
Don't you have...

457
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,709
something to say to me today?

458
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:07,350
What? Again?

459
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,219
Don't you have something to give me?

460
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,790
My goodness. Fine, here.

461
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,359
Forget it!

462
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,159
Gosh, that hurts.

463
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:25,439
I mean, what have I done wrong?

464
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:40,050
You should just hit me or something.

465
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:41,990
How much longer
will you keep avoiding me?

466
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,490
I don't have the energy
to argue with you.

467
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:46,459
Do I look like I'm picking a fight?

468
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,790
Why did you suddenly
butt in earlier?

469
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:52,500
Is Holly your friend or something?

470
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,830
Why would you say something
you can't be responsible for?

471
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,169
How do you know
if I can be responsible or not?

472
00:26:58,169 --> 00:26:59,439
If anyone has to be responsible,
it'll be me.

473
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,939
This is my chance.

474
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:04,639
Hey, why do you think Ms. Kang is
suddenly giving you this project?

475
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,510
She's trying to use you as a shield,

476
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,740
using the permanent position
to trick you.

477
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:10,280
If things go wrong,
you'll take the fall for everything.

478
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Can't you even see that?

479
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,850
I know that too.

480
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,879
- You do?
- Yes.

481
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:17,520
So, please stop sticking your nose
into my business.

482
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,790
Tell me so I can understand.

483
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,530
What does this mean?

484
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,699
Is this your answer
to what I said to you last night?

485
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Are you turning me down?

486
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,699
Should I take it that way?

487
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:31,939
Should I stop interfering
in your business...

488
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,439
and just disappear from your life...

489
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,669
as if I don't exist?

490
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,679
(Maeng Dumplings)

491
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,990
Oh, my. Myung Ja, you're here.

492
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,619
Hey, you're here early.

493
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:52,820
- Yes.
- Oh, my.

494
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,290
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

495
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,600
I haven't seen that ring before.

496
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,830
Oh, this?

497
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:06,800
This ring...

498
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,209
Why do you have this ring?

499
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,320
(My Merry Marriage)

500
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,290
My wife saw the ring?

501
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,760
If you're keeping anything a secret,
tell me now.

502
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,889
I don't have any secrets.

503
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:31,290
You can't take it back later.

504
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,659
I'm really rooting for you,
Gong Hee.

505
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:34,330
I really want to do well.

506
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,600
Please help me out, Ms. Kang.

507
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,070
Are you being sarcastic with me?

508
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,869
Stop lurking around.

509
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:39,969
Just leave her alone.

510
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,399
Stop confusing Gong Hee.

511
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,570
Who are you to Gong Hee?

512
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
