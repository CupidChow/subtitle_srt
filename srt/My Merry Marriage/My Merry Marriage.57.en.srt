1
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,509
- Let's go! Let's go inside.
- Hey, stop!

2
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,980
Be careful.
Ssook Ssook is growing inside of me.

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,980
Gosh, my back.

4
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:28,950
What?

5
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:35,589
Hey, put me down.

6
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:38,060
Hold on. Ouch, my back.

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,090
Oh, boy.

8
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:44,729
Hey, kid.

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,729
Who are you?

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,729
Do you know this kid?

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,840
- No.
- What?

12
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,869
Hey, do I know you?

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,180
Then why are you sitting here?
Where are your parents?

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,420
Me?

15
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,559
I am Maeng Gong Boo's son.

16
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:15,930
What do you mean?

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Hey, kid.

18
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,470
Who...

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,799
Whose son?

20
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:28,139
What is that?

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Hey.

22
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,719
(Conclusion,
Korea DNA Testing Company)

23
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,790
(Maeng Gong Boo, Maeng No Ah)

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,990
(Maeng Gong Boo is
the father of Maeng No Ah.)

25
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:49,729
Why? What is it?

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,009
I can give you a hug, right?

27
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,479
What are you doing?

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,990
You...

29
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,559
Hello, Dad.

30
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,630
What...

31
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,700
Lee Soo Yeon...

32
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,879
(Episode 57)

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,619
Maeng Gong Boo.

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,089
Take good care of him.

35
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,770
Yes?

36
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,339
- Did you ask to see me, ma'am?
- Yes.

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,249
You can leave work
a little early today, can't you?

38
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,180
Yes, ma'am. I'll head straight
to the restaurant.

39
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,420
That won't be necessary.
Just come with me.

40
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,339
Kimchi is the identity
of a household, isn't it?

41
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,640
The chairwoman is so fond of
my kimchi-making skills,

42
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:45,510
so I can't turn her down,
saying I can't come...

43
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,809
because I'm too busy.

44
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,779
It can be so hard sometimes.

45
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:49,779
Right.

46
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,920
The chairwoman asked me
so desperately.

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,550
That's why I came.
You know that, right?

48
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,860
Yes. Of course, we do.
How could we not know?

49
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,189
Funny seeing you again.

50
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,930
- My gosh.
- Your husband drives her car,

51
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,059
your son works at her company,

52
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,129
and I guess you work
at her house as a housekeeper.

53
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,300
The whole family must be involved.

54
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,839
Why is this woman here?

55
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,240
She's the guest that's coming today.

56
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:20,879
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

57
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,580
The chairwoman...

58
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,080
must've hired some extra help...

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,450
to prepare for her important guests.

60
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,689
Oh, my. From what I hear,

61
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,589
you're so good
at making fresh kimchi.

62
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:48,239
My gosh, the chairwoman
must really like salty foods.

63
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:52,940
The cooks in this house
should try to manage that.

64
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,179
How could you call this salty?

65
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,320
I mean, I'm just...

66
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,549
I only came here
to help out a little.

67
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:04,760
I just remembered...

68
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,960
an interesting story.

69
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:10,060
About fish.

70
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,460
They're such smart creatures.

71
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,330
What?

72
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,770
They swim in the water
that suits them best.

73
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,370
Those that need the cleanest water
live there.

74
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,080
And fish that live in murky water
live where they should.

75
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,880
Sometimes, I don't think
people are as smart as fish.

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,349
They don't even know
their own place...

77
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:33,380
and often bark up the wrong tree.

78
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,890
Are you talking about me right now?

79
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,289
Hey!

80
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,890
Do you want to get slapped
in the face with fresh kimchi?

81
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,359
How uncivilized.

82
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,229
- Here.
- Yes, ma'am.

83
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,969
It's top-grade Korean beef.

84
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,400
Put it in the fridge.

85
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:53,669
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:05,880
Are you already heading out?

87
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,989
You should at least
finish cooking everything.

88
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:13,589
This will only make things harder
for your daughter, you know?

89
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,989
Go ahead and act arrogantly
while you still can.

90
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,029
Just wait until Min Gi gets married.

91
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,400
Will you be able to handle...

92
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,700
your daughter
living with her in-laws?

93
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:27,239
Oh, my. You still seem to be lost
in dreamland.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,239
Look here. Please wake up, will you?

95
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,479
Who is getting married?

96
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,409
What's all this noise?

97
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,179
- Oh, you're here, Ms. Jung.
- Hey.

98
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
We've met, haven't we?

99
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:45,289
It's good to see you.
I'm Ji Na's mom.

100
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,159
Come in.

101
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,630
You...

102
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,640
Are you done making fresh kimchi?

103
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,599
You must've finished quickly.

104
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:11,820
Ma'am, thank you
for inviting us to your home.

105
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,620
Oh, yes. I see you're already here.

106
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,669
Gong Hee.

107
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Here's some medicine
for indigestion.

108
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,570
What?

109
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,969
I noticed you seemed to have
an upset stomach this morning.

110
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,109
You don't look so great.

111
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,750
You have a lot on your plate.
Things are tough, aren't they?

112
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,320
It's not like that.

113
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,049
Then do you have
some other kind of concern?

114
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,190
I attached the sonogram picture
under today's date.

115
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,029
You should show that
to the baby's father.

116
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,159
I'm sure he'll be happy.

117
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,299
You can tell me.

118
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,539
It's nothing.

119
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,239
Let me know anytime
if it gets to be too much.

120
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,010
The burden will weigh a little less
if we share it.

121
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,620
Gong Hee,

122
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,750
you're such an amazing person.

123
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,560
Should I say you're like
an legendary sword in its sheath?

124
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,330
People don't know
how sharp you are yet,

125
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,299
but once you show yourself,

126
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:38,700
anyone will recognize you.

127
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,409
Just how great a person you are...

128
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,609
and how talented you are
as a designer.

129
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,710
Thank you.

130
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,189
Oh, my. Mother.

131
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,059
What are you doing in here?

132
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,230
Myung Ja...

133
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,069
She must feel very lonely.

134
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,270
Our children think...

135
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,970
they've only left us physically,

136
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,480
but from a mother's heart,

137
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:54,850
it's as if
a pillar has gone missing.

138
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,319
It hurts so much...

139
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,520
that it makes you
fall to the ground.

140
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,520
But it's not like
he's going anywhere far.

141
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,159
Whether it's far or close,

142
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,829
that's how it feels
when your kids move out...

143
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:15,829
with all their things.

144
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:20,770
You think,
"Now, they must be really leaving."

145
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,579
It's like a cold wind blowing
through your heart.

146
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,480
All right. Come in.

147
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
What?

148
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,350
Wait.

149
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,090
What?

150
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,890
Is that you, Gong Boo?

151
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,029
You just left. Why are you back?

152
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,130
Didn't you go to your new home?

153
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,970
Well, I'm in a bit of a pickle.

154
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,169
- What?
- Come in.

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,939
Who are you?

156
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,679
I'm Maeng No Ah.

157
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,750
Oh, boy.

158
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,919
"Maeng No Ah?"

159
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,760
I am Maeng Gong Boo's son.

160
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,630
Dad, let me talk to Soo Yeon.

161
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,900
Please watch him.

162
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,329
Wait, is this really your son?

163
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,000
Anyway, this is an emergency.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,970
Soo Yeon seems to be dropping
a nuclear bomb on me.

165
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,039
Wait, what is going on?

166
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,480
If I can't figure this out,

167
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,740
my life
and my marriage will be over.

168
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,380
I'll be right back.
See you in a bit!

169
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Oh, dear.

170
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,730
The button just fell right off.

171
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,890
I can't sew this back on.

172
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,429
You need to use the machine
to put this back on.

173
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:54,929
And...

174
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,199
I brought this.
Can you let out the waist?

175
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,470
My goodness. I don't even eat much,

176
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,240
so I don't understand
why I keep gaining belly fat.

177
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
Am I pregnant or something?

178
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,079
I can fix these quickly.

179
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,650
Give me a few minutes.

180
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:12,449
Ladies.

181
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,020
Do you still talk to Dan Soo?

182
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,319
Dan Soo?

183
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:21,789
You must've heard the news.

184
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,130
I told her.

185
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:25,429
You and your big mouth.

186
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,169
He moved back
to his grandmother's house.

187
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:30,630
Why? Did you need to talk to him
about something?

188
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:35,069
He said he'd visit us
to say goodbye in person,

189
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:36,909
but we haven't seen him.
I guess he's busy.

190
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:39,140
I assumed
he must be busy or something,

191
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,439
so I haven't tried calling him yet.

192
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:43,949
Then could you...

193
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,819
give me his number?

194
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,490
Oh, sure. I'll give you his number.

195

(Gyeong Tae)

196
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:54,789
One moment.

197
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,230
(Gyeong Tae)

198
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,400
Hi.

199
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,630
I came to the alteration shop
for a moment.

200
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,199
What?

201
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,240
Gong Boo's son?

202
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,370
"Gong Boo's son?"

203
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,789
So, who is your dad?

204
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,319
Goodness. Stop asking him questions.

205
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,159
Let the kid finish his milk.

206
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,569
Gong Boo's son is here?
What do you mean?

207
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,439
Hello, Grandma.

208
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,270
"Grandma?"

209
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,579
Yes. He's very smart and polite.

210
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,079
My goodness.

211
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,079
Where is Gong Boo?

212
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
What about Hong Dan?

213
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,049
Well, Gong Boo said
he'd try calling Soo Yeon and left.

214
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,260
As for Hong Dan, I don't know.

215
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,529
As soon as they got back
from their honeymoon,

216
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:05,529
this kid showed up at their door.

217
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:11,230
What? He left this kid here
and took off...

218
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,370
without saying anything?

219
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,439
Anyway, are we sure
that he is Gong Boo's child?

What is this?

223
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,130
My gosh.
This is a paternity test report.

224
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, my. She must've prepared this
in case Gong Boo denied it.

225
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,069
Oh, dear. What is happening?

226
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:49,069
He can't deny this.

I'll give you
three days' worth of medicine.

- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

(Han Internal Medicine Clinic)

233
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,600
Hey, what did you say?

234
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,140
I told you everything on the phone.
What more do you need to hear?

235
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,610
That boy is your child.

236
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,439
Hey, it makes no sense!

237
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,010
It's been five years
since Soo Yeon and I got a divorce.

238
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,880
How could this kid show up
out of nowhere?

239
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,850
She found out that she was pregnant
only after you guys split up.

240
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,220
Then she should've told me
right away.

241
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,020
You know how Soo Yeon is.

242
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,260
She didn't tell you because
you two had split up already.

243
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,490
What? So, you knew?

244
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,199
Well...
I only found out recently too.

245
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,270
You know she had cut off all contact
with everyone from school too.

246
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,169
She suddenly came to see me...

247
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:53,970
and asked me
a bunch of questions about you.

248
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,169
About me?

249
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,740
Well, things like
if you were seeing someone,

250
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,909
if your clinic was doing well,

251
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,179
and how you were doing.

252
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:03,610
So? You told her everything?

253
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,880
Hey, Soo Yeon is my friend too,
just like you're my friend.

254
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,419
I couldn't just ignore her,
you know.

255
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,850
Darn you...

256
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,630
Who is this?
I don't recognize this number.

257
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,799
Answer it.
I think that's Soo Yeon's number.

258
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,939
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon.
Where are you now?

259
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:29,610
This is an announcement.

260
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,880
The flight departing at 1:20 p.m...

261
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,709
What? Are you at the airport now?

262
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,279
Where are you going?
Don't go anywhere until you see me!

263
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,789
I'm heading
to the departure gate now.

264
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:43,789
You...

265
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:46,289
Hey.

266
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,959
Who's that kid? Who is he?

267
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,199
He's your son.

268
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,600
You saw the DNA test report, right?

269
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,900
But how?
I mean, when did this happen?

270
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:02,270
We split up
just a month after our wedding.

271
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,209
How's it possible that
you got pregnant, all of a sudden?

272
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,340
I raised him by myself
for the past five years.

273
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm participating in this two-year
training program in the US.

274
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,650
You can't take care of him
for two years?

275
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:14,620
It's about time
you played your role as his father.

276
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,260
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon!

277
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,590
My gosh. This was
a premeditated nuclear attack.

278
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,999
- Where is she now?
- She's at the airport.

279
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,360
I get that she's joining
a training program in the US,

280
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,400
but why does she have to
drop this bomb on me?

281
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,669
Seriously, Lee Soo Yeon!
I can't believe this.

282
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,310
Why, you...

283
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,540
Goodness. Oh, boy.

284
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:45,050
Ji Na,
am I making you uncomfortable?

285
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,489
Why aren't you eating?

286
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,890
Oh, she's always like this.

287
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,390
She's on a diet.

288
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,390
Now that
Dan Soo has moved back home,

289
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,370
I think we should expedite things.
That's why I called you here.

290
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,169
The merger of Dodo Group
and Jayce Group...

291
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,699
through this marriage.

292
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:13,009
You're still talking about this?

293
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,179
Grandma, your wish has been granted.
Am I wrong?

294
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:16,449
My wish?

295
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:22,050
Me. Your dear grandson,
Gu Dan Soo, is back.

296
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,120
Is that not enough for you?
Now, I have to get married?

297
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,120
I have to marry her, of all women?

298
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,989
I heard
you were taking time off work.

299
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,689
I didn't expect to see you here.

300
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,959
This is my home.
Why can't I be here?

301
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,870
Well, I was talking about the place
where you used to live.

302
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,739
I guess things didn't work out
between you and your roommate.

303
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,880
I heard...

304
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,640
Dan Soo was renting a room
from a family.

305
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,179
What do you mean he had a roommate?

306
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,050
What about you?
You have a boyfriend.

307
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,390
What are you doing here?

308
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,390
Oh, I see.

309
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,360
You want to marry me...

310
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,189
and keep dating him?

311
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,100
You have a boyfriend?

312
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,400
What? A boyfriend?
What are you talking about?

313
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,640
Ji Na isn't seeing anyone else,
ma'am.

314
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,840
Is your mother telling the truth?

315
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,409
Are you sure
you're not seeing someone else?

316
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,050
Tell her the truth.

317
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:30,120
I will...

318
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,259
tell you everything later, ma'am.

319
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,380
How could you say that
in front of Chairwoman Hwang?

320
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,810
Gu Dan Soo. Can you not think?

321
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,350
Aren't you the one who can't think?

322
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,150
Why did you come here?

323
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,090
I heard you said you wanted
to break off the engagement.

324
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,419
Was it all a lie?

325
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,090
I'll figure out what to do.

326
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,659
It's none of your business.

327
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,630
Does Min Gi know...

328
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,530
that you're here now?

329
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:16,530
My gosh.

330
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:21,239
I was really disappointed in Min Gi,

331
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:23,610
but I suddenly feel bad for him.

332
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:26,110
He dumped his girlfriend,

333
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,909
saying he was in love
with someone else.

334
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,280
But now, he's about to get dumped.

335
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,679
The greedy Kang Ji Na
played him for a fool.

336
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,019
Eat up.

337
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,290
Children must eat well.

338
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,259
Okay, Great-grandma.

339
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Here.

340
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,530
I...

341
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,130
can eat on my own.

342
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,580
I have a nephew now?

343
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,179
That's right.

344
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:10,290
He came wearing his DNA test report
around his neck.

345
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,459
Come on. We don't even need proof.

346
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,290
He looks just like Gong Boo
when Gong Boo was little.

347
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,489
Oh, no. This is huge.

348
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,959
Soo Yeon has been raising him
all this time?

349
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
Who knows?

350
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,729
Maybe she had him
with another man...

351
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:25,400
and left him here
before she took off.

352
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,570
Gyeong Bok, why would you say that?

353
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,409
It's a good thing
that he came to us.

354
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:30,570
Besides, he is Gong Boo's child.

355
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,669
Gosh, you...

356
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,810
When he got married,
I thought that was it.

357
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,050
How many problems
will his first marriage cause?

358
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,219
Who knew this would happen
right after their honeymoon?

359
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,350
How could Soo Yeon do this?

360
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:50,060
Soo Yeon must've been through a lot
to raise the kid on her own.

361
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:53,330
Did we force her
to raise him on her own?

362
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,729
It's not like we kicked her out.

363
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:55,870
She's the one who left.

364
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,900
She created this whole mess.

365
00:21:58,669 --> 00:21:59,969
Goodness.

366
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,610
Where has Gong Boo gone?

367
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,979
Oh, whatever. Who knows
if he's dead or alive? Good grief.

368
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,909
We should be grateful if his wife
hasn't beaten him to death.

369
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,479
They just had their wedding
and got back from their honeymoon...

370
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,550
only to be met
with his ex-wife's kid?

371
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,050
Gosh, we're lucky she didn't faint.

372
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,320
My goodness.

373
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,769
You said you weren't lying to me
about anything else!

374
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,070
You said you didn't have
any more secrets!

375
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,570
I swear, I didn't know about this.

376
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,840
You giant onion!

377
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,350
I keep peeling you open,

378
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:47,620
but there's always something more.
What should I do?

379
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,689
But I really didn't know...

380
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,189
Get out! Leave.

381
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:58,360
Get out of my sight
right this instant. Leave!

382
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,870
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Get out!

383
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,900
- No, but I...
- Get out.

384
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,340
- Okay. Wait.
- Get out!

385
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,239
Hong Dan!

386
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:11,780
Honey!

387
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:15,479
I'm not moving an inch from here.

388
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,850
I'll wait all night long.

389
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,479
Until you let me in,

390
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:21,080
I will be on my knees
with my arms...

391
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:24,550
I knew it.

392
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,259
I knew you'd let me back in.

393
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:31,729
But Hong Dan...

394
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,229
(No one from the Maeng family
is allowed inside!)

395
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,050
You're here.

396
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,320
Don't you know
how busy we are at work these days?

397
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,459
What are you doing?
Why aren't you coming to work?

398
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:06,199
Can't you see?

399
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,669
I'm back to where I used to be.

400
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,999
I've moved back home,

401
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,540
and I'm back to being a slacker
who plays around all day.

402
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,249
At least look at me
if you called me over.

403
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,820
You said you had something to say.
What is it?

404
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,620
Ms. Kang was just here.

405
00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:32,719
She came here for dinner
with her mom.

406
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,130
I guess you didn't know.

407
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,300
Gosh, it's obvious.

408
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,600
She couldn't help but come
because Grandma insisted.

409
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,909
Make your position clear.

410
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,880
You're the one
who abandoned Gong Hee...

411
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,479
and chose Kang Ji Na.

412
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:58,749
What did you tell me
when we were young?

413
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,050
"Be decisive when making choices."

414
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,449
"Be sure to take responsibility."

415
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,850
You know,

416
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,890
I thought
you looked so cool back then.

417
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,830
But...

418
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:13,130
why is it that Seo Min Gi
doesn't look cool at all anymore?

419
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,800
If you made a decisive choice,

420
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,669
take responsibility for it as well.

421
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,640
Don't let me down anymore...

422
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,810
while I still consider you
my friend.

423
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:32,080
You could've said this
over the phone.

424
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,780
Why are you making me come and go?

425
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,919
You'll have to come to me
whenever I call you from now on.

426
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,290
What?

427
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:44,259
Come and report to me
on what's going on at work.

428
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,699
I don't need to know
about anything else.

429
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,229
Just report to me
about the fashion show.

430
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,830
I think I should know.

431
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,640
You're unbelievable.

432
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,009
You took time off work
because you just felt like it.

433
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,610
So why are you curious
about what goes on at work?

434
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,580
What are you planning on doing?

435
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,719
Forget it. I'm done talking.

436
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:07,949
I have nothing more to say.

437
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,650
You can go or whatever.

438
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:33,340
Hey, Gu Dan Soo!

439
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:36,780
Without you here,

440
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:40,679
I don't have anyone
to eat late-night snacks with!

441
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,489
Why do I have to order so much...

442
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:45,759
just to have some tteokbokki
delivered?

443
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,229
I don't have anyone to go
to the convenience store with...

444
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:51,530
even when I'm scared
to go out alone at night!

445
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,860
You said to lean on you
when things were hard!

446
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,100
You said
you'd always stay by my side!

447
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:01,070
So why did you leave?

448
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:03,840
You should be by my side, at least!

449
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,239
How could you leave like that...

450
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,009
just because I got a little angry?

451
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,949
Why do I feel so frustrated...

452
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,719
no matter how much I yell?

453
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,530
Gu Dan Soo!

454
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:30,769
Hey! You jerk!

455
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,900
Gu Dan Soo, you total fraud!

456
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:35,439
Hey!

457
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:37,009
Why are you calling me?

458
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,070
Gu Dan Soo, you...

459
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:10,870
I'm right here.

460
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,959
(My Merry Marriage)

461
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,290
There's something you don't know.

462
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,830
I wasn't just friends with you.

463
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,060
You were my first love.

464
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,189
Hey, Gu Dan Soo.

465
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:33,600
Friends? That won't cut it for me.

466
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,060
I want to become more than that.

467
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,300
Arms in the air.

468
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,229
I can change myself.

469
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:41,769
Mom told me
that I should get changed on my own.

470
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:43,110
Didn't your mom
tell you anything else?

471
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,179
Ssook Ssook,
you don't have a daddy anymore.

472
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,739
Do you know how I was treated today?

473
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:50,009
I'll put things right.

474
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:52,280
I'll put everything back
to where they should be.

475
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,050
