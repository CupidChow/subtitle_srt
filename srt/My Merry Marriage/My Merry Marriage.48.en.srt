00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,740
(Episode 48)

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,740
Hey.

3
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,179
I told you to call me
when you were done. Why...

4
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,320
Maeng Gong Hee.

5
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,050
What's wrong with me?

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,719
Tears keep rolling down my face.
How strange.

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,699
You won't ask me why I'm crying?

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,870
No, I won't ask anything...

9
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,399
until you tell me.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,770
But let me ask you this one thing.

11
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,710
Are you all right?

12
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:59,179
Of course, I'm fine.

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,109
It's me, Maeng Gong Hee.

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,710
Hey.

15
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,020
You don't need to act tough.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,189
If you feel like
you're about to fall,

17
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,189
just let yourself fall.

18
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:11,460
You don't need to shout loudly
to hide how depressed you are...

19
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,490
or overwork yourself
to get your mind off of it.

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,490
In front of me, at least.

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,859
When you feel like
you're about to fall,

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,170
I'll be there to hold you.

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,799
When you wobble,

24
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:24,700
I'll help you up.

25
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:46,930
Thanks.

26
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,659
For asking nothing.

27
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,980
(Bubble Up Laundry)

28
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,159
Are you getting ready
for a battle or something?

29
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,930
Why are you eating so aggressively?

30
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,599
Tell us what's going on.

31
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,500
Are you in shock or something?

32
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,139
In shock?

33
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,639
Why would I be?

34
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,139
You eat like that...

35
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,110
when you're going through
something bad.

36
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,080
Oh, come on.
Gong Hee always eats like this.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,479
Actually,
she normally eats more than this.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,150
- Hey, eat up.
- Thanks.

39
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:50,689
Dan Soo.

40
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,430
Can you drop this off
at Tiffany Alterations?

41
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,759
Sure, I can do that.

42
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,300
You need to get
something else altered?

43
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,330
Yes, well...

44
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,939
Oh, the hem got ripped.

45
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,069
Hey, you can drop it off yourself
on your way out.

46
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,340
Her shop is very close.
Why must you make Dan Soo do it?

47
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,919
Hearing this
might make you uncomfortable.

48
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,520
About Geon... No.

49
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,219
I mean, Dan Soo.

50
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,189
Could you help me
so I can see Dan Soo often?

51
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,759
Dan Soo?

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Yes.

53
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,729
I'm not saying I want to act
like his mom after all these years.

54
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,500
But...

55
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,240
I want to...

56
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,370
stay by his side now...

57
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,810
even just as a neighbor.

58
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,180
Would that be too hard for you?

59
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,349
I will help you.

60
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,050
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,889
Dan Soo, I want you to drop it off
at the alteration shop...

62
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,560
and wait there
to pick it up when it's ready.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,199
What... Wait there?

64
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,099
Yes, I have to...

65
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,770
wear it today.

66
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,800
Dad,
then I'll do it for you quickly.

67
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,909
I can do this much too.

68
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,240
Right, just take it
to the alteration shop.

69
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,479
As neighbors, we should support
each other's businesses.

70
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,409
She always buys dumplings from us...

71
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,020
and brings us side dishes too.

72
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,650
Right. Then I'll drop it off
on my way out.

73
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,990
- You should...
- Hey!

74
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,829
Darn it.

75
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,740
Hello, ma'am.

76
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,250
My son.

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,389
What have I done to you
all this time?

78
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,120
I thought your dad
would have stayed with you...

79
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,560
by your side.

80
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,259
You were on your own
without your dad.

81
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,860
How lonely have you been?

82
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,329
How hard has it been?

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,040
Hello, why are you outside?

84
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,670
The sunshine felt nice today.

85
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,540
I was just getting some air.

86
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,709
I was on my way to see you anyway.

87
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,310
Is that so?

88
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:28,509
Yes.

89
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,920
Mr. Maeng asked me
to bring this to you.

90
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:32,949
I see.

91
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
Let's go inside.

92
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,009
Come on in.

93
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,379
Let me see.

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,220
Okay.

95
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,019
It'll be done soon.

96
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,790
Do you want to wait?

97
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,189
Mr. Maeng told me to wait here...

98
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,389
and bring it back.

99
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,259
Oh, I see.

100
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,870
Have a seat here.
Would you like some coffee?

101
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,639
Oh, that would be nice.

102
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,439
I was just thinking
about getting some now.

103
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
Thank you.

104
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,360
My, this smells great.

105
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,430
What?

106
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,430
This tastes like
it has the hoofprint...

107
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,439
of a wild horse
running on the African plains.

108
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,139
It's comforting,
yet slightly stimulating,

109
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,610
and while providing
a break from life,

110
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,579
it gives you the energy
to go on living.

111
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,180
That's how I'd describe this aroma.

112
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,319
You must like coffee.

113
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,550
I must've liked the smell of coffee
since childhood.

114
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,689
I have a faint memory of it.

115
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:22,430
That person...

116
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:24,629
with the aroma of coffee.

117
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,699
Who is that person?

118
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,699
A person...

119
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,810
called my mom, who left me long ago.

120
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,050
My dad got into an accident
while he was out looking...

121
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,449
for my mom.

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,420
I was left all alone.

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,660
That's how it feels...

124
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,290
when you're abandoned by your mom.

125
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,800
It feels like the whole world
has abandoned you.

126
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,029
So, I kept wandering around.

127
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:08,370
Aren't you...

128
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,370
curious about your mom?

129
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,379
About where she is
and how she's doing?

130
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:17,149
I'm sure she's alive somewhere.

131
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,720
I just hope she's doing well.

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,420
If she left like that
only to have an unhappy life,

133
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,889
that would make me even angrier.

134
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,699
Geon, it's me. It's Mom.

135
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,160
I'm telling you all sorts of things.

136
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:37,569
Wait, did you put a spell
on this coffee or something?

137
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:40,069
A spell that makes people
spill their secrets?

138
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,839
You can come and have some coffee
whenever you'd like.

139
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,910
I'll always be here.

140
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,019
If I keep coming here for coffee,

141
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,490
I might tell you all my secrets.

142
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,990
If you keep things bottled up,

143
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,059
your heavy heart will keep you
from living your life.

144
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:03,059
It would be nice
if you can be lighthearted...

145
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,259
after you leave everything with me.

146
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,299
I have a very tight pair of lips,
you know.

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,330
If you want to talk,

148
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:12,100
you can come over anytime.

149
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,539
I feel a bit better, thanks to you.

150
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,879
I had been feeling frustrated.

151
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,500
- Come again.
- Shoot. Again?

152
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,639
Hey, your fists have a lot of
unnecessary things attached to them.

153
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:46,899
They seem chaotic.

154
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,679
Come on. Don't hesitate.
Just throw your punch.

155
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,750
- Go.
- Don't tell me...

156
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,980
you had a one-sided crush on him...

157
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,480
without knowing
that he had a girlfriend.

158
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,350
You missed that, didn't you?

159
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,919
It's been a while
since the last time...

160
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,220
I saw you this distracted
during a sparring session.

161
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,429
Is something really going on?

162
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:11,259
No. As if.

163
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,700
- Let's go again.
- Is that right?

164
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,769
- All right. Focus.
- Okay.

165
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,440
I told you to focus.

166
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,669
I am a wench
who gobbled up my husband.

167
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,440
I killed my husband.

168
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,950
Dad, you're the one who seems
to have a lot on your mind.

169
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:33,750
It's nothing like that.

170
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,820
I've been sparring with you
for years now.

171
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,190
Don't try to fool me.

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,889
Tell me the truth.

173
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,590
Are you interrogating a criminal?

174
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,730
Of course.
I'm a detective's daughter.

175
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,769
Your fists have so many worries
hanging off of them.

176
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:48,769
Is that right?

177
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,039
Stop playing tricks.

178
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,539
Bring it on.
I've still got a lot of fight in me.

179
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,210
I haven't even warmed up yet either.

180
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,509
- Is that right? Hit me!
- Okay!

181
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,940
Nice, 1, 2.

182
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,750
That's it. Short!

183
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,750
All right. Come in.
Yes, right in the middle. That's it!

184
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,779
Shall we dance to a jazz song?

185
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,990
Princess Kang Ji Na?

186
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
Nice.

187
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,019
Keep those uppercuts coming.

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
That's it!

189
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,460
Mr. Maeng,
I brought back your clothes.

190
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,690
Oh, hey.

191
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,559
Hey, you. Perfect timing.

192
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,799
Stand right here.

193
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,429
What timing is this?

194
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:54,500
I don't like this picture.

195
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,570
I really want
to beat someone up today.

196
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
How about you take a beating?

197
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,539
I think that will help me loosen up.

198
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:02,769
Mr. Maeng,
will you just let her do this?

199
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,110
Thank you.

200
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,509
If a man wants to survive
in the jungle,

201
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,110
he should be able
to overcome this much.

202
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,179
- Hey!
- Wait, Mr. Maeng!

203
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,889
Just stand here for five minutes.

204
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,389
I'll finish up soon.

205
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,620
Do I really have to?

206
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,929
Don't be scared. Don't you know me?

207
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,759
Hey, no! I don't want to!

208
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,009
Don't you think...

209
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,409
Gong Hee and Dan Soo
are more than just friends?

210
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,580
They've been friends
since they were little.

211
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,080
It doesn't feel like that.

212
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,889
There's some tension between them,
like between a man and a woman.

213
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,120
Not Gu Dan Soo.
He's an immature kid.

214
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,659
Gong Hee should date someone better.

215
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,259
Let it go.

216
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,330
Whether they're lingering feelings
or regret,

217
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,529
let those emotions go.

218
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:08,509
I got Seo Min Gi back,
the man I love.

219
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,980
I won't allow you
to have anything left in your heart.

220
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,179
I feel the same way.

221
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,919
Get rid of everything you have left
in your heart.

222
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,690
Tell the chairwoman
when you go to work.

223
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,590
Tell her that you won't go ahead...

224
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,059
with the engagement with Dan Soo.

225
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,330
Why aren't you answering me?

226
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,299
All right. I get it.

227
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,399
I'll go and see the chairwoman
as soon as I get to work.

228
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:39,970
Are we good now?

229
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,970
Yes.

230
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,559
- Gu Dan Soo.
- Why? What?

231
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,919
Thanks.

232
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,590
For being there for me.

233
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,429
For holding my hand
so I wouldn't fall apart.

234
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,100
And for acting like nothing happened
in front of my family.

235
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,440
Do you feel better now?

236
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,470
You know, in Kkotsan,

237
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,179
it was raining so hard.

238
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:22,649
Suddenly, I saw Mr. Seo
running toward me,

239
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,179
and his shoulders were soaked.

240
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,450
So, I tried to wipe him down.

241
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,549
I was really flustered
at that moment.

242
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,289
If I just focus
on my day-to-day life,

243
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,490
this, too, shall pass soon, right?

244
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,799
Thanks.

245
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:41,330
I should do some work.

246
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,210
I can see that
you're not okay yet...

247
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:51,909
even if you try to smile like that.

248
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,990
Will it really pass soon?

249
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,960
I feel like it'll all...

250
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,759
come flooding down any minute.

251
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,470
Even so, I must take care
of what I need to do.

252
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,679
I can't get washed away like this.

253
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,049
I'll get Holly on board,
no matter what.

254
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,850
Dear Holly.

255
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:44,899
Ta-da.

256
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:46,659
Goodness.

257
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,399
You're heavily in debt.

258
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,169
You can't afford to drink wine.

259
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:51,470
Gosh, go and put it back.

260
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,340
You've filled the cart
with things you want to eat.

261
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,610
I told you.
These are all for Ssook Ssook.

262
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,740
Let's not be so frugal.

263
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,980
Quality of life is important.

264
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,220
Are you saying
we should sacrifice...

265
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,250
the quality of Ssook Ssook's things
to improve the quality of your life?

266
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,090
Well, this is my only hobby.

267
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,320
Quit hobbies that cost money.

268
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,759
Do things that don't cost a thing.

269
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,029
Stop pigging out, okay?

270
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:17,159
Why don't you exercise?

271
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,600
Then should I join a gym?

272
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,830
Are you rich?

273
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:23,429
Just jump rope.

274
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,070
I can't even eat good food.

275
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,909
You want me to live
as if I'm barely surviving?

276
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:31,639
You can try fermenting milk
to make cheese.

277
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,409
Why not tell me to get milk
from a cow at a dairy farm?

278
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,549
Goodness. Ssook Ssook.

279
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,279
Why is your dad whining nonstop
today?

280
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,019
Ssook Ssook, you should
always listen to Mom. Okay?

281
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,019
In return, Mommy will buy you...

282
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,659
anything and everything
you want to eat.

283
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:53,460
Until then, your dad should
stay determined, right?

284
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,299
He should be as frugal...

285
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,230
as possible.

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Goodness.

287
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,580
Why did that sound like...

288
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,440
she wanted to suffocate me?

289
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,480
Wait up!

290
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,850
Oh, you're here.

291
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,789
It's very good to see you.

292
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,220
I was worried
you might be skipping lunch.

293
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:20,659
Thank you.

294
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,700
You don't look so well.
Are you upset about something?

295
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,529
No, I guess
I'm coming down with something.

296
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,799
You like galbi dumplings, right?

297
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,200
It'll only be a moment.

298
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,109
- My gosh. There's a fire.
- What? A fire?

299
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,210
- What?
- There's a fire in the building.

300
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,349
- My gosh.
- Get out of here now.

301
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:44,750
- Wait, hold on.
- What?

302
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,849
Hold on, this is...

303
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,849
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

304
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:51,049
My goodness. Are you all right?

305
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,460
- I think I sprained my ankle.
- Your ankle?

306
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,130
Oh, no. Here. Get on my back.

307
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,930
Here, let me carry you.

308
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,400
- Hey, hurry up and get out of here.
- There. Are you all right?

309
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,630
- All right, then. Let's hurry.
- What? Hang on.

310
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,099
- Let's go.
- What is he doing?

311
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,799
What? Does he not see
that we're here too?

312
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,400
He's carrying the sleepwalker
on his back?

313
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:12,180
Unbelievable. Anyway, let's go.
We have to get out of here!

314
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,079
Gosh, my goodness.

315
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,079
Is your left foot okay?

316
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,680
- Let me see.
- I panicked.

317
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,819
What happened? My goodness.

318
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,349
It must hurt a lot.

319
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:23,450
You should see a doctor.

320
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,160
- Wait.
- Gosh, what is going on?

321
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,289
Goodness. It was a false alarm.

322
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,289
- It was a false alarm?
- Yes. It must've been a prank.

323
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,259
That's nuts.

324
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,500
Who pulled a prank like this?

325
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,599
- Let's go back inside.
- Darn it.

326
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,630
Is your ankle okay?

327
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,839
- I told you. It's fine.
- Even so, you should...

328
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,069
Myung Ja,
you must've been really surprised.

329
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,539
Let's go back inside.
You should eat your dumplings.

330
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,450
Oh, dear.

331
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,990
Myung Ja must've been hurt.

332
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,660
You should've taken care
of Myung Ja first.

333
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,660
Oh, boy.

334
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Darn it.

335
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,869
Anyway, you bumped into the others
on our way out.

336
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:14,740
- Is your backside okay?
- What? My backside?

337
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,269
- You bumped into the others.
- I'm fine.

338
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,140
Gosh, I'm fine.

339
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,710
- Are you sure?
- Stop staring at me, seriously.

340
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,009
(Maeng Dumplings)

341
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,950
Where is Audrey?

342
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,049
Well, she said she'd eat later.

343
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,059
Hey, Gyeong Tae.

344
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:35,460
Goodness. It's not just machines
that malfunction.

345
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,089
Humans can malfunction too.

346
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,700
They said a fire broke out
in the building.

347
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,930
How could you save another woman
instead of your own wife and sister?

348
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,369
Well, she sprained her ankle.

349
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:48,910
But was it all an act?

350
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,569
Or did that fox
actually sprain her ankle?

351
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:51,980
Did you think about it carefully?

352
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:53,779
Goodness.

353
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:57,680
Hey, what's there
to think carefully about?

354
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,549
I bet he doesn't even care
whether or not...

355
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,289
his wife burns to death.

356
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,660
Come on, honey. What are you saying?

357
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,160
You're strong.

358
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:10,859
So is Gyeong Bok!

359
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,059
I'm strong?

360
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,099
I won't get burned by fire
because I'm strong?

361
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,569
I never asked you
to treat me like a queen,

362
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:21,339
but you shouldn't embarrass me
at the very least!

363
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:23,509
What? I'd never do anything...

364
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:24,880
- that could embarrass you...
- Be quiet!

365
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,109
They say your husband is worse
than a complete stranger.

366
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:29,509
It's so true!

367
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:30,910
- My goodness.
- Darn you.

368
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:35,490
Mr. Maeng! He's here.
I think he's looking for me.

369
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,150
- I saw him over there.
- What? Oh, no.

370
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,660
- Let's go into the kitchen.
- My goodness.

371
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,529
What is happening now?

372
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,190
What is this?

373
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,529
Excuse me.

374
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,759
Hello.

375
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,670
Hello, are you here for dumplings?

376
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,069
No, I'm not.

377
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,900
About the alternation shop
over there.

378
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,809
There's no one inside.

379
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,339
Do you know the owner of the shop?

380
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,740
Well...

381
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
What is this?

382
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,609
Well, what brings you...

383
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:06,480
to the alternation shop?

384
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,349
It's something personal.

385
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,289
The owner of the alteration shop...

386
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,930
closed the shop early today...

387
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,390
and went home already, right?

388
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,299
That's right. She said
her vision suddenly went blurry.

389
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,799
I think she went home to rest.

390
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,069
That's right. My goodness.
How does she still sew at that age?

391
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:30,069
I find it so fascinating.

392
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,480
Is the owner of the alteration shop
pretty old?

393
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,650
My goodness. She's been running
the shop here for over 30 years.

394
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,190
From what I've heard,
it was a bar up until recently.

395
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,890
- What? Well, that's...
- That place was...

396
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,299
The shop was right next to the bar.

397
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,329
When the bar moved out,
she moved into that space.

398
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:00,099
Anyway, why are you interrogating us
about our neighbors?

399
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,200
This seems suspicious.

400
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm looking for someone.

401
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,680
That's your problem.

402
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,410
If you aren't here for dumplings,
please leave now.

403
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,480
We'll get customers soon,
so don't interrupt our business. Go.

404
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,609
- Leave now.
- But...

405
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:12,319
Come back when you're hungry.

406
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,619
Bye. When you're hungry,

407
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:15,549
- you can come back.
- Well done!

408
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:16,789
Go!

409
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,220
My goodness.

410
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,619
Oh, dear.

411
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,329
He left. Here, you can get up now.

412
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,700
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

413
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,130
- Oh, no.
- Gosh, be careful.

414
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
All right.
Now, explain what's going on.

415
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,240
What just happened?

416
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,440
Well, it was just...

417
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,009
I mean, he's a stalker.

418
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,680
He's been stalking Audrey.

419
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,019
What? A stalker?

420
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,759
I asked Mr. Maeng for help.
I'm sorry.

421
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,059
He kept waiting for me
in front of my shop...

422
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:58,730
and wouldn't leave me alone.

423
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,069
Oh, dear.
This world is such a scary place.

424
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:05,940
He showed up in broad daylight
and wasn't afraid to show his face.

425
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,339
Shouldn't we report him
to the police?

426
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,839
Come on. You ladies have
a detective right here.

427
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,880
I mean, an ex-cop.

428
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,349
Exactly. You're just an ex-cop.

429
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:19,579
My gosh. You're getting old now.
Don't get involved.

430
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,150
Oh, boy.
They used to call me Lion Maeng.

431
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,319
Goodness. Even a cat would beat you.

432
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,319
Oh, dear.

433
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
Holly.

434
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Holly?

435
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:44,269
Holly.

436
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,440
Did you really send this email?

437
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,349
I asked for you
because I was curious.

438
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,380
You emailed me, right?

439
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,849
Why are you looking for me?

440
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:02,789
I'm Maeng Gong Hee,

441
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:04,930
from Jayce Fashion in Korea.

442
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,630
Our team wants
to collaborate with you...

443
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,400
as the main designer
for the brand we're launching.

444
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,069
Why me?

445
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,710
I'm asking
why you chose me specifically.

446
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,980
(Maeng Gong Hee)

447
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,779
You can do it.

448
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,920
You said you'd be able
to convince Holly.

449
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,859
In the foreword of your book,
you wrote,

450
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,160
"You are not alone."

451
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:43,670
Can I ask what you meant by that?

452
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,670
What do you think it means?

453
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,609
I think...

454
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,809
it means "comfort."

455
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,519
There was someone
I wanted to comfort too.

456
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:07,720
(Tiffany Alterations)

457
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,539
When you make clothes,

458
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,470
you want the person wearing them
to feel comfortable,

459
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,079
to feel good
in the clothes you're making.

460
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:27,779
Holly.

461
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,150
Your designs have the same warmth.

462
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,119
When you wear clothes
made with such intention,

463
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,390
you can feel it.

464
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,960
You think,
"Oh, this was made for me."

465
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,859
And I think that can be comforting.

466
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,769
"You are not alone."

467
00:25:50,569 --> 00:25:52,170
"I'll be with you."

468
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,069
It's the sense of comfort
delivered through clothing.

469
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:01,140
That's the kind of clothing
I want to make.

470
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,289
Are you there? Holly?

471
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,890
(Maeng Gong Hee)

472
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,799
I messaged her as Holly...

473
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,869
in case she was feeling down.

474
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:31,170
I guess I didn't have to worry.

475
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,650
She totally knocked me out.

476
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,180
You are...

477
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,289
Maeng Ggong, indeed.

478
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,789
Like the toad that croaks loudly,

479
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,759
even in the mountains
and the fields,

480
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,059
and even when you're lonely
or stressed.

481
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Let's sit.

482
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,859
Did you have a good weekend?

483
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,569
No.

484
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,500
Actually, I wasn't in my right mind
all weekend long.

485
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,039
I kept forcing myself to smile,

486
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,680
and I'd lose my mind
when I was alone.

487
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:43,779
I thought I'd feel even more upset
if I kept living like that.

488
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,549
That's why I asked to meet.

489
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,390
I wanted to end things properly.

490
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:54,490
I wanted to check something
with you.

491
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,990
Sure.

492
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:02,000
Are you getting married, Mr. Seo?

493
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,599
Is that why you broke up with me?

494
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,150
(My Merry Marriage)

495
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,319
Just be sad for three days.

496
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,549
And then, please look at me.

497
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,119
Get engaged right away...

498
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,730
- and come back home.
- Grandma!

499
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,259
"Grandma?"

500
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:34,829
What will we do
about our newlywed home?

501
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:37,029
We're already set
on our newlywed home.

502
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,740
How are you so close with your wife?

503
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,170
But I don't have a wife.

504
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,170
What did you say?

505
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:45,279
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
