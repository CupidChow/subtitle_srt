1
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:25,229
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,359
I'm slacking off.

3
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,699
I learned this from you.

4
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,740
Let's go.

5
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:41,339
Come with me.

6
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,510
Hey.

7
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,119
You weren't even listening
to Mr. Ryu in class.

8
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,749
You just kept glaring at Ssang Sook.

9
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:54,060
Are you that upset that
you had to give her back her scarf?

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,090
Why would I be upset
over a piece of cloth?

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,289
A luxury brand is no big deal.

12
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,730
I have to say,

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,130
you only get like this
with Ssang Sook.

14
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,370
You keep provoking her.
Don't do that.

15
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,969
It's not like I want to provoke her.

16
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,340
She irks me like crazy.

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,370
Just listen to me.
Provoking her will do you no good.

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,410
Hey, I don't think
it's just about Gyeong Tae.

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,410
What is it?

20
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:18,009
Is there something I don't know?

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,179
Forget it.

22
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:24,690
So, there is something.
There must be.

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,050
What is it?

24
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,419
You can tell me.

25
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,690
I mean, why did she have to...

26
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,000
put that scarf
around my husband's neck?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,929
I must say, my husband is a fool
for letting her do that.

28
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,229
What a fool.

29
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,699
Seriously,
I want to twist his neck...

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
What was that?

31
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,009
Oh, no.

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,679
Goodness.
Why are you blaming Gyeong Tae?

33
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:52,949
Don't you know how Ssang Sook is?

34
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:54,979
What could he have done?
She always throws herself at him.

35
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,619
I bet he felt trapped
in that moment.

36
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,190
My gosh!
Why did you get so many things?

37
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,229
Why did you miss
the poetry workshop again?

38
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,429
Mr. Ryu asked about you again.

39
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,669
You don't look so well.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,369
Are you coming down with something?

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,470
No. Work has been busy.

42
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,509
Anyway,
is it someone's birthday today?

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,410
Our dear Gong Hee got a promotion.

44
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,780
She got rid of
her temporary employee tag...

45
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
and became a permanent employee.

46
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,419
Oh, my! That's such great news.

47
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,150
I should congratulate Gong Hee.

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,190
Come over to our house
and have dinner with us.

49
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,419
Can I...

50
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,090
really do that?

51
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,389
Yes, of course.

52
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,729
We really enjoyed the side dishes
you gave us last time.

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,100
Then let me go home first...

54
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,269
and come right over.
I'll help you prepare dinner.

55
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,609
See you in a bit, Myung Ja.

56
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:52,840
What? My goodness.

57
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,139
We invited her just as a courtesy.

58
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,210
What's with her?
She said yes right away,

59
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,479
as if she had been waiting
for such an invitation.

60
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,919
It's such a hassle to cook
for yourself when you live alone.

61
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,720
I'm happy to see
that she's so excited.

62
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,060
You trust people too easily.
That's your problem.

63
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,759
You shouldn't invite people over
so easily.

64
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,759
You're at it again.

65
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,359
My goodness.

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:15,930
(Maeng Dumplings)

67
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:20,100
I have a bad feeling about this.

68
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,739
She'd better not flirt
with my brother.

69
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,940
I will be watching...

70
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,440
with my eyes wide open.

71
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,819
Don't hold it all in,
stuck in the office.

72
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,250
Yell all you want and let it go.

73
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,190
"I'm so annoyed!"

74
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,060
"This is really unfair."

75
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,060
You'll feel better.

76
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,810
Hey!

77
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,340
What did I do so wrong?

78
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,509
I...

79
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,250
I worked so hard.

80
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,880
I poured my heart and soul into it!

81
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,620
Was I...

82
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,690
too arrogant for hoping I'd win?

83
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,930
No.

84
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,000
Am I not even qualified
to be a permanent employee?

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,340
Am I that incompetent?

86
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,870
You did well, Maeng Gong Hee.

87
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,350
I'm annoyed.

88
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,479
Ms. Kang,
who told me to look for another job,

89
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,950
and everyone else
who got my hopes up.

90
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,320
They're all so annoying.

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
And...

92
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,260
I feel horrible.

93
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,169
To Mom,

94
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:00,600
Dad,

95
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,239
and Auntie Gyeong Bok too.

96
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,580
They must be as excited as I was.

97
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:11,910
It's not your fault.

98
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,119
You know that
I worked so hard for it, right?

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Yes, I know.

100
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,320
I know that, for sure.

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,229
I do have the right
to say that it's unfair, right?

102
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,330
Yes, you do.

103
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,530
You totally have the right
to say that.

104
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,119
Do you want me to tell you
all the complaints we've had?

105
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,020
I'd rather recite
the entire Tripitaka Koreana to you.

106
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,160
Why were you trying
to bite my head off...

107
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,729
throughout the meeting?

108
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,200
Was I so wrong to say...

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,229
that you disappointed Gong Hee...

110
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,229
by getting ahead of yourself?

111
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,669
Who says that's the reason?

112
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,799
Do you know what the agency said?

113
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:10,400
If you're in charge of the project,
they won't cooperate with us...

114
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,770
on any photo shoots.
What will you do about this?

115
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,010
What will you do?

116
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,979
If you keep getting on my nerves
like this,

117
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,780
I won't just sit back
and let things slide...

118
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,220
during the personnel evaluations.

119
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,580
Director Lee.

120
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,460
You keep threatening me
with the personnel evaluations.

121
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,789
If you keep doing this to me,

122
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,330
you might regret it later on.

123
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:34,859
Why do people keep saying...

124
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,729
that I will regret things later on?

125
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,830
Goodness.

126
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,799
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

127
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,100
Why can't I reach Gong Hee?

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,609
Gong Hee?

129
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,369
She took the afternoon off.

130
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,109
She did?

131
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,479
Gu Dan Soo called.
He's with her right now.

132
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,789
(Team Manager Seo Min Gi)

133
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,600
Why aren't you answering?

134
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,970
It seems to be from Min Gi.

135
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,039
Right now,

136
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,309
I don't want to.

137
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,640
I don't want to show him
how down I am.

138
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,410
I thought he was your boyfriend.

139
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,179
That's why I don't want to show him
even more.

140
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,419
Mr. Seo always thinks...

141
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,220
that I'm brave.

142
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,559
Someone who gets back up
no matter how many times she falls.

143
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,059
Like a roly-poly toy.

144
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,499
Someone he wants to root for.

145
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,669
Someone he does root for.

146
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,770
When did the definition
of girlfriend...

147
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,939
change like that?

148
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,210
Is he a fan of an idol star
or something?

149
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,609
Is he cheering for an athlete
competing in the Summer Games?

150
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,679
If his girlfriend is going through
something tough,

151
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,109
he should hurry up
and console her first.

152
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,650
I feel much better now.

153
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,890
Maybe it's because I shouted
as much as I wanted to.

154
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,229
Thanks, Gu Dan Soo.

155
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,100
Actually,

156
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,229
I felt...

157
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
awkward around you.

158
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,270
We seemed to have grown apart
all of a sudden lately.

159
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,809
And you didn't seem like the friend
I had known since my childhood.

160
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,559
Why are you thinking about it
like that?

161
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,530
Just think that I was being fussy
from feeling sleepy.

162
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,859
Still, thank you...

163
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,769
for consoling me...

164
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,499
and being considerate of me.

165
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm really glad...

166
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,840
that you're my friend.

167
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,950
Your friend.

168
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,550
You said I deserved it.

169
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,220
If I hadn't heard that,

170
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,149
I really might have gotten down
on myself.

171
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,060
Getting down on yourself
doesn't suit you.

172
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,330
You're Maeng Ggong,

173
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,759
just like the toad
that cries out loud...

174
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:25,970
in the fields and the mountains.

175
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,509
Hey, there's a star!

176
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,580
There's a star out already?

177
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,420
The sun hasn't even gone down.

178
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,779
It's really there.

179
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,889
Is it the morning star?

180
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,159
It's been so long
since I've seen one.

181
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,430
Well,

182
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,759
I haven't had much time
to look up at the sky...

183
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,200
ever since I became an adult.

184
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:01,540
You're right.

185
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,739
When we were little,

186
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,269
we'd always play outside
until this hour...

187
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,509
and see it often.

188
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,009
Then, our stomachs would grumble,

189
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,950
and we'd run home to eat dinner.

190
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,950
Do you remember?

191
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,519
We were stuck together
like peas and carrots.

192
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:20,889
If you want to change your fate,

193
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,989
ask the stars for help.

194
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,200
Can I...

195
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,769
change fate?

196
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,100
What fate?

197
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,389
My gosh! Hey!

198
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:01,499
There's a shooting star!

199
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,430
How is there a shooting star
at this hour?

200
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,109
Please let me become
a permanent employee next time.

201
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,109
I should...

202
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,649
change fate next time.

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,820
A party to celebrate her promotion?

204
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:26,619
That's right. Come home early.

205
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,859
You should congratulate
your sister too.

206
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,690
All right.
I'll see if I can make it.

207
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,330
Okay, bye.

208
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,029
Mom says to come home early...

209
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,869
to have a party
for Gong Hee's promotion.

210
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,269
Oh, no.

211
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,340
Gong Hee didn't get promoted
to a permanent employee.

212
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:47,409
What? She didn't?

213
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,609
No.

214
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,249
I mean, I thought
she'd definitely win the contest...

215
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,050
and become a permanent employee too.

216
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,350
But the results
were suddenly overturned.

217
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,749
Gosh, what should I do?

218
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,420
I think Mom got excited
and put together a party.

219
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,119
Should I tell her?

220
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,229
Wouldn't it be better
for Gong Hee to say so herself?

221
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,499
Gosh, the whole house
will be in an uproar again.

222
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,170
Goodness, I won't go.

223
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,440
I can't imagine watching that scene.

224
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,869
Well, Gong Hee is good at her job.

225
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm sure she'll get another chance.

226
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,440
Oh, by the way...

227
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:25,080
Here, take a look at this.

228
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
What?

229
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,050
- "Marriage Vows?"
- Yes.

230
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,489
"One, Maeng Gong Boo will only love
Eom Hong Dan forever."

231
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,859
"Two, Maeng Gong Boo..."

232
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
"will obey Eom Hong Dan's words,
no matter what."

233
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,670
Here. "Three, Maeng Gong Boo..."

234
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,139
"will not lie to Eom Hong Dan."

235
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:51,239
"Four, Maeng Gong Boo will answer
Eom Hong Dan's calls..."

236
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:54,269
"before the third ring." Okay?

237
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:56,479
"Five, Maeng Gong Boo
will provide..."

238
00:12:56,479 --> 00:13:01,009
"mental and material stability
for Eom Hong Dan."

239
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:02,479
(Marriage Vows)

240
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,749
What is this?

241
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,320
Our marriage vows.

242
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,190
It says so right here.

243
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,960
I went to meet your family,

244
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,200
not even knowing
how big your family was.

245
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,229
I played my part...

246
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,269
as the daughter-in-law
and your new bride,

247
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,639
so I thought we should agree
on these few rules...

248
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,570
since this is your second time
getting married.

249
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,570
You call these marriage vows?
It's practically a slave contract.

250
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,680
Where should we go on our honeymoon?

251
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,210
Before that,
where should our wedding venue be?

252
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,749
Since I should hold up my dignity
as a doctor's wife...

253
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Director Lee, I will stomp on...

254
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,399
that stuck-up nose of yours.

255
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:54,700
"The dignity as a doctor's wife?"
As if.

256
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,369
Gosh, what if she causes trouble
at this rate?

257
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,379
(Bubble Up Laundry)

258
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,749
Hey, I don't think I can go in.

259
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,379
Can you tell I cried?

260
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,519
Your face does seem a little puffy.

261
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,190
Oh, really?

262
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,420
I'm just kidding. You look the same.

263
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,659
You're always puffy.

264
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,460
You little...

265
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,800
This isn't the time to joke around.

266
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,369
Mom will be so disappointed.

267
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,670
What's the big deal?

268
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,769
It's not like
you haven't disappointed her before.

269
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,769
Hey, will you keep hitting me
where it hurts?

270
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,080
That's right. I wanted you
to shout out loud like this.

271
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,810
Stop being so down.
That's not like you.

272
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:42,420
There will be another chance.

273
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,420
Soon. Before long. For sure.

274
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Do you think so?

275
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,859
I promise you.

276
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,889
If you don't get promoted
next time either,

277
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,060
then I'll take responsibility
for you.

278
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,060
Take responsibility for what?

279
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Seriously,
you're so full of yourself.

280
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:04,100
(We're proud of you!
Permanent Employee Maeng Gong Hee!)

281
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,509
(We're proud of you!
Permanent Employee Maeng Gong Hee!)

282
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:12,979
What's this?

283
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,279
Did someone win a medal
at the Summer Games?

284
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,749
- I'm doomed.
- My gosh.

285
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:26,029
- Surprise!
- Congratulations!

286
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:27,930
Good job.

287
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:31,529
Gosh, what is all this?

288
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,540
Gong Hee, come in and have a seat.
You too, Dan Soo.

289
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Yes.

290
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,739
Come in.

291
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:41,409
Your auntie worked so hard
to cook for you, Gong Hee!

292
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,139
Hey, niece. I heard you finally
became a permanent employee.

293
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,149
Congratulations.

294
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,220
I helped them prepare all this.

295
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:52,019
My gosh. I'm so proud of you.

296
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,720
I know how hard you worked for it,
my daughter.

297
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
Yes.

298
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,830
All right. Let's all sit down.

299
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,830
Hey, Gong Hee. Look at all this.

300
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,499
Your mom practically bought
everything at the market.

301
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,369
She told everyone at the market...

302
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:14,810
that her daughter finally became
a permanent employee.

303
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,580
The cake is too much.
I said not to put it on the table.

304
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,979
Having cake is the best part
of any celebration.

305
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:25,619
Gong Hee, I made this from scratch.

306
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:28,359
My, she is a woman of many talents.

307
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Thank you.

308
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,129
Oh, no. The cake will get cold.

309
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,460
Hurry up and light the candles.
We'll eat it right away.

310
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,129
Gyeong Bok,
do you like your cake warm?

311
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,129
Yes, I do!

312
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:40,729
Of course.

313
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,440
- I like it warm.
- Heat it up in the microwave.

314
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,609
Should I?

315
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,440
(TF Team,
Marketing Manager Seo Min Gi)

316
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:54,920
Yes, Mom.

317
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,320
Will you be home late again?

318
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,889
Yes, I'm swamped with work.

319
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,420
By the way, I heard
Kang Myung Ja's daughter...

320
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,190
finally got rid of
her temporary employee tag.

321
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,190
Listen. Even if
she's a permanent employee now,

322
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,159
I will not approve of her.
Do you understand?

323
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,899
Why does it matter whether or not
she's a permanent employee?

324
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:14,769
Also,

325
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
Gong Hee isn't
a permanent employee yet.

326
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,470
What?

327
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,710
Myung Ja said
she was getting a promotion today.

328
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,709
It was canceled.

329
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,649
My goodness.

330
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
So...

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,090
watch what you say
in front of Gong Hee's mother.

332
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,959
Don't say anything
that could hurt her feelings.

333
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
I have to go.

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,750
Okay, thank you.

339
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:11,459
You know
all of Dan Soo's favorite dishes.

340
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,330
Audrey, all the side dishes
that you brought...

341
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,359
are Dan Soo's favorites.

342
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,369
Pork cutlets, seasoned dried squid,
and sausage stir-fry.

343
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,899
My gosh. How did you know
they were my favorites?

344
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,669
Oh, I made them...

345
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:27,310
because they're the only things
I know how to make.

346
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,449
Myung Ja,
you must be so relieved now.

347
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,280
You were always worried
about Gong Hee,

348
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,889
wondering when she'd get
a permanent position.

349
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,919
When you get over a hurdle,
there's a new one waiting for you.

350
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,830
You should work harder from now on.
Eat up.

351
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,090
Okay.

352
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,929
Gyeong Tae, I guess
the booze tastes extra good today.

353
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,840
Yes, it's very nice.

354
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,810
Gong Hee, my sweetheart.

355
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,209
She was so happy when she got
the yellow belt in taekwondo.

356
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,980
I remember it like yesterday.

357
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,419
But she is all grown up now.

358
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:10,179
I know.

359
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,750
Now, she's a permanent employee
at this great company.

360
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,719
My gosh. I know she is my niece,

361
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:18,730
but I am so proud of her.

362
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,760
Yes.

363
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,330
Let's go to my pub
for another round.

364
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,129
We can't go for another round.

365
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,000
We all have to work tomorrow.

366
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,770
Eat this too.

367
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,209
My gosh.

368
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,840
I feel so much better now.

369
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,340
Ssang Sook can no longer go on...

370
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,350
about how my daughter is
just a temporary employee.

371
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,780
I should go and get more japchae.

372
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:44,219
Yes.

373
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,719
- Bring plenty more.
- Okay.

374
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Gong Hee.

375
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:50,159
Let's drink.

376
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,389
- Nice.
- Cheers.

377
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,230
What's up? I'm busy now.

378
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,469
Hey, is your daughter home now?

379
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,770
Why are you asking
if my daughter is home?

380
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,340
What is she going to do?

381
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,409
I heard she didn't get the promotion
after all.

382
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,609
I didn't know.

383
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:17,379
Try to comfort her.

384
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,750
It happens.

385
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,449
But I wonder if she can get promoted
next time.

386
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,020
Even if it doesn't happen,
what can she do?

387
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,730
So be it.

388
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:28,699
My gosh. You must be so upset.

389
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,659
What do you mean?

390
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,730
She didn't get the promotion?

391
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,399
My son told me
that she didn't get it after all.

392
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:42,040
Oh, no.
Don't tell me you didn't know.

393
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:45,980
I guess she hasn't told you yet.

394
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,050
Oh, no.

395
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,649
Have some manners.

396
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,760
So why did you have to brag
about your daughter nonstop?

397
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,899
I think she's trying
to make a move on Min Gi.

398
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:04,199
How dare she?

399
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,669
Wake up.

400
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,100
Gosh, I get so feisty...

401
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,840
when I talk to Kang Myung Ja
on the phone.

402
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,070
Calm down. I need to calm down.

403
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,179
When I get my first paycheck,

404
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:16,379
I really will take you all out
for dinner.

405
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:17,909
We'll have some beef.

406
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,780
My goodness.
My niece will buy me beef?

407
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,679
Don't spend too much money.

408
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,550
You must have a lot of expenses.

409
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,290
Come on. I can afford that much.

410
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,159
I work for a big company, you know.

411
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,459
Dad,
your daughter will take care of you.

412
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,990
- Really?
- Yes!

413
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,199
- You're all welcome to join us.
- Really?

414
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,629
It's on me!

415
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,429
Thank you.

416
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,240
(8 p.m., Call Mom)

417
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,980
Mom, it's me.

418
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,080
What's wrong with your voice?

419
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,949
Did something happen?

420
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,320
It's because of Gong Hee.

421
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,290
Gong Hee? Why?

422
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,260
I don't think...

423
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,230
she got the promotion after all,

424
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,969
but she's not telling me.

425
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,730
At times like that,

426
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:17,000
just pretend to know nothing
if you want to help her.

427
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,810
I'm so upset.

428
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,510
How could I pretend to know nothing?

429
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,510
Remember how we sold a cow...

430
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,250
to send your eldest brother
to that big school in the city?

431
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,189
What's the point of being
the smartest boy in our small town?

432
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:35,689
In that school,
there were so many smart kids.

433
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,459
After three months,
he came home with his report card.

434
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,500
It said he ranked first
in the entire school!

435
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,070
He had the highest GPA?

436
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,340
The numbers looked crooked,

437
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,310
and the color of the ink
was different too.

438
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,270
So, I could tell right away.

439
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,310
He changed his grades
because he was so embarrassed.

440
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:01,379
But when your father saw
that report card,

441
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,280
he said nothing about it.

442
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,250
He just threw a party
and invited all our neighbors.

443
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,219
I guess
your brother studied very hard...

444
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:12,189
when he returned to the city
after that.

445
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,260
He finally brought home
his real report card,

446
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,899
and he actually ranked first
in the entire school.

447
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,369
There are times...

448
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,469
when you should just play dumb
as a parent.

449
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:28,310
Be patient and wait
until Gong Hee tells you.

450
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,980
Okay, Mom.

451
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,050
All right.

452
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,780
Good night, Mom.

453
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:36,719
Eat up.

454
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,379
Will they pay you a lot?

455
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,449
I don't know yet.

456
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:42,719
- Eat up.
- Mom's cooking is the best.

457
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,919
- Eat up.
- Yes, eat more.

458
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,189
Gong Hee, do you know
if they're hiring a security guard?

459
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:48,429
- Hey.
- Dad.

460
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,459
- Yes?
- I'll find out for you.

461
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,629
- Can I count on you?
- Yes.

462
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,969
- Really?
- My gosh. You're the best.

463
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:54,300
- My gosh.
- I'll work very hard.

464
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,840
- Yes, we know.
- Oh, my.

465
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,169
- I was just saying.
- Goodness.

466
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,209
This is delicious.

467
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,510
On the days
when it suddenly started raining,

468
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,179
moms would all come to school
with their umbrellas.

469
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,179
I was the only one blankly staring
at the schoolyard, all alone.

470
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:09,649
Then I went home...

471
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,419
without an umbrella
and got all soaked.

472
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,350
My gosh, you did?

473
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,459
I will be a sturdy umbrella
for our Ssook Ssook.

474
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:24,060
Even when it thunders
and rains hard,

475
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,100
I will never leave my baby alone
in the rain.

476
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,570
I must say, I'm surprised, Hong Dan.

477
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,139
I thought...

478
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,550
you grew up in a wealthy family
and received a lot of love.

479
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:42,179
So if you ever make me feel lonely
from now on,

480
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,219
you're so dead.

481
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:47,250
That's fine,

482
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:50,159
but let's think about this again.

483
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,659
Is it really necessary
to get married?

484
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,060
So, what are you suggesting?

485
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,399
Should we break up?

486
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,199
No, let's just date like this...

487
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:02,899
without getting married.

488
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,240
Darn you.

489
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:08,939
Seriously.

490
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:10,409
Hey...

491
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:15,879
It's this way.

492
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
- It's here.
- I see.

493
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,260
This is where you and Dan Soo live.

494
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,830
I was too flustered last time,
so I couldn't take a good look.

495
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,830
I see. But why, all of a sudden?

496
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,199
Why did you want to see the rooftop?

497
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Sorry.

498
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,139
(Team Manager Seo Min Gi)

499
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,310
Oh, one second.

500
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,649
I'll head in after I take this call.

501
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:46,780
You should go in first.

502
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:48,149
Okay.

He has returned to the great pride.

504
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,959
Seph, the male lion,
is courting the female, Karly.

505
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,459
You know, a man...

506
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,800
has to understand
the order of the jungle.

507
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,399
The ways of survival
in the jungle...

508
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,070
exist among men in our society too.

509
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,310
Which side were you on
in the jungle, Mr. Maeng?

510
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,149
The lion? The tiger?

511
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:22,119
Back in my day,

512
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,820
I was called the king of the jungle,
the lion.

513
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:29,820
When I caught the culprit,
I would never let them go.

514
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,990
Like a beast.

515
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,030
Oh, a beast.

516
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,800
Detective Maeng. Right.

517
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:41,869
But now,

518
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,669
I've given up that spot.

519
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,439
To who?

520
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:48,409
Over there.

521
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,510
Here she comes now.

522
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,179
I see.

523
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,119
This is where my Geon lives.

524
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,719
My son has gotten so big.

525
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,959
"How big must he be now?"

526
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:40,629
I'd wake up every morning...

527
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:41,990
and think of you.

528
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,830
Just imagining you growing up
every day...

529
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:49,399
made me grateful.

530
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Yes, right.

531
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,689
I made this for him.

532
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:16,060
What are you doing here?

00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:38,419
A suit?

538
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:40,219
I'm going to wear it
when I visit my dad.

539
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,889
Why would he visit Hae Joon,
wearing something...

540
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,520
that looks like a mourning suit?

541
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,290
Who put this here
without even saying a word?

542
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,030
Dan Soo, will you not come back to work
after leaving like that?

543
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,030
I don't need a company like that.
