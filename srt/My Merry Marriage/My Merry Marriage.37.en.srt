1
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:24,439
Dan Soo? What about him?

2
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:25,840
What is the story...

3
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:29,609
behind Dan Soo wandering around
without any parents?

4
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,920
I heard that he didn't have a mom...

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,650
because she ran away.

6
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,490
But what about his father?

7
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:42,389
Why isn't his father around?

8
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,370
Why are you curious about that?

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,639
You came in
from being beaten up just now.

10
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,609
I just think...

11
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:03,079
I might be able to help if I knew.

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,679
Last time,
he collapsed on the street,

13
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,090
and he refused to go
to the hospital.

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,990
I felt so bad for him.

15
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:12,889
Still,

16
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,259
it's not easy
to talk about it lightly.

17
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:18,630
It's not a happy story.

18
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:22,100
Some relatives took Dan Soo in...

19
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:25,669
when he was young.

20
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,509
But I guess they sent him away
once he grew up.

21
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,750
Then, does that mean
Dan Soo's father...

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,080
is no longer here?

23
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:42,149
What's this? Tell us the truth.

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,559
Do you know Dan Soo's father?

25
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,830
Go on and say so if you don't!

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,270
You keep going on about
Dan Soo's father.

27
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,000
You're being such a nuisance!

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,069
It's just strange.

29
00:01:58,169 --> 00:01:59,500
Do you have some kind of...

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,569
weird relationship
with Dan Soo's father?

31
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,640
Goodness, Gyeong Bok.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,240
Just go inside
and make the dumplings.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,250
I mean, she keeps
her secrets all to herself,

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,949
so why does she keep asking
about someone else's secrets?

35
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:39,609
Hae Joon.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Are you doing well?

37
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,720
You're doing well, right?

38
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,160
Then what happened to Geon?

39
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,930
Why is Geon staying here?

40
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,870
Why is he living apart
from Hae Joon?

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,870
I have no right
to be curious about this.

42
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,710
I don't know why I feel so anxious.

43
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,210
I wonder if Gong Hee is doing well.

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,639
Goodness.

45
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,410
This won't do.
I have to see for myself.

46
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,350
(SS Season
Company Blind Contest Presentation)

47
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,919
(SS Season
Company Blind Contest Presentation)

48
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,090
She's completely frozen.

49
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,190
How cute.

50
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,410
We just couldn't decide
on which of you to choose...

51
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,609
through the blind contest.

52
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,280
We were surprised
when we looked up your names too.

53
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,210
The Design Manager,
who could be considered...

54
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,580
the backbone of Jayce Fashion,

55
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,119
and a temporary employee
who doesn't even have a company ID.

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,960
It would be best to hear
from the designers in person.

57
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,890
Try to convince us.

58
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:10,999
I will present first.

59
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,080
I'm Kang Ji Na,

60
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,679
the Design Manager
of the Future Strategy TF Team.

61
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,450
What I propose is...

62
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,720
desire.

63
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,749
When you see an outfit,

64
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,090
you would think,
"I want that outfit."

65
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,859
The desire to own it.

66
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,669
The desire to wear
a different outfit from others...

67
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,109
and become the object of envy.

68
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,109
I want to stir up that desire.

69
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,850
What's this? I grabbed it first.

70
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,749
You'd better let it go.

71
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,260
I'm saying this for your sake, lady.

72
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,330
Does this coat belong to someone?

73
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,929
Why are you butting in?

74
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,129
Of course, it does.

75
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,530
It belongs to the person
who can afford it.

76
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,910
(Price: 27,000 dollars)

77
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,939
The price written on the tag
means more than just a number.

78
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,950
How big a desire you have...

79
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,179
- and how much you deserve it.
- Ring this up for me.

80
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,169
I want the name, Jayce Fashion,
to represent our brand value.

81
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,270
A value where one can look down...

82
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,939
from the highest point.

83
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,619
What? What are you doing?

84
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
What do you mean?

85
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,830
How unsophisticated.

86
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,660
You shouldn't look around
in places like this.

87
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,470
Just being in the same store...

88
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,369
offends me.

89
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,249
Hey! I don't want to see you either!

90
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:47,220
Don't you dare show up
in front of me!

91
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,749
Goodness gracious.

92
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,460
So what if she wears
luxury brand clothes?

93
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,830
The person wearing them is trashy.

94
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,429
Most of Jayce Fashion's sales...

95
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,400
come from the high-end line.

96
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,970
Designing for the one percent,

97
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:07,910
not the masses in the 99 percent.

98
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:14,210
I am confident that my designs
will become...

99
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,650
the new premium line.

100
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:18,379
I see.

101
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:20,749
I like your confidence.

102
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:41,640
Hello.

103
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,580
I'm Maeng Gong Hee,

104
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,379
the Future Strategy
TF Team's intern.

105
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,680
Someone just said this to me.

106
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,810
"Deliver your sincerity."

107
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,820
Have you ever had your allowance
taken away by your parents...

108
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
when you were little?

109
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,690
When you get an allowance
from relatives on holidays,

110
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:37,290
your mom says she'll keep it safe
and takes it from you.

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,930
There was a time
when I felt upset about that.

112
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,300
But...

113
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,009
my mom would keep that money safe.

114
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,149
And at the beginning
of a new school year,

115
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,450
she would buy me new clothes.

116
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,920
She wanted me to wear
the new clothes...

117
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,649
and meet new friends...

118
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,690
in a new chapter of my time
as if I were starting fresh.

119
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,759
Interestingly enough,
when I wore the new clothes,

120
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:11,300
I would feel so elated and walk
with a bounce in my steps...

121
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,200
as though
I might float like a cloud.

122
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:17,899
I included...

123
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,070
the heart-fluttering feeling
from that day in my designs.

124
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,239
When people wear
Jayce Fashion's clothes,

125
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,879
I hope they will feel like
how they felt...

126
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,050
when their moms would dress them
in a brand-new outfit.

127
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,249
Thank you!

128
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,279
Ssook Ssook.

129
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:05,119
Mommy will be even braver
and think more positively.

130
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,820
You should...

131
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:09,590
also be born...

132
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,290
as the healthiest baby in the world.

133
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,090
Promise!

134
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,300
Gosh, this is such a happy day.

135
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,369
What on earth is your dad doing?

136
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,810
Oh, forget it.

137
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,950
You're way too good
for a dad like that, Ssook Ssook.

138
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:37,149
Ssook Ssook.

139
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,019
Let's just...

140
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,749
live happily,

141
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,690
just the two of us.

142
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,389
Just us.

143
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:54,899
What?

144
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,639
Hong Dan.

145
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,239
You're home early.

146
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,139
Well...

147
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,680
What kind of situation is this?

148
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,979
Oh, this was supposed to be...

149
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,690
a surprise! Ta-da.

150
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,220
That was what I had in mind.

151
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,830
And what's with your outfit?

152
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,529
Did you go to someone's wedding?

153
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,729
I never saw a glimpse of you
when I had my appointments.

154
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:30,670
I prepared all of this for you.
It's my...

155
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,269
- Oh, no!
- My goodness!

156
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:36,840
Oh, my!

157
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,440
Are you okay?

158
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,680
My goodness!

159
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,050
This isn't what I had planned.

160
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,619
Surprise.

161
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,389
Oh, I think I broke my tailbone.

162
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,129
I ended up letting you
into my home again.

163
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,659
It's not like I can't be here.

164
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,800
But seriously,
why did you come here?

165
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,170
And what's with the balloons?

166
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,670
Well...

167
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,139
Aren't you going to tell me?

168
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,909
If not, then leave.

169
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:11,580
Wait. Listen, Hong Dan.

170
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:16,009
I'll be honest with you.

171
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,550
Marriage is difficult for me.

172
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,149
I'm still traumatized by how
my ex-wife suddenly divorced me.

173
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,790
It still haunts me to this day.

174
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,290
Having to be responsible
for a family feels like...

175
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,359
a huge burden,

176
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,399
and I still don't know
how I can protect my family.

177
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,300
If I fail again this time,

178
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,470
it'll mess me up
for the rest of my life.

179
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,119
Well...

180
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,259
What else are you hiding from me?

181
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
What do you mean?

182
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,290
I'll keep this short
and straightforward.

183
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,859
- Have you stood surety for someone?
- No.

184
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:06,659
Okay. Any secret girlfriends?

185
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:07,670
None.

186
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,600
Any secret children
you might not know about?

187
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,930
Are you crazy?

188
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,999
Could your college degree be fake?

189
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,739
Hey, what do you take me for?

190
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,810
All right, fine.

191
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,009
What's fine?

192
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,279
I've stayed single until this age,
telling myself...

193
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,249
that I'd never marry a man
who's been married before.

194
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:27,820
But I will do it because it's you.
Yes.

195
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,989
Do what?

196
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Maeng Gong Boo.

197
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,889
It means you're indebted to me
for the rest of your life.

198
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,629
What are you saying?

199
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,129
I'm saying we should get married!

200
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,970
Well, I'm still...

201
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,509
To tell you the truth,

202
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:50,139
the idea of getting married again
scares me,

203
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,379
- so let's first...
- Come on.

204
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,909
Hey, let me talk!

205
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,379
Be quiet!

206
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,220
I don't even have the right
to give you my answer?

207
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:05,619
The river is quickly flowing
downward.

208
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,430
The leader of the lion pride
quietly gazes at the river...

209
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,659
and turns around.

210
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,859
The river is protected
by dangerous alligators.

211
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,239
- They go into the river.
- You watch lions every day.

212
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,340
- You'll see lions in your dream.
- It's dangerous.

213
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,279
Looking anxious...

214
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,680
Why?

215
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,279
Just help me fold clean laundry.

216
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,180
I'm going to watch "Animal Kingdom."

217
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,359
Fine.

218
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:43,430
By the way...

219
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,800
You know, about Audrey.

220
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,940
Why does she seem
so interested in Dan Soo?

221
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,310
She probably feels bad for him
because he reminds her of herself.

222
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,109
She's lived a lonely life too.

223
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,810
I think she pities him.

224
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,050
She dropped off a bunch
of side dishes she made for him.

225
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,979
- Side dishes?
- Yes.

226
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,850
But they're mainly side dishes
that kids like.

227
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,019
She made pork cutlets,
tteokbokki, and so on.

228
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,430
- Did she?
- My goodness.

229
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,729
I feel really bad for Audrey.

230
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,800
I think that's why she wanted
to move away from this neighborhood.

231
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,129
The ladies in the neighborhood
just won't leave her alone.

232
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,369
I am glad
she has decided not to leave.

233
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,540
I think she's been wandering around,
moving from place to place.

234
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:34,379
I think she's very lonely.

235
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:36,109
We should try to be nicer to her.

236
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,389
Anyway, I wonder what's going on
with Gong Boo. Oh, boy.

237
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:53,560
Shoot. Why am I here again?

238
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:58,170
Do you think the military is a joke?

239
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,440
No.

240
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:03,509
What? The military?

241
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:04,609
Why would I come back?

242
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,979
I completed my military service
years ago!

243
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,850
You reenlisted.

244
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,450
When? When did I do such a thing?

245
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,479
Get it together!

246
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,279
You have a long way to go.

247
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,119
Trainee, recover position!

248
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
Recover position.

249
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,359
Wait, where?

250
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:30,129
Why on earth would I do this twice?

251
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,040
- Do it properly!
- Yes, sir!

252
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:37,439
Trainee. As you were.

253
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,010
Yes, sir!

254
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,719
I feel like
my heart is about to explode.

255
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:49,050
You're so slow.

256
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:51,219
How are you going
to feed your family?

257
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,659
Are you not going
to raise your baby?

258
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,959
What? Why...

259
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,669
You will not be discharged
until the day you die!

260
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,840
Do you understand?

261
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
Stay away. Don't come near me.

262
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
No...

263
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,419
- Gong Boo.
- Yes?

264
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,619
Wake up, all right?

265
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,449
Wake up, okay?

266
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,889
Wake up.

267
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,830
What was that?

268
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,500
You should hurry home
and tell your family...

269
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,969
that we are getting married.

270
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,010
Well, can I not go?

271
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,169
What did you say?

272
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,709
You said I would not be discharged
until the day I died.

273
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:50,209
What?
Are you still dreaming or what?

274
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,919
Hey, get up.

275
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,879
Get up! Go!

276
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:54,889
Oh, no.

277
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:55,949
Goodness.

278
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,290
- My tailbone.
- What about your tailbone?

279
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,359
Hurry up and get ready.

280
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:04,090
You will marry her?

281
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:08,129
Yes.

282
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,969
So after all, you decided
to enter that gloomy world again.

283
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:19,879
My, I know Ms. Eom's personality.
How did she persuade you?

284
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,609
I didn't think this would happen.

285
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,209
She's pregnant,

286
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,580
so you should speed things up.

287
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,189
My goodness. We should hurry up
and meet her family first.

288
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:31,859
We should invite all the elders
to the wedding, so...

289
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:33,619
That's not necessary.

290
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,260
It's not like
this is my first rodeo.

291
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,590
Hey, it's not your first time.

292
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,230
But for her, it is the first time.

293
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,230
Hong Dan has no family members
to attend such a thing,

294
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,300
so we can skip it.

295
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,240
But this is a big event
for the Maeng family.

296
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:47,669
We can't skip it.

297
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,340
I'll call Uncle.

298
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:54,750
Wait, are we calling
all the family elders?

299
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,709
My goodness.
Why would we call the relatives?

300
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,820
Let's just keep it
within the immediate family.

301
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,889
What? If we don't call Uncle...

302
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,919
Gosh, he'll be furious.

303
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,520
Do you really think
you can handle it?

304
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,389
Aunt too. If we don't call her,

305
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,060
- she'll flip out.
- That's right.

306
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,129
Yes. We're welcoming
a new member into the family,

307
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,399
so we must follow the proper steps.

308
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,469
We're a family
that respects tradition.

309
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,340
Tradition, my foot.

310
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,669
Are we making ox bone soup
or something?

311
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,679
You rarely eat a spoonful
even when I make a whole pot of it.

312
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,510
What? A spoonful?

313
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,010
Hey, Gyeong Tae.
Keep your mouth shut.

314
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,179
I'm sick of this, seriously.

315
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,919
Very nice!

316
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,159
All the executives
are highly praising you, Gong Hee!

317
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,359
I was so nervous.

318
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,230
Did they all like my presentation?

319
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,070
They were all very impressed.

320
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,699
At this rate, you'll surely get
a permanent position.

321
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,500
Starting with the story
about your childhood,

322
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,969
you spoke to our hearts and made us
empathize with your story.

323
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:58,679
Did you prepare the script
in advance?

324
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,109
Oh, someone gave me some pointers.

325
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,250
Someone helped you?

326
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:07,619
Good for you.
You should never let that person go.

327
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,020
Sister-in-law, buy me dinner.
Let's celebrate.

328
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,590
My gosh, Ms. Eom.

329
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,060
I heard the news.
You're getting married!

330
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,429
My future sister-in-law,
be good to me!

331
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:18,629
Of course.

332
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,399
What are you two talking about?

333
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,429
Well, you'll find out soon enough.

334
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:27,139
Oh, it's too early to celebrate.

335
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:28,369
If I actually land
a permanent position,

336
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,209
then I'll take everyone out
for dinner.

337
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,740
I told you. It is happening.

338
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,980
Everyone, get ready.
Gong Hee will buy us dinner!

339
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,149
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

340
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:41,250
I think it's too early to celebrate.

341
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:42,649
Gong Hee.

342
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:46,659
Hey, ask her.

343
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,530
Grandma, you must know...

344
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,530
why I spent all those years
wandering around.

345
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,770
I could never sleep
because of my nightmares,

346
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,100
and I never knew
when and where I'd collapse next.

347
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,409
I asked you
why you wouldn't move back home.

348
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:05,209
And I'm telling you the reason now.

349
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,810
I'm doing much better these days.

350
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,149
I'm comfortable
in the house where I live now.

351
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,449
I tried all sorts of things...

352
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:13,649
to cure your condition,

353
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,320
but you didn't show any improvement.

354
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,790
Are you saying that family fixed it?

355
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,419
Yes, I rarely have a nightmare
these days.

356
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:23,629
And do you know
how much I eat these days?

357
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,500
You'd probably just have
2 to 3 bites and stop eating.

358
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,469
No. These days,
I have ginseng chicken soup...

359
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:32,800
and even pork belly for breakfast.

360
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:35,240
Look how broad my shoulders are now.

361
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,179
So if you aren't here to say
you'll move back home,

362
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,810
why are you here?

363
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,379
I'm here because I was curious.

364
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:44,980
Whose design will you pick
after the presentation?

365
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,320
By the way, why were you there?

366
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,320
When did you see me?

367
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,449
This shows your interest
in the company.

368
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,990
It's good.

369
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,760
So? Who did a better job
in your opinion?

370
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,459
I could tell you were particularly
impressed by one of them.

371
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:00,459
Why try to feel me out?

372
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,939
I could tell the intern
was still inexperienced,

373
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:07,199
but her presentation was sincere.

374
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,109
And she's quite talented
if her designs are good enough...

375
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,540
to compete against Ms. Kang's.

376
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:16,649
Then, it's been decided, right?

377
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:17,649
Come, now.

378
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:19,419
Don't get ahead of yourself.

379
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:20,949
It hasn't been announced yet.

380
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:23,449
All right, but it has been decided.

381
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,919
Oh, one more thing.

382
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,560
I take back what I said
about marrying Kang Ji Na.

383
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,929
Wait... What? You...

384
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,469
Do we still have
a few more dates left?

385
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,340
Consider those canceled, okay?

386
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,669
Who says you can cancel those?

387
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,810
You said you'd try dating her.

388
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,879
My feelings have changed since then.

389
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:46,879
Why?

390
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,649
There's someone
I want to confess my feelings to.

391
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,280
What? You...

392
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,850
Are you seeing someone?

393
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,290
I didn't know.

394
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,790
I'm not seeing her just yet.

395
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:03,189
But I'm sure we will soon.

396
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,359
I will confess my feelings to her.

397
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:09,369
I'll do it someplace
where you can see thousands of stars.

398
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:11,800
She's not an easy woman.

399
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:14,969
But as soon as I confess
my feelings, you know...

400
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,770
With my face and my physique,
what could she do?

401
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,240
Does she have any other choice?
She'll fall right in love.

402
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,350
Are you pulling a prank
on your grandma?

403
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:25,320
Do you think
I'd fall for that again?

404
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,980
I'm serious.

405
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,449
Just you wait, Grandma.
You'll get to see me get married.

406
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:43,669
(Chairwoman's Office)

407
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:44,669
Oh, my.

408
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,840
Look who it is.

409
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,510
I am Ji Na's mother.

410
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,540
I've only ever seen pictures of you,

411
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,350
but I finally get to see you
in person.

412
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,879
You look much more handsome
in person.

413
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,949
Well, everyone says so.

414
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,760
You have a great sense of humor too.

415
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,760
By the way, what brings you here?

416
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,090
I just came by...

417
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,929
as I wanted to see the chairwoman
out of the blue.

418
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,369
Well... If you go in now,

419
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:18,669
you'll see some interesting faces.

420
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,639
"Interesting faces?"

421
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:23,109
Bye, then.

422
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,480
If Grandma says so,
I'm sure she'll be chosen.

423
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,949
Maeng Ggong.
What if she cries tears of joy?

424
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,189
I'll hurry over
and congratulate her first.

425
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,500
What are you doing? You startled me.

426
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,500
Didn't Gong Hee come here?

427
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,770
No.

428
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,540
- Enjoy your food.
- Okay.

429
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Goodness.

430
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,619
Where has she gone
during work hours?

431
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,389
She was nagging me so much
about not slacking off.

432
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,629
Is she not here?

433
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,399
You did so well, Gong Hee.

434
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Thank you.

435
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,109
Oh, by the way,

436
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,879
did I give you
that kind of advice too?

437
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,280
To talk about your childhood
and make people relate to you.

438
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,010
Oh, that?

439
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,619
Gu Dan Soo told me that.

440
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:40,949
Is that so?

441
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:43,619
He sure knows you well
as your childhood friend.

442
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,290
Yes, he gives me
constructive advice sometimes too.

443
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:50,629
I guess he has a different side too.

444
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,030
Yes.

445
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,199
I'm so grateful to you.

446
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,899
For cheering me on.

447
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:01,740
It's nice to see you work so hard.

448
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,340
I keep wanting to help you more.

449
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,639
Have you thought about
what you want to eat?

450
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:09,010
Since the contest is over,

451
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,379
we should go someplace fancy
and have a meal.

452
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,490
I guess a day like this
really does come.

453
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:18,219
It has always been a dream of mine.

454
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:21,560
To have a permanent employee
ID badge around my neck...

455
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,530
and coming to work with confidence.

456
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:28,230
Having a tall and handsome boyfriend
by my side would be nice too.

457
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,139
Then,
haven't all your dreams come true?

458
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,310
I still have a long way to go.

459
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:38,139
Keep helping me out...

460
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:39,409
even when I become
a permanent employee.

461
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,909
You're so greedy.

462
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,449
When will we get to go on dates?

463
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:47,119
I should work hard to do that too.

464
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Maeng Gong Hee.

465
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:21,350
(My Merry Marriage)

466
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,590
Those two are really dating?

467
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,159
You have to keep your promise.

468
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:30,030
Did my mom ask you for a favor?

469
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,030
Do you like him a lot?

470
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,629
I used to have a crush on him.

471
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,330
Honestly, I still can't believe it.

472
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,129
My crush is now my boyfriend.

473
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,000
We barely managed to meet again.

474
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,139
I don't know why it feels like
we've been separated again.

475
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:43,540
Dan Soo, if you like her,

476
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,010
you should tell her.

477
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:47,909
