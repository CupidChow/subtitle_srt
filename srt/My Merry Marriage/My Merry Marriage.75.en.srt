1
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,490
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,529
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

3
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,029
What?

4
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,000
I think it's strange.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,900
You keep crying whenever you see me.

6
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:40,170
You have something to tell me,
don't you?

7
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:43,809
What is it?

8
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,050
You don't need to know.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,219
What is it that
I don't need to know?

10
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,759
I'll take all things dark and shady
and go into hiding.

11
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,159
Be like a piece of fabric
drying under the sun.

12
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,329
One that has never been wrinkled.

13
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,100
Just live like that, Dan Soo.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Dan Soo.

15
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,649
When you see Gong Hee,

16
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,979
say hi to her
with a smile on your face.

17
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,290
Dan Soo, I trust...

18
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,260
you can do that.

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,530
I'm sure of it.

20
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:45,439
(Episode 75)

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,859
Oh, boy.

22
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,200
They say getting pregnant
before marriage is the trend.

23
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,700
I hear you're the Marketing Manager.

24
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,170
I guess you follow
all the newest trends.

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Honey.

26
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,769
Why do you keep saying
stuff like that?

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,439
Hey, Gong Boo. Up until recently,

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,609
you couldn't even say a word
at our family meetings. Goodness.

29
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,250
Look at you saying stuff like that
as Gong Hee's brother.

30
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,020
You sure take after your father.

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,189
Auntie, I can't even say that
as her older brother?

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,759
Hey, what are you doing?
We invited him over, you know.

33
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,289
He's here to officially meet us,
so that's what we're doing now.

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,699
After this, we'll send him home.

35
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,759
Oh, right.

36
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,629
Gong Hee is being acknowledged
at work these days.

37
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,199
She got her promotion...

38
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,770
because Mr. Seo praised her
very often.

39
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,169
Right.

40
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:56,139
Yes, Gong Hee
always works hard and...

41
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,909
But even if you manage
your own team,

42
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,409
you can get fired
like a non-managerial employee.

43
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:01,750
- Here, eat this.
- Hey.

44
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,080
I run my own clinic.

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,590
You're right.

46
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,120
It's very competitive.
It sure isn't easy.

47
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,419
But I'm going to work very hard.

48
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,990
Now, I have to take responsibility
for two people.

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Gong Hee...

50
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,099
and my baby.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,909
Honey, where are you going?

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,580
To get more side dishes.

53
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,409
Look how skinny he is.
He must be very weak.

54
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,349
I guess he likes that salad,
at least.

55
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,319
My goodness, honey.

56
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,819
Don't mind her. Eat up.

57
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,759
You too, Gong Hee.

58
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,460
He seems to be enjoying the food.

59
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,030
Oh, boy.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,900
My, I guess
Gong Hee really is getting married.

61
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,270
The truth is,

62
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,780
I tried to act supportive at dinner,

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,449
but I don't know if this is right.

64
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,520
Is it okay that
they're getting married like this?

65
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,189
Why? To my surprise,
he seemed like the serious type.

66
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,189
He seemed like a decent guy.

67
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,189
At work, they never once showed it.

68
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,560
No one at work knows they're dating.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,900
You have to keep it that way
when dating a co-worker.

70
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:23,060
I think it's strange.

71
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,270
What do you mean?

72
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,800
I don't think it's love.

73
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,069
Then what?

74
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,909
Acting out of
a sense of responsibility?

75
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,710
I can totally see
Mr. Seo doing that.

76
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,480
He's one of those people
who care a lot...

77
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,779
about their reputation
and what others say about them.

78
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,250
Whatever, it's Gong Hee's life.

79
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,990
Anyway,

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,689
you and No Ah
suddenly did a high five earlier.

81
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,819
What's going on?
Why were you so excited?

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,560
He's such a smart little kid.

83
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,040
What in the world were you thinking?

84
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,610
Well, please let me explain.

85
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,040
He refused
to go to the daycare center,

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,279
and I had no one to babysit him.

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,350
Should we build an in-office
daycare center for you?

88
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,579
You should've told me...

89
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,290
that you brought this kid
to the office!

90
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,120
Well, he's just a little kid.

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,629
Must you yell at me
for bringing him to work?

92
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,629
What did you say?

93
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,829
Ms. Eom had a situation,
although she can't tell you...

94
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,930
Zip your mouth.

95
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,000
You said you were pregnant
and had doctor's appointments.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,810
How many times
have I let you take a half day?

97
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,170
And you're always late.

98
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,339
Now, you bring your kid to work?

99
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740
Hold on.

100
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,449
Who is this kid?

101
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,620
Is he your nephew?

102
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,550
Well, the thing is...

103
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,459
Why can't you answer my question?
Who is he?

104
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,389
Listen, he is... My gosh, I mean...

105
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,800
How should I explain
this situation to you?

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Mom.

107
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,769
Mom, just report him.

108
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,209
What? "Mom?"

109
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,350
A company with more than
300 female employees...

110
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,079
or over 500 employees in total...

111
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,550
must offer on-site childcare.

112
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,819
My gosh. How do you know this?

113
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,060
I heard it on the news.

114
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,529
Hurry up and report him, Mom.

115
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,730
Did you just call her Mom?

116
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,110
That's right.

117
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,709
I will report you.

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,050
I've been holding back until now.

119
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,279
You always picked on me
when I asked for a half-day leave...

120
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,949
and brought up my menopause
in front of everyone.

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,220
I have been putting up with you
until now.

122
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,759
On behalf of all working mothers
in Korea,

123
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,060
I, Eom Hong Dan,

124
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,459
must take action now.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's right!

126
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,930
Wait, what do you mean
you'll report me?

127
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,110
That's too extreme.

128
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,480
I told you.
I've been holding back until now.

129
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,480
- Right, No Ah?
- Yes.

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,680
You've been holding back
very patiently, Mom.

131
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Yes.

132
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,290
"Mom?"

133
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,920
Is that right?
Did I really do such things?

134
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,759
Well, anyway...
As long as the kid stays quiet.

135
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,230
About reporting me...

136
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't report me, please.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,300
- Roar!
- My gosh.

138
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,870
Hey. "Roar?"

139
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,139
- Roar!
- Goodness!

140
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,279
- What the... Darn it.
- Do it again.

141
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,649
Darn it!

142
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,209
- Hey.
- We won!

143
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,310
We won!

144
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,750
You did such a good job.
That felt great.

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,050
Did he really say that?

146
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,220
I felt like he totally had my back
in that moment, you know?

147
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,829
It was always my wish
to teach Director Lee a lesson.

148
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:14,930
I never thought
our dear No Ah would do that for me.

149
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,470
He's my son, indeed.

150
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,170
And you know...

151
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,639
He called me "Mom."

152
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Really?

153
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,339
I was choking back tears.

154
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,949
Goodness, this little kid.

155
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,079
Don't touch him. He might wake up.

156
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:37,790
So cute.

157
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,089
Oh, you're so...

158
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,120
Don't touch me.

159
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,360
So adorable.

160
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,290
You're a treasure.

161
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,700
You were here.

162
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:02,809
Did you...

163
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,279
see Min Gi off?

164
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,950
You know,

165
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,389
you can keep staying here
if you want.

166
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:14,389
I'll be moving out
once I get married anyway.

167
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,690
You'll be able to use
the living room by yourself too.

168
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,190
Maeng Gong Hee. Look at me.

169
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,230
You could just use my room
as your studio.

170
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,759
You'll find everything you need
in there.

171
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,029
Look at me, Maeng Gong Hee.

172
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,039
Are you really fine...

173
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,509
with getting married like this...

174
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,679
and leaving me behind here?

175
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,149
Yes.

176
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Okay.

177
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,500
I won't ask anymore.

178
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,769
Good night.

179
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,409
How could I be fine?

180
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,320
There's no way.

181
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,830
I won't go!

182
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:34,970
My goodness.

183
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,039
Kang Myung Ja,
are you really going to do this?

184
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,340
I mean, you left the shop
in someone else's hands already,

185
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,509
but you refuse to go now?

186
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,279
My gosh.

187
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,250
Good grief.

188
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,419
(Audrey's Stalker)

189
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,649
- What?
- What?

190
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,789
My goodness.

191
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,659
Yes, Mr. Seo.

192
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,399
I am sorry that I had to...

193
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,000
say hello over the phone
before we officially met as in-laws.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,269
Oh, yes. I guess it's awkward
for both of us.

195
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,840
There's no need to be sorry.

196
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,740
Well,
in-laws are brought together...

197
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,950
by the connection
between their kids.

198
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,850
I am sorry for how I treated you
all this time...

199
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,889
without knowing
you were Min Gi's father.

200
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,759
There weren't any personal feelings
with what happened before.

201
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,600
I hope
there aren't any misunderstandings.

202
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,259
I'm sure
you were just following orders.

203
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:38,600
I understand.

204
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,600
Then, I will see you later
at the restaurant.

205
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,669
Oh, goodness.

206
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,509
I mean,

207
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,649
even before
officially meeting my in-laws,

208
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,379
I've already gotten involved
in a bad relationship. Oh, dear.

209
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,120
Goodness me.

210
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,320
- Gyeong Tae.
- Yes?

211
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,850
You should do something.

212
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,330
To be honest,
meeting with Jung Ssang Sook...

213
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,960
makes me rather afraid too.

214
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,029
Gosh, seriously?

215
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,529
Stop frustrating me.

216
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,029
Are you going to send your daughter
into battle by herself?

217
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,740
My goodness. Oh, my.

218
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,039
Let's go.

219
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,870
What is this?

220
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,340
Were you refusing to go
when you had already gotten ready?

221
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,110
Without me,

222
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,519
that brat, Ssang Sook,
will be so mean to Gong Hee.

223
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,820
She was the one
who went to see Gong Hee...

224
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,120
and said
Gong Hee had ruined her son's life.

225
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,590
I should go
and flip everything upside down...

226
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,990
to stop her from doing that
to Gong Hee.

227
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,090
What? You won't put a stop
to their marriage, will you?

228
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,529
I have to show Ssang Sook
who's boss now.

229
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,200
If not, Gong Hee's future is doomed.
Let's go.

230
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Oh, dear.

231
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,440
Goodness.
Hey, it's starting to get scary now.

232
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,809
I don't want to go.

233
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,309
My stomach hurts too.

234
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,679
Hurry up and go. Go on!

235
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,309
- Can't you go instead?
- Forget it.

236
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,850
Do you want me to show you
who's boss? Go on!

237
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,250
My stomach hurts.
What if I have appendicitis?

238
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,879
Gosh, just go to the bathroom.

239
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,419
- Just go.
- Hey, do you have toilet paper?

240
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,049
- My gosh.
- Goodness gracious.

241
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:09,490
- I won't go!
- Mom.

242
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,289
You already went to their house
and greeted them.

243
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:15,230
Why do we have to meet
and have a meal together?

244
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,429
I already told you.

245
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,230
You can't act like this
all of a sudden.

246
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,570
Do you think I'll be able
to take a single bite...

247
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,039
with Kang Myung Ja
sitting across from me?

248
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:29,110
- My goodness.
- Mom.

249
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,519
It's nice to meet you all.

250
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,899
Yes, our Gong Hee may be lacking
in many ways,

251
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,269
but please look kindly upon her.

252
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,169
Our daughter isn't lacking.

253
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,200
She can hold her head up high
wherever she goes.

254
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,700
She became a permanent employee
at a big company too.

255
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,309
Goodness, if you think
that's enough to boast about,

256
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,480
why didn't she just meet a rich man?

257
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,049
What's the big deal about
being a permanent employee?

258
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,779
My Min Gi is the manager
in that company.

259
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,549
Come on, Mom.

260
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,690
I made sure she didn't meet a man...

261
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,720
who came from a mediocre background.

262
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,590
Mom.

263
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,990
All right. Still,

264
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,460
it's such a joyous occasion
that a man and a woman...

265
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,399
have agreed to get married.

266
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,970
Oh, yes.

267
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,570
By the way, you two,

268
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,139
where will you live
once you're married?

269
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,110
I hear young couples have
a hard time finding a newlywed home.

270
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,809
How much
can your family support them?

271
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,779
Is that something
you should be bringing up?

272
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,049
The groom's family usually prepares
the newlywed home.

273
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,549
Why are you asking me?

274
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:46,620
Do I owe you something?

275
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,659
There are still some ladies
who are behind the times like this.

276
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,429
Why must the groom
always get a house for the couple?

277
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,700
Then should the bride's family
get them a house?

278
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

279
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,710
Then should I expect you to bring
the traditional wedding presents?

280
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,309
Hey, who in the world cares about
that stuff in this day and age?

281
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,580
Are you suddenly becoming
a modern woman?

282
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:21,860
We will just live in my house.

283
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,059
Hey, I don't want that.

284
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,559
Live somewhere else.

285
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,200
Then come and live with us.

286
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,899
What? I mean...

287
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,139
Why should my son live with you?
Are you crazy?

288
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,509
Then what else can they do?

289
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,679
I know all about
your financial situation.

290
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,850
Let's have them live at our house.

291
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,019
Aren't you the one
who's behind the times?

292
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:53,519
No woman lives with
her husband's parents these days.

293
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,019
Then what?
You want them to live with you?

294
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,320
In that run-down house?

295
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,159
"That run-down house?"

296
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,029
Hey, we fixed up our house
top to bottom.

297
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,429
Does an old house become a new one
just because you fixed it up?

298
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,330
Come on.

299
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,840
- My goodness.
- Oh, dear.

300
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,370
Then you want my daughter to live
with a mother-in-law like you?

301
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,980
A mother-in-law like me?

302
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,840
Did you call my house run-down?

303
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,549
Oh, dear.

304
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,620
Oh, goodness.

305
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,559
My gosh.

306
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,299
Oh, dear.

307
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,740
Are you okay?

308
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,610
Do I look okay to you?

309
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,919
We're on the losing end.

310
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,149
Kang Myung Ja is the only one
who's profiting from this.

311
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,389
Mom.

312
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:01,789
It's still not too late, okay?

313
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,120
Let's call off the wedding.

314
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,389
Please come to your senses, okay?

315
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:07,629
Mom.

316
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,600
It would've been over
if you had just chosen Ji Na.

317
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,269
If you had just turned a blind eye,

318
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,870
everything would've been fine.

319
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,370
How could you do this, Min Gi?

320
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,169
How could you do this to me?

321
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,279
Oh, poor me.

322
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:29,319
Why do I have to become in-laws
with Kang Myung Ja of all people?

323
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,220
You kicked your own good luck
to the curb...

324
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,990
only to marry Myung Ja's daughter?
How could you do that?

325
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,339
- Mom!
- My goodness.

326
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,299
Oh, no.

327
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,839
Mom, don't be like this.

328
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,839
I'll live a happy life.

329
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,009
I promise you it'll all work out!

330
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,849
Gong Hee, let me talk to her.

331
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:02,950
Go upstairs.

332
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
My gosh.

333
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,599
Oh, dear.
You need to trust Gong Hee.

334
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,369
We, of all people, should trust her.

335
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,000
Is it really too much to ask?

336
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,640
I just wanted her
to meet someone decent,

337
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,170
receive a decent amount of love,

338
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:29,240
and live without much trouble.

339
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,109
I just wanted my daughter
never to hear any mean things...

340
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:36,279
or suffer heartache.
I just wanted her to live like that.

341
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,150
Is that too much for me to ask?

342
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,150
Oh, dear.

343
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,259
Jung Ssang Sook was right
about everything.

344
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,890
Gong Hee is getting married,

345
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,700
but we can't afford
to give her anything.

346
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,299
At this rate, we'll marry her off
with nothing but worries.

347
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,069
There's nothing we can give her
as her parents,

348
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,970
so we should at least make sure
she can feel happy and be at peace.

349
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,509
I should at least do that for her.

350
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,849
Why did I get into a fight
in front of her? My goodness.

351
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,859
Mom, Dad.

352
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,190
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,660
All I do is worry you.

354
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,230
But...

355
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,869
don't worry so much.

356
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,440
I'm becoming a mom too, you know.

357
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,410
I'll become stronger.

358
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,509
I'll be happy...

359
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,579
and live a good life. I promise.

360
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,940
Oh, hello.

361
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,569
Hello, Dan Soo. You're here.

362
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:09,079
By the way,

363
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,680
did you meet your mom that day?

364
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,349
My mom? What do you mean?

365
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,150
What? You didn't read that letter?

366
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,150
She came by a little while ago...

367
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,420
- and left a letter for you...
- Is it you, Dan Soo?

368
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,130
Oh, no.

369
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,170
I heard you'd be coming,
so I was waiting.

370
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,069
What are you doing here?

371
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,309
I heard my mom was here.
What does it mean?

372
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,079
Grandma, you must know something.

373
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,950
My gosh.

374
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,420
Hi, Myung Ja. It's me.

375
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,630
Mom, I keep forgetting to call you
these days.

376
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:06,200
Come on. You don't need
to call me once a day.

377
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,640
I know...

378
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,710
you have a lot on your mind
because of Gong Hee these days.

379
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,009
Mom.

380
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,009
You'll come
to Gong Hee's wedding, right?

381
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,079
Gyeong Tae will pick you up.

382
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,509
No, don't bother.
I can just take the bus.

383
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,250
Don't worry about me.

384
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,650
Just do what you need to do.

385
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,819
Mom, what's wrong with your voice?
Are you not feeling well?

386
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,029
Goodness. My voice?
What's wrong with it?

387
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,230
I'm worried.
When you visit us this time,

388
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,099
let's go and get you
a full health checkup.

389
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,670
Gong Hee actually suggested
we book you a health checkup.

390
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,440
Forget it. Don't worry about me.

391
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,680
Just tell Gong Hee
to take good care of herself.

392
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,109
It's important to have
a big hospital nearby...

393
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:53,210
when you're older.

394
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,450
I want to live far away
from hospitals.

395
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,049
That way, I won't live so long.

396
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,890
What? Mom, what did you say?

397
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,119
Nothing. Never mind.
Hang up already.

398
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,660
My goodness.
You must be very busy these days.

399
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,630
Take good care of Gong Hee.

400
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,960
Mom, Gyeong Tae said
he'd pick you up,

401
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,930
so don't fight me on this.
Just let him pick you up.

402
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:16,240
All right, I heard you. Bye.

403
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,009
I mean, why does she keep worrying
about me?

404
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,609
If I end up in the hospital,

405
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,819
how will she handle all the stress?

406
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,759
Why do you keep asking
about that woman?

407
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Tell me.

408
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:47,099
Did my mom come here to see me?

409
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Yes.

410
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,869
It's about time you heard the truth.

411
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,309
In the past, I couldn't tell you
because you were too young,

412
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:00,609
but I think
I should tell you the truth now.

413
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:02,720
You're all grown up now.

414
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,250
That woman's family...

415
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,319
was full of worthless scumbags.

416
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,630
The man called her father...

417
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,829
was a con man
who was always in and out of jail,

418
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,730
and her mother was a barmaid
who roamed from town to town,

419
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,700
swindling people.

420
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,369
Both of her parents came to see me
and threatened me...

421
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,740
for money.

422
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,339
That woman called your mother...

423
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,210
deliberately approached
the family...

424
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,910
to extort money from us.

425
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,779
She seduced your naive father,

426
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,180
and they eloped together.

427
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,650
Even after that,
she kept extorting money from me.

428
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,049
She demanded a big chunk of cash...

429
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,059
on the condition that
she'd leave you and your dad.

430
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,890
She was willing to sell off
her own child for money.

431
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,289
I don't believe that.

432
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,660
Why do you think
I've never told you about your mom?

433
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:55,000
I didn't want to break your heart
when you were so young.

434
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:56,970
That's why I never told you
about her.

435
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,069
She really did that?

436
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,079
She really is
such a horrible person?

437
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,109
Yes, she is awful.

438
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,750
So awful that
I can't tell you everything she did.

439
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,519
So,

440
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,789
don't try to find her.

441
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,529
Your father too.

442
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,269
It was her fault that he died.

443
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,210
That woman...

444
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,740
caused his death.

445
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,349
Dad.

446
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,349
Dad...

447
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,250
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

448
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,130
May we start getting ready now?

449
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:04,730
Oh, the groom-to-be isn't here yet.

450
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,329
But we'll be closing soon.

451
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,210
Then please just get my dress ready.

452
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,210
Will that be okay?

453
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,380
The groom should see it.

454
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,549
It is the most important moment
in wedding preparation.

455
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
It's fine.

456
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,490
All right, then.

457
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,369
Who designed this?

458
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,480
The designer did a great job.

459
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,109
Every woman...

460
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:58,220
dreams of wearing...

461
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,859
a beautiful wedding dress like this.

462
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:24,009
If you have something to say,
let's talk later.

463
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,410
I have somewhere to be.

464
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,190
Kang Ji Na.

465
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,210
(My Merry Marriage)

466
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,740
Come back to me now,
before it's too late.

467
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,079
Marry me...

468
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,410
and go to Dodo Group.

469
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,680
When Ssook Ssook is born,

470
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,819
do I have to go back to my mom?

471
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:38,819
Why is this...

472
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,490
She said she threw it away.

473
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,490
Maeng Gong Hee, you...

474
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,890
This is our last chance.

475
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,460
Should we run away?

476
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,059
