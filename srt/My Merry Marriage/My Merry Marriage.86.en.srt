00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,459
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,699
I was happy to stay by your side
for a little while, at least.

3
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:42,140
Forget all about your lousy mom...

4
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,309
and live with a smile on your face.

5
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:47,679
Did you leave again?

6
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,420
Leaving me behind like this.
Again, by yourself...

7
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,060
If you were going to leave
just like this,

8
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,729
why did you act like my mom?

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,229
Why?

10
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,509
What do you want me to do?

11
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,179
You just have to be this selfish,
don't you?

12
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:21,179
Until the end.

13
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:23,579
You don't care about me.

14
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,890
(Dried Pollack Soup, Hangover Soup)

15
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,629
I'll move to a place
where you don't know...

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,099
and live in hiding.

17
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,700
I'll move to a place
where you can't find me...

18
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,439
and continue breathing.

19
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,480
(For lease)

20
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,580
(Tiffany Alterations)

21
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,169
I won't die,
so don't worry about that.

22
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,469
Don't even think about me.

23
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,979
Just live your life.

24
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,310
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,750
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,389
My goodness.

28
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:46,159
Hey, Mom.
Where did you put my sweater?

29
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,530
Is it in the washing machine?

30
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,199
I put all of your clean clothes
in your room.

31
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,199
Oh, really?

32
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,069
Hey, Hong Dan.
Where did you put my sweater?

33
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,639
Oh, my. Why are you asking me
about your clothes?

34
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,439
You should ask your ex-wife
to find it for you.

35
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,210
Why are you doing this again?

36
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,379
You nagged me all night long.
Let's stop this now.

37
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,979
You didn't even repent
on why you were nagged.

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,180
How dare you rebel against me?

39
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,449
Goodness, what a great example
you're setting for your kid.

40
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,620
How could you be more immature
than No Ah?

41
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,860
Dad, can't you do anything
by yourself?

42
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:20,060
I do things well on my own.

43
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,030
No Ah,
are you going to be like this too?

44
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,629
You should take my side.

45
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,169
See you later.

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,139
Grandma, let's get going.

47
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,610
Okay, let's go.

48
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,310
Oh, come on.
What use is it to raise a son?

49
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,379
- My goodness.
- See you, Mom.

50
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,910
See you later.

51
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,579
- Ms. Eom Hong Dan.
- What?

52
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:42,649
Stop kidding around.

53
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,649
Give me my clothes that you hid.

54
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,949
What is this childish prank?

55
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,490
"Kidding around?"

56
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,029
What nonsense are you talking about?

57
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,629
Oh, my.
I think I hear a fly buzzing around.

58
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,629
- Why is this...
- Honey, come on.

59
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,629
Don't you dare call me "honey."

60
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,639
Just give me that woman's number.

61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
What?

62
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,170
Who?

63
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,879
Your first love and ex-wife,
Ms. Lee Soo Yeon.

64
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,240
Give me her number.

65
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,620
But why do you want
Soo Yeon's number?

66
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,180
I'm going to meet her
to get a good look at her face.

67
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,550
Come on. Give it.

68
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,189
I won't see her anymore.

69
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,959
I gave her a stern warning.

70
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,629
She said she wouldn't show up again.

71
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,430
She said she was going back
to the US. For real.

72
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,660
So, this is how you're going to be.

73
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,470
Sure, okay.

74
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,800
I won't sit around
and wait to get stabbed in the back.

75
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,240
But where... Hey.

76
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,740
My gosh!

77
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,879
Eom Hong Dan, Lee Soo Yeon.

78
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm like a sailboat caught between
a typhoon and a tsunami.

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,519
Why is my life always so stormy?

80
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,529
I'm running late.

81
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,500
You don't have to work
in the kitchen in the morning.

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,800
Mom will take care of things.

83
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,230
Still, I should help her.

84
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,699
Why? Is something wrong?

85
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,769
My belly feels a little heavy.

86
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,610
Maybe it's because
you were shocked by the accident.

87
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,720
But the doctor said
everything seemed fine.

88
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,819
(Han Internal Medicine Clinic)

89
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,889
Yes?

90
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,100
Mother,
what brings you here at this hour?

91
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,529
Is No Ah sick again?

92
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,769
No Ah went to daycare just fine.

93
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,509
I'm glad.

94
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,939
I was worried
that he might be sick again.

95
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,540
Did you decide
to ignore what I said?

96
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,379
I clearly told you
not to come looking for No Ah.

97
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,579
But then,
you went to daycare and took No Ah.

98
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,220
What are you trying to do?

99
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,649
Mother.

100
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,589
Because you're being so thoughtless,

101
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,389
Gong Boo and Hong Dan
are constantly...

102
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,259
bickering with each other.

103
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,860
What if
Gong Boo gets divorced again?

104
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,959
Will you take responsibility
for that?

105
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,129
It's not like that...

106
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:14,040
If you're a mom,
you should be more careful.

107
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,839
No Ah is adjusting well
to his new family.

108
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,970
Why do you keep interfering
and confusing him?

109
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,980
Mother.

110
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,480
No Ah is my son.

111
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,209
My son is about to be taken away
from me.

112
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,680
How can I just let that happen?

113
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
Who says anyone is taking your kid?

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,649
You're the one who sent him to us.

115
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,220
Please stop confusing No Ah.

116
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,459
Just live your life.

117
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,790
Please, I'm begging you. Please!

118
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,790
Okay?

119
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,579
You don't look so good.

120
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,079
Did you not sleep well?

121
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,519
Please try not to talk about
private matters from now on.

122
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,990
What private matters?

123
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,930
We can't even talk
about stuff like this?

124
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,459
We're colleagues
working on the same project.

125
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,660
There's nothing wrong with me
asking how you're feeling.

126
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,230
I've given this a lot of thought,

127
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,100
but about that project...

128
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,339
I'd like to work on it alone.

129
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,709
What?

130
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,980
You should just go back
to what you were working on.

131
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,779
I'll deal with my own project.

132
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,879
You want me to back off now?

133
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,920
For what reason?

134
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,189
I should refrain from doing things
that might stress out my wife.

135
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,220
Work is important,

136
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,129
but so is doing my duty
to my family.

137
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,600
You know just how critical
this project is, don't you?

138
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,899
Heirmez accepted this deal
because they thought highly of me.

139
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,899
You know that very well.

140
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,169
Thanks for your help.

141
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,100
But I'll do the rest on my own.

142
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,370
This is a surprise.

143
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,379
I wanted to do whatever I could
for you.

144
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,610
That's because
I truly want the best for you.

145
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:06,179
I know...

146
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,379
just how desperately you want it.

147
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,649
I know.

148
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,490
But...

149
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,360
I don't want to do anything
that might be misconstrued anymore.

150
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,529
It's only natural for Gong Hee
to be bothered by it.

151
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,330
How can you give up your dream
because of something so petty?

152
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,559
I haven't given up.

153
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,470
I'll make this work on my own.

154
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,909
(Mother)

155
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,889
Yes, Mother. What's the occasion?

156
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,220
I'm not sure if I can call you
about something like this.

157
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,090
You can tell me, Mother.

158
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,600
About the spa membership
you gave me.

159
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,100
Can I still use that?

160
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,129
Of course.
I'll make a reservation for you.

161
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,440
When do you want to go?

162
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,500
Is it possible to go today?

163
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,110
Well, it's usually hard
to make a reservation there.

164
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,879
Then forget it.

165
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,710
I'm being silly.

166
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,710
I shouldn't have called you.
You must be busy at work.

167
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,919
I just thought it was a waste
to throw away...

168
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,649
the membership you got for me.

169
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,889
I'll make sure
they can take you in today.

170
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,190
How does 4 p.m. sound?

171
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,690
Really? I'd appreciate that.

172
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,659
You sure have a kind heart, Ji Na.

173
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,399
I'll be there
for the time slot after that.

174
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,529
Let's catch up.

175
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,669
That would be nice.

176
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,570
Okay, see you later.

177
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,549
Ever since Kang Myung Ja
and I became in-laws,

178
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,409
I've been getting more wrinkles
each day.

179
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,179
My precious skin.

180
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,090
I can't ruin it
because of Kang Myung Ja.

181
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,289
I need some antiaging
and anti-Kang Myung Ja treatment.

182
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,399
Is that so?

183
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,970
- Yes, ma'am.
- That woman finally left town?

184
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,370
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,139
She has even put her shop up
for lease.

186
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,210
She seems to have
cleaned everything out and left.

187
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,210
That's good.

188
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,549
I'm relieved that she left
before causing more trouble.

189
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,450
What if she had lingered
near Dan Soo for longer...

190
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,679
and said something
she shouldn't have?

191
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,759
Dan Soo.

192
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,029
I was just thinking about
how much I missed you.

193
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,399
And there you are. Perfect timing.

194
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,830
That person...

195
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:40,830
I have to find her.

196
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,110
What are you talking about?

197
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,610
My mom.

198
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,509
I have to find her.

199
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,379
I thought you might know
where she went.

200
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,049
Are you saying...

201
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:59,889
you're going to look for her
because she's your mom?

202
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,820
She ran off because she felt guilty.

203
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,190
There's no need to find her.

204
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,559
I still have to tell her something.

205
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,000
And I couldn't even ask her
what I wanted to know.

206
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,899
I must know
why she had to leave me...

207
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,500
and if she really liked
money so much.

208
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,169
How could she have abandoned me
and Dad for money?

209
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,840
I didn't get any answers
for my questions.

210
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,639
Like I said, ask no more.

211
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,580
I told you everything.

212
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,809
That's all there is
to know about her.

213
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,580
I need to hear it from her
in person.

214
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,009
Why on earth
are you acting like this?

215
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,620
You're doing the same thing
your father did.

216
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,779
When she ran off,

217
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,720
Hae Joon asked me the same thing.

218
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,460
Do you want me to tell you again
what kind of person she is?

219
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,830
She grew up
with a mother who ran a bar,

220
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,929
and her father was a con man.
She's just a vulgar woman.

221
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,299
If you look at someone's parents,

222
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,269
you can tell who that person is too!

223
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Is that...

224
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,509
her fault?

225
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,279
What?

226
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,049
Was it her fault that
she was born to such lousy parents?

227
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,419
Dan Soo.

228
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,759
You should listen to me, all right?

229
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,220
Still to this day,

230
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,490
I deeply regret that
I failed to stop Hae Joon back then.

231
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,460
I feel the regret in my bones.

232
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,299
As for Dad,

233
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,269
he died before he could find her.

234
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,039
But that won't be...

235
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,570
the case with me.

236
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,450
I'll follow her to the ends
of the earth and find her.

237
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,110
You know how I am, right?

238
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,350
I must find her
and hear it directly from her.

239
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,789
I came here, thinking you might know
where she went.

240
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,990
I guess I wasted my time.

241
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,799
Dan Soo!

242
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,230
Oh, no. Ma'am.

243
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:56,370
Are you all right?

244
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,539
If Dan Soo finds out everything...

245
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,379
What if he reacts like Hae Joon did?

246
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Then what should I do?

247
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,549
First, you need to calm down, ma'am.

248
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,179
Hurry up and track her down.

249
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,950
Locate her and send her to a place
where Dan Soo can't find her.

250
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,950
Hurry!

251
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,230
Dan Soo!

252
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,029
Dan Soo...

253
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,570
(This is the last birthday gift
you'll get from me.)

254
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,610
(Executive Director, Gu Dan Soo)

255
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:41,549
Are you all right?

256
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,779
I'm fine.

257
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,289
What about you?
Have the wounds healed?

258
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,289
I'm totally fine.

259
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,690
Just be careful, all right?

260
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,759
You're the mighty Maeng Gong Hee,
but you're pregnant now.

261
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,070
You shouldn't jump and run around
like you used to.

262
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,070
I revised the proposal.

263
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,139
She left.

264
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,279
Who?

265
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,409
That person.

266
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,549
Ms. Audrey?

267
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,889
She left this letter...

268
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:21,720
and took off again.

269
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,690
I never asked her to come back
into my life, but she did.

270
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,259
And she left again,
leaving me all alone.

271
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,600
I never even had the chance
to blame her.

272
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,070
Ms. Audrey left? But why?

273
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,340
I found out everything,

274
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,210
so I guess she couldn't take it?

275
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,340
She said she'd never
show up before me again.

276
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,009
Isn't it such a comedy?

277
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
After all this time.

278
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,190
So, how do you feel?

279
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,350
What does your heart say?

280
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,690
At first, I thought I didn't care
whether she left or not.

281
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,059
But I was wrong.

282
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:03,960
I want to find her...

283
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,029
and take it up with her.

284
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,940
I want to ask her,
"You'll leave again, and that's it?"

285
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
This time,

286
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,879
I want to leave first, if anything.

287
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:16,840
I don't want to be left behind.

288
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,279
You should find her
and bring her back.

289
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,350
I heard she wandered
from place to place for years.

290
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,220
It must've been exhausting.

291
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,389
She had decided
to settle down in our neighborhood,

292
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,059
and things were finally
becoming stable for her.

293
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,360
If you hear from her,

294
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,129
do let me know.

295
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:47,740
My stomach has been upset...

296
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,139
since I lashed out
at Soo Yeon earlier.

297
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,139
She seemed to be regretting
her decision...

298
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,750
to leave her son like that.

299
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,250
I'm not surprised.

300
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,720
She must be deeply regretting it.

301
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,549
We used to be fond of each other,

302
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:02,820
but I drove a stake
through her heart today.

303
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,690
I feel pathetic and miserable.

304
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,960
You had no other choice.

305
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,129
You had to step in
for peace in the family.

306
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
What?

307
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,830
Where have you been?

308
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,100
What's that?

309
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,700
Oh, well...

310
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:18,769
This...

311
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:20,870
Give this to Gong Hee.

312
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,440
What is this? My goodness.

313
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,210
Isn't this carp extract?

314
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,279
Oh, my. I guess you got this made...

315
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,490
with the carp you caught yourself.
Am I right?

316
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,420
I was sick of hearing you say
you were going fishing.

317
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,289
But it produced
some meaningful results, at last.

318
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,960
Hey, must you be so mean?

319
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:47,599
I was wondering
what I should get for Gong Hee.

320
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,599
This is great.

321
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,240
I'm telling you.

322
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,980
No one loves their daughter more
than my brother.

323
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:59,410
They say carp extract is the best
for pregnant women.

324
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,480
Gong Hee has been looking pale,
so I was worried.

325
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,150
Hey, tell Gong Hee
to come over and pick this up.

326
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,259
And cook her a nice meal too.

327
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,130
You saw Ssang Sook giving me
the evil eye when she left.

328
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,059
I bet she lashed out at Gong Hee
for telling me on her.

329
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,430
If I have her over again,

330
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,000
she'll hate Gong Hee even more.

331
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,599
Well, then what should we do?

332
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,670
Oh, boy.

333
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,009
Here.

334
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Mother.

335
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
What?

336
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,250
What is this?

337
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,519
Well, they're skincare products.
Make sure you use them.

338
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,420
Don't make me look like
an evil mother-in-law.

339
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,390
Tell your family about this.

340
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,789
Yes, I'll brag about this.

341
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,730
Thank you, Mother.

342
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,400
I needed these.

343
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,039
Who is it?
Why are you just standing there?

344
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,680
What? Why is that girl here?

345
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,299
My gosh.

346
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,670
Hey.

347
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,799
Mother.

348
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,700
You left your phone at the spa.

349
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,039
Oh, no. Where was my head at?

350
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,609
My goodness.

351
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,650
I was going to call Min Gi first...

352
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,880
but figured he might be busy now.

353
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,349
Am I not welcome here?

354
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,119
Why would you say such a thing?

355
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,519
Of course, you're welcome here.

356
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,089
Come in and have a seat.

357
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,160
Thank you.

358
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,230
And here.

359
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:02,869
This is for me?

360
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,279
My, it's so beautiful.

361
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:10,779
This...

362
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:12,880
It's a purse.

363
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,680
I didn't want to come empty-handed.

364
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,119
It's a brand
I've been keeping my eye on.

365
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,049
Don't you think
it's perfect for you?

366
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:23,259
My gosh. How sweet of you.

367
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,630
I'm so flattered and grateful.

368
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,700
Oh, my.
Look at this beautiful design.

369
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,799
Try it on, Mother.

370
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,369
My goodness.
Can I really accept this gift?

371
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:37,069
What do you think? Does it suit me?

372
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,869
Yes. I know your taste very well,
Mother.

373
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,880
Oh, my. Thank you so much.

374
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:47,049
This is bringing tears to my eyes.

375
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,349
You should have a cup of tea
before you go.

376
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,420
Hey, why are you
just standing there?

377
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,490
Go and bring out
some fruit or something.

378
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,200
I can't believe
she came to our house.

379
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,470
This is no big deal.

380
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,779
It's nothing. It's okay.

381
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,079
Thanks to you,
I got a facial at the spa...

382
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,450
and got this beautiful gift too.

383
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:29,859
All my stress has melted away.
Thanks.

384
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,200
With the new member in the family,
there must be a lot to think about.

385
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,329
I don't want to say this
in front of you,

386
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,299
but I'm incredibly tenderhearted
and understanding, you know.

387
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I put up with everything
even when there's something I dislike,

388
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,069
and I'm nice to everyone.

389
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,339
But she thinks
her in-laws are a complete joke.

390
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,549
She goes to her family
and tells them everything.

391
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,289
Gong Hee's intentions
are questionable at times.

392
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,789
My gosh. You felt that too?

393
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,420
Is she like that at work too?

394
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,789
The truth is,

395
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:09,559
there's a competition going on
between Min Gi and Mr. Gu now.

396
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,369
Between Min Gi and Gu Dan Soo?

397
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,769
That's right. The chairwoman
will use it to choose her successor,

398
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,809
so it's very important, Mother.

399
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,839
Okay, and?

400
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,940
I was helping Min Gi
with his project.

401
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,549
I want Min Gi to do well, you know.

402
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,549
Ji Na, you're incredibly kind.
Thank you.

403
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,490
But I think
Gong Hee was bothered by it.

404
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,859
It looked like
she was getting jealous,

405
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,099
so I couldn't really be proactive
about helping Min Gi.

406
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,329
But for Min Gi, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

407
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,839
What? What do you mean
she was getting jealous?

408
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,809
She is helping Mr. Gu Dan Soo
on his project.

409
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,819
What? She should be helping
her husband at work if anything.

410
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,289
How could she get in his way?

411
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,720
Why on earth is she doing that?

412
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,390
I don't really get it.

413
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,119
Instead of helping her husband,

414
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,559
how could she help his rival?

415
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,289
I can't believe this.

416
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,900
This won't do.

417
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:30,880
Can't you at least act like
you're happy to see me?

418
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:32,509
I am a guest.

419
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,720
How could you put it that way?

420
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
What do you mean?

421
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,420
You spoke as if I was getting
in the way of Mr. Seo's work.

422
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,289
Isn't that true?

423
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,990
What did you say?

424
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,259
I wasn't stating false facts.

425
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,660
You're getting in the way
of Seo Min Gi's future,

426
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,430
aren't you?

427
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,329
Ms. Kang,

428
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,470
I pity you now.

429
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
What?

430
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:00,369
You stay close to my husband...

431
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:01,839
and act like
you're just trying to provoke me.

432
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,839
Now, you even come to
my in-laws' home to bad-mouth me.

433
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,809
Why are you being so disgraceful?

434
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:07,549
"Disgraceful?"

435
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Me?

436
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,680
Even when you nitpicked
my every move at work,

437
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,789
I tried to understand,
thinking that you might be upset.

438
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,160
But I can't let this go on
any longer.

439
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:17,759
And what if you can't?

440
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:21,089
What do you think you can do?

441
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,960
I won't just let this happen.

442
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,170
How much longer must I tolerate you?

443
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,829
What is all this noise?

444
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:34,440
Oh, my. Ji Na, are you okay?

445
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,279
Why are you yelling at her?

446
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,349
Ji Na just came in here
to help you with the fruit.

447
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:42,779
What...

448
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,849
It's okay, Mother.

449
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,259
Gong Hee must've felt uncomfortable
with me around.

450
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,559
Gong Hee, I'm sorry.

451
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,029
I shouldn't have talked
about stuff from work.

452
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,829
Mother and I used to be very close,
you see.

453
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,839
Still, I was doing it
for Min Gi's sake.

454
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,210
I crossed the line, didn't I?

455
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,380
You work with Min Gi,

456
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,049
yet you never once talk
about him first.

457
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,920
Are you that angry
that Ji Na told me that one thing?

458
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,920
Mother.

459
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,190
I think I should be going now.

460
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,960
No, don't leave so soon.

461
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,759
You should stay for some tea.

462
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,589
I don't think this is the right time
for me to be here.

463
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,430
Gong Hee, sorry about today.

464
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:34,329
I'll see you at work.

465
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,539
Gosh, Ji Na.

466
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,839
Don't leave like this.

467
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,150
Ji Na is leaving
because you upset her.

468
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:54,750
She thought of me
and even brought a present.

469
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,259
Why did you pick a fight with her?

470
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:00,890
No, I...

471
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,470
Should I just call Gong Hee out...

472
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:14,309
and give this to her?

473
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,940
I don't want to see Ssang Sook.

474
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,450
What if she scolds Gong Hee again...

475
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,019
for doing something for her
behind her back?

476
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,319
My goodness.

477
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,660
Oh, my.

478
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,359
Hello.

479
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,299
Who...

480
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,829
Don't you remember me?

481
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,200
I work with Gong Hee.
I'm her manager.

482
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,470
I came by that one time
to have dumplings...

483
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,809
when we had to
step out of the office together.

484
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,839
Oh, right.

485
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,940
But...

486
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,049
what brings you here?

487
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,750
I just had some business here.

488
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,619
Then you should head inside.

489
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,099
She even left the front door open.

490
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,069
Hey! Don't just stand there
with your mouth shut.

491
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:22,609
Say something!

492
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,279
You're an expert
at getting in my Min Gi's way.

493
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,549
He's working
on something so important.

494
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,220
How could you interfere
in his work...

495
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
when you should be helping him?

496
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,460
You think I don't know anything
about working in an office, right?

497
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,289
You think I'm a joke, don't you?

498
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,730
I told you, Mother.
I'm not trying to interfere...

499
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,430
That's called interfering.

500
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,029
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance
for Min Gi.

501
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,339
If you're going to be like this,
you should just quit your job.

502
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,569
Stay at home.

503
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,009
- Mother, I worked hard to...
- Be quiet.

504
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,210
How dare you talk back to me?

505
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,150
Is that how your mother raised you?

506
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,279
If you're going to do this,
just quit your job.

507
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,319
Stop getting in Min Gi's way.

508
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,319
Mom.

509
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:14,960
Oh, my. When did you...

510
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,910
(My Merry Marriage)

511
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,950
Why did you come
without even calling ahead?

512
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,950
This is just bad manners,
don't you think?

513
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,549
Actually,
I've been looking around for her.

514
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,049
I want to find her
and end things on my own terms,

515
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,349
whether I resent her or not.

516
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:42,619
I'll find her.

517
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:43,859
Why would you do that?

518
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,059
I didn't want you
to get the wrong idea,

519
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:48,730
so I told Ms. Kang
to take her hands off my project.

520
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,099
I never told you to do that.

521
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:53,099
I just wanted you
to keep your boundaries clear.

522
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,000
That means the same thing!

523
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,369
