00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,010
(Episode 45)

2
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,010
Do you...

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,880
like Min Gi a lot?

4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,950
What?

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,919
Are you serious about him?

6
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,429
I don't know.

7
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:44,560
I guess I could say...

8
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,779
My heart races
just by looking at him.

9
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:02,180
I'm so nervous
that I can't look at him,

10
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,279
but then, at other times,
I look into his eyes,

11
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,489
and it makes me feel relaxed
and at ease.

12
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,930
I won't let anyone else have you
anymore, Min Gi.

13
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,129
I have no intention
of letting you go either.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,170
He cares so much about me.

15
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,539
I received so much from him,

16
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,640
and that makes me want to
give just as much back.

17
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:36,849
It's not that I feel indebted
to him,

18
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,379
but I have such a strong desire
to do that for him,

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,450
which is what he deserves.

20
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
Then,

21
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,530
you should write that down.

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,899
Why are you asking me?

23
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,700
If I sound too serious,
it would be overbearing.

24
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,269
If he's a jerk
who finds sincerity overbearing,

25
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:58,399
you should kick him to the curb.

26
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,039
Why do you keep calling
Mr. Seo a jerk?

27
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,080
What's getting on your nerves
that you're being so sulky?

28
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,039
You.

29
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:09,349
What about me?

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,679
You're getting on my nerves.

31
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,390
What's wrong with him now?

32
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,399
What bothers me more...

33
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,969
isn't Seo Min Gi and Kang Ji Na,

34
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,439
but you, Maeng Gong Hee,

35
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,640
who's so smitten...

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,209
with Seo Min Gi.

37
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:48,390
What?
The dress was meant for a model?

38
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:51,719
Gong Hee was
just trying it on instead.

39
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,029
I didn't think
someone might've seen that.

40
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:56,989
I didn't even know that.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,959
When I imagined you
holding another woman's hand...

42
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,369
and entering a wedding hall,

43
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,570
I nearly lost my mind.

44
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,809
I don't even know
how I got to the chairwoman's house.

45
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,640
All I could think of was
that I had to see you right away.

46
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,149
Don't make me lose my mind again.

47
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,119
I don't know what I might do.

48
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,260
We're in so much trouble now.

49
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,429
Yes, we're in big trouble.

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,249
"Don't die."

51
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,880
He was saying that in his sleep.

52
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,649
You know Gyeong Tae works out
because of his insomnia.

53
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,219
I guess he still can't sleep well...

54
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,459
even after working out so hard.

55
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,160
He was even sweating...

56
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,390
and moaning all night long.

57
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,130
He kept me up all night too.

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,330
Has Gyeong Tae gotten
a little weak lately?

59
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,800
Weak? As if.
When he goes in for a physical,

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,140
his bone density is
in the range of someone in his 20s.

61
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:16,769
You're right.
Even a wild hog would run away...

62
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,510
after one look at Gyeong Tae's arms.

63
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,880
So what if he has strong arms?

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,179
He has no use for them
besides lifting trays of dumplings.

65
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,279
Oh, goodness.

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,550
Do we have any hangover soup?

67
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,860
Good grief. Why do you always come home
in the middle of the night?

68
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,029
What?

69
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:37,160
Why would you bother coming home
in the middle of the night?

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,300
Just go and live there.

71
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,129
If I lived in that house,

72
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:42,699
my life would be cut short.

73
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,569
She's always asking me
for the weirdest things.

74
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,540
"Go buy chicken feet,
grilled chicken hearts,"

75
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,639
"and tripe."

76
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,009
That woman...

77
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,710
loves the weirdest parts of meat.

78
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,210
Hey.

79
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,020
She has such an odd taste.

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,550
That's why she chose you.

81
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,949
Come on, Auntie.

82
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,350
Do I really have to marry her?

83
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,119
Hey, just go and wake your dad...

84
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,860
before I beat you
with this ladle, okay?

85
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,030
Wasn't Dad working out?

86
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,429
It's not like him
to be sleeping at this hour.

87
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
What's this?

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,340
I'm sure the sun rose
in the east this morning.

89
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,509
Why is he sleeping in?

90
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:24,139
Is that really you, Detective Maeng?

91
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,410
My gosh.

92
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,590
You sure know
how to make someone frustrated.

93
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,559
If you're sick,
tell me where it hurts...

94
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,259
or go to the hospital.

95
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:42,660
Just leave me alone.

96
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
How could I leave you alone?

97
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,829
I'm so frustrated that my insides
feel like they're on fire.

98
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,869
Why don't you
just go fishing instead?

99
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:50,530
You love fishing so much.

100
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,770
Why aren't you going fishing
and just lying there moaning?

101
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:56,840
Then, I'll break your fishing rod.

102
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,480
Do whatever you want.

103
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,949
I don't need it anymore.

104
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:05,249
Goodness.

105
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,119
Oh, goodness.

106
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:10,759
Good grief.

107
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,360
Don't walk so close to me.

108
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,259
I have to go to work too.

109
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,270
Seriously...

110
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:22,499
Hey.

111
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
What are you doing?

112
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:28,470
You should go to the restroom.

113
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,340
What are you saying?

114
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,239
Why would you tell me
to go to the restroom or not?

115
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,079
You have lipstick on your teeth.

116
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,949
Really?

117
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,389
Oh, no.

118
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:44,059
- Go on.
- Oh, hey.

119
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,860
Hey, Seo Min Gi.

120
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,800
Let's talk for a minute.

121
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,710
Tell me here.

122
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,389
I'm barely holding myself back...

123
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,689
when I want to
smash everything apart.

124
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,790
Follow me.

125
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,369
Good morning.

126
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,780
You and Dan Soo are
always side by side.

127
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,150
Well...

128
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,220
Ms. Kang, about my house...

129
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,689
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

130
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,059
The two of you living together.

131
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Could I perhaps...

132
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,160
ask you why that is?

133
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,199
Gong Hee,

134
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,910
I feel bad about something.

135
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,110
Let's just call it even with this.

136
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:27,790
What do you think you're doing?

137
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,590
I thought about it all night.

138
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,030
Why did Seo Min Gi do that?

139
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,540
Explain things to me clearly.

140
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:40,939
What was...

141
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,379
the scene I saw
in front of the house yesterday?

142
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,710
You must know if you saw it.

143
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:53,219
Do you need more of an explanation?

144
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,319
Don't you even feel bad
for Gong Hee?

145
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,120
Ji Na and I dated for three years.

146
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,160
Then, we broke up.

147
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,859
There were talks of marriage
between you and Ji Na.

148
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,099
As you must know,

149
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,569
you weren't really sincere
about that marriage.

150
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,370
So?

151
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,939
Are you saying
you just had fun with Gong Hee?

152
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,469
Why?
Did it bruise your fragile ego...

153
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:18,939
that Kang Ji Na's
arranged marriage...

154
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,709
happened to be with me?

155
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,309
You punk.

156
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
Darn it.

157
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,540
I'm going to...

158
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,780
sort it all out with Gong Hee.

159
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,209
But...

160
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,520
I don't know if this is something
for you to get worked up about.

161
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,050
There's nothing going on
between you two.

162
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,490
You're still calm,
even amid all this.

163
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,599
"Sort it out?" Sort what out?

164
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,370
What will you tell Gong Hee?

165
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,069
"Sorry, I can't date you..."

166
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,069
"because I'm dating Kang Ji Na."

167
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,670
It's between us.

168
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,270
Don't overstep and butt in.

169
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:23,670
Watch yourself.

170
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,140
Don't let Gong Hee hear about...

171
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,479
how you and Kang Ji Na dated
for years...

172
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,020
and how you were broken up.

173
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,479
Don't tell her anything.

174
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,219
Break up with her this instant.

175
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,490
What right do you have
to tell me to break up or not?

176
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,929
Seo Min Gi!

177
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,429
If you're the Seo Min Gi
I once knew,

178
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:50,829
at least do what I say.

179
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,670
I've lost
all respect for you already.

180
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,849
Do you like Gong Hee?

181
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,109
Is that why?

182
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
Hey.

183
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,130
Dan Soo,
what's wrong with your face?

184
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,160
(Pattern Room)

185
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,199
Where did you
get yourself beaten up?

186
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,300
Don't mind me.

187
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,099
Why did you get hurt?

188
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,339
Did you have a fight with someone?

189
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:29,370
Who would you fight with at work?

190
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,609
What's the big deal
about a busted lip?

191
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,939
Who was it that made me
feel like bursting from frustration?

192
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:35,750
What are you saying?

193
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,349
I'm more worried...

194
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,689
about you getting hurt.

195
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,390
Why would I get hurt?

196
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:48,429
Gosh, this won't do. Come with me.

197
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:56,270
(First Aid Kit)

198
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:58,339
My goodness.

199
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,170
Gosh, sit still for a second.

200
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,109
What if it leaves a scar?

201
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,179
Did something happen
between you and Mr. Seo?

202
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,120
You went off with him earlier.

203
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,620
You're going to remain silent?

204
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,520
Let me see.
How can I make this more painful?

205
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,329
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

206
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,770
No matter what happened
between you two,

207
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,069
I'm still your friend.

208
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,839
So loosen up a little.

209
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:36,809
Even if...

210
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,280
I punched your boyfriend
in the nose?

211
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,410
Hey, did you really do that?

212
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,079
I didn't.

213
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,819
I wanted to,

214
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,990
but I let him off easy.

215
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,290
Hey.

216
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,829
I heard Mr. Seo really looked out
for you since you were young.

217
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,800
In some ways, you might have
more history with him than me.

218
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,599
That's why
I'm not asking you about it.

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Still,

220
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,270
you have to tell me later on.

221
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
If I tell you,

222
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,609
you won't even be able to handle it.

223
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:17,949
Let's get going.

224
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,140
The zipper was being weird,

225
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,410
so I yanked on it,
and it just broke off.

226
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:46,439
Is something wrong?

227
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,709
You don't look so great.

228
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,849
Oh, my. Are you okay?

229
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,189
What's wrong? You seem so out of it.

230
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,890
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,089
Your jacket...

232
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,859
It's fine. I can just wash it.

233
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,199
Don't you have any ointment
and bandages?

234
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,640
If you don't,
I'll run to the pharmacy.

235
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,939
It doesn't matter.

236
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:15,469
None of it...

237
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,140
matters anymore.

238
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,390
Hey.

239
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,219
What about the jacket
you took with you?

240
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:32,959
I thought you were getting it fixed
and bringing it right back.

241
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,890
Well, Audrey is acting rather odd.

242
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,530
And when hasn't she been odd?

243
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,099
When she walks,
she sways so cheerfully.

244
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:43,370
When she talks,
she sounds so friendly.

245
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:45,199
But she wasn't being cheerful,

246
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,099
as if she were in a daze.

247
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:48,209
She looked out of it.

248
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,410
She even pricked her finger
while sewing.

249
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,939
What's up with that?

250
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:54,479
First Gyeong Tae,
and now Sleepwalker too?

251
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:58,880
Is there an infectious disease going
around that leaves you in a daze?

252
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,849
I know. They do seem to be
in similar conditions.

253
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,990
She wasn't like herself at all...

254
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:05,189
and didn't even smile.

255
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,660
What? Sleepwalker,
the woman who's always smiling?

256
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,630
What's up with her?

257
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,530
Where is Mr. Seo?

258
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,949
I'm sorry for being late.

259
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,479
What's wrong with your face?

260
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Did you get hurt?

261
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,290
Yes, a bit.

262
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,020
Come to think of it,

263
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,160
Dan Soo seemed
to have been hurt too.

264
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:46,260
Oh, my.
What's going on between you two?

265
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,099
You didn't go up to the rooftop...

266
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:51,170
and get into a brawl, did you?

267
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:53,439
No way.

268
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,839
How could something like that
happen at work?

269
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,439
Right?

270
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,679
It was because of personal matters.

271
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,920
Please don't mind me.

272
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,849
It's because a jerk
I thought was normal...

273
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,349
turned out to be crazy.

274
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,760
A good beating is
the best cure for a crazy jerk.

275
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,540
No way.
Did I miss such a great show?

276
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,010
Darn it.
Watching fights is so much fun.

277
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,750
Oh, no.
Ssook Ssook, don't listen to that.

278
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:40,079
Good going, you two.

279
00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:56,229
(Design Room, Pattern Room,
Resource Room)

280
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,770
- Gong Hee.
- Yes?

281
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,770
One second.

282
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,179
Gong Hee.

283
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,910
Yes.

284
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,150
Can we meet after work?

285
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,209
I have something to say.

286
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,280
Let's meet in the park.

287
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,420
I'll be right there
after my report to the chairwoman.

288
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,020
Okay.

289
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,859
Were you badly hurt?

290
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,630
Oh, this?

291
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:41,849
I guess
you're going to tell her today.

292
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,819
I should.

293
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:46,619
I should...

294
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,589
sort things out.

295
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,260
You didn't actually get into
a fistfight with Dan Soo, did you?

296
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,589
Why did you leave with him
and come back with a busted nose?

297
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:00,059
Don't mind me. I'll deal with it.

298
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,230
Just wrap things up well
with Maeng Gong Hee.

299
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,300
Make sure she doesn't talk badly
about you behind your back.

300
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,430
I hope he likes it.

301
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,780
How do you think Dan Soo is doing
these days?

302
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:49,649
Do you think...

303
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,109
he has come to his senses
since coming back to work?

304
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,520
Yes, he's coming to work regularly.

305
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,649
You don't have to worry.

306
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,119
All right.

307
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,159
Just like your father and I,

308
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,430
you and Dan Soo will also become
a good pair.

309
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,099
Yes?

310
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
What is it?

311
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,970
Well, Ms. Kang Ji Na is here.

312
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,639
Just let her in.

313
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,240
Min Gi is practically
part of my family anyway.

314
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,980
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,619
Come and have a seat.

316
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,059
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,129
I didn't know Mr. Seo would be here.

318
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,399
You're both like family to me.

319
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,899
You shouldn't feel awkward
around each other.

320
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:47,839
Ji Na, you're going to be
my actual family now.

321
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,010
A daughter-in-law
who's like your actual daughter...

322
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,109
I thought that was all nonsense.

323
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,450
But having such a pretty girl
like you as my granddaughter-in-law,

324
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,550
I feel as though
I've gained a daughter.

325
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,819
I feel so great these days.

326
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:05,490
Thank you.

327
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,629
How are
your wedding preparations going?

328
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,030
That's up to the elders.

329
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,260
There's nothing much for us to do.

330
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:15,200
Come now. You shouldn't say that.

331
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,069
How is that up to the elders?

332
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,240
I apologize.

333
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,569
I just meant that I knew
how serious this matter is.

334
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,770
This marriage is also about
the merger between two corporations.

335
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,980
My mother suggested we have
an engagement ceremony first.

336
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,250
It would be favorable
for both companies' stock prices,

337
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,389
and we could expect
positive outcomes.

338
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,919
As long as you allow it,

339
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,389
I thought it might be good...

340
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,659
to take things slowly,
from the engagement to the wedding.

341
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,430
Hey, that hurts!

342
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,809
Gosh, let go of me.

343
00:20:58,809 --> 00:20:59,809
What are you doing?

344
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,780
Your attitude is bothering me.

345
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,220
You should be doing
the explaining first.

346
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,190
Do you know what you were saying
right in front of my face?

347
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,790
As I was listening,

348
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:15,490
you were talking about
marrying another man!

349
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,629
We're at work now.

350
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,899
What else should I have done?

351
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Get in.

352
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:30,869
Get in.

353
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:19,260
The call cannot be connected.
Transferring to voicemail...

354
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,240
It's cold.

355
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:44,680
Gosh, let go of me first.

356
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,250
We're not at work anymore.

357
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,990
And the chairwoman,
who you respect so much, can't hear you.

358
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,760
So tell me the truth.

359
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:56,530
Are you just going to
play games with me?

360
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,960
Will you treat me like a doll
you can control?

361
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,329
It's not like that.

362
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,930
Why are you blowing things
out of proportion?

363
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,440
Was I supposed to tell
the chairwoman right then and there?

364
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,700
You should've told her.

365
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:10,309
Before both families meet...

366
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:11,510
I will tell them.

367
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,010
Now is just not the right time.

368
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:15,649
No.

369
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:17,809
You have no intention
of telling anyone.

370
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,950
Even when I was right next to you,

371
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,419
you were talking about
getting engaged to Gu Dan Soo.

372
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,020
I'm in a tight spot too.

373
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,260
If I break things off right now,

374
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,389
what would the chairwoman
think of me?

375
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,589
Does what she thinks of you matter?

376
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,230
Didn't you think about
how humiliated I felt back then?

377
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,569
(Maeng Gong Hee)

378
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Why aren't you picking up?

379
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,210
Pick up and tell her this instant.

380
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,710
"Let's break up."

381
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,819
"I'm dating Kang Ji Na again."

382
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,220
Why can't you say it?

383
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,889
Aren't you the one who hasn't
sorted out your feelings yet?

384
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:04,530
Why do I have to tell her?

385
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:06,899
What?

386
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,530
You're not sorting anything out...

387
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,700
or giving anything up.

388
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,369
So why do I have to sort out
my feelings first?

389
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,309
Your situation is different
from mine.

390
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,980
No, to me, this is about...

391
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,639
breaking the promise
I made with Gong Hee.

392
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:22,809
Seo Min Gi.

393
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,879
Until you sort things out
with Gu Dan Soo,

394
00:24:26,849 --> 00:24:27,849
I won't either.

395
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,169
(Team Manager Seo Min Gi)

396
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:19,069
I should have...

397
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,300
run into her by now.

398
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,040
Why isn't she home yet?

399
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:25,740
She's making me worried.

400
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,079
Maeng Gong Hee must have...

401
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,220
heard everything...

402
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
by now.

403
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
What?

404
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Audrey!

405
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,180
Audrey!

406
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,790
What...

407
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,869
I ruined everything.

408
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I...

409
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,069
I ruined everything.

410
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,879
I ruined everything, Hae Joon.

411
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,990
I should've died instead.

412
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,129
I should've died.

413
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:39,740
I should've died.

414
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,359
No!

415
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Oh, goodness.

416
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:04,270
My goodness.

417
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,139
Oh, my. Audrey, are you okay?

418
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,809
Gosh, Audrey.

419
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:10,540
You can't do this.

420
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Let go.

421
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,909
Let me go!

422
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,690
(My Merry Marriage)

423
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:25,149
Hae Joon died because of you!

424
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:27,790
You killed my son!

425
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,589
I couldn't reach you,
so I couldn't sleep a wink all night.

426
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:32,030
He lost his phone.

427
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,829
- So where is he?
- At the hospital.

428
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,930
Did you perhaps get stood up?

429
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,099
I'm sure he had his reasons.

430
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,770
I'm sorry.

431
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,409
What on earth is this?

432
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,839
