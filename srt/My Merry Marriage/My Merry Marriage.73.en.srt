1
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,790
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,230
Your tenant is here.

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,660
I'm back.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,730
(Episode 73)

5
00:00:58,599 --> 00:00:59,740
Gu Dan Soo.

6
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:03,570
Have you all been keeping well?

7
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,739
What? What brings you here
in the middle of the night?

8
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:09,550
Hey, who are you?

9
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,879
My goodness. What are you, a ghost?

10
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,519
Hey, did your relative
kick you out again?

11
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,490
I missed your soy sauce
marinated crab so much...

12
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,619
that I had to come back.

13
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:22,729
Of course, I knew it.
You're totally addicted.

14
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,799
Gu Dan Soo, we need to talk.

15
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,170
Talk about what?
I'm happy that he's back.

16
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,170
I was sad I never got to
say goodbye to him before he left.

17
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,969
I guess you missed me.

18
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,210
Mom, it's not that...

19
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,240
My room is still available, right?

20
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,939
Don't tell me
you already found a new tenant.

21
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,750
My goodness. Of course, we didn't.

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,179
- He looks happy.
- He looks great.

23
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,590
I know. My gosh.

24
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,420
Oh, my goodness.

25
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,260
What's going on?

26
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,519
It sounded like Dan Soo's voice.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,530
Yes, Dan Soo packed up his things
and moved back.

28
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:05,269
Hey!

29
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,670
Who said you could move back here?

30
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,040
I can do what I want.

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,609
That's my room.

32
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,879
You know you shouldn't be doing this
in this situation.

33
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,349
What is the situation now?

34
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,349
Nothing has changed for me.

35
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,620
Hey, don't you know
I've rejected you numerous times?

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm fine with being rejected.
What's with all the fuss?

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,260
I'm not fine. It's not fine with me!

38
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,019
I have nowhere to go.

39
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,030
What do you mean
you have nowhere to go?

40
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,730
Don't tell me...

41
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,640
Dan Soo, let's talk.

42
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,460
Why did you fight with her?

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,159
Apologize to Chairwoman Hwang
and go home. Right now!

44
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,259
I kept regretting moving out
and leaving you here alone.

45
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,030
I thought, "I shouldn't have let her
push me away."

46
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,699
"I should've held out
and stayed by her side."

47
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,770
I won't leave, no matter how hard
you try to kick me out.

48
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,770
Don't waste your energy.

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,180
I feel like I've finally come home.
Yes, this is home.

50
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,360
Actually,

51
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,530
I'm happy that you're here.

52
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,870
I feel bad that I feel this way,

53
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,169
but I'm so happy...

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,139
that you're back.

55
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,500
Hurry up and take me too.
What are you waiting for?

56
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,139
Are you having fun alone up there?

57
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,840
Why were you in such a rush?

58
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,139
Did you really have to go alone
like that?

59
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,680
My goodness.

60
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,379
And what is this picture?

61
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,080
We cut this out of a group picture.

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,449
You're much more handsome in person.

63
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:53,039
Myung Ja always calls me
around this time of day.

64
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,439
I guess she's pretty busy.

65
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,279
She must have so much
on her mind now.

66
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,209
My goodness.

67
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,269
Give it a rest.

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,470
You should have a hearty meal.

69
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,639
Will you empty this bowl quickly
and have another?

70
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,939
I might just flip this table over.

71
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,579
Dan Soo is looking out for you.

72
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:37,279
Why are you being so feisty?

73
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,819
You are being suspiciously kind
to her.

74
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,620
Does she have something over you?

75
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,129
Dan Soo, you and I should talk.

76
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,129
Oh, okay.

77
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,540
But he's in the middle of a meal.

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Gosh, he already
emptied his bowl clean.

79
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,639
Is that so?

80
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,009
Shouldn't he have
another bowl of rice?

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,180
Do you think he didn't get any food
at his relatives' house again?

82
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,290
I heard from Gong Hee.

83
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,730
You should put those thoughts aside.

84
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,870
Mr. Maeng, I...

85
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,970
We'll have Gong Hee...

86
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,339
marry the baby's father.

87
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:36,970
That's not the best thing
for Gong Hee.

88
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,509
I'm right about this.

89
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,079
Getting married
out of responsibility is right?

90
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,379
To someone she doesn't even love?

91
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,949
Just back off if I tell you to!

92
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,050
Mr. Maeng.

93
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:56,329
I'm sure you understood
what I just said.

94
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I...

95
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,699
like Gong Hee.

96
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,930
I'll become a good husband
and a good father.

97
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,699
I'm sure I can do it.

98
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,610
You resemble your father so much.
Especially that look in your eyes.

99
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,680
But that's why I can't allow this,
Dan Soo.

100
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,720
I know all too well
what that firm stance...

101
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,920
led him to in the end.
That's why you can't do this.

102
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,360
I can't let you,
because I saw it with my own eyes.

103
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,769
Don't shake up Gong Hee's heart...

104
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,509
anymore.

105
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,639
Please.

106
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Dad.

107
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,199
What did you say to Dan Soo?

108
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,269
Listen carefully.
Dan Soo is not the one for you.

109
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,699
I know.

110
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,610
I do, but...

111
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,839
Get ready
to marry the baby's father.

112
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,079
And persuade Dan Soo to move out.

113
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,949
Dad.

114
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,920
Actually,
Dan Soo coming back here...

115
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,449
makes me happy.

116
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,589
Can't I just stay like this
with Dan Soo?

117
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,430
No, you can't! And that's final!

118
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,629
What can't she do?
What is this about?

119
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,939
Send Dan Soo back.

120
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm against him
staying here with us.

121
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:50,970
What's wrong with you now?

122
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,810
And what about the year's rent
he already paid?

123
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,879
I'll pay him back
even if I have to take out a loan.

124
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,509
So just send him back!

125
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,519
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

126
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:04,790
My goodness.

127
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:10,829
Yes?

128
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,669
Did you ask to see me, ma'am?

129
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:22,269
She said she couldn't sleep a wink
last night.

130
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,409
Are you feeling ill, ma'am?

131
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,309
Have a seat, Min Gi.

132
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,720
Dan Soo left home.

133
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Pardon?

134
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,289
He says he will marry that girl,
Maeng Gong Hee.

135
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,960
All because of one girl.

136
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:44,659
My goodness.

137
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:47,960
Is it true that Maeng Gong Hee...

138
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,200
is pregnant with your child?

139
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:53,169
Is it true?

140
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,509
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,210
Then you should hurry up
and marry her.

142
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,179
Why should Dan Soo marry a girl
who's having your baby?

143
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,980
That's just not right.

144
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,379
What do you think about this?

145
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,860
I don't want to see Dan Soo
ruining his life because of a girl.

146
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,259
So, get married as soon as possible.

147
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,330
Yes, ma'am. However,

148
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,370
I'm not doing this
to follow your orders.

149
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,269
I am doing this of my own accord.

150
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,870
I'm more relieved to hear
that it's what you want too.

151
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,870
Make it quick.

152
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,740
If that's all, I'll be going now.

153
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,549
That girl, Maeng Gong Hee,

154
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,279
will quit her job
once she marries you, right?

155
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,190
Isn't raising the baby well
just as important...

156
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,590
as keeping her job?

157
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,320
If you need money,

158
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,590
I can give you
however much you need.

159
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,059
If you need a newlywed home,

160
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,830
I'll buy you one.

161
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,309
You shouldn't carry heavy things
when you're pregnant.

162
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,779
Hey, forget it. I'll do it myself.

163
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,110
And please wear shoes
with lower heels.

164
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,879
You're short, so you'll never
reach the top shelf anyway.

165
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
My gosh.

166
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:51,350
What about the iron supplements?
You took them, right?

167
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,590
Forget it, okay?

168
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,460
- No, I'll carry it.
- I'll do it.

169
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,230
- Why?
- Hey, let go of this.

170
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,759
- Let go.
- Just open the door.

171
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,970
My gosh. I'll take it.

172
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,940
What? What are you doing
in my office?

173
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,940
I heard you went back
to Gong Hee's house.

174
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,110
My, news travels fast.

175
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,080
What are you thinking?

176
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,090
I told you.

177
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,950
I'm only going to think
about one thing.

178
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,190
I said I'd go to Maeng Gong Hee.

179
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,029
Gu Dan Soo.

180
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,490
Will you really be so reckless?

181
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,000
I only have one goal.

182
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,529
I'm going to make Gong Hee smile.

183
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,799
There's nothing I hate more
than seeing her crying.

184
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,200
I'll make her happy.

185
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,240
I will also try hard
for Gong Hee and my child, so...

186
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
"Try hard?"

187
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,009
To you, that must be something
that requires a lot of effort.

188
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,820
I don't even get
a chance to do that.

189
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,480
Stop being so immature.

190
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,090
I mean, I'm doing my best too.

191
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,490
Just hurry up
and bring me the report.

192
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,889
Will you be able to beat me...

193
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,190
when you work so slowly?

194
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Hey.

195
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,809
I'm sorry to call you out
while working.

196
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,519
Why? What is this about?

197
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,490
I want to go
and officially meet your parents.

198
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,019
Pardon?

199
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,730
When would be a good time?

200
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,029
Mr. Seo.

201
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,960
Even the chairwoman knows
about us now.

202
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,269
I want to act properly.

203
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,299
"Act properly?"

204
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,740
Do you want to get married just to
act properly and be responsible?

205
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,440
That's also how I sincerely feel.

206
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,379
I've already gotten rid of...

207
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,649
my fantasy about marriage.

208
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,179
Why not?

209
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,789
A sense of responsibility
can be a sincere emotion too.

210
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Also,

211
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,620
how about you resign from work?

212
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,360
What are you...

213
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:13,529
Why...

214
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,330
We have to get ready
for the wedding,

215
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,000
and it'll be hard to see Dan Soo.

216
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,700
I want you to quit working
once you're married.

217
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:34,549
I really don't think
I can marry you, Mr. Seo.

218
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,620
You have no idea...

219
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,519
what makes me happy.

220
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,490
How hard I've worked
to become a permanent employee,

221
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,600
how much I love this company,

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,759
and how happy I am
when I design clothes.

223
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,330
You've been watching me
all this time,

224
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,399
but you know nothing about me.

225
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,769
Then...

226
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,080
about you quitting,
we can rediscuss it later on.

227
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,440
- First, let me meet your parents...
- No.

228
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,149
You don't need to do that.

229
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,379
Let me make this clear to you
once again.

230
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,879
I...

231
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,549
will not marry you.

232
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,220
So?

233
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,259
Are you saying you'll marry Dan Soo
or something?

234
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,899
You probably think
social classes don't exist anymore.

235
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,029
You're wrong. They still exist.

236
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,070
I bet you've never had to worry
about stuff like that until now,

237
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,139
but I've had to deal with it
firsthand since a young age.

238
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,309
People like us must stay
where we belong...

239
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,610
to be safe.

240
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,379
Happiness?

241
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,490
What's that?

242
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,559
People like us...

243
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,029
should be grateful
if they can be safe.

244
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,759
Let's choose the safe route.

245
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
For our marriage...

246
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:56,830
and our future.

247
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:05,610
(Executive Director, Gu Dan Soo)

248
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,750
How dare you pack up and leave
without a word?

249
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,549
Are you planning
to cut off all ties with me?

250
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,860
You let me down first, Grandma.

251
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,159
And you called Min Gi
to urge him to get married soon.

252
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,629
Dan Soo.

253
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:30,330
I really don't want to see you
ruin your life like your dad did.

254
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,669
Did you do this to Dad too?

255
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,440
"Emotions are mere luxuries."

256
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:38,340
"Listen to no one but me."

257
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,009
Did you hound him like that too?

258
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,450
- That's...
- Just leave me be.

259
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,149
If you don't want me
to end up like Dad, that is.

260
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:48,250
How could you...

261
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,019
say such a thing
to your own grandmother?

262
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,659
I'm only saying these things
because I don't want to leave you.

263
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,490
When it comes to my marriage,
let me have my way.

264
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,990
Then I'll do as you say
when it comes to work stuff.

265
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,759
Gu Dan Soo, you...

266
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,399
You must have a lot of free time,
Chairwoman Hwang.

267
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,169
I'm busy now.

268
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:11,139
There's something very important
I must take care of now.

269
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,950
(Things to Know
About the First Trimester)

270
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,490
All right.

271
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,090
- Goodness.
- The whole family...

272
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,919
is getting together for dinner
this evening.

273
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,360
I have to get groceries.
You'll help me carry things, right?

274
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,029
My goodness.

275
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,970
You can't go fishing right now,

276
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,509
so you're hoping that song
could take you to the East Sea?

277
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,910
Goodness me. I feel like
I'm talking to a brick wall again.

278
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,380
Hi. My gosh.

279
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,950
I guess
you're closing up early today.

280
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,319
We haven't had a chance...

281
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,759
to properly celebrate
Gong Hee's promotion yet,

282
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,289
and Dan Soo is back,

283
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,029
so the whole family
will have dinner together.

284
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:04,529
Audrey, you should join us
in the evening too.

285
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:05,829
- Hey.
- Right.

286
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:07,660
Mr. Maeng told me...

287
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,799
that Dan Soo moved back in.

288
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,029
Hey, brother. You're so weird.

289
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:15,299
How come you're so sweet to Audrey
but no one else?

290
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,210
Can I...

291
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,980
really come, Myung Ja?

292
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,180
Yes, of course.
It'd be great if you could join us.

293
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,220
What should I bring?

294
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,650
Why don't you bake a cake
like you did last time?

295
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,890
Although it didn't taste that great.

296
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,119
Stop it.

297
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,319
You don't need to bring anything.

298
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,289
No, I'll bring a cake
and some fruit too.

299
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,599
Where are you going?
We have to go grocery shopping!

300
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,069
Is Mr. Maeng upset about something?

301
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,039
He says he's strongly against
Dan Soo moving back in.

302
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,309
Now that Dan Soo is back,
everyone looks happier,

303
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,779
including Gong Hee. I feel like
I can finally breathe now.

304
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,019
I have no idea
what his problem is. Goodness.

305
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,920
Exactly. I'm worried about him.
Oh, boy.

306
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,559
- Hello.
- Hello.

307
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:28,779
- Please have a seat for a moment.
- Okay.

308
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,750
Maeng Gong Hee.

309
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,660
What are you doing here?

310
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,059
I checked your calendar and saw
that you had an appointment today.

311
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,900
Who said you could go into my room
without my permission?

312
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,099
Well, it was my turn to clean.

313
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:51,400
But it was a total mess.

314
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,769
My, I guess you never cleaned once
while I was away. It was so dusty.

315
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,410
Goodness.

316
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
Whatever. Just go.

317
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,279
You'll just get on my nerves.

318
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,579
- Whatever.
- Ms. Maeng Gong Hee.

319
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,910
- Yes!
- Yes!

320
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,119
Let go.

321
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,119
- Go on in.
- Okay.

322
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,190
My gosh.
You came with your husband today.

323
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,960
I was curious
to meet the baby's dad.

324
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,490
Finally, we meet.

325
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:18,059
- Oh, he's not my...
- That's right.

326
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,730
I've been busy
with some overseas work trips.

327
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,430
From now on,
I'll always come with her.

328
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Right, honey?

329
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:24,869
What? Wait.

330
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,039
Sir, do you see the baby?

331
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,410
Pardon?

332
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:38,849
Oh, yes.

333
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,019
What do you think?

334
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,849
Do you think the baby
looks like Daddy or Mommy?

335
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,619
Doctor.

336
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,890
Is the baby doing okay?

337
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,559
I've been feeling pain
in my lower abdomen for a few days.

338
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,299
The baby seems to be doing well.

339
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:58,470
Doctor, the baby's heartbeat.

340
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,569
Could you turn up the volume?

341
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Sure thing.

342
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,180
I can hear it very well.

343
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
I'm relieved.

344
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:15,119
Your baby is very healthy.

345
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,150
Thank you.

346
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,890
But you have to take it easy.

347
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:21,619
Sir?

348
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,890
Did you hear what I said?

349
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:24,859
Pardon?

350
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:26,329
Right, yes.

351
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,170
As the baby's dad,
you have to take good care of her.

352
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:33,200
For your baby and your wife,

353
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,670
you must be their guardian
they can trust and always rely on.

354
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,440
A guardian they can trust
and rely on?

355
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,039
Got it.

356
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,490
So? Are you saying
you'll marry Dan Soo or something?

357
00:21:58,029 --> 00:21:59,029
Did you hear that?

358
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,200
As soon as Momo heard my voice,

359
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,099
Momo's heart started beating louder.

360
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:05,869
Once Momo starts kindergarten,

361
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:07,369
I'll take care of Momo's classmates.

362
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,710
I'm handsome and competent.

363
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,470
I guarantee you
that Momo will be very popular.

364
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,380
Thanks for coming today,

365
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,380
but don't do this again.

366
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,119
Your mom is throwing a welcome party
for me in the evening,

367
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,190
but I'm already hungry.

368
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,819
Go ahead and hurry home, then.

369
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,559
I have to stop by somewhere.

370
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,630
You should head home.

371
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:31,960
Where do you have to go?

372
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,430
It's a secret.

373
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
I'll see you later.

374
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,599
Gu Dan Soo.

375
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,910
Don't make me become greedy.

376
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,150
- Oh, boy.
- My gosh!

377
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,960
Hey, can you taste this stew? Here.

378
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,930
We don't have time for that now.

379
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,390
- What?
- Hurry up and take that off.

380
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,460
What? Are we going somewhere?

381
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,900
Hurry up and get dressed.
We need to get going.

382
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,200
What? Did war break out
or something?

383
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,799
Am I a soldier standing guard?

384
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,839
Mother is throwing a party.

385
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,839
You won't go?

386
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,809
Do you want to stay home
and eat this awful stew you made?

387
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:21,509
Let's go!

388
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,480
Let's go!

389
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,579
- Hurry.
- Yes, let's go!

390
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,750
All right.

391
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,519
Yes, let's go!

392
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,319
Wait, hold on.

393
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,619
Oh, dear.

394
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,160
Let me see. Are we good now?

395
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,390
Oh, wait.

396
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,390
- Hello!
- Why is this here?

397
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,400
We're here!

398
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,160
- My gosh.
- Come on in.

399
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,400
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, everyone.

400
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
- Oh, my!
- My gosh!

401
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,369
What is all this?

402
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,740
Oh, my. I've been starving.

403
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:52,710
Are you ready,
Private First Class Maeng?

404
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,180
I am ready, sir. Charge!

405
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:00,720
My goodness.
This is a welcome party for Dan Soo.

406
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,119
How come
a mere guest is more excited?

407
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:06,049
"A mere guest?" What's that?

408
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:11,759
Oh, well... It means
you are a very important guest.

409
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,259
I see. I am an important guest.

410
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:20,670
Well, how come Dan Soo
and Gong Hee aren't here yet?

411
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,569
They'll probably come home together
after work.

412
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:23,769
I'm here.

413
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:26,980
- Oh, hello.
- It's good to see you.

414
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,380
- I'm not late, am I?
- No.

415
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,250
I baked a cake
and made some japchae too.

416
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,849
- Oh, my.
- Nice, japchae? Put it here!

417
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,019
Hey.

418
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:35,250
Please don't embarrass me so much.

419
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:37,619
Come and have a seat.

420
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:39,390
- We haven't started eating yet.
- I see.

421
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,420
Hey, come and sit here.

422
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,059
- Here.
- My goodness.

423
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,369
Wait, what's that?
Did someone order something?

424
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:52,769
No.

425
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,470
We're not expecting anything.

426
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,670
What?

427
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Mom.

428
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,990
Well, we have a visitor.

429
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,319
Is she someone you know?

430
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,390
Isn't she Dan Soo's relative
who came by before?

431
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,220
I heard my grandson was here.

432
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,559
I came to take him back.

433
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,759
It's not like he's a child.

434
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,930
If your fully grown grandson
left home,

435
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,430
he must have his reasons.

436
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,769
How did you treat him
for him to leave home again?

437
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:16,019
Now that I've seen
how things are here,

438
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,349
I must take him with me.

439
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,759
Dan Soo shouldn't be living
in this kind of house.

440
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,559
What kind of house is this?

441
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,799
He's doing just fine.

442
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:32,200
I'm the chairwoman of Jayce Group.

443
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:34,339
And Dan Soo is...

444
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,039
my only heir.

445
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:45,849
What?

446
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:48,849
So, Snot Face was
from a rich family?

447
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,559
What is this?
Did you know about this, honey?

448
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,559
What? Yes.

449
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,130
I only found out recently too.

450
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,359
What is going on?

451
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:18,410
Was this what you meant
when you asked me to let you...

452
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,650
stay by his side for three months?

453
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:21,420
How cunning you are.

454
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,750
What are you doing here?

455
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,289
I won't say anything to Dan Soo.

456
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:29,420
I'm just here as a neighbor.

457
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,890
If you're close enough
with that family...

458
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,099
to visit their home,

459
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:35,900
you must know
what Dan Soo is thinking now too.

460
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,140
If you're still his mother,
you should try to stop him.

461
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,740
You should stop him
in any way possible.

462
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,809
I also don't want Dan Soo...

463
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,849
to make this kind of choice.

464
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,579
Of course, you shouldn't.

465
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:55,319
Whose fault was it
that Dan Soo lost his father?

466
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:58,019
Whose fault was it
that I lost my son?

467
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,450
Dan Soo is my son.

468
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,259
I care about him more than anyone.

469
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,259
Ms. Audrey.

470
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:10,730
What was all that about?

471
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,339
Why are you talking about Dan Soo?

472
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:15,339
Gong Hee.

473
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,920
(My Merry Marriage)

474
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,920
You have something to tell me,
don't you?

475
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,319
I think it's strange.

476
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:33,960
You keep crying whenever you see me.

477
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,329
Gong Hee, please let Dan Soo go.

478
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,730
I'm asking you this
for your sake too.

479
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,660
- Maeng Gong Hee! Get out here!
- What do I do?

480
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,529
I'm going to marry Mr. Seo.

481
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,430
Are things really over between you
and Ms. Kang Ji Na?

482
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,099
You're the one who needs to move on.

483
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,240
Hello, I'm Seo Min Gi.

484
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
