when filming with children.)

00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,159
(Episode 43)

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:30,929
Hey.

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,030
I'm worried.

5
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:35,599
I think Ms. Kang has caught on.

6
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,570
Don't worry.

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,040
I bet she won't say anything
even if she knows now.

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,910
Why do you think that?

9
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,279
On the surface,
not to bring down team morale.

10
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,950
But what she's really thinking is...

11
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,250
What is she thinking?

12
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,449
I'm like a handsome prince,
you know.

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,990
- Goodness.
- So,

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,019
what would you call the woman
who lives with the prince?

15
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,089
A princess.

16
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,229
And...

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,559
do you think Ms. Kang
would want to call you a princess?

18
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,769
You need to see a doctor.

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,100
They may have a cure
for your narcissistic thinking.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,470
The others are fine,

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,009
but I'm worried about
how Mr. Seo would react.

22
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,640
I should've told him
right off the bat.

23
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,079
Hey, aren't you worried
about me at all?

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,519
If people find out
that I live with you...

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,750
How should I put it?
My reputation and dignity...

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,219
Hey, I should run to the office
and make something.

27
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:28,219
What do you need to make?

28
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,490
You don't need to know.

29
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,759
Seriously, she always does
whatever she wants.

30
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:00,219
How dare you show up here?

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,460
Is Hae Joon...

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,990
inside now?

33
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,460
Is Hae Joon...

34
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,199
here now?

35
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,270
Hae Joon...

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,609
is visiting
an overseas branch now...

37
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,609
You're lying.

38
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,949
I did exactly
what you folks told me to do...

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,550
and lived like a dead person.

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
You told me never to be seen,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,849
so I wandered around like a ghost.

42
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,619
I thought it was wrong of me
to be curious,

43
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,559
so I tried not to be interested.

44
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,159
But where is Hae Joon now?

45
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,129
Where is he?

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,170
You said all would be fine
if I just disappeared.

47
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,039
You said, if I disappeared,

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,140
both Hae Joon
and my Geon would be safe.

49
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,779
That's why I left and vanished.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
So...

51
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,420
where is Hae Joon now?

52
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,849
Where is Hae Joon?

53
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:16,300
He's at the memorial park
in Seolhwa-dong.

54
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:24,039
I won't ask you how you found out.

55
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,770
Do not come here again.

56
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,809
If Chairwoman Hwang sees you,

57
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,510
you'll have to wander around
like a ghost again.

58
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,779
What...

59
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:39,089
do I have left to fear?

60
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:41,490
Hae Joon is gone.

61
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,789
Don't you care about your son?

62
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,369
It's Chairwoman Hwang.

63
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,800
You need to leave now.

64
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,670
For your son's sake!

65
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,289
I heard some noise outside earlier.

66
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,719
Was someone here?

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,230
It was nothing. Let's go, ma'am.

68
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,560
Where is my brother?
He's nowhere to be seen.

69
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,320
I have no idea.

70
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,890
He left the house,
wearing his mourning suit.

71
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,400
My goodness. That absurd habit
is kicking in again.

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,969
He always does this
at this time of year.

73
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:59,169
He goes somewhere
dressed in all black,

74
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,330
looking like the Grim Reaper.

75
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,500
Goodness.
The shop will be busy today.

76
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,440
Did you ask him when he'd be back?

77
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,810
Why would I bother asking?

78
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,440
He won't answer me anyway.
I'm sick of this now.

79
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,479
Oh, dear. I'm telling you.

80
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,919
You felt for Maeng Gyeong Tae
just because of his looks.

81
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,179
Why did you have to
dig your own grave?

82
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,520
My point, exactly.

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,620
When that man said,
"Let's go, baby,"

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,390
I shouldn't have followed him.

85
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
"Baby."

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,900
Hey, you're a total fool
for following him.

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Oh, boy.

88
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,409
The secret box
in my husband's heart.

89
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,710
Should I have left the box
unopened forever?

90
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,310
Should I have just buried it?

91
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,390
Back then, I didn't know...

92
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,159
such big waves...

93
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,299
might come and swallow us
the day the box was opened.

94
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,989
Goodness, who's here?

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,760
What are you doing here like this?

96
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:34,729
Why?

97
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:36,960

here by your side, honey.

105
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,279
You should ask me,
"Did you have a good day?"

106
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,049
You should ask me
why I came so late...

107
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,049
and get mad at me.

If it's true,

Long ago...

149
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,809
I mean, recently,

150
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,949
there lived
a gentle marketing manager...

151

At the rookie designer's home...

156
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,939
Ta-da. There was Snot Face,
her poor childhood best friend,

who was now dating the manager,

tried to tell him about this,

161
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,289
but she kept missing
the right time to tell him.

162
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,929

wanted to tell her manager this.

00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:50,000
(Pattern Room)

185
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,850
Where are you now?

186
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,289
Why did you call again?

187
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,049
I'm home, obviously.

188
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,319
Maeng Gong Hee's house?

189
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:11,730
Why didn't you tell me?

190
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,329
That you live with Gong Hee.

191
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,459
Do I have to tell you?

192
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Gu Dan Soo.

193
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you were curious,

194
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,169
why didn't you ask
Gong Hee yourself?

195
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,510
Shouldn't you be curious about...

196
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,740
how the person you love is living?
I would be.

197
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,679
What?

198
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,740
Don't think that
this is Gong Hee's fault.

199
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,110
It's not my fault either.

200
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,449
Seo Min Gi's indifference
is the worst part of all.

201
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:38,590
I'm hanging up.

202
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,990
Hey, Gu Dan Soo. You...

203
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,760
"The person you love?"

204
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,970
Darn it. I'm the one who said it,

205
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,529
but it makes me feel terrible.

206
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,640
Hey, what do I do?

207
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,270
Out of all the aces out there,

208
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,939
I just had to draw
the most useless card of all.

209
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:05,579
My gosh. How does it make sense...

210
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,179
that I'm marrying a divorced man...

211
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,279
with nothing but debt?

212
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,120
Ms. Eom. Please calm down, okay?

213
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,090
Hey! This is all your fault.

214
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,020
Why did you have to
introduce me to him?

215
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,299
I didn't introduce him
so you could marry him.

216
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,029
Well, right. That's true.

217
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,900
But this is just too much.

218
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,140
If I accepted him
when I found out he was divorced,

219
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,309
so he should at least
have some money.

220
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:36,610
Ms. Eom, my brother may be
struggling a bit right now,

221
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,150
but once he puts his mind to it,

222
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,209
he won't let his family starve.

223
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,520
If you just hang in there
and endure it a little...

224
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Right now,

225
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,590
enduring it isn't the problem.

226
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,419
Then, what's the problem?

227
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:51,659
My letter of resignation.

228
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:52,929
What?

229
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,130
Had I known he was penniless,

230
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,699
I wouldn't have submitted
my letter of resignation.

231
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,699
Gosh, I have to ask Director Lee
to have that letter back,

232
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,169
but how can I say that?

233
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,840
This is driving me nuts!

234
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,640
Oh, Director Lee said
he was heading to HR earlier.

235
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,980
What? No.

236
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,579
Hurry!

237
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,250
Goodness.

238
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,350
Oh, dear.

239
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,689
Good grief, Maeng Gong Boo.

240
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,490
- What?
- Oh, hey.

241
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:24,929
Haven't you seen Director Lee?

242
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,990
He just set off for the HR office.

243
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,000
What?

244
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,260
Why is he so quick
about such things?

245
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,600
(Director's Office)

246
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Stop!

247
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Excuse me.

248
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,949
My letter...

249
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,720
What?

250
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,120
What about my letter of resignation?

251
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,360
I submitted it to HR. Why?

252
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,429
Are you worried
you didn't write your name again?

253
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,959
I checked everything myself.

254
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,829
No...

255
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,900
No!

256
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
What?

257
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,409
Ms. Eom.

258
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,610
Excuse me.

259
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,980
My letter of resignation...

260
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,549
It hasn't been processed yet,
has it?

261
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,220
Our staff took it...

262
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,919
to the Office of Planning
and Coordination earlier.

263
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,990
What?

264
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,189
No.

265
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,699
No!

266
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,439
Oh, hey. You there!

267
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,169
Stop!

268
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,150
Stop!

269
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,520
I told you to stop!

But this keyword...

276
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,060
doesn't seem to fit here.

Why did you bring this back?

279
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,409
But why would you do that,

280
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,310
You're going to sit on
a mountain of money.

281

You don't need a job, do you?

282
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,390
It's not a mountain of money.

283
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:09,419
I sat on a mountain of debt.

284
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,560
A mountain of debt.

Dad.

289

How have you been?

290
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,630
I've brought a delicious egg.

291
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,929
Ta-da.

292
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:56,939
What?

293
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,909
I won't eat this.

294
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,640
- What?
- I want tteokbokki.

295
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,979
The tteokbokki that Mom made.

296
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,380
When is Mom coming?

297
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,479
Mom will come back soon...

298
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,820
if you eat well.

299
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,320
Soon, when?

300
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,689
Ten nights? Twenty nights?

301
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,620
Well, if you eat this,

302
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,419
she'll be back after just one night.

303
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:21,300
The delicious egg has become a plane
and is off to Geon's mouth.

No.

306
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,870
Come on, open up.

307
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:26,900
Until Mom comes back,

308
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,600
I won't eat a thing.

309
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,169
Come on, don't be like that.

310
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,610
Let's just take one bite. Open up.

311
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,810
- Come on, Geon.
- No.

312
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,880
Here.

313
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,739
No, I don't want it.

314
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,810
But I have to say,

315
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,880
did you really have to
make me eat that burnt egg?

316
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:47,219
You were such a bad cook, Dad.

317
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,939
Last time I was here, I told you...

318
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,110
that I'd joined Grandma's company.

319
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,909
But I don't like it.

320
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,280
Grandma's temper!

321
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,810
It's too much, seriously.

322
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,880
She doesn't even care to know
how I'm feeling.

323
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,449
She's forcing me to get married.

324
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,689
Tell me. How do you feel?

325
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
How do I feel?

326
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,290
Dad, I bet you're asking me
when you know everything.

327
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,830
I know I should stop here,

328
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,939
but it's hard.

329
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,570
Do you like Gong Hee that much?

330
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,979
Yes, Dad.

331
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,479
I like Maeng Gong Hee.

332
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:51,749
I'm often late for things, you know.

333
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,689
I realized my feelings too late.

334
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,459
I'm annoyed at myself.

335
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,929
I want to see Gong Hee's smile...

336
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,600
until the day I die.

337
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:10,669
It won't happen, right?

338
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,110
Stay by her side...

339
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,979
while you can still be with her,
okay?

340
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:17,810
Should I?

341
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,949
That would be better, right?

342
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,019
I should stay by her side...

343
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,459
and be there for her, right?

344
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,390
She always acts tough,

345
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,290
but she's actually a real softie.

346
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,100
If I leave the company too,

347
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,199
she'll struggle alone.

349
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,989
How about we collaborate...

350
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:01,820
with a designer
not affiliated with Jayce?

351
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,689
Collaborate with a designer
not affiliated with Jayce?

352
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,959
If we do decide to do it,
we should do it properly.

353
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,499
It can't be something unimpressive.

354
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,659
It has to be very special.

355
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,469
Ms. Eom, is there a designer
you're thinking of?

356
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Pardon?

357
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:21,540
Oh, well... Someone mysterious.

358
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,080
But it has to be a famous designer
and...

359
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,249
So, you bluffed without a plan.

360
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:30,880
Why are you so enthusiastic
all of a sudden?

361
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,989
My gosh. "All of a sudden?"
What are you talking about?

362
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,519
I love this company very much.

363
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,290
I, Eom Hong Dan,

364
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,929
will never leave Jayce Fashion.

365
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,130
I'll devote myself to Jayce Fashion
until the day I die...

366
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,870
- That's enough.
- Okay.

367
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,870
Does anyone have a good idea?

368
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,100
Well...

369
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,570
What about Holly?

370
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Holly?

371
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,979
The fashion designer no one has met?

372
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,310
Yes. If we work with Holly,

373
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,080
it'll definitely generate some buzz.

374
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,320
Holly communicates
through her agent.

375
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,650
No one knows Holly's real name,
nationality, and age.

376
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,590
Actually, no one really knows
if Holly is a woman or a man.

377
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,330
So, how do you plan
to get Holly on board?

378
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Ms. Kang is right.

379
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,229
It'll be very hard
to get Holly on board.

380
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,199
If we do manage to convince Holly,

381
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,699
it'll be like hitting the jackpot.

382
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,769
Holly likes to stay mysterious
and never reveals herself.

383
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,040
She's never collaborated
with a company before, but...

384
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,540
Even from a marketing perspective,

385
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,780
it's definitely an idea
worth investing in.

386
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,179
All eyes will be on us
if we manage to get Holly on board.

387
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,850
It is a good idea.

388
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,120
Okay. Who wants to tackle this?

389
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,489
I'll do it.

390
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,030
You, Ms. Kang?

391
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,030
I thought you didn't approve
of the suggestion.

392
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,729
We have to convince
an internationally famous designer.

393
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:54,429
Who can do it, if not me?

394
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,009
Oh, Mr. Seo.

395
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,749
We have the photo shoot
for the magazine today.

396
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,689
We're short-staffed on set,

397
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:13,090
so I need you to go there.

398
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,390
Yes,
they already called me about it.

399
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,620
The model had a schedule conflict.

400
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,590
I should go to the shop
and check the dress first.

401
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,259
Okay, please take care of it.

402
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,659
Having you there
will put my mind at ease, Mr. Seo.

403
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,600
Gong Hee,
do you want to come with me?

404
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Me?

405
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,409
- Sure.
- All right.

406
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,550
We waited long enough.

407
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,150
You can't do this
on the day of the photo shoot.

408
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,759
We can't just send the dress...

409
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,290
to the set
without doing the fitting.

410
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,630
Okay, fine.

411
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,130
Come straight to the set, then.

412
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:01,939
What is going on?

413
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,570
The model can't make it?

414
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,110
The drama shoot
got delayed more than expected,

415
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,080
so she can't come here
to do the fitting.

416
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,679
What should we do, then?

417
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:13,310
I was worried
because she'd been putting it off.

418
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:16,179
Let's just send it over to the set.

419
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,080
We'll figure things out there.

420
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,919
We were waiting on the fitting
to do the final touches,

421
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,860
so this dress isn't finished yet.

422
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:29,459
Then...

423
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,560
how about you try it on, Gong Hee?

424
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,530
You're on the design team,
so you trying it on will be helpful.

425
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Me?

426
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,269
How do I look, Mr. Seo?

427
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:09,769
This must look strange.

428
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,239
Oh, my. You look pretty.

429
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
The dress looks great on you.

430
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,620
Gong Hee, do you like the dress?

431
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,459
Yes, it's pretty.

432
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:35,199
When will I get
to try on a dress like this again?

433
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,330
Next time,
I'll prepare a prettier one.

434
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,499
"Next time?"

435
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,390
My goodness.

436
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,189
Who's that?

437
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,810
What do you think about marriage,
Gong Hee?

438
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:22,509
Marriage?

439
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:26,380
I have...

440
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:29,219
a fantasy about marriage.

441
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,689
Some say
marriage is the tomb of love...

442
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,249
and that
it'll destroy your fantasies.

443
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:35,719
I know people say that,

444
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,290
but I think...

445
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,590
marriage...

446
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:43,030
completes your love.

447
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,929
So, you're not against marriage.

448
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,739
Of course, I'm not.
I want to get married.

449
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,409
What about you, Mr. Seo?

450
00:27:58,409 --> 00:27:59,880
I want to get married too.

451
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,449
As soon as possible.

452
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:22,600
(My Merry Marriage)

453
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:25,140
That chauffeur's son is hilarious.

454
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,669
You dumped him,

455
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:28,580
so he's rushing to get married now.

456
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,239
Do you like Min Gi a lot?

457
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,509
Well...

458
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,419
Ssook Ssook wants dessert.

459
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,890
Fine, Seo Min Gi. I surrender.

460
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,050
Let's get married.

461
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,590
I am proposing to you.

462
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,929
I killed someone.

463
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,090
