1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,409
Being betrayed
by someone you trusted.

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,940
Have you all experienced it?

3
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,010
- Yes.
- Of course.

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,680
- I see.
- Yes, by someone I once loved.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,079
Having faith in people.
Trusting someone.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,679
Let's write about that emotion
and what it means to us.

7
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,390
One sentence at a time.

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,189
One by one, release the emotions
you've been repressing for years.

9
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,459
Through that process,
you'll become free.

10
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,090
That's the charm of poetry.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,739
(Trust)

12
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:53,299
Are you...

13
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,210
getting married, Mr. Seo?

14
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:59,780
Is that why you broke up with me?

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,920
My mom told me
that your mother said so.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,890
That you're getting married soon.

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,030
It's too early
to talk about marriage.

18
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,329
But...

19
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,500
I was in a relationship
for a long time.

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,100
I couldn't pull myself together
after we broke up.

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,949
But we've decided
to get back together.

22
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:37,380
Hold on.

23
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,820
You were in a relationship
for a long time?

24
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,889
So, you're now back together...

25
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:44,759
with your ex-girlfriend?

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,029
I didn't know this would happen.

27
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,259
So, I was just a substitute?

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,430
No, it's not like that.

29
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,240
I wouldn't even have faltered
had it been someone else.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,770
Like I said the other day,
just know this one thing.

31
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,339
I was sincere in every moment
I was with you.

32
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,279
But...

33
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,880
"There is poison..."

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,150
"hidden in the word, 'trust.'"

35
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,460
"When you trust someone,"

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,520
"the pain of wanting
to know the truth kills you."

37
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,630
"When you don't trust someone,"

38
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,960
"the pain of not being able to trust
kills you."

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,999
"So, I choose to trust."

40
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:34,309
"I choose to trust
and feel optimistic..."

41
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,409
"rather than distrust
and feel like a wreck."

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,319
Everything you've said
and done for me.

43
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,589
I will believe
that you really meant it.

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,460
If not,

45
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,159
even the excitement I felt...

46
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,930
will be tarnished.

47
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,939
Gong Hee, you are...

48
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,839
the strongest
and kindest person I know.

49
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,779
I hope we can stay...

50
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,039
as good colleagues
who help and support each other.

51
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,789
I think I got my closure.

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,430
Let's end things on good terms.

53
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,629
(Entrance Pass)

54
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,339
It's okay.

55
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,170
It's all okay.

56
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,539
- What's okay?
- My gosh. Hey.

57
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,080
Why are you here?

58
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,879
I'm working too.

59
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:25,719
Why do you keep seeing me
when I'm in a weird state?

60
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,619
You're always weird.

61
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:29,990
It's nothing special.

62
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,119
But...

63
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:35,029
it looks like you're heartbroken.

64
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,400
Heartbroken? As if.

65
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,270
You did break up, though.

66
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,700
Are you okay?

67
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,609
Of course. I have to be.

68
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,810
As if.

69
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,810
You liked Seo Min Gi a lot.

70
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,909
You used to cry
for three days and nights...

71
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,320
just because
you lost a toy you liked.

72
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,020
Forget it. Anyway,

73
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:04,390
I had a nice dream for a while.

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,260
I should just work hard now.

75
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,630
I'll forget about everything...

76
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,460
and keep working hard
to become a permanent employee.

77
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,599
Let's go.

78
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,239
Just be sad for three days
this time too.

79
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,279
And then, please look at me.

80
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,080
Gosh, this face is one...

81
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,620
that you just can't forget about,
no matter how hard you try.

82
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,320
"If it hurts to trust..."

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,089
"and also not to trust,"

84
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,089
"I choose to trust
with my own free will."

85
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,460
This poem uses the word "trust"
to portray growth.

86
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,690
Ms. Kang Myung Ja.

87
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,000
That was great.

88
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,239
- You did so well.
- Congratulations.

89
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,510
You're practically a poet now.

90
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,839
Yes, Joo Ri?

91
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,010
I will read mine too.

92
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,010
Sure.

93
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,620
It's obvious.

94
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,690
"If you tell me to, I will believe."

95
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,390
"If you tell me to believe."

96
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,289
"I will believe you
even if I miss you."

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,429
- There she goes again.
- "I will believe you,"

98
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,599
"even if I long for you."

99
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,539
"On a night, where I yearn for you."

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,940
"In the starlight..."

101
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,409
I can't stand this anymore.
Excuse me...

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Mr. Ryu.

103
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:34,909
Yes?

104
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,820
I don't think it's right...

105
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,989
to steal someone's lyrics
in this sacred poetry workshop.

106
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,289
What are you saying?

107
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,690
What ridiculous slander.

108
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,070
If you tell me to, I will forget

109
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,039
If you tell me to forget

110
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,570
Indeed.

111
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,339
I knew it.

112
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:06,380
I know, right?

113
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,310
All you did was change
a single word.

114
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,650
Please stop stealing poetry,
will you?

115
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,549
She does this every time.

116
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:16,620
I know.

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,089
Believe, my foot.

118
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,529
Who would believe her?

119
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,969
I've been meaning to say this
for a while now.

120
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,870
Will you please not linger around
the poetry workshop?

121
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,070
Do I need your permission
to attend the poetry workshop?

122
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,640
Hey, do you think I'm keeping
my mouth shut because I don't know?

123
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,049
You're the daughter of Madam Yang,
the owner of Night Fog.

124
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,520
You vulgar thing. How dare you?

125
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,849
You're the one who's vulgar.

126
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,859
You keep stealing poetry.

127
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,620
You should be embarrassed.

128
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,729
Why, you little...

129
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,729
You're making me get physical,
aren't you?

130
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,400
Hey, Jung Ssang Sook.

131
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:05,140
What do you think you're doing?

132
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,270
What's wrong with you?

133
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,609
This woman is overstepping...

134
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,810
and tattling on me
that I plagiarized or whatever!

135
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,479
Hey, if Audrey had said nothing,

136
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,109
I would've said something!

137
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,210
Hey, you should watch out.

138
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,479
Don't let this woman steal
your husband from you.

139
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,289
You know I have a good hunch
when it comes to that area, right?

140
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,719
Keep that in mind, all right?

141
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,359
Why, that...

142
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,529
(Chairwoman's Office)

143
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,940
Tell the chairwoman
when you go to work.

144
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,570
Tell her that you won't go ahead...

145
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:43,440
with the engagement with Dan Soo.

146
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,779
Yes?

147
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,850
Mom, why are you...

148
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:58,559
You're here.

149
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,860
I had her come in
to set a date for your engagement.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,699
I came to tell you something, ma'am.

151
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:10,929
What is it about?

152
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,510
The engagement with Dan Soo...

153
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,510
Ma'am!

154
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,380
Let me borrow Ji Na for a moment.

155
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,620
I forgot to tell her something.

156
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,390
Let go of me!
I didn't even say anything yet.

157
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,500
Do you think I don't know you?

158
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,900
If I hadn't caught on
and dragged you out,

159
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,569
what would you have done?

160
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,799
Mom,
do you want to see me go insane?

161
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,779
Did you shake up Ji Na?

162
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,620
Why is she suddenly
acting like this?

163
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,090
I don't know what this is about,

164
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,090
but don't do this at the office.
Let's talk outside.

165
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,090
Today,

166
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:11,760
we set the date for Ji Na
and Dan Soo's engagement ceremony.

167
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,299
But I don't know
what's gotten into her.

168
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:18,240
She was trying to break things off
as if she had no fear.

169
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,470
If that's Ji Na's choice,

170
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,140
can't you try to understand her too?

171
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,150
Look at you.

172
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:32,079
Mom, stop this.

173
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:33,579
You.

174
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,390
You think you know Ji Na best,
don't you?

175
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,520
You're wrong.

176
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,630
I gave birth to Ji Na,

177
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,459
and I raised her myself.

178
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,600
She may ask for you now
since she's not thinking straight.

179
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,270
But what do you think
she'll be like once you're married?

180
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,169
We will live...

181
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:55,669
She will regret it,
hate you, and resent you.

182
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,010
Are you sure
you can handle that nightmare?

183
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,909
Are you prepared
to be treated like that?

184
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,919
We decided to get back together
because it was what Ji Na wanted.

185
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,250
Oh, is that right?

186
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,760
Then go to the chairwoman's office
this instant.

187
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:14,529
Go ahead and tell her.

188
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,630
That you have another man...

189
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,029
and that you'll break off
the engagement.

190
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,510
Let's talk later.

191
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,079
Let's go.

192
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,020
I said, let's go.

193
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,860
(Tiffany Alterations)

194
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,959
It was really her?

195
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,500
The woman I saw
20 years ago in Kkotsan?

196
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,669
Goodness, she was right next door,

197
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:58,340
but we went looking for her
all across the country.

198
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:01,470
I'm sorry
for putting you through that.

199
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,240
You've worked hard.

200
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,610
That wasn't hard at all.

201
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,809
You're the one who went through
so much distress.

202
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:11,449
You should put aside
all of your burdens...

203
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,020
and pass on everything
you have to tell her.

204
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,850
I want to tell her everything.

205
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,590
But the doctor says
that she's in really bad condition.

206
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,789
She can't handle
any kind of shock now.

207
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:25,730
I'm just waiting for the right time.

208
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,000
I should tell her soon, though.

209
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,600
But besides that, I'm more worried
about something else now.

210
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,640
I heard there were people
who threatened her to leave.

211
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,779
Goodness, what if she has to leave
her child again because of that?

212
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,949
What rotten people they are.

213
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,409
- Bye.
- See you later.

214
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,020
- Gyeong Tae.
- What?

215
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,120
What are you doing over there?

216
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,250
- Oh, well...
- Hey.

217
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,150
Is that you, Detective An?

218
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,890
You finished early today.

219
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,459
Oh, hello.

220
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,970
What brings you here, Detective An?

221
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,270
I came to see Gyeong Tae.

222
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,299
I heard you had a bad cold.

223
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:09,240
You look totally fine.

224
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,850
Gosh, turn that way.

225
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,449
Goodness, you're in a bad state.

226
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,679
Now, I understand why
you had to make porridge for him.

227
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,120
What porridge?

228
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:23,819
What? You nearly died?

229
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:25,289
Yes, I almost did.

230
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:26,289
Oh, that...

231
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,959
Oh, my. You two have
such a beautiful friendship.

232
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,799
They say those who take care of us
when we're sick...

233
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,059
are the truest of friends.

234
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,270
Yes, that's right.

235
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,169
Since you're here,
you should have some dumplings.

236
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,779
I'm sure we froze some
to make dumpling soup.

237
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,740
Then, let me burden you a little...

238
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:49,350
Hey.

239
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,579
Hey, go.

240
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,850
Well, I want some dumplings.

241
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,120
Yes, you should be able to eat
what you want when you want it.

242
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,390
- Go on in.
- Really?

243
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,860
Yes, it's fine. Let's go inside.

244
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,730
- Thank you.
- No problem. Come on.

245
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,789
- Hey, goodness.
- All right, then.

246
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:06,159
- See you later.
- All right, see you.

247
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:09,699
Should I go this way or...

248
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,230
This way?

249
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:14,669
Well...

250
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,370
Oh, one moment.

251
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,640
- My goodness.
- I didn't want my wife...

252
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,179
to get the wrong idea,

253
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:22,949
so I gave her some excuses.

254
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,549
Thank you for looking out for me.

255
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:29,189
For sending Dan Soo here
the other day too.

256
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,419
Oh, that's no big deal.

257
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,220
Seriously, thank you so much.

258
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,459
Here.

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,100
Did you bring your handcuffs?

260
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Sorry?

261
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,510
She tells this joke all the time.
Don't mind her.

262
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,679
You won't know
if the person next to you dies...

263
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,209
from how good this is.

264
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:56,809
It might turn into a murder case.
So, here.

265
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:57,809
Oh, I see.

266
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:00,819
There.

267
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,120
How are you so close with your wife?

268
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,819
I heard
you gave your wife your cold...

269
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,029
- while kissing her.
- What?

270
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,829
But I don't have a wife.

271
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,429
Sorry? What did you say?

272
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:19,039
We got a divorce five years ago.

273
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:20,699
My goodness.

274
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,020
Why do you keep calling me here?

275
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,350
I'm busy too.

276
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,319
Move back home.

277
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,189
You're at it again.

278
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,189
I will not move back home.
How many times must I say this?

279
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,260
Just listen to me
and move back home.

280
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,699
Do as I say.

281
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,000
Grandma.

282
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,029
Why are you doing this?

283
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,100
You need to get ready
for your engagement ceremony.

284
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,039
You must move back home
to prepare...

285
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,870
for the announcement that
you're the heir to Jayce Group.

286
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,740
The date has been set
for your engagement ceremony.

287
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,909
The date for what?

288
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,949
You've made up your mind,
so we should get it done right away.

289
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:06,650
I can't wait any longer.

290
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,419
It bothers me
that you're still living there,

291
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,620
so just move back home.

292
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:12,020
I don't want you to meet
some weirdo...

293
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,029
and get bogged down.
I can't let that happen.

294
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,929
What are you talking about?

295
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,429
I told you loud and clear.
I won't get married.

296
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:20,699
Let me decide what I want!

297
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:21,929
Not a chance.

298
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,630
I wanted you
to get engaged right away...

299
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,939
and have your wedding ceremony
immediately after that,

300
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:29,309
but I figured
Ji Na would have a lot to prepare,

301
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:31,110
so I'm being patient.
Just know that.

302
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,579
Grandma! I told you.

303
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:35,110
There's someone I like!

304
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,750
And have you told her how you feel?

305
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,819
No, not yet.
I can't really tell her yet.

306
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,220
That's good.
Then you two aren't meant to be.

307
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:49,390
You told me
that you liked this girl,

308
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,130
so I was curious
to find out about her family.

309
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,900
But you say
you haven't even told her,

310
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,730
which tells me
I don't need to worry about her.

311
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,740
Grandma!

312
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,510
"Grandma?"

313
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,709
Director Lee.

314
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,720
You must keep this to yourself.

315
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,189
Do you understand?

316
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,850
Do you think I gave my grandson...

317
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,289
a bottom-ranking position
for no reason?

318
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,090
I did it for a reason,

319
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,830
so take good care of him.

320
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:26,459
Okay?

321
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Yes, ma'am.

322
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,739
I had no idea. My sincere apologies.

323
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,840
You shouldn't have kicked him
in the shin.

324
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,780
You aren't in the military.

325
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,909
Seeing you being so harsh
on my grandson...

326
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:42,509
made me feel...

327
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:44,209
It made me upset.

328
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,019
I sincerely apologize, ma'am.

329
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:50,390
I promise you it won't happen again.

330
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,790
Grandma,
that wasn't the only time he hit me.

331
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:56,229
He hit me here. Here and here too!

332
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,860
It still hurts.

333
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,979
If I've upset you in any way,

334
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:17,280
please forgive me.

335
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,479
I only did it because I truly cared
for you as your superior...

336
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,290
If you care for me any more
than you already do,

337
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,689
I'll end up having to wear a cast.

338
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,120
What? Why would you say that?

339
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,530
I'm at your command, sir.

340
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,769
Promise me one thing.

341
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,540
Sure, anything. Just tell me.

342
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,709
For the time being,
keep it to yourself.

343
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,880
Don't you worry, sir.

344
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,850
And talk to me like you used to.

345
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,979
- Sure thing, sir...
- You did it again!

346
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,749
I meant to say, "Got it."

347
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,390
Good. You're quick-witted.

348
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,959
I'm in trouble now.

349
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
What?

350
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:09,929
Don't follow me.

351
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,909
Why is it that
this wants to break up with me too?

352
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:24,409
What's wrong?

353
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,820
The heel broke. What should I do?

354
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,219
Hey, what do you do
with your paycheck?

355
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,219
Buy yourself a new pair of shoes.

356
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,659
I'm struggling to pay back
the interest on the loan.

357
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,090
What loan?

358
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,900
Because of the rent
for my brother's clinic...

359
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:44,300
Well, hey. Just go
and do what you need to do.

360
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,100
Go.

361
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,110
Hey!

362
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,540
How dare you!

363
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:53,409
Hey!

364
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,620
As co-workers,
you guys should get along.

365
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,159
Don't fight.

366
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:06,959
Okay.

367
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
- What?
- Goodness.

368
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,030
He's so kind.

369
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Thank you for the food, Myung Ja.

370
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,100
(Maeng Dumplings)

371
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,040
Come straight here
whenever you're in the mood...

372
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,209
for some dumplings.

373
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:26,179
Next time,
I'll come with a real cop...

374
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,140
and real handcuffs.

375
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,610
Oh, my goodness.

376
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,949
All right, get going. I'll call you.

377
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:38,189
Okay. Bye, Gyeong Tae.

378
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,530
Get back inside.

379
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,699
Goodness. So?
Have you chosen your gravesite?

380
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,499
Hey, let's go in together.

381
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,840
What's with you?

382
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,340
You must accept your punishment.

383
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,810
Even if you show up
with your attorney,

384
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,080
- Kang Myung Ja won't even budge.
- Oh, dear.

385
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,650
Shall we just talk here?

386
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,390
You'd better tell me the truth.

387
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,650
What did you say
about Detective An's wife?

388
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,759
Detective An said he got a divorce.

389
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,790
He said he and his wife split up
five years ago.

390
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,929
Why did you lie to me? Why?

391
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:22,669
Well, that was...

392
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:26,600
Detective An never told me
he got a divorce.

393
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,239
Okay, you didn't know.
But why did you lie?

394
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:32,209
You made that porridge.
Who on earth was it for?

395
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,509
You cooked the porridge,

396
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,110
but no one got it?

397
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,350
He had a cold? As if.

398
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,009
Clearly, he's very healthy.

399
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:42,120
Yes, he ate ten plates of dumplings.

400
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,759
He finished
a plate full of dumplings at once.

401
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,090
My goodness.

402
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:51,830
Who on earth was that porridge for?

403
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,130
You won't tell me?

404
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm pleading the Fifth.

405
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Pleading the Fifth, my foot.

406
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,040
Come inside. Now!

407
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,840
I will put an end to this today.

408
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,140
Oh, boy.

409
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,850
My goodness. Where are you going?

410
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,820
What? Do you even have a place to go
if you run away?

411
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,790
Seriously,
you know Myung Ja's temper.

412
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,390
Oh, dear.

413
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,259
It's not like you threw away
the porridge you made.

414
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,659
Who ate it?

415
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,199
Hurry up and come inside!

416
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:35,610
Hey, look for a funeral home.

417
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,610
Will do.

418
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:39,780
I hope you come out in one piece.

419
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,009
My goodness.

420
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:45,380
He said he'd bring real handcuffs
next time. Oh, my.

421
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,120
(Holly's philosophy, Holly)

422
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,919
Poor countries.

423
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:56,060
Donating children's clothing.

424
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,929
"You're not alone."

425
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,630
The fashion designer no one has met.

426
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:10,110
What are some key points
I can use...

427
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,739
to convince Holly?

428
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:23,719
What is this?

429
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,459
You should wear nice shoes.

430
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:35,999
You have external meetings often.

431
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:38,939
Hey, you said you were broke.
What is this?

432
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,540
I found them on the street.
Are we good now?

433
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,840
Hey, why did you... My gosh.

434
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,479
Hey.

435
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,810
How did you know my shoe size?

436
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:52,580
How could I not know?

437
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,150
You're always throwing kicks at me.

438
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,120
My gosh.

439
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,390
Oh, my.

440
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:02,989
Grandma.

441
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,900
I've fallen for her so deeply now.

442
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:10,669
Whenever I look at her,
I feel like I'm in a daze.

443
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,900
How could I get engaged
to anyone else in this state?

444
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,340
They look good on me, right?

445
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Yes.

446
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,310
Should we sing
the congratulatory song ourselves?

447
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,850
- Yes, sounds good.
- Okay.

448
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:24,909
Oh, right.

449
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,419
By the way, let's ask
my boss at work to be our officiant.

450
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,219
Didn't you hate the guy?

451
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,590
Come on. You don't know
how to get ahead in society, do you?

452
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,259
Do you want to get a promotion
through our wedding?

453
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,630
Okay. You take care
of the officiant, then.

454
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:45,030
By the way, what will we do
about our newlywed home?

455
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,239
It'll be hard to move
south of the Han River, right?

456
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,909
I don't expect that much either.

457
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:50,870
It's not like I don't know
your financial situation.

458
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:55,110
But still, I hope
it's not too far from my office.

459
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:57,810
We're already set
on our newlywed home.

460
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,150
Oh, my. Already?

461
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,949
Yes. Right here.

462
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
Right here?

463
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:08,630
Right here, where?

464
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,630
We have a home right here
for the two of us... I mean,

465
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:13,800
our home for the three of us,
including Ssook Ssook.

466
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:16,729
Our home?

467
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,600
So, you mean, my place?

468
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,570
This house?

469
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,169
Yes.

470
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,939
Goodness, you know,

471
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,909
I really love this house so much.

472
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,909
Whenever I come here,
it feels so cozy.

473
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,080
I feel so at home here.

474
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,749
You really have a good eye
for what's to come, sweetie.

475
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,189
Figures. That's how
you found yourself a man like me.

476
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:41,189
Hey!

477
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,330
Gosh, seriously... Why, you...

478
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:45,830
I really should just... Seriously!

479
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,830
Oh, thank you.

480
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,130
That's nice.

481
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,140
How infuriating.

482
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,739
Have you still not found out
where Gyeong Tae's porridge went?

483
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,050
You're a detective's wife.
Where did all your skills go?

484
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,850
He must have
another junior officer somewhere.

485
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,880
He's a pro at giving things away.

486
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:12,719
Your brother isn't one to go astray.

487
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:13,919
I trust him.

488
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,959
If you get stabbed in the back
by someone you trust,

489
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:20,229
your heart is bound to hurt more
than your back itself.

490
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,900
Your brother isn't the problem
right now.

491
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:24,699
I'm so worried about Gong Boo.

492
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,540
Where will they live
once they get married?

493
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:29,640
What can you do?
We have to work with what we've got.

494
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,810
Even if we can't buy them a house,

495
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,310
we should at least give them
some decent wedding presents.

496
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,709
Since we don't have any money,

497
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,350
we can't be cool parents either.

498
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,110
Wedding presents?

499
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,590
You have that jade ring, don't you?

500
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:44,590
You know, the one you inherited.

501
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,189
Oh, my ring.

502
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,590
Right, I have the jade ring.

503
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,890
That's right.

504
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:54,400
Even though my mom went on and on
about how she didn't like you,

505
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,030
she still gave you that ring.

506
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,269
That ring has a long history.

507
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:04,840
My mom got that from my grandma too.

508
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,840
Will young people like such things,
though?

509
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,979
That's why I didn't even give it
to Soo Yeon.

510
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:12,949
Hong Dan seemed different
from Soo Yeon.

511
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,189
She kind of looks old-fashioned.

512
00:27:16,189 --> 00:27:17,189
I'm sure she'll like it.

513
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:18,189
You think so?

514
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,860
Where did I put that thing?

515
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,439
I haven't taken it out in so long...

516
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,439
that I can barely remember
where I put it.

517
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:45,449
What?

518
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:48,449
What's this?

519
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:52,919
This isn't the ring case
where I keep my jade ring.

520
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,459
What is this?

521
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:02,669
Goodness.

522
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:04,769
Did you find it?

523
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,640
What? Oh, my!

524
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,909
Isn't this a diamond ring?

525
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,509
A diamond ring?

526
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:17,110
It's not like the jade ring
became a diamond.

527
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:19,120
What is this doing here?

528
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,530
(My Merry Marriage)

529
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,600
She offered to buy
brand new furniture.

530
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,269
And she'll buy the jewelry
as their wedding present.

531
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:40,840
It's not like we can come
and live here.

532
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,439
You don't have to get us anything.

533
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:45,239
But still, I can't believe
she said yes right away.

534
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:47,409
I guess I should wear shoes
that suit me.

535
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,810
