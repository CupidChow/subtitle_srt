This is halibut fin.

4
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,319
I know you like this.

5
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,159
Oh, was it your girlfriend
who liked it?

6
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,299
How come
you didn't come together today?

7
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:27,910
Is it that good?

8
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,920
Yes.

9
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,679
The art of sushi
always fascinates me.

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,850
The taste is determined
by the skills...

11
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,020
of the person who makes it
rather than the price of the fish.

12
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,889
Isn't it so interesting?

13
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,690
My gosh. Thank you.

14
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,190
You make amazing sushi.

15
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,730
I'll be sad if this taste changes.

16
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,969
Okay, I'll remember that.

17
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,679
Could I get some to go?

18
00:01:59,949 --> 00:02:02,020
This is an important opportunity
for me.

19
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,490
She and I are the two finalists.

20
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,589
That alone makes my heart flutter.

21
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,289
Then you can work all night
just until today.

22
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,000
When you're done,
we'll go and see the stars.

23
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,429
Okay? Please.

24
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:23,869
Okay, we will go.

25
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:25,339
You promised me.

26
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,709
All right.

27
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:31,740

28

29
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,649
What? What do the stars
have to do with tteokbokki?

30
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:41,750
Come on. Some tteokbokki places
use star-shaped rice cakes.

31
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,330
I'm really craving tteokbokki now.
Super spicy tteokbokki.

32
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,990
You'll ruin your stomach
at that rate.

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,399
That's not a problem
if you train yourself.

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,030
You shouldn't just lie around in bed
in the morning.

35
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,199
Come out and hit the punching bag.

36
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,569
You're such a weakling.

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,370
Goodness,
who would want to marry you?

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,109
Gosh, what a bother.
She wants spicy food at night?

39
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,919
What a nuisance.

40
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,519
What?

41
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,130
I guess you're heading home now.

42
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,970
Yes. What about you, Dan Soo?
Are you going somewhere?

43
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,370
I came out to get some tteokbokki.
Super spicy tteokbokki.

44

45
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:37,680
Gosh, I don't understand
why she loves spicy food so much.

46
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,019
Well, I should hurry
before the snack house closes.

47
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,720
All right. Bye, Dan Soo.

48
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,319
Get home safely.

49

50
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,269
Make me some tteokbokki.

51
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,609
Give me a few minutes.
Let me unpack first, okay?

52
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,109
But I want it now.

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,049
Okay, all right.

54
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,380

and make it for you.

but I couldn't even make it for you.

74

Well, remember the place
where I dropped you off...

75
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,270
when I gave you a ride
that one time?

76

78

why he came here.

121
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,320
And why would Min Gi buy
Maeng Gong Hee sushi at this hour?

Think of this as a test
to see if your baby is healthy.

183
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,930
Don't feel too overwhelmed.

184
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,399
- Okay.
- All right.

185
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,460

Mommy met you too late.

188
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,779
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,680
I looked it up,

190
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:11,450
and there are so many things
to be careful with as an older mom.

191
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,119
What if you get sick because of me?

192
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,359

And what if I lose you, Ssook Ssook?

195
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:26,769
I'm so scared.

196
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,070
Were you thinking about these things
by yourself?

197
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,769
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

afraid of being alone.

Tell me.

The heart is beating strong.

221
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,710
Last time,
the heartbeat was very weak,

222
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,050
so we thought
she might have a miscarriage,

223
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:52,119
but the baby is healthy
and breathing well.

224
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,489

the heartbeat?

267

are you and Gong Hee dating?

268
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,199
I heard you two were friends
growing up.

269
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,399
I guess you even know
where she lives.

270
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,280
Just answer my question.

It's not what you think.

273

I only stopped by
to give her a pep talk.

00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:51,389
She has a presentation today.

275
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,790

276
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,500
Of course. I knew it.

277
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:00,699
But why were you curious about it?

What?

I almost got the wrong idea.

284
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:16,980
I should get back to work.

285
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,429
I focused on the everydayness
of the design and...

286
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,139
You have your presentation.
Shouldn't you get going?

287
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,340
I'm so nervous right now.

288
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:41,669
Can I really pull this off?

289

Are you asking me for help?

290
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,909
Why? Do you have
some pointers for me?

291
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,719
Just focus on
what you want to deliver.

292
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,689
What?
But I already have this script.

293
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:56,889
I'm talking about your heart,
not your words.

294
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,389
What was the inspiration
behind your design?

295
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:04,060
What motivated you
to do the presentation?

296
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,629
- Stuff like that.
- Come on.

297
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:07,270
Do you really think that will work?

298
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,669
Ms. Kang is well-spoken,
on top of everything else.

299
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:12,199
Why would you try to beat
an eloquent speaker with words?

300
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,570
Fight her using your own weapon.

301
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,139
My weapon?

302
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,310
My fist?

303
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:19,780
Your sincerity.

304
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:25,020
I bet no one can beat you
on that front.

305
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,689
Remember what you told me?

306
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,790
The reason you have to work
for Jayce Fashion.

307
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,659
If this strategy works,

308
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:32,619
it'll be stronger
than your steel fist.

309
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,159
My sincerity?

310
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:36,760
I'll give you energy...

311
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,560
so you can win.

312
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,699

313
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,310
You wouldn't be Gu Dan Soo
if you didn't act silly.

314
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,240
Anyway, thanks for your advice.

315
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,679
If you want to thank me,
just keep your promise.

316
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:54,649
What promise?

317
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:56,280
You've forgotten all about it?

318
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,179
We said we'd go and see the stars
when it was over.

319
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:01,350
What's with this sudden obsession
with the stars?

320
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,619
Sincerity.

321
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,629
Sincerity.

322
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Sincerity.

323
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,040
I tried making some pork cutlets
with sirloin.

324
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,070
This is sausage stir-fry.

325
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,240
And this is seasoned dried squid.

326
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,010
I made it pretty sweet.

327
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,280
Goodness. What's with you,
showing up with these side dishes?

328
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,980
You never cook at home
since you live alone.

329
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,679
You said
you lived off our dumplings.

330
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:35,790
Well, I just...

331
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,859
It seems that
Myung Ja is quite busy these days,

332
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:41,889
and you said
you were renting out that room,

333
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,399
so I wanted to help out a little.

334
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,770
My goodness.
No matter how busy we are,

335
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,500
we will be sure to make time
to feed that boarder upstairs.

336
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,139
Seriously, you worry too much.

337
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,439
What is this?

338
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,010
Let me see.

339
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,639
Oh, my. This is tteokbokki.

340
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,010
I think Dan Soo likes it.

341
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,179
How do you know that he likes this?

342
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:11,020
Oh, I saw him buying tteokbokki
the other day.

343
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:15,790
I'm telling you. You should change
your name to Ms. Oh So Nosy.

344
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,760
By the way, Gyeong Bok,

345
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:21,230
you said...

346
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,740
Dan Soo had no parents, right?

347
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,139
That's right. His mother ran away
when he was very young.

348
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,840
Even Myung Ja never met her.

349
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:32,379
I see. Then what about his father?

350
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,850
His father? I have no idea.

351
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:37,619
I wasn't living with my brother
and his family back then.

352
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,919
I met Dan Soo for the first time
when he was all grown up.

353
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,219
- Then...
- Goodness.

354
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:43,760
If you're done here, leave already.

355
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,159
Myung Ja isn't here,
so I have a lot to do.

356
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,959
Then Dan Soo's father...

357
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,060
Like I said, I don't know! Go.

358
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,330
Leave, will you? My goodness.

359
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:56,230
- What's going on?
- Myung Ja, you're here.

360
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,199
I told you to leave.
Why are you still here?

361
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,169
All right. I'll come back later.

362
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,909
My goodness.

363
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:05,709
Oh, boy.

364
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,679
So? You went to the clinic, right?

365
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,119
- The baby is okay, right?
- Yes.

366
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,919
Hey, why did you kick Audrey out?

367
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,090
Well,
she is hiding from all of us...

368
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,389
that her mom was the owner
of Cafe Night Fog.

369
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,090
So, why is she digging up
others' secrets?

370
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,300
I'm telling you. She really irks me.

371
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:27,169
Hey! Do you think
I'm joking with you?

372
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,500
What is going on?

373
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,070
I said the other day...

374
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,939
that there was a tornado coming.

375
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,770
Anyway, because of Audrey,

376
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,379
not a day goes by quietly
in this neighborhood. Oh, boy.

377
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:40,649
Oh, dear.

378
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:44,020
I warned you, didn't I?

379
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,780
Did you not hear what I said?

380
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,790
After being humiliated like that,

381
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,520
how could you flirt
with my husband again?

382
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,159
Watch what you say.

383
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,389
If you didn't flirt with them,
then what happened?

384
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,030
How come all the men keep going in
and out of your shop?

385
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,159
It's not the only alternation shop
in the area!

386
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:58,560
I run a business.

387
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,629
Isn't it my job to help
the customers who come to me?

388
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,240
How could I kick out my customers?

389
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,840
It runs in your blood.

390
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,740
Seducing men is the only thing
you know how to do.

391
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,010
Did you see it?

392
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,310
Did you actually see me
seducing someone?

393
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,250
You are Madam Yang's daughter.

394
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,850
If you're not, just say so! Okay?

395
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:25,020
Yes, I am Madam Yang's daughter.

396
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,689
Finally, you are admitting it.

397
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:31,899
But no one here has the right
to kick me out.

398
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,800
Are you all that anxious?

399
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:37,270
Because you think a mere seamstress
might steal your husband?

400
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,010
What? This woman
still hasn't learned her lesson.

401
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,270
- What are you doing?
- Goodness.

402
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,609
Look at you ladies ganging up
on her.

403
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,310
Aren't you embarrassed?

404
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,750
Myung Ja, you shouldn't stop us.

405
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,689
I know your husband
has been visiting her shop too.

406
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:55,919
Yes, to get his clothes fixed.

407
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,490
Why else?

408
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:00,429
Don't falsely accuse her like this.

409
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,090
Audrey would never do such a thing.

410
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,030
She doesn't deserve
to be treated like this.

411
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,230
Unbelievable.

412
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,169
Get up. Let's go back to my shop.

413
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,469
Oh, dear. Come on.

414
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,570
Where are you going?
We must put an end to this!

415
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,909
Stop!

416
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,550
It's break time.

417
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,560
- Goodness.
- But why?

418
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,699
Goodness gracious.

419
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:48,639
Myung Ja.

420
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:51,909
I have something to ask you.

421
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:59,719
About Dan Soo, the young man
staying in your house...

422
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,560
Dan Soo? What about him?

423
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:05,959
What is the story...

424
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,730
behind Dan Soo wandering around
without any parents?

425
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:13,060
I heard that he didn't have a mom...

426
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,730
because she ran away.

427
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,570
But what about his father?

428
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,510
Why isn't his father around?

429
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,480
Why are you curious about that?

430
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,750
You came in
from being beaten up just now.

431
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
I just think...

432
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,189
I might be able to help if I knew.

433
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,800
Last time,
he collapsed on the street,

434
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:49,169
and he refused to go
to the hospital.

435
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,000
I felt so bad for him.

436
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Still,

437
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,280
it's not easy
to talk about it lightly.

438
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,740
It's not a happy story.

439
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,149
Some relatives took Dan Soo in...

440
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:05,820
when he was young.

441
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,619
But I guess they sent him away
once he grew up.

442
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:13,830
Then, does that mean
Dan Soo's father...

443
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,230
is no longer here?

444
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,199
What's this? Tell us the truth.

445
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,639
Do you know Dan Soo's father?

446
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,939
Go on and say so if you don't!

447
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,379
You keep going on about
Dan Soo's father.

448
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:36,080
You're being such a nuisance!

449
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,219
It's just strange.

450
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,679
Do you have some kind of...

451
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,590
weird relationship
with Dan Soo's father?

452
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:43,719
Goodness, Gyeong Bok.

453
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,419
Just go inside
and make the dumplings.

454
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:49,389
I mean, she keeps
her secrets all to herself,

455
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:51,959
so why does she keep asking
about someone else's secrets?

456
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,760
(My Merry Marriage)

457
00:28:26,969 --> 00:28:28,969
Why is Geon staying here?

458
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,139
Why is he living apart
from Hae Joon?

459
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:33,810
What's this? I grabbed it first.

460
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,570
You'd better let it go.

461
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,010
I'm saying this for your sake, lady.

462
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,740
I'm Kang Ji Na,

463
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:42,050
the Design Manager
of the Future Strategy TF Team.

464
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,409
I'm Maeng Gong Hee.

465
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,449
Someone just said this to me.

466
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,189
"Deliver your sincerity."
