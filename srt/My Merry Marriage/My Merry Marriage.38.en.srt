1
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,319
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,300
Where is she?

3
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:31,599
Is she here?

4
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:35,700
You're so greedy.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,310
When will we get to go on dates?

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,880
I should work hard to do that too.

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,430
Maeng Gong Hee.

8
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,579
What are you...

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,990
doing up there, Maeng Gong Hee?

10
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,759
In Min Gi's arms.

11
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,999
Those two are really dating?

12
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,999
It's not what you think.

13
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,469
I only stopped by
to give her a pep talk.

14
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,210
Then...

15
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:48,609
why did Min Gi...

16
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,479
say that?

17
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,660
You have to keep your promise.

18
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,330
I really wasn't going
to push it like this,

19
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,130
but judging by the state
Dan Soo is in now,

20
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,100
I don't think it'd be a bad idea
to put a rush on it.

21
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,169
I never imagined
he'd fall for someone else.

22
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,009
Yes, come in.

23
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,169
Hi.

24
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,080
Mom, what are you doing here?

25
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,349
It's not like
I'm not allowed to come here.

26
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,450
Come on.
What's with you, acting like...

27
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,789
you've just seen a ghost?

28
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,789
- Take a seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

29
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,089
Your mother said
something interesting.

30
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,559
You know, about the blind contest.

31
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,869
All the executives quite liked
the intern's design,

32
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,339
and I must say I agree with them.

33
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,710
Do you plan to announce
that Maeng Gong Hee is the winner?

34
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,050
She is very thoughtful.

35
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,210
More importantly,
she's a sincere person.

36
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,849
You see, that's what touches
people's hearts.

37
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:06,219
That's what moves people.

38
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,319
I was thinking it'd be nice
to make her a permanent employee...

39
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,390
and have her work under you.

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
But that's...

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,869
Isn't it too embarrassing?

42
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,569
You're the manager of the team.

43
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,439
If you don't win the contest,

44
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,339
people will talk behind your back.

45
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,140
Did my mom...

46
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,539
ask you for a favor?

47
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,339
My goodness.

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,580
Watch what you say. "A favor?"

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,080
Hey, are you trying
to get me into trouble?

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,249
I don't want people to gossip,

51
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,420
so I wasn't going to do it.

52
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:42,589
As Ms. Hwang's future in-law,
I can give her advice.

53
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,159
That girl is a mere intern.
There's nothing wrong...

54
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,930
with looking out
for her future granddaughter-in-law.

55
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,200
I suggested the two of you
make it official and get married.

56
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,939
Of course, she's on board.

57
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,110
- Have some tea.
- Yes, thank you.

58
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,480
Don't cry for me

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,619
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

60
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,089
Don't be sad for me

61
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,789
It's still pretty early.

62
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,460
Don't look at me like that

63
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,230
You look like
you've lost all meaning to life

64
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,140
That look on your face

65
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,409
- Don't love me
- Oh, hello!

66
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:40,049
It's too late

67
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,650
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

68
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,890
Don't wait for me

69
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,320
- With bated breath
- We're not open yet,

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,690
but you can order
anything you'd like.

71
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,159
What would you like?

72
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,859
Last time, I left suddenly
without even ordering anything.

73
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:54,859
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,830
What do you recommend for food?

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,799
Well, like my sister said,

76
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,870
the menu is full
of amazingly tasty dishes...

77
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,770
that would even make
two best friends fight over them.

78
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Just order what you like.

79
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,039
I'll let you pick something for me.

80
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,349
By the way,
is something up with Dan Soo?

81
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,580
Shouldn't he be at work now?

82
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,950
I know, right?

83
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,349
He showed up earlier in the day
and pestered me to let him in.

84
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,489
And he's been singing nonstop
since he got here.

85
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,089
I guess he's feeling
very sentimental today.

86
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,460
His singing has never made me
feel this gloomy before.

87
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,429
What is with him?

88
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,770
Just like you
when you said goodbye to me

89
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,409
With a smile on your face

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,049
Dan Soo, please join me.

91
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:52,719
Come and sit here.

92
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,700
Hey, give me the booze
you've been keeping for me.

93
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,500
Hey, they say you won't recognize...

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,029
your own parents
if you drink in broad daylight.

95
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,669
I don't even remember
their faces anyway.

96
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,539
Besides, my mother abandoned me
and left years ago.

97
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,039
Gosh, I can't even say anything
around you.

98
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,739
What's up with you, kid?

99
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:19,909
Dan Soo.

100
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,719
Is something wrong?

101
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:27,589
I just...

102
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,820
remembered the past.

103
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,570
Goodness, look forward.

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,900
But...

105
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,739
Baby, you have to live with me now,
your grandma.

106
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,270
No, I want to stay here.

107
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,539
You can't stay here.

108
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,739
Let's go now.

109
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,650
You must go, young man.

110
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,520
No. I don't want to go.

111
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,489
No.

112
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,710
Geon!

113
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,909
Hey! Snot Face!

114
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,820
Snot Face!

115
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,450
Hey, where are you going?

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,589
This is your favorite.

117
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:37,190
Where are you going without this?

118
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,830
Maeng Ggong!

119
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,060
Don't go!

120
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,229
Don't go!

121
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,729
Don't go!

122
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Mr. Seo.

123
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,539
Maeng Ggong!

124
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,640
I'll come back.

125
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,979
Let's meet again!

126
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,880
(Oh Pine, You Verdant Pine)

127
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,489
We barely managed to meet again.

128
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,859
I don't know why it feels like
we've been separated again.

129
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,130
What's wrong with me?

130
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,159
I feel like there's a huge hole
in my heart.

131
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,270
Is that perhaps...

132
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,010
about Gong Hee?

133
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,880
The two of you seemed
to have deep feelings...

134
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,049
in the way
you thought about each other.

135
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,419
If you like her,

136
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,120
you should tell her.

137
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,659
People's feelings don't have feet,

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,589
so they can't reach
the other person...

139
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,029
unless you tell them.

140
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,500
I've lost...

141
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,429
my way.

142
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,400
I'm not sure where to go.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,409
I've realized my feelings too late.

144
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,909
I've totally missed the beat,

145
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,220
so I ruined it.

146
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,130
I said we should go somewhere good.

147
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,939
This tastes good to me.

148
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
You eat so well.

149
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:35,240
My appetite is like a very good kid.

150
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,510
It has never run away from home.

151
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,449
- Eat up.
- I will.

152
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,919
You worked so hard lately.

153
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,590
What?

154
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,429
Hey. Is that you, Seo Min Gi?

155
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,730
What?

156
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Hey, funny running into you here.

157
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,270
I know, right?

158
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,299
And who might this be?

159
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,209
- Is it perhaps...
- What?

160
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,539
your wife?

161
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,610
Gosh, you were keeping her hidden
all this time.

162
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,140
I guess I'm the first to meet her.

163
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,610
- Hello...
- Oh, hey.

164
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,350
It's not like that.

165
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,020
What are you saying?
I've caught you on a date.

166
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,590
- Why are you making excuses?
- Oh, this is...

167
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,059
my colleague at work.

168
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,029
Oh, really?

169
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,360
Let's meet up some other time.
I'll call you.

170
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,760
- Yes, it's so nice to see you.
- Likewise.

171
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,029
Oh, right.
I hope you enjoy your meal.

172
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,169
Call me.

173
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,189
The coffee is so bitter.

174
00:10:58,329 --> 00:10:59,990
Is it because
I'm just an office worker?

175
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,799
The breeze feels nice too.

176
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,029
Is it because
I'm just an office worker?

177
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,069
Am I just a work colleague to you?

178
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,439
- Well...
- Do you go around...

179
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,549
hugging your colleagues...

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
and kissing them?

181
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,020
He's a friend,

182
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,819
but he works in the industry too.

183
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,789
Nothing good will come of
making our relationship known.

184
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,329
Are you mad?

185
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,370
Why would I be mad?

186
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,299
I'm just an office worker.

187
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,510
It's not like that.

188
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,740
I'm sorry, okay?

189
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,610
You're apologizing again.

190
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,610
Oh, that's forbidden.

191
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,850
Where are you going?

192
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,650
Wait up, Gong Hee.

193
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,559
The simple office worker
will just go home...

194
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,390
Sorry.

195
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Are you okay?

196
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,740
Let me see. I think you're hurt.

197
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,840
Oh, no. I'm fine.

198
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
Come on. Let me see.

199
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,850
It seems okay.

200
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,120
I really am okay.

201
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:31,919
I have such strong bones.

202
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:34,959
Come here.

203
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,829
If it still hurts when I get home,

204
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:40,490
I'll use the pain relief patches
that you bought me.

205
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,459
Pain relief patches?

206
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,669
Did I buy you pain relief patches?

207
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,799
On our business trip.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,140
You went and bought them for me...

209
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,699
in the middle of the night
when I sprained my ankle.

210
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,900
I still have some left.

211
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,610
That wasn't me.

212
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
What?

213
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,049
It wasn't me.

214
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,150
It must've been Gu Dan Soo.

215
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,490
You didn't get
those pain relief patches?

216
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,520
It was Gu Dan Soo?

217
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
What?

218
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,669
Gong Boo is getting married?

219
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,600
Yes, he says he will.

220
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,740
Gosh, that's great news.

221
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,939
You should join us when the family
gets together to meet her.

222
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,880
Goodness, why should I?
You don't need me there.

223
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,909
Why not? Still, this is the woman
Gong Boo will marry.

224
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,010
You should meet her.

225
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,750
Make it a simple affair.

226
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,449
Make it comfortable for the kids.

227
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,789
Make them think
that there are no elders...

228
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,919
in this family.

229
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,730
But there are elders.

230
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,459
Well, elders are supposed to...

231
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,829
act like they're not around
even if they are. That's best.

232
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,130
Goodness, Mom.

233
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:54,029
All right.

234
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,439
Then sleep well.

235
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:05,409
How is it that
our moms are so different?

236
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,679
Oh, my. Why are you bringing up
my late mother again?

237
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,880
Your mom and my mother-in-law...

238
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,890
was such trouble as she tried
to act like the elder too much.

239
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,860
And my mom tries so hard
not to act like an elder.

240
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,329
The way your mother acts
is how true elders should be.

241
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:27,329
My...

242
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,840
Mom, I'm sorry.
Let me talk badly about you a bit.

243
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,439
Honestly, my mom wasn't acting
like an elder.

244
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,179
She was more like an old fogey.

245
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,679
Thank you
for the objective evaluation.

246
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,650
Goodness, she may have been my mom,

247
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,850
but she was so... Good grief.

248
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,390
If it hadn't been for you,

249
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,090
she would've kicked out
several daughters-in-law.

250
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,230
Gosh, Mom.

251
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,329
Oh, dear.

252
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,470
Since my back is almost better,

253
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,240
my legs are causing trouble now.

254
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,049
My wilted weed of a body.

255
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,380
All that's left is for it
to return to the earth.

256
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,620
Now, my goal is...

257
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,890
to die without making my kids worry.

258
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,090
That's all.

259
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,130
Here. I steamed some potatoes.

260
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,740
Try some. They're so soft and tasty.

261
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,370
Goodness,
why do you keep coming over?

262
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,069
- You're such a bother.
- My gosh.

263
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:41,209
Do you think
I want to come over so often?

264
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,909
Myung Ja keeps calling me...

265
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,809
and tells me to check in on you.

266
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,850
By the way, Myung Ja says...

267
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,319
Gong Boo is getting married again.

268
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,659
Is that true?

269
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,689
Yes, they're about to have
an official family meeting soon.

270
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:00,890
Oh, my.

271
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,100
Myung Ja's in-laws
will be coming over...

272
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,069
and making a big ruckus.

273
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:07,870
I don't know why they're like that.

274
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,370
By the way,
I bet Myung Ja still has no idea.

275
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,809
That you had to get down
on your knees...

276
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,980
in front of her mother-in-law.

277
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,679
Of course, she doesn't know.

278
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,010
Knowing Myung Ja's personality,

279
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,980
she would've left her husband
if she'd known about it.

280
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,250
You'd better not tell her.

281
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,150
Goodness. Don't you worry.

282
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,360
She'd gladly give up her life
for you.

283
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,159
If she finds out
that her mother had to...

284
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,529
beg her mother-in-law on her knees,

285
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,429
she'll flip out.

286
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
What?

287
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:42,939
What's wrong? Are you choking?

288
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,400
Or is it your heart?

289
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,470
- What is it?
- It's both.

290
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,470
What?

291
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,039
- When I think about how Myung Ja...
- Yes.

292
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,110
- had to put up with her in-laws,
- Here.

293
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,520
I still get indigestion.

294
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
My goodness.

295
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:08,699
What were you doing until this late?

296
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:11,699
Hey, thanks.

297
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
For what?

298
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:15,870
I found out that you were the one...

299
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,309
who got me those pain relief patches
on the work trip.

300
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,309
Why didn't you tell me?

301
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,480
I had no idea.

302
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,909
I thought
Mr. Seo bought them for me.

303
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,050
Okay, so what?

304
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:28,880
Thank you.

305
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,550
I didn't think
a simple thank-you would be enough,

306
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,390
so I wanted to buy you a truckload
of pain relief patches...

307
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,459
but stopped myself.

308
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,390
I mean, you seem fine now.

309
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,429
You're okay now, right?

310
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,400
Oh, right.
We said we'd go somewhere...

311
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,439
once the contest was over.

312
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,070
Did we say we'd go
and see the stars together?

313
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,239
Is there a good place you know of?

314
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,810
Forget it.

315
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:54,780
You should go...

316
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,140
with Min Gi.

317
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,719
Hey, you knew?

318
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,419
He came all the way here
to drop off sushi for you at night.

319
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,519
How could I not know?

320
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,659
I pick up things very quickly,
you see.

321
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,560
What?

322
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,860
You knew all about it
but didn't even show it?

323
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,969
Hey, don't look so upset.

324
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,630
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

325
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,900
Do you like him a lot?

326
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:25,739
I used to...

327
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,179
have a crush on him.

328
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,749
Honestly, I still can't believe it.

329
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,150
My crush is now my boyfriend.

330
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:42,919
Right. You said you'd known Mr. Seo
since you were little.

331
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,830
What does he like?

332
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,390
And what's his type?
Hurry up and tell me, okay?

333
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,800
How would I know?

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,929
Come on. Help me out here!

335
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,499
What are friends for?

336
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,300
Friends, my foot.

337
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,040
Stop saying we're friends.

338
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,939
Why?

339
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,780
Our friendship since childhood
is so precious.

340
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,350
We're best friends.

341
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,650
And don't tell Mom, okay?

342
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,850
She got so mad at me the other day.

343
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:12,489
Your mom? Why?

344
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,590
Mr. Seo's mom and my mom...

345
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,659
are like sworn enemies.

346
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:18,929
Okay, but why?

347
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,429
You don't need to know.

348
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,159
So, keep it to yourself
for the time being.

349
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:25,999
What is this? A secret relationship?

350
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Thanks,

351
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,769
Gu Dan Soo.

352
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,310
What now?

353
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,640
Thanks to your help,
my presentation went well.

354
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,640
I followed your advice...

355
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,179
and tried my best
to convey my sincerity.

356
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,350
If there's anything you want
to do or get, just tell me.

357
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,150
Since I'm getting
a permanent position,

358
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,150
I'll get you everything you want.

359
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,659
Seriously,
I'll buy you everything you want.

360
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,090
Look at him all shy.

361
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,540
What I want...

362
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,340
and what I want to do?

363
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:07,939
You can't do it for me...

364
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,610
anymore.

365
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,890
Gong Hee, did you get home safely?

366
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,459
Is your ankle okay?

367
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,159
It's totally fine.

368
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:29,159
I guess I just pulled a muscle.

369
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,929
Gosh, I'm glad to hear you're okay.

370
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,499
You had a long week.
Get some good rest on the weekend.

371
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,400
I will. You should rest up too.

372
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,769
Will do.

373
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,540
The winner of the contest
will be announced next week.

374
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,140
Sweet dreams.

375
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,050
What is it?

376
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,959
Ji Na has decided to marry Dan Soo.

377
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:05,030
Dodo Group finalized it
with Ms. Hwang earlier today.

378
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,669
Do I have to know this?

379
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,209
You should be extremely careful
from now on.

380
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,610
Okay.

381
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,479
You don't need to give me
these updates anymore.

382
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:19,949
Ji Na and I are done.

383
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,350
What do you mean?

384
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:37,929
You tell me. Is it really true?

385
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,739
Honey, it's not something
you can meddle in.

386
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:45,070
If you don't want me
to meddle in it,

387
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,909
you need to take care of it
on your end.

388
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:49,239
Do you only see Ms. Hwang?

389
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,140
Can you not see how hurt Min Gi is?

390
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,449
Ji Na's mother came by today...

391
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,519
and made the decision
with Ms. Hwang.

392
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,189
And Ji Na is on board?

393
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,150
She wants to marry Gu Dan Soo?

394
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,060
Yes. So wake up already.

395
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,390
Goodness.

396
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,400
Ji Na, that girl...

397
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,900
This is not good.

398
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,699
Before things go
completely sideways,

399
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,840
I should do something.

400
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,620
I've never felt this nervous before.

401
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:34,959
Don't be so nervous.

402
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,330
You're just having a meal
with my family.

403
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Okay.

404
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,199
I'm ready.

405
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,130
Let's go.

406
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,669
Yes, let's go.

407
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,080
- Am I wrong?
- You're right.

408
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,780
Oh, my. I see.

409
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,310
- Yes.
- About that...

410
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,949
- Goodness.
- Oh, yes.

411
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,479
There you are, Gong Boo.

412
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,550
Welcome, Hong Dan.

413
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,290
- She's here. Isn't she pretty?
- Yes.

414
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,959
Who are these people?

415
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,300
My relatives are all very close.

416
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,600
Okay, I get that they're close,

417
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,040
but why are they attending
this family meeting?

418
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,840
Shouldn't this be kept
within the immediate family?

419
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,979
Hey, Gong Boo!

420
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:33,679
My gosh! You made it, Uncle!

421
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,679
- You've been keeping well, right?
- Of course.

422
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,749
Oh, hey!

423
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,350
Ms. Eom.

424
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,620
You must be surprised.

425
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,090
We have...

426
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,060
a big family.

427
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:47,489
I see.

428
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,699
Why didn't you tell me?

429
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,429
You could've given me a heads-up.

430
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Here.

431
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,439
This lists
all the family elders' birthdays.

432
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:05,009
My gosh. Please don't do this.

433
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:08,949
Gong Boo and Hong Dan
have finally decided to get married.

434
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,650
You should cheer them on,
if anything.

435
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,949
Why are you trying
to intimidate her?

436
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,890
My goodness.
What's wrong with what I said?

437
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,890
She is marrying
the eldest son of the family!

438
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,659
Of course,
she should remember these things.

439
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,159
And take this too.

440
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,570
This lists
all the death anniversaries.

441
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,070
Pardon?

442
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,540
Well, you have...

443
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,239
such a big family.

444
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,749
No, we don't.

445
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,780
The others have all passed away.

446
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,150
There are only a few of us left now.

447
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:44,550
Right, Myung Ja?

448
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,850
When you were a newlywed,
there were birthdays every two days.

449
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,659
Compared to that time,
you young people...

450
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,330
Goodness. You have it so easy!
You really do.

451
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,400
- Hong Dan!
- Oh, no.

452
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:02,239
My goodness.

453
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,340
Are you okay?

454
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,280
I bet you don't want
to marry me now.

455
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,050
Yes, I get it.

456
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:20,689
Well...

457
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,659
It all depends on you, Gong Boo.

458
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,130
What?

459
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,530
All the birthdays
and the death anniversaries in the family.

460
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,600
You take care of them
since it's your family.

461
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,330
Okay?

462
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:35,800
Well...

463
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,540
Just say you want
to call off the wedding. I get it.

464
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,340
It's fine.

465
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:46,979
I said I would marry you.

466
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,550
- Let's go back inside, honey.
- But...

467
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:51,919
The elders...

468
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,189
must be waiting.

469
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:58,790
Gosh, seriously?

470
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:02,759
This was my last chance
to run away from all this.

471
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:17,540
I've realized my feelings too late.

472
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,050
I've totally missed the beat,

473
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,320
so I ruined it.

474
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Don't go.

475
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,400
Don't go.

476
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,370
No.

477
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,080
Don't go, Mom.

478
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,380
- Mom.
- No.

479
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,550
Mom!

480
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,449
Mom!

481
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,890
Mom!

482
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:06,830
Mom!

483
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,130
No.

484
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,530
No.

485
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:15,340
Don't go.

486
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
Mom.

487
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,439
Mom.

488
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,350
Gu Dan Soo!

489
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,550
You haven't had dinner, have you?

490
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,449
I thought so.

491
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
No...

492
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,290
No. Mom.

493
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:36,689
Mom.

494
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
No.

495
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,600
Don't go.

496
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,630
- No...
- Dan Soo.

497
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:48,969
Dan Soo.

498
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,300
Hey, Dan Soo.

499
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:51,840
Are you okay?

500
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:59,050
Hey, I thought
something happened to you.

501
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:01,509
Why are you sweating so much...

502
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,650
Don't lay a hand on me.

503
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,769
(My Merry Marriage)

504
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,330
He's getting angry for no reason.

505
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,870
Seriously, Gu Dan Soo...

506
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,810
Take good care of your son.

507
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,310
My poor Min Gi. What do I do?

508
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,880
He was born to the wrong parents.

509
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,380
Where did my handkerchief go?

510
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,850
Where did my Hermes go?

511
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:38,419
- Why is that around your neck?
- Why?

512
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:39,850
Is something going on?

513
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,320
Why is everyone gathered around?

514
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,189
They announced the winner
of the blind contest.

515
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,489
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
