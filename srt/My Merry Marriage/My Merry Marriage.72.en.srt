(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,760
Let go, and we can talk.

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Let go of her hand.

4
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:31,229
You stay out of this.

5
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,139
No. You stay out of this.

(Chairwoman's Office)

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,010
Let go, if you want to talk.

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,879
Mr. Seo.

9
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,139
And you too, Mr. Gu!

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,210
Don't meddle in my life.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,650
I won't marry either of you!

12
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,729
(Episode 72)

13
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:03,870
It's okay.

14
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:06,669
I'm okay.

15
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:18,550
Do you now know your place?

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,519
I can guess what
the chairwoman probably told you.

17
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,360
If I say I want to marry Gu Dan Soo,

18
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,289
isn't it a good thing for you?

19
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,629
You completely ruined
my wedding plans...

20
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,959
and want to find your happiness now?
How selfish.

21
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,830
I wasn't the one
who ruined your plan.

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,970
You're pregnant
with Seo Min Gi's child,

23
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,769
and you insist on keeping the baby.

24
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,739
Because of your decision,
Min Gi changed his mind.

25
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,739
No.

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,409
He changed his mind because
you two don't trust each other.

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,179
If you two trusted
and loved each other,

28
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,819
you wouldn't be anxious...

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,819
regardless of whether
I want to keep the baby.

30
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,989
So?

31
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,920
Do you really not need
the child's father?

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,090
I don't need
the baby's biological father.

33
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,989
I need someone who would truly love
and care for my child.

34
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,860
Not someone
who feels obligated to do it.

35
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,030
Someone who'd truly love
and care for your child? Who?

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,670
Are you saying you'll marry
Gu Dan Soo or something?

37
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,640
Do you think that will work out?

38
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,580
Come to your senses now.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,050
Face your reality as it is.

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,179
I appreciate your advice.

41
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,689
About No Ah's mom.

42
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,089
I think she keeps video-calling him
to egg him on.

43
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,559
You see, No Ah...

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,429
suddenly said he wanted
to go to an English kindergarten.

45
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,969
He said his mom sent him to one...

46
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,830
and all kinds of academies
he wanted to attend.

47
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,709
We don't have that kind of money,
you know?

48
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,809
Goodness,
my back is about to break...

49
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,709
from working so hard
to pay off your brother's debt.

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,050
Did No Ah ask to go
to an English kindergarten?

51
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,450
Oh, dear.

52
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,619
That must be hard for you.

53
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,920
So, I looked into it,

54
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,559
but they all cost so much,

55
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,830
and even if he wants to go,

56
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:48,800
there aren't any open spots.

57
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,269
But when No Ah was comparing me
to his mom,

58
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,769
I was so upset.

59
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:59,469
My baby is getting bigger,

60
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,239
but your brother
isn't worried at all.

61
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,050
He's just whining about getting
a bigger credit card limit. My gosh.

62
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,189
Oh, no.

63
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,689
Hey, I'm sorry.
What am I even saying...

64
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,830
to you right now?

65
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,230
I'm sorry
things are so tough for you.

66
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,469
It's okay.

67
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,839
I may have it tough,
but it's nothing compared to you.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,509
Cry if you want to.

69
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,949
There's no one here.

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,650
Cry as much as you want.

71
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:44,189
Oh, dear.

72
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:46,949
Just cry.

73
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,800
Hey.

74
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,800
Why did you come back here?

75
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,670
Hey.

76
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,739
Your son said
he'd marry my daughter.

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,900
We should discuss things, then.

78
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,410
What are you talking about now?

79
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,939
I haven't heard anything.

80
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,280
I heard your son came to see
my husband.

81
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,710
Why are you acting dumb?

82
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,449
Apparently, your son said
he'd take responsibility.

83
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,150
That he'd marry my daughter.

84
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,989
Can you just leave if you're going
to keep talking nonsense?

85
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,819
I already have
a big enough headache...

86
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,759
that I had to take two painkillers.

87
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,030
How dare you mention your daughter
and my son getting married?

88
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,999
Look here.
I don't like the idea either.

89
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,100
But your son said he would.

90
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,800
Well, no matter what Min Gi said,

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,040
I won't allow it.

92
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,770
Now, you've gone too far.

93
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,280
Hey, then what will you do?

94
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,610
I'll do everything you ask for
besides letting them get married.

95
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,319
What do you want?

96
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,720
Money? I'll give you money.

97
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,949
How much will it take?

98
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,220
Is your dumpling business
not doing well?

99
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,420
You're acting
as if you came to rip off money...

100
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:57,889
You!

101
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,230
Will you finally come to your senses
once I take you down?

102
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,540
Do you think I'm still
the same old Jung Ssang Sook?

103
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Do you think I'll lose to you?

104
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,610
Fine. Today,
I'm going to take you down...

105
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,040
even if it costs me my life!

106
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,309
- Hey!
- Why, you...

107
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,780
Darn you...

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,860
Darn it! I don't want
an in-law like you either!

109
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,129
Hey, you should tell me now.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,840
Why do you hate me so much?

111
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,569
Fine, I had a crush on your husband
before you got married.

112
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,579
I was jealous,
so I tried to stop your marriage...

113
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,749
by planning to interfere.

114
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,520
But that's all in the past.

115
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,920
How could you be so mean...

116
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,819
as to punish me for decades?

117
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Do you think
that was all it was about?

118
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,090
Back then,

119
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,800
what did you do to me?

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,869
The day I went to see you
with my newborn baby!

121
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,939
There was no one to help me,

122
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,079
but I still went to you for help
because you were my friend.

123
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,809
What did you say to me that day?

124
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,009
What?

125
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,550
"Are you here to beg like a tramp?"

126
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,650
I don't remember.

127
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,389
Don't lie to me.

128
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,989
You clearly remember that.

129
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,499
You're embarrassed of yourself
from back then, right?

130
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,730
That was why you didn't see me
for a while!

131
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,970
Get out of my house.

132
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,579
Fine, this tramp will go now.

133
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,350
You seem
to have lived a good life...

134
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,319
after driving a stake
into your friend's heart.

135
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,420
You'll be punished for that!

136
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,920
I hope the skies punish you!

137
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,429
Get out.
Leave! I told you to get out!

138

Ssang Sook.

139
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,619
My friend
who had a good life in Seoul...

140
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:44,989
was my last resort...

141
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:48,100
and my last hope at the time.

142
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,569
I came here because I heard...

143
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:52,829
that you lived here.

144
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,339
You live in a nice house,
just like what I heard.

146
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,910
What are you doing here?

147
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,410
Well...

148
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,380
Please help me.

149
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,620
You're asking me for help?

150
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,790
Who's helping whom?

151
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,729
I'm having...

152
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,630
a really hard time.

153
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,770
Because of
my older brother's business,

154
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,800
my mom is about to
lose her house too.

155
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,010
What is this?

156
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,150
Are you here to beg like a tramp
with a baby on your back?

157
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,890
What?

158
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:49,620
Go. I won't listen to you anymore.

159
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:52,729
Ssang Sook!

160
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,069
I think my baby needs
a diaper change.

161
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,900
And I think he's hungry too.

162
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,540
- Could I come in and have him...
- Forget it!

163
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,969
How dare you try to come in here?

164
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
What?

165
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,959
I said I was living large
after getting married.

166
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,969
How could I tell you the truth
when you came all the way...

167
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,569
to ask me for help?

168
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,140
A husband
who works at a large company?

169
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,069
He was just a chauffeur.

170
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,870
A huge house?

171
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,240
It was the chauffeur's quarters
in the basement.

172
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:44,780
How could I tell you that?

173
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,719
The person
who should have gone out begging...

174
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,250
with her baby on her back...

175
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,120
was me, you brat.

176
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,829
It was better that I was...

177
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:00,760
a mean witch to you,

178
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,400
rather than a pathetic one.

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,449
Oh, Audrey.

182
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,089
Audrey.

183
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,120
I haven't seen you around.

184
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,729
Are you here for dumplings?

185
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,260
Pardon? Well, yes.

186
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,599
I know the people
who run this place.

187
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,699
You know these people?

188
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,699
Oh, my!

189
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,770
Goodness, it's my poetry teacher!

190
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,410
- What brings you all the way here?
- Yes.

191
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,910
I was just passing by...

192
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,309
when I spotted the sign
for Maeng Dumplings.

193
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,880
I've always been curious
about what your dumplings...

194
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,349
would taste like, Gyeong Bok.

195
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,120
My goodness.

196
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,050
Well, dumplings are all the same.
Mine's no different.

197
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,219
Oh, gosh!

198
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,719
You scared me.

199
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,959
Back again? My goodness.

200
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:06,890
So, this is my poetry teacher.

201
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:09,599
He's an elegant man
who writes poetry.

202
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,699
I know a thing or two
about poetry too.

203
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,270
What?

204
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,240
You look like you've never read
a poem in your life.

205
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,309
Here, Mr. Ryu. Come on in.

206
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,309
Okay.

207
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,920
Oh, my. Mr. Ryu!

208
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,219
He must've dropped in
while passing by.

209
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,420
My gosh. I'm glad you're here.

210
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,219
I'm even happier to see you here.

211
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:35,719
Really?

212
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,630
Could I join you for a minute?

213
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,589
- Of course. Have a seat.
- Okay.

214
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:43,130
Would you like to join us too,
Detective An?

215
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,969
I'm all right.

216
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:46,469
Okay.

217
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,380
Oh, you should eat with us,
Gyeong Bok.

218
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,939
Shouldn't you have lunch too?

219
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,910
I have to get ready for business.

220
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,079
We've had some trouble in my family,

221
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,719
so I have to run the shop alone.

222
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,120
I'll help you.

223
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
It's fine.

224
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,559
So, see how it tastes. Here.

225
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,589
Oh, okay.

226
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,800
It's the best dumpling
I've ever had.

227
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,510
There's a festival going on
inside my mouth.

228
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,109
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

229
00:13:27,109 --> 00:13:28,679
You sure are a poet.

230
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,979
You described the taste
so poetically.

231
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,780
As the title of
one of Rilke's poetry books goes,

232
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,189
"A Festival for Me
and a Festival for You."

233
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,689
Oh, my.

234
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:48,130
My gosh. You know Rilke?

235
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,059
Rilke is my favorite poet.

236
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:51,929
My goodness.

237
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:56,500
Oh, my. "A Festival for Me
and a Festival for You."

238
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,670
What does that mean?

239
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:03,339
Life is so tough, isn't it?

240
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,620
But most breakups
are remembered beautifully.

241
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,020
We all experience hardships,

242
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,819
but if we keep smiling,

243
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,990
every moment...

244
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,689
will be like a festival,
don't you think?

245
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,359
I see.

246
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh, my. He's surprising me
with his unexpected charm.

247
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,449
I didn't know you liked poetry.

248
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,050
(Maeng Dumplings)

249
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,550
Mr. Ryu, you left your notebook...

250
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,650
Oh, no!

251
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,020
Darn it.

252
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,729
No!

253
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:56,929
Are you all right?

254
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,900
Mr. Ryu.

255
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,370
You could've been hurt badly.

256
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,910
The floor is slippery, isn't it?

257
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:12,050
Thank you for saving me.

258
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,880
I'm heavy, aren't I?

259
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,319
No, not at all.

260
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:18,689
You flew into my arms, Gyeong Bok.

261
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,089
You were as light as a butterfly.

262
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,309
Oh, my.

263
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,209
I'm seeing a halo over 2 men?
Not even 1?

264
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,179
This is crazy.

265
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,559
Please make sure not to miss
your checkup appointments.

266
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,559
As for your cold medicine,
only take the one I gave you.

267
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,559
Got it.

268
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,859
- Thank you.
- Get home safely.

(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

270
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:16,140
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon.
Why do you keep calling me?

271
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,750
No Ah called me.

272
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,780
He wants to go to
an English kindergarten.

273
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,910
I can't afford it.

274
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,020
You can't even do it for him
as his dad?

275
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,089
What? Come on.

276
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:26,990
You took everything I had
when we got a divorce,

277
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,120
including my apartment I had bought
with my parents' money.

278
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
What?

279
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,890
You gave it to me
because you felt guilty.

280
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,300
You acted all cool
and told me to take everything.

281
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, anyway...

282
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:40,069
I've been dead broke
ever since then.

283
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,670
Also, you left No Ah with me.

284
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,640
So, mind your own business
and live your selfish life.

285
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,809
Why are you being so nosy?

286
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,880
Are you really going
to be like this?

287
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,109
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon.

288
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,550
I made it very clear to you.

289
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:54,250
You're not No Ah's mom anymore.

290
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,780
The moment you abandoned No Ah,
you lost your rights as his mom.

291
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,620
Don't call me again like this.

292
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,490
And stop calling No Ah.

293
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,790
What am I supposed to do?
He keeps wanting to talk to me.

294
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,089
You need to help him
adjust to his new environment!

295
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,900
I need to make money to raise him,

296
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
so I have to go.

297
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,329
(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,569
We will not...

299
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,280
become in-laws
with Jung Ssang Sook, ever!

300
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,679
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

301
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,879
Come on. Ssang Sook's son told me...

302
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,980
that he wanted to marry Gong Hee.

303
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,389
I told you to go and talk to her about it.
What's the problem?

304
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,559
The problem is...

305
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,290
that he never even told
his parents about it.

306
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,559
Ssang Sook said she had no idea.

307
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,300
What?

308
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,960
What is the matter with that clown?

309
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,300
He confidently said
he'd take responsibility.

310
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,730
How could he
not even tell his parents?

311
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,270
Even so,
you went there to talk to her.

312
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,839
You can't just come back
without talking to her.

313
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,409
You think I came back
without doing anything?

314
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:56,579
What? Did you two have a talk, then?

315
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,180
I smacked her in the head
to knock some sense into her.

316
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,280
Happy now?

317
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,180
My goodness. It doesn't look like...

318
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,589
that was the only thing you did.
Am I right?

319
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,220
That's right. It wasn't enough,
so I pulled her hair out too.

320
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,089
That's nuts.

321
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,359
What?
What are you going to do, then?

322
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,559
What can we do?

323
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,430
We'll just let Gong Hee do
what she wants.

324
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,730
Gong Hee said
she didn't want to marry that punk.

325
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,970
Hey, she could change her mind
about it.

326
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,399
Then let's all get together
later today...

327
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,210
and listen to what she has to say.

328
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,280
But you have to promise me that
you'll let her have her way, okay?

329
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,780
Oh, dear.

330
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,750
- Come in and have a seat.
- Thank you.

331
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,490
I must say, I am relieved.

332
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,960
To hear that
the baby's father came to meet you.

333
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
I know.

334
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,930
We actually had a good conversation.

335
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,869
He's a reliable guy.

336
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,369
He said he'd take responsibility...

337
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,169
and get the situation sorted out.

338
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,809
But do you think
Myung Ja will change her mind?

339
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,349
It's not something
the parents should meddle in.

340
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,690
I'm sure it'll all work out
in the end.

341
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,119
What does Gong Hee say about it?

342
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,629
It looks like
the two of them already had a talk,

343
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:21,629
but she hasn't made up her mind yet.

344
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,829
I guess she's hesitating
because of Dan Soo.

345
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Yes.

346
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,169
Mr. Maeng.

347
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:38,649
It's not easy for me
to bring this up,

348
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,119
but even if things work out
between Gong Hee and Dan Soo,

349
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,460
it won't be easy
for them to get married.

350
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:53,859
As you know, Dan Soo's grandmother
is a scary person.

351
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,399
Feeling anxious all the time...

352
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,230
as if you're being chased,

353
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,740
like a criminal.

354
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:08,540
Living like that
won't end well for Gong Hee...

355
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,579
and for her baby too.

356
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:16,419
Right, I understand
what you're trying to tell me.

357
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,889
She can't be with Dan Soo.

358
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,659
They can never be together.

359
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,169
What are you trying to tell us?

360
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:38,809
If you're going to talk nonsense...

361
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,339
I...

362
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,809
want to get married.

363
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,020
You say you want to get married,

364
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,480
yet you canceled the meeting
with Ji Na's parents.

365
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,619
Way to go.

366
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,119
Have you apologized
to Ji Na's parents yet?

367
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,490
No, I'm not talking about Ji Na.
I want to marry someone else.

368
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,359
What on earth are you saying?

369
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,800
Then who is this person
you want to marry?

370
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,930
I want to marry Maeng Gong Hee.

371
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:07,270
Maeng Gong Hee?

372
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,970
The one Dan Soo wants to marry?

373
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,639
What are you saying?

374
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,639
She and Dan Soo have been friends
since childhood.

375
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,379
He wants to marry her,
but it's completely one-sided.

376
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,409
Why do you keep getting tangled
with Dan Soo...

377
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,079
when it comes
to your marriage issues?

378
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,419
Why her?

379
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,280
There are many other women
out there!

380
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,260
Gong Hee is pregnant with my child.

381
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,829
What?
What in the world are you saying?

382
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,500
No, Min Gi.

383
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,569
You can't do that.

384
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:45,540
What?
Honey, did you know about this?

385
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,210
Consider yourselves informed.

386
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:49,510
I'll take care of
all the wedding preparations.

387
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,379
No, don't do this.

388
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,250
Think about this again, please.

389
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,550
Marrying Ji Na will be like
winning the lottery.

390
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,290
Why won't you marry her?

391
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,020
I've already made up my mind.

392
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,490
Just know that.

393
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,159
Listen to me, please.

394
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,099
You will leave Ji Na
and marry someone else?

395
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,700
Kang Myung Ja's daughter,
of all people?

396
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,970
It has nothing to do
with your past history with her mom.

397
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,069
How could you say
it has nothing to do with it?

398
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,639
I can't do this.
I won't let you marry that girl.

399
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,470
Is Ji Na okay with this?

400
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,379
Now, you say this after getting
your wedding invitations printed?

401
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,649
None of that matters now.

402
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:29,819
Everything is a mess.

403
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,349
No.

404
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,389
No, Min Gi. Don't do this.

405
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,260
No, please. You can't do this.

406
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,270
What do I do now?

407
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:56,680
You, Dan Soo.

408
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,980
Have a seat.

409
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,690
I have something to tell you anyway.

410
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,020
- You...
- I won't expect you...

411
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,460
to take my side anymore.

412
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,599
So, I'm here to notify you.

413
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,899
Mr. Seo called me.

414
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,970
That girl, Maeng Gong Hee.

415
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,470
She's pregnant with Min Gi's child.

416
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,409
I guess I was too late.

417
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
I figured you'd find out about that,

418
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,680
so I wanted to tell you beforehand.

419
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
What?

420
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,750
Dan Soo, don't tell me...

421
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,050
that you knew everything
when you did that.

422
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,690
Things between Min Gi and Gong Hee
are already over.

423
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,790
There are no feelings left
between them.

424
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,159
So, I...

425
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:47,829
Mr. Seo.

426
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,129
Hurry up with Min Gi's wedding.

427
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,700
If he got a girl pregnant,
he should take responsibility.

428
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:54,129
Grandma!

429
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,040
I'll cover the wedding expenses.

430
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,210
So, just hurry things along.

431
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,010
I think it would be best
to have Maeng Gong Hee fired.

432
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,379
What?

433
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,250
In return, I'll give her
a sizable severance package.

434
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,589
She won't be disappointed.

435
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,419
She's marrying Min Gi.

436
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:18,530
I should give her that much,
at least.

437
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,460
Grandma, have you always been
such a spiteful person?

438
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,000
How could you use Min Gi
to stop me from getting married?

439
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,270
How could you fire Maeng Gong Hee
because of me?

440
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,270
A person in my position
has to be spiteful.

441
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,639
Emotions are mere luxuries.

442
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:36,740
A person can waver
from a passing wind in the winter.

443
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,079
But you can't let a tree fall
because of it.

444
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:42,619
You can't be with that girl.

445
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,419
You're the next chairman
of Jayce Fashion.

446
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,990
I never knew you'd do this.

447
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,089
Or was I the only one
who didn't know?

448
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,859
What kind of person the chairwoman
of Korea's top fashion company...

449
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:57,629
actually is.

450
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:00,930
You sound as though
you'll let a mere girl like her...

451
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,800
drive a wedge between you
and your own grandma.

452
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,040
Should I tell you why...

453
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,440
I always wandered around abroad
and didn't want to come back?

454
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,510
It was because of you.
You were so stifling.

455
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,010
You're always stabbing me
in the heart like this.

456
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,079
Gu Dan Soo!

457
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,819
I won't lose to you anymore.

458
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,520
I'll take care of things myself.

459
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,690
Don't interfere anymore.

460
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:39,869
Things are hard, aren't they?

461
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,050
I know I shouldn't say this
when you're suffering, but...

462
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,290
Honestly, I envy you.

463
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,919
You're having a baby.

464
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,559
That's such a joy.

465
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,730
Auntie.

466
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,800
I spent all the years of my youth...

467
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:08,069
just so I could have a baby.

468
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,409
I tried everything in the world
that was supposed to help,

469
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:13,669
but it never happened.

470
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,139
The skies...

471
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,109
have given you this blessing.

472
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:21,919
A special gift.

473
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,589
I'm also grateful
that Momo came to me.

474
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,659
That's also why I feel sorrier.

475
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,230
My goodness.

476
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,069
This baby is the luckiest child
before it's even born.

477
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,040
It will have someone...

478
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,569
as kind as you for a mom.

479
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,669
Come on, Auntie.

480
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,550
It will be better for the baby
to have its dad around.

481
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,220
You should meet with the dad
and talk things through, okay?

482
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:01,419
Gyeong Bok, can I have some tea too?

483
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,889
All right.

484
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Be careful.

485
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:14,270
Aren't you opening the pub today?

486
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,300
I came
because Myung Ja called me over.

487
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,839
I wanted to hear
Gong Hee's thoughts...

488
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,240
in front of the whole family.

489
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,609
I'll do as Gong Hee decides.

490
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,180
Everyone should keep that in mind.

491
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,919
Wait, but where is Gyeong Tae?

492
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,790
Honey, why aren't you out here?

493
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,290
Gyeong Tae! Get out here.

494
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Leave him alone.

495
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:43,829
We'll support your decision.

496
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,230
Tell us what you think.

497
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:49,500
Will you marry him or not?

498
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,510
I think...

499
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,579
my marriage...

500
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,180
Here I am!

501
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,220
Oh, my. What is that noise?

502
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,319
Your tenant is here!

503
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,619
What?

504
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
- Oh, my.
- What?

505
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:11,930
Why...

506
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,760
- What?
- My gosh.

507
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,899
Your tenant is here.

508
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm back.

509
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,639
Gu Dan Soo!

510
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,710
(My Merry Marriage)

511
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:35,050
I won't leave, no matter how hard
you try to kick me out.

512
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,950
- Don't waste your energy.
- Actually,

513
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,419
I'm happy...

514
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:39,619
- that you're here.
- I'll do it.

515
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:40,889
- I'm so happy...
- I'll take it.

516
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,159
- that you're back.
- Give it here.

517
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,490
We have a visitor.

518
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,760
I heard my grandson was here.

519
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,089
I came to take him back.

520
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:48,190
What are you doing here?

521
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,559
Dan Soo is my son.

522
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,460
I care about him more than anyone.

523
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,629
You must have a lot of free time,
Chairwoman Hwang.

524
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:54,030
Gu Dan Soo, you...

525
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,040
