Don't go, Seo Min Gi.

Stay with me, just tonight.

4
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,710
No, just for a bit.

5
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,879
It's fine
even if it's just for a moment.

Let's stay like this, okay?

No.

No.

10
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,739
No bad thoughts, please.

11
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,640
Everything will be all right.

12
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,870
I'm sure
it's nothing to worry about.

13
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,419
Yes.

14
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,750
It's me.

15
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,149
It looks like I have to
pull an all-nighter at work.

16
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,590
Where...

17
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,590
are you now?

18
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,289
I'm at the office.

19
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,860
Don't stay up to wait for me.
Just go to bed.

What?

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,110
For Ssook Ssook's sake,
I suggest you stop now.

30
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,739
You should just give up.

31
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,280
I never give up.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,709
Eom Hong Dan never gives up.

33
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,679
All right. No Ah, do it again.

34
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,550

- Got it.

Look at you brainwashing him.

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,239
You're too idealistic

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,010
No Ah will never
just look at your eyes

44
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,779
And talk to you first,
the same goes for me

00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,050

mild exercise was good for me.

- Let's go!

00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,110
Honey, I'll tell you
the truth about everything.

68
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,540
The truth about what?

69
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,439
The reason why you always put others
before your own family?

70
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,510
What is the reason?

71
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,809
It's because...

72
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,649
I feel indebted...

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
to Dan Soo's father.

74
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,920
You feel indebted?
I'm sick of hearing this.

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360
What did you do
that you feel so indebted?

76
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,029
Dad, are you in debt again?

77
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,800
Goodness. No!

78
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:22,600
Oh, then what is it?

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,170
Don't tell me you stood surety
for a loan again.

80
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,499
What did you say?

81
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
- Wait.
- Mom.

82
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,969
- Wait, Mother.
- Oh, dear.

83
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,779
What's the matter with Mom
this time?

84
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,379
Dan Soo called
and said he'd found Audrey,

85
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,449
so I told your mom about it and...

86
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,889
My gosh. He found her?

87
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,489
That's good news.

88
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:47,759
Yes, I'm relieved to hear that.

89
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,889
Oh, boy. Yes. I'm relieved too.

90
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,030
I thought this news
would make Mom happy too.

91
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,100
What's with her?

92
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,829
She said your grandma was ill.

93
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:01,600
That's why she's so anxious
and angry now.

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
- What? Grandma is ill?
- Oh, no.

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,410
She won't even tell me more.

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,210
Dad, you need to calm down
at a time like this.

97
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,210
Shouldn't finding Grandma
be our priority now?

98
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,480
I've already contacted
Kkotsan Police.

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,819
They may be able to find some clues.

100
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,590
Oh, you're right.

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,889
Thank goodness
you used to be a cop, Father.

102
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,530
- I'll ask around too.
- Yes.

103
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,530
All right. Goodness, anyway...

104
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,300
I really hope
this doesn't wear your mom down.

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,739
Dad, focus.

106
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:35,939
Just focus on finding Grandma.

107
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,610
I'll take care of Mom, all right?

108
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:41,679
Oh, dear.

109
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:53,619
Mom,

110
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,290
shall we watch a movie together
at the terminal?

111
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:57,960
Just the two of us. What do you say?

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,389
Let's watch a movie together
and eat popcorn too, okay?

113
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,460
Let's do that.

114
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Mom.

115
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,119
Myung Ja.

116
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:26,119
Don't be like this.
Let's go home, okay?

117
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,020
You need to get some sleep.

118
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,420
That day...

119
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,800
That was the last time I saw Mom.

120
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,730
That day,

121
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,429
Hong Dan asked me...

122
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,739
to pick up No Ah
from the daycare center.

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,340
I wanted to spend some time
with Mom,

124
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,910
but you didn't answer your phone.

125
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,920
If only
you had picked up your phone,

126
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,350
I wouldn't have let Mom
go home alone.

127
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,730
What if that ends up being
my last memory of her?

128
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,960
Sending Mom home...

129
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,860
all by herself.

130
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:15,569
I bet you were
with Audrey that day too.

131
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,739
And you ignored my calls.

132
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,679
Are you that heavily indebted?

133
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,379
I'm not sure when that was,

134
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,050
but...

135
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,249
stop thinking negative thoughts.

136
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:32,949
I can't forgive you.

137
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,090
I keep thinking about it,
and I really can't forgive you.

138
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,160
Myung Ja.

139
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,730
Don't call my name.
I don't want to hear it.

140
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,869
Goodness. Wait.

141
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,840
Oh, dear.

142
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,110
I really don't know what to do.

143
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,489
You're still up.

144
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,800
Were you at the office?

145
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:17,770
Yes, it took a while
to finish what I had to do.

146
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
The truth is,

147
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,639
I dropped by the office earlier.

148
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,210
You weren't there.

149
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,280
Right, I stepped out
to take care of something...

150
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,050
and have dinner
with a friend of mine.

151
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,650
I needed to get some information
about Heirmez.

152
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,350
A friend? Who?

153
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,489
It's not like you'd know
if I told you.

154
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,420
I want to know
since it's my husband's friend.

155
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,329
You can tell me, can't you?

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,199
Well, you don't really have to know.

157
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:55,339
What happened to your hand?

158
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:56,699
Did you get hurt?

159
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,140
It's nothing.

160
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,540
I'm kind of tired.

161
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,079
What would other wives do...

162
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,280
in this situation?

163
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,490
Would they have shouted at you...

164
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,449
not to lie and to tell the truth?

165
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:16,859
What would've happened
between other couples?

166
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,459
They would've fought...

167
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,199
and turned the whole house
upside down.

168
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,359
That would be normal.

169
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,800
I don't know what you're imagining,

170
00:09:26,469 --> 00:09:27,500
but trust me.

171
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:29,969
How is it normal
to fight as a couple?

172
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,910
It's normal to trust each other.

173
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:43,880
How can I trust you?

174
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,920
It's an obvious lie.

175
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,790
No matter how hard I try,

176
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,189
I can't believe you
because I know it's a lie.

177
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,359
It's so suffocating.

178
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,599
What?

179
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,770
Oh, gosh.

180
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,640
Goodness, how tired is she...

181
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,849
that she's groaning in her sleep
like that?

182
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:47,079
My goodness.

183
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,390
Goodness gracious.

184
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,559
My gosh.

185
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,939
Oh, dear.

186
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,050
My goodness, look at this.

187
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,990
Oh, no.

188
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:32,459
Hey, let me see the other foot too.
Come on.

189
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,500
Gosh, this side looks the same too.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,599
Where did you get scraped up
like this?

191
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,870
Goodness me.

192
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Oh, dear.

193
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,609
Dressed in red

194
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,010
I smell tangy and sweet

195
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,849
I'm a cool tomato

196
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,150
- My gosh.
- I'll become

197
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:02,359
- Darn it.
- I'll become ketchup

198
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,959
- No Ah, that's not it.
- Is she practicing...

199
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,790
- I'll be
- for the open class in her dream?

200
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,660
- I'll be the juice
- Why is she making...

201
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,130
- her whole life about being a mom?
- I will

202
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,030
- You're so obsessed.
- Do a dance

203
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,770
- Dad.
- Hey.

204
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,740
I'll be the juice

205
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,809
I'll become

206
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,979
- Come here.
- Ketchup

207
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,380
- Did you sleep well?
- That's not it.

208
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,250
- No, how could I have slept well?
- I'm a cool tomato

209
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,319
Tomato

210
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,449
No Ah, we did so well.
We're the best.

211
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:33,449
Tomato

212
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:38,429
- Looking buff and cool
- Should we call the police on her?

213
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,599
So, did you get any updates
from Kkotsan Police?

214
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,599
No.

215
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,839
Oh, boy. Let's go to Ilsan...

216
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,939
and Paju today.

217
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:50,939
Okay, Gyeong Tae.

218
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
Oh, Myung Ja. How have you been?

219
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,750
Hi.

220
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:01,420
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

221
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,849
You should just stay at home.

222
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:07,219
I'll look around
with Detective An today.

223
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,359
Don't worry about Mother.

224
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:10,760
Didn't you listen to what I said?

225
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,260
I said I didn't need your help.

226
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,439
Let's go.

227
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:23,099
Okay.

228
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:29,709
- Oh, my.
- Hey.

229
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,280
You're working hard
so bright and early.

230
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:35,449
If Gyeong Tae calls me, I must...

231
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,120
come running right away.

232
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,189
Gosh, you startled me.

233
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:41,390
Were you singing a song
or something?

234
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,859
Across the Pacific

235
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,990
Would you run across oceans
to come running for him?

236
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,699
- Come on.
- Oh, my.

237
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,599
Hey, have Myung Ja
rest at home today.

238
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,839
She was moaning all night
in her sleep yesterday.

239
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,770
Her feet were all banged up too.

240
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,309
Her shoes looked downright raggedy.

241
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,339
How would her feet
be any better off?

242
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,910
Gosh, it breaks my heart.

243
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,750
I tell her to rest,

244
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,020
but she refuses to listen to me.

245
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,689
She seemed really upset.

246
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,189
Gyeong Tae was just trying
to do his best too.

247
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,189
Goodness, if you don't know
the struggles she has been through,

248
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,229
you should just keep your mouth shut
and stay out of it.

249
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,900
Throughout their entire marriage,

250
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,329
she put up with so much
because of Gyeong Tae.

251
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,870
Who knows what his mind was on?

252
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,910
He kept wandering around
to go fishing or whatever.

253
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,579
You went fishing with him, right?

254
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:43,219
You're a pair of accomplices.

255
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,890
Gyeong Tae,
you have no excuses to give.

256
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,790
While you were going fishing
in every province in the country,

257
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,490
Myung Ja had to run the household
all by herself.

258
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,699
Gosh, it must've built up
in her heart all those years...

259
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:56,800
until it exploded.

260
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,140
Gyeong Tae,
find your mother-in-law quickly...

261
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,569
unless you want Myung Ja
to divorce you.

262
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,740
Divorce, my foot!
Don't even mention it!

263
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,510
I guess
you don't want to get dumped.

264
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,309
- My gosh! Hey, let's go.
- Whatever.

265
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:13,949
But I'm hungry.

266
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,179
The murderously delicious
soy sauce marinated crab.

267
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,890
Can we have some of it before we go?

268
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,459
Did you bring your handcuffs?

269
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,189
Handcuffs?

270
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:28,429
I brought them.

271
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,199
Then I guess
you'd have to arrest me.

272
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
My gosh.

273
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,439
Gyeong Tae, wait up!

274
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,439
I'll arrest you next time.

275
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,510
Gyeong Tae!

276
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,280
My goodness. Seriously.

277
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,390
A man as burly as him
should make sure to eat breakfast.

278
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:56,520
Oh, my. I shouldn't be worrying
about that burly man right now.

279
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,959
My best friend
who's also my sister-in-law...

280
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,429
is on the verge of breaking down.

281
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:04,370
Good grief, Maeng Gyeong Bok.
Get a grip.

282
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,870
My goodness.

283
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
Oh, my.

284
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,770
Are you staying home today?

285
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,410
Dan Soo called and said
he was coming home with Audrey.

286
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,640
I thought I'd catch up with her...

287
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,050
over a meal.

288
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,550
By the way,
Gyeong Tae left with Detective An.

289
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,650
You know those two are experts.

290
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,589
You should just leave it
to the cops...

291
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,120
and get some rest today, okay?

292
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,459
How could I rest?

293
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,959
I don't know where my mom is
or how she's doing.

294
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,260
Stop being so stubborn, will you?

295
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,469
You should just stay here
and work in the shop today.

296
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:42,370
The shop is a total mess
without you.

297
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,270
And the house too.

298
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,109
You're a daughter,
but you're a mother too.

299
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,510
Gosh, think of your kids too.

300
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,809
I didn't even notice
my mom disappearing...

301
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,679
as I was worrying over the shop
and my kids.

302
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:59,089
I was making a fuss
about living my own life...

303
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,719
and made my mom leave.

304
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,819
So what if everything is a mess?

305
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,160
I should find my mom first.

306
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,160
I'll just serve Dan Soo breakfast...

307
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:08,429
and get going right away.

308
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:12,370
Goodness, you won't even budge.

309
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:14,939
I'm back!

310
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:22,939
Come on in.

311
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,309
My mom came with me too.

312
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,720
My, how nice is that?
I'm so happy for you.

313
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,649
You must've had a hard time.

314
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,659
Sorry for making you worry.

315
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,389
Shouldn't we throw a party today
or something?

316
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:44,260
Well, it is Dan Soo's birthday,

317
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,030
so I was going to make him
some seaweed soup.

318
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,800
I bought all the ingredients.

319
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,770
I'll cook you a birthday meal later
for dinner.

320
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,940
Oh, thank you,

321
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,780
but in the evening,

322
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:58,109
we have somewhere to go.

323
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,059
This is where I'm staying.

324
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,800
When I was in this room last time,

325
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,270
I noticed you still had that.

326
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,339
I was happy to see it,
but it made me sad at the same time.

327
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,710
Oh, this?

328
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,450
All done.

329
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,220
I made this as I thought of you,
Geon.

330
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,230
Oh, my.

331
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,930
Isn't it adorable?

332
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,260
Keep this with you.

333
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,369
It means
I'm always by your side, Geon.

334
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,899
You made this for me, Mom.

335
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,010
I always held this in my arms
and never once let it go.

336
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,710
But after Dad passed away,

337
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,639
Grandma came to get me.

338
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,450
The day when I left Kkotsan
in a hurry...

339
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:12,389
Sweetheart, you have to come
and live with Grandma now.

340
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:14,720
No, I want to stay here.

341
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,990
You can't stay here.

342
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,190
Come on. Let's go.

343
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,059
You have to come with us, Dan Soo.

344
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,899
No! I don't want to leave!

345
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,639
But at that moment, I heard
Maeng Gong Hee calling my name.

346
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:33,710
Geon!

347
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,740
Hey! Snot Face!

348
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,109
Hey, where are you going?

349
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,119
I know you love this.

350
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,020
You left this! Where are you going?

351
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,750
Don't go!

352
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,619
Maeng Gong Hee...

353
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,230
ran after me at full speed
to give me this.

354
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:56,129
That day, she couldn't give me this.

355
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,230
But she kept this for 20 years.

356
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm grateful...

357
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
to Gong Hee.

358
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,669
I'm grateful for her too,
and she's lovely.

359
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,510
To me, Gong Hee is...
How should I put this?

360
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,210
She symbolizes my hometown
and my childhood innocence.

361
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:15,520
She was like a mom to me,

362
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,819
and she was my family.

363
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,490
Sometimes, I get jealous of Gong Boo
and Auntie Gyeong Bok.

364
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,790
They're Gong Hee's family,
so they can see her all their lives.

365
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,200
Gu Dan Soo!

366
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:35,399
Whenever I think of her...

367
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,740
or tell someone about her,

368
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,839
she always shows up.

369
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,240
It's so fascinating.

370
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:46,450
Maeng Gong Hee.

371
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,050
Are you happy
that you met your mom again?

372
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Yes, I'm happy.

373
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,119
Congratulations.
Well done, Gu Dan Soo.

374
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,220
Can you check
to make sure this isn't a dream?

375
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,430
- Happy now?
- Hey, it hurts.

376
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,200
I never asked you
to pinch my cheek that hard.

377
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,800
You're way too strong.

378
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,369
Goodness. Look at you yapping away.

379
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,069
Gu Dan Soo really is back.

380
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,669
Happy birthday.

381
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,339
What? That's it?

382
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,250
What is this?
It looks like an umbrella.

383
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,020
Will it cause a lightning strike
when it's open?

384
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,089
I'll get you one
when something like that is invented.

385
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
Oh, my.

386
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,800
Out of all the gifts I've received,
this is...

387
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,770
This is the smallest one.

388
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,940
- Then give it back.
- No!

389
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:47,940
It's the smallest gift
I've received,

390
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,280
but it's also the most touching one.

391
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,780
What was that?

392
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,480
You really hate it
when you get wet in the rain.

393
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,649
Don't get rained on from now on.

394
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,750
That's why I got you this.

395
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,190
Okay. From now on, I'll use this
so I won't get rained on.

396
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,430
I'll stay nice and dry.
Cheerful and Happy. Sounds good?

397
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:11,730
What? It's kind of cool to see you
appreciate such a small gift.

398
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Then here.

399
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:18,639
What?

400
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,109
Goodness. Here you go.

401
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,909
Good boy, Gu Dan Soo. You're cool.

402
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:29,879
Oh, hello.

403
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,490
Ms. Audrey, I'm so glad you're back.

404
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:36,419
Congratulations
on meeting Dan Soo again.

405
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,690
Thank you.

406
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,790
Mom, you should just talk casually
to her too.

407
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,859
She's your son's friend.

408
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:47,569
I still find it so hard to believe
that you're Dan Soo's mom.

409
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,540
I mean, you're so beautiful.
How come he...

410
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,980
Hey, what does that mean?
What's wrong with me?

411
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
Thank you.

412
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,379
It's all thanks to you...

413
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,280
that I could meet Dan Soo again.

414
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
My goodness.

415
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,550
Yes, it's the best birthday gift
I've ever received.

416
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,520
It's been a while.

417
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,319
What?

418
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,889
Seeing you smile like that.

419
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,700
You and me both.

420
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:19,829
You're right.
It's been a while indeed.

421
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,970
You're always the one
who makes me smile again.

422
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,740
You make me smile too.

423
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,909
Really? Then smile.

424
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,409
I am smiling now.

425
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,780
I mean, smile always.
Even when I'm not around.

426
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,849
Welcome back.

427
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,619
I'm so happy.

428
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:47,329
We don't have a patient
named Im Sun Yi.

429
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Mom.

430
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,399
Where on earth are you hiding?

431
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,020
What?

432
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,149
Mom?

433
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,619
Mom.

434
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm sorry.

435
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Put these on.

436
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,839
It's still chilly.
Your hands must be cold.

437
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:34,440
No, I'm good. You should wear them.

438
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,540
Just put them on.

439
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,710
I told you
never to dress so lightly.

440
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,550
You're an adult now,
yet you still won't listen to me.

441
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,050
You always catch a cold
in between seasons.

442
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,419
Listen to Mom, please.

443
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,319
Oh, hello.

444
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,960
I guess she thought
you were her daughter.

445
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:54,899
My daughter is here.

446
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,859
Isn't my daughter so beautiful?

447
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,839
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

448
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,639
Ma'am, she isn't your daughter.

449
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,139
You should go back inside.

450
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:27,889
Mom.

451
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,730
Have you been keeping well?

452
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,339
Your daughter...

453
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,409
is doing great, so don't worry.

454
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,470
Even if you get an upset stomach,

455
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,839
never skip your meals.

456
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,450
And don't forget...

457
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,149
to take your medicine.

458
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,919
Okay.

459
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,819
All right.

460
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:22,980
Don't be sick, Mom.

461
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,319
You shouldn't fall ill, Mom.

462
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,389
Don't be sick.

463
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,700
What's taking him so long?

464
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,740
Are you sure you called him?

465
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,500
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,339
He'll be here soon.

467
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,109
Grandma!

468
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,180
I'm here, Grandma.

469
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,680
Yes, Dan Soo. You're here.

470
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:57,550
Mom's here too.

471
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,550
What?

472
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,530
You...

473
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,329
How dare you set foot in here?

474
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,500
Dan Soo, how could you...

475
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,069
You...

476
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,309
From now on, I need you
to accept her as my mom, Grandma.

477
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:30,020
Oh, my. I see that you prepared
seaweed soup for my birthday.

478
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,859
You should sit too, Grandma.

479
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,559
Doesn't the seaweed soup
look so good, Mom?

480
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,559
Yes.

481
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,030
Grandma!

482
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,720
(My Merry Marriage)

483
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,990
I know you two have hated each other
for many years.

484
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,960
But you're my family, you know.

485
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,389
I want to try my best
to patch things up.

486
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,730
No Ah, what's wrong?

487
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,960
- No Ah is sick.
- My goodness.

488
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,059
Mom.

489
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:19,629
No Ah, Mom's here.
Are you feeling really sick?

490
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:21,430
At 6 p.m., okay? I made a reservation.

491
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,599
It's such a romantic place.

492
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,510
He sure loves his wife very much.

493
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,970
Everyone's gentleman
is all yours now.

494
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,740
Lucky you, Gong Hee.

495
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,849
