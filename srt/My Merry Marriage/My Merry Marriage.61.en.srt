00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,219
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:31,829
I love you, Maeng Gong Hee.

3
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:34,939
Even though
I realized it too late...

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,570
I'm sorry I realized it so late.

5
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:40,209
But I love you,

6
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,279
Maeng Gong Hee.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,110
Don't die.

8
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,450
Don't die.

9
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,079
Please don't die.

10
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,159
(Episode 61)

11
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,890
We're finally getting married.

12
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,860
Why are you in such a rush
as if you're being chased?

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,530
I feel like we might never
get married if I don't do this.

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,670
This is the best thing for us.

15
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,170
By the way,
why do I feel so anxious?

16
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,339
What are you anxious about?

17
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,979
I don't know. I just keep
feeling anxious for some reason.

18
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:19,549
Do you really think
we can get married?

19
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,990
(Emergency Medical Center)

20
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,940
You're with
Ms. Maeng Gong Hee, right?

21
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,109
Yes.

22
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:47,080
- She needs absolute rest...
- Doctor.

23
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,210
One moment.

24
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:52,449
You woke up?

25
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:54,020
You fainted earlier.

26
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,350
What have you been up to?

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,550
You were always very healthy.

28
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,660
Doctor, I'm fine.

29
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,770
Ms. Maeng, it looks like you've been
overworked and stressed,

30
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,770
but right now...

31
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,910
You know about the state
your body is in now, right?

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,139
Yes.

33
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,680
You don't need to say anything else.

34
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:26,009
Today, you can go home
once the IV drip is finished,

35
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,080
but you have to be very careful.

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,279
- Okay, understood.
- All right, then.

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,960
What kind of condition are you in
for the doctor to say that?

38
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,230
Is there something wrong with you?

39
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,869
Nothing's wrong with me.
Stop overreacting.

40
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,300
I should go home.

41
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,700
Hey, she said to wait
until the IV drip was done.

42
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:50,869
If my mom finds out,
it'll become a huge deal.

43
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:52,809
She already has enough on her plate
because of my brother.

44
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,409
So why are you sick?

45
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,939
Do you know how surprised I was?

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,510
I really thought...

47
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,950
something bad might happen to you.

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,950
I'm sorry for calling you.

49
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,619
I didn't want my family
to find out and worry about me.

50
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:13,360
That was why I called you.
Don't read too much into it.

51
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:16,230
Hey, am I telling you off
for calling me?

52
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,330
How could you work yourself so hard
that you collapsed?

53
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,670
And why were you walking around
in the rain?

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,039
Excuse me. Could you take out my IV?

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,939
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

56
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:42,619
It never felt weird
when I lived alone.

57
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,559
Why did I let someone into my home?

58
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,400
I don't want to go home
to an empty house anymore.

59
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,999
I won't live by myself.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,939
I don't want to be alone!

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,779
What are you looking at?

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,219
Have you never seen a woman
break off her marriage in a week?

63
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,980
Marriage?

64
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,349
It's like bungee jumping.

65
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,159
You go up to the highest point,

66
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,289
and you fall the farthest
and for the longest time!

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,900
Just like bungee jumping.

68
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,610
Dance around happily

69
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,210
- And stop right in place
- Stop!

70
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,580
- Dance around happily
- Goodness, you're so good.

71
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,049
- And stop right in place
- This smart boy can sing well too.

72
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:48,760
Well, the more I look at him,

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,460
- Don't close your eyes
- the more he resembles his dad.

74
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,330
- Don't smile either
- He shouldn't take after me...

75
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,560
- And don't cry
- in how unlucky I am in marriage.

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,060
- Don't move at all
- Your son is listening.

77
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,200
- Dance around happily
- I'm sorry.

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,739
- And stop right in place
- Soo Yeon raised a smart boy.

79
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,700
Having a baby
and raising him all by herself...

80
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,810
- Dance around
- must've been so hard.

81
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,679
- Happily and stop
- She must've cried every day.

82
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,450
- Right in place
- Did anyone make her do that?

83
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,219
- I can never forgive her.
- Don't close your eyes

84
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,520
- Don't smile either
- I can't forgive you.

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,120
- And don't cry
- Come on, Mom.

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,589
- Don't move at all
- I'm a victim too.

87
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,620
Be quiet.

88
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,489
The only victim is the child.

89
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:25,489
The adults are all responsible.

90
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,659
A child...

91
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,900
is carefully chosen and sent down
to parents from the skies.

92
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,640
Raising that child well...

93
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,239
and sending them out into the world
is an assignment that life gives us.

94
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,710
Don't ever think of running away.
Do your duty until the end.

95
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,179
That's how you can call yourself
an adult.

96
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,049
Yes, Grandma.

97
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,419
All right, then. Start again.

98
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,750
Start singing. Ready, go!

99
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,789
Don't close your eyes

100
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,419
Don't smile either

101
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,659
And don't cry, don't move at all

102
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,799
- Dance around happily
- My, look at him.

103
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,130
- And stop right in place
- My goodness.

104
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,099
- Dance around
- Poke.

105
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:12,270
- Happily
- Poke!

106
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,979
- And stop right in place
- In place!

107
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,039
(Maeng Dumplings)

108
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,479
My heart is wasting away,

109
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
but everyone seems...

110
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,320
Ssook Ssook.

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,789
What do we do now?

112
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,969
Are you shooting a drama
or something?

113
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,049
Red light, green light

114
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Why did you come here?

115
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,219
Well...

116
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,359
I didn't come because
I had something to say to you.

117
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:06,390
I was just passing by.

118
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,460
I actually wanted to talk to you.

119
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,130
I'm glad you're here.

120
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,630
Hong Dan.

121
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,500
- Let's...
- My gosh.

122
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,109
No matter how serious
you try to look,

123
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:20,310
I won't fall for it.

124
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,909
I'm off.

125
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:33,620
Let's...

126
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:35,989
split up now.

127
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,929
Let's break up.

128
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,460
I have a conscience too.

129
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,169
I can't ask you to raise
someone else's child too.

130
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,029
Your conscience...

131
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,339
is suddenly rearing its head
at this time?

132
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,339
After everything?

133
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,380
It should, before it's too late.

134
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,979
Everything happened
because I'm a pathetic loser.

135
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,349
I won't make you
take on my burdens too.

136
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,520
I'll deal with my life on my own.

137
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,159
So let's just split up now.

138
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:11,589
Hey.

139
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,299
Hey, Maeng Gong Boo.

140
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,729
I'm letting you go.

141
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:18,630
You should leave when you can.

142
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:22,500
If you stay with me,
you'll only face more trouble.

143
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,710
I didn't know this either,

144
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,310
but I guess
I'm quite an unlucky guy.

145
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,779
Hong Dan.

146
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:33,810
I don't want to cause you
any more heartache.

147
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,479
I really don't.

148
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,919
- Daddy.
- Hey.

149
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,190
I want to go to the bathroom too.

150
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,989
Do you? Okay, let's go.

151
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,630
Forget about everything.

152
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,330
Eat good food,

153
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,029
and take care of yourself.

154
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,380
He's always telling me
to forget and eat good food.

155
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,620
Why are you acting
all serious now...

156
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,490
after being silly all this time?

157
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,390
It doesn't suit you at all.

158
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,760
(This way to the orthopedic clinic)

159
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,000
Darn it.

160
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,470
Why do I feel like I've been dumped?

161
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,179
I should forget everything?

162
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,179
Forget what?

163
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,150
How could I forget?

164
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,350
Maeng Gong Boo, you jerk.

165
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,650
Come on.

166
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,449
You dare to refuse
the first egg from our chickens?

167
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,500
There you go.

168
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,100
You're eating so well.

169
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,480
Will you refuse Gu Dan Soo's
first egg soup? Come on.

170
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,319
Gosh, darn it.

171
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,189
Oh, that's hot.

172
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
This is...

173
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
Do you remember?

174
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,829
When we were little,
and I had a raging fever,

175
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:33,990
you'd make this for me.

176
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,059
You'd go into the chicken coop,

177
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,500
fend off
all of the fluttering chickens,

178
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,069
and make this for me
with warm, freshly laid eggs.

179
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,740
I couldn't wait
until the chickens laid eggs...

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,409
like you used to,

181
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,880
but I put all my effort into this.

182
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,150
Try it.

183
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,159
Does it taste bad?

184
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,959
Well...

185
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,900
It's just like my aunt says.

186
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,929
It's so good that
you wouldn't even notice...

187
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:11,970
someone dying next to you.

188
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,870
Eat up.

189
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,250
When you were running
with me on your back,

190
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,390
you told me not to die.

191
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,220
When I was on your back,

192
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,360
I thought of you
when you were young.

193
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,900
When you collapsed
after your dad passed away,

194
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,169
I think I said the same thing to you
as I ran with you on my back.

195
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:48,870
"Don't die."

196
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,640
So, I cried.

197
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,179
Because I felt bad for you.

198
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Hey.

199
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,819
You fainted,
and I carried you on my back.

200
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,819
What? You felt bad for me?

201
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:09,220
You're unbelievable.

202
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,289
Just eat your food.

203
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,909
("The Life Before Us")

204
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,529
Where did she go?

205
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,370
You're not even feeling well.
What are you doing outside?

206
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,900
I was feeling cooped up.

207
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,309
Just tell me.

208
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,010
Something's up with you, right?

209
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,209
I found out.

210
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:42,449
What?

211
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,120
Who Mr. Seo's ex-girlfriend was.

212
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,919
He said he had an ex-girlfriend...

213
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,189
and that they decided
to get back together.

214
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,600
It was Ms. Kang Ji Na.

215
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,069
Darn it. I knew this would happen.

216
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,010
So, you knew?

217
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Hey.

218
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,409
Was that why you were so shocked?

219
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,309
You wandered in the rain
and passed out.

220
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,419
Way to go.

221
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:17,520
That is not why I passed out.

222
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,549
I've been overworking myself.
That's why.

223
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,959
But you know,

224
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,829
I couldn't believe it
even when I saw it with my own eyes.

225
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:29,159
Just believe it.

226
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,730
Why can't you believe it
when you saw it?

227
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,929
What you saw is the fact.

228
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,069
I want to ask him...

229
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,970
if I wasn't mistaken.

230
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,809
Why bother asking him?
You have good eyesight.

231
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,709
Don't tell me...

232
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,279
Are you still hung up on Seo Min Gi?

233
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,150
No, I am not.

234
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,020
It's not...

235
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,289
that simple.

236
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,890
Aren't you curious...

237
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,100
how I showed up so quickly
in the middle of the night?

238
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:06,870
I was already
in front of your house.

239
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:10,100
- Why?
- I was just out walking...

240
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,640
and ended up here
because I missed you.

241
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,010
When I got your call...

242
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,909
and heard you call my name,
I was so happy,

243
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,650
thinking you also needed me
and waited for me.

244
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,850
When I saw you in that state,

245
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,390
do you know how angry it made me?

246
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,549
I thought,
"I shouldn't have moved out."

247
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,289
"I should've been there for her."

248
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:32,429
Maeng Gong Hee.

249
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,029
Did you know this?

250
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,529
You were the reason I went to work.

251
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,299
You were the reason I stayed here
for as long as I did.

252
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,799
I did all of it...

253
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,470
because of you.

254
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,740
That's how much you mean to me.

255
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,610
Even if you push me away,

256
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,110
I'll be standing out front again
because I'll miss you.

257
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,010
If you call me,
I'll come running again like a fool.

258
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:54,449
Maeng Gong Hee. To me, you're...

259
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,679
Gu Dan Soo.

260
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,289
Let's just...

261
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,520
be strangers.

262
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,059
What?

263
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,829
Strangers?

264
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,659
You said you couldn't stay
by my side as a friend.

265
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,169
You're right. I can no longer
be friends with you either.

266
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,370
Let's just be strangers...

267
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,600
as if we never knew each other.

268
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,539
Do you really mean that?

269
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,380
What you just said.

270
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:30,350
I'm asking if you really meant it.

271
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,150
Why would I lie to you?

272
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Yes.

273
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,979
This is the right thing to do.

274
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,419
I'm sure I did the right thing.

275
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,110
Mom.

276
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,280
Where did she go?

277
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,820
(I'm going home. Make a choice
that will make you happy.)

278
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,330
I'm going home.

279
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,159
Make a choice
that will make you happy.

280
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:27,130
She's a pro
at running away by herself.

281
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:52,959
Oh, no.

282
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,300
(Baeknyeon Spine Hospital)

283
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,509
Now that
my children are all grown up,

284
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,340
I thought I could marry them off
and just wish them all the best.

285
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,479
Feeling a little empty but relieved
at the same time.

286
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,380
I wanted to take a breather
and enjoy some fresh air.

287
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,790
But now,
I have another burden to bear.

288
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,390
This time, it's my grandson.

289
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,360
Peace of mind matters more
than physical comfort.

290
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:25,759
What can I do?

291
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:29,659
Yes.

292
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:31,830
I will raise my grandson.

293
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,669
No Ah, you're going to live
with Grandma from now on.

294
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,080

295
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,390
Geon.

296
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,219
My son, Geon.

297
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,959
There are so many things
I want to say to you.

298
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,360
Even if I stay up all night,
I won't be able to write everything.

299
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,330
And that's why I don't even know
what to write first.

300
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,300
My dear son, Geon.

301
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,780
I'll wait for you at the benches
in the center of Sowol Park.

302
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,320
If you read this letter,
come and meet me there.

303
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,850
I'll be there from 3 p.m. and on.

304
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
I'll wait until you come.

305
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Excuse me.

306
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:12,800
Hello.

307
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:14,169
Hello.

308
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,840
Well, do I know you?

309
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:21,709
Oh, my goodness. Look who's here.

310
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:25,280
Didn't Hae Joon look up to you
as if you were his big brother?

311
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,419
Yes. My goodness, but...

312
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,689
You know, you shouldn't be here.

313
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,019
Is Dan Soo inside?

314
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:35,560
Yes, he is.

315
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
What about Chairwoman Hwang?

316
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,860
She's at work.

317
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,130
Well...

318
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:46,800
Could you give this to Dan Soo?

319
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:48,269
Please.

320
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,939
What? But how could I take this...

321
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:54,669
Gosh, I'd get in big trouble
if the chairwoman were to find out.

322
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,949
This is my last wish in life.

323
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:01,949
Please do me this favor.

324
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:03,919
My goodness.

325
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,390
Dan Soo.

326
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:34,280
Dan Soo, I'll leave this letter
for you on your desk.

327
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,620
Oh, dear.

328
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,620
If the chairwoman finds out,

329
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,249
she'll be in an uproar.

330
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,590
Goodness. Even if she ran off,
she's still his mom.

331
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,900
Oh, ma'am.

332
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,330
What brings you home at this hour?

333
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,300
And what brings you into the house?

334
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,110
I thought you had a lot to do
in the garden today.

335
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:01,009
Yes, well...

336
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:05,009
Dan Soo asked me
to bring something for him.

337
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,449
Well, then. Please excuse me.

338
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,110
(Mom)

339
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,550
(I'll wait for you at the benches
in the center of Sowol Park.)

340
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,620
Let's go.

341
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
You have a breakfast meeting...

342
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,949
with the chairman of Seoyeon Group
in an hour.

343
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:22,159
Cancel the meeting
and get the car ready.

344
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,959
Yes, ma'am.

345
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,830
Grandma?

346
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,269
Dan Soo.

347
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,469
Yes. Aren't you busy with work?

348
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,040
Why are you home at this hour?

349
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,580
Oh, I have a meeting nearby.

350
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,979
I came home to take a short break.

351
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,390
By the way, where are you going?

352
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,150
I'm going on a trip.

353
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,219
A trip? Why, all of a sudden?

354
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,560
My head is on fire.

355
00:26:00,189 --> 00:26:02,199
The fire alarm is blaring.
It's really loud.

356
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,130
I'll be back.

357
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,900
Dan Soo, wait.

358
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
You're not...

359
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:15,810
heading out to meet someone,
are you?

360
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,780
Like who?

361
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,179
Did you perhaps get
a strange phone call or something?

362
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,320
I did get a strange phone call.

363
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,489
What?

364
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,610
Here.

365
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,479
You must be busy
preparing for the fashion show.

366
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,120
I called you to have some coffee
and take a breather.

367
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,350
I see.

368
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,100
Should I have gotten you
something else besides coffee?

369
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,429
It's fine.

370
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,769
So...

371
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,540
I have something to ask you.

372
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,810
Yes. What is it? Go ahead.

373
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,850
The person you're dating...

374
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,519
Is it Ms. Kang Ji Na?

375
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,130
I was going to tell you first.

376
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:42,330
I guess it's too late now.

377
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,400
Then, the person you dated
for a long time...

378
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:49,100
and got back together with
after the breakup was...

379
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:51,699
Yes.

380
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,969
It's Ms. Kang.

381
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
I'm going to...

382
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,249
marry her soon.

383
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,419
You're getting married?

384
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,769
(My Merry Marriage)

385
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:28,409
- Is this Ms. Maeng Gong Hee?
- Yes.

386
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,110
We have your test results
from your early pregnancy checkup.

387
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,949
Maeng Gong Hee is pregnant?

388
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,080
Hong Dan.
You're a really great woman.

389
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,090
Don't let a guy like me
hold you back.

390
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,090
Live happily.

391
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,919
No Ah,
what's your wish for the new year?

392
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:46,790
I want to live with Mommy and Daddy
as a family.

393
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,959
Maeng Gong Hee, aren't you
even wishing me a happy new year?

394
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,729
Happy New Year, Maeng Ggong.

395
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
