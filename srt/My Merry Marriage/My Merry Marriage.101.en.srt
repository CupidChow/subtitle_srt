1
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,109
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,909
Hi.

3
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,850
Ssook Ssook.

4
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:31,980
Oh, my.

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,049
Mom's belly has gotten flat.

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,490
That's because Ssook Ssook
has moved out of her home.

7
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,990
Ssook Ssook
will move in with us now.

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,360
But what if Ssook Ssook says...

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,529
she wants to move back
to her old house?

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,700
Well, No Ah.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,910
You can become
a precious big brother to her.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,810
Then she'll never say she wants
to leave you and move back there.

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,480
I am Ssook Ssook's
precious older brother.

14
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,350
- My goodness.
- Oh, my. I see.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,319
How long do you plan to stay
at the postpartum care center?

16
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,490
Well, not too long.

17
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:12,959
Just for a little while.

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,990
Mom.

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,200
Thanks in advance for your help.

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,499
Me? What do you mean?

21
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,969
Well, while taking care
of a newborn,

22
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,169
I heard you had to...

23
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,240
hold the baby to sleep
even during the day.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,140
Mother, it'd be amazing...

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,309
if you could hold her
during the day.

26
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:33,550
I have to get her to nap?

27
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:35,910
Yes. Newborns have weak stomachs,

28
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,919
so they poop several times a day.

29
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:39,880
We'll need your help, Mom.

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,190
What, poop? Me?

31
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,190
Yes.

32
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,059
Yes. Mother, I still feel so weak.

33
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:53,300
And if babies don't burp properly,

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,630
they get bloated.
I hear it's quite painful for them.

35
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,470
So if you could help her burp too,

36
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,110
it'd be so amazing.

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,169
Help her burp too?

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,780
Oh, one more thing.
I'll be breastfeeding her,

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,780
so I'll have to
pump my breastmilk often.

40
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,880
If No Ah...

41
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,919
is running around
when I'm doing that,

42
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,289
it'll be hard to focus.

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,289
So it'd be great
if you could take No Ah outside...

44
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:19,220
and play with him, Mother.

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,959
Oh, on days
when the weather is nice,

46
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,929
you could take him somewhere far
for a good walk.

47
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:27,130
My goodness. What is this?

48
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,900
They might ask you to raise her
until she starts elementary school.

49
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,239
- Not until college?
- You're right.

50
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,639
I've had enough of this.

51
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,739
You guys planned this, didn't you?

52
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:39,979
I knew it from the moment...

53
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,710
you moved out of your place
and came to live with us.

54
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,919
I'm sorry, Mother.

55
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,850
I'm sorry, Grandma.

56
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,590
You don't have to be sorry, No Ah.

57
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:52,660
Of course not.
Your grandma is lucky to have you.

58
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:56,930
I'll give you that luck.

59
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:59,600
I mean, I'm lucky to have you.

60
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:00,900
My gosh.

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,100
Oh, my. How adorable.

62
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,109
- My gosh.
- It's Gong Hee.

63
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,370
Hey, Gong Hee.

64
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,210
Goodness, I couldn't call you
because things were so hectic.

65
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,210
Hong Dan just had her baby.

66
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,019
It's a girl.
She looks just like your brother.

67
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:21,989
What?

68
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,799
- Gong Hee!
- Mom.

69
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,199
- My gosh.
- Mom.

70
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,269
Oh, dear. Why are you here alone?

71
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,380
Why did you have your baby alone?

72
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,410
Giving birth is such a scary ordeal.

73
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,880
How did you do it alone?

74
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,180
- Mom.
- Gong Hee...

75
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,720
I was scared.

76
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,019
I was so scared
that I might lose Momo, Mom.

77
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,389
Where is Min Gi now?

78
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,030
Where are all of your in-laws?

79
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,130
How could they not even show up...

80
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,970
while you were here in this state?

81
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,039
Goodness, how could they do this?
Just how...

82
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,810
My goodness.

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,210
You've seen the sales reports
and contracts I sent, right?

84
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:23,919
I opened a boutique
in Raphaen Department Store.

85
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,049
How did you manage that...

86
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,650
in less than a year?

87
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,989
No one has been able to do that.

88
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,160
That's because
I'm not just any old person.

89
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,189
Of course, it wasn't easy.

90
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:38,729
It was hard enough to break down
the stereotypes of Korean brands.

91
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,330
But who am I?
I'm Holly, the designer.

92
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,900
You picked a fight
with the wrong opponent, Grandma.

93
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,510
Now, it's time for you
to keep your promise.

94
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,739
When I said I'd go to France,

95
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,249
you made me a promise.

96
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,379
You said you'd accept Mom
if I successfully...

97
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,950
launched the brand
in the European market.

98
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,890
I did.

99
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,160
Keep your word.

100
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:07,359
You, me, and Mom. The three of us...

101
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:09,429
are a family.

102
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,030
Grandma.

103
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,239
You're not even asking me
to name you my heir.

104
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,939
Why are you so obsessed
with this mere issue?

105
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,410
How come
you have such little ambition?

106
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,039
"This mere issue?"

107
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,510
This is a huge ambition for me.

108
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,580
It's about the happiness
of my family.

109
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:31,020
I am the only family you have.

110
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,489
Why are you going back
on your word now, Madam Chairwoman?

111
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,020
You said you'd accept my mom,

112
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,090
so keep your promise.

113
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:41,189
I'll think that you've accepted Mom
as your family now.

114
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:45,129
Now,
we'll all get along as a family.

115
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,400
Then tell her
to come and live with me.

116
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,270
What?

117
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,869
That's what it means
to accept her as my family.

118
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,010
Can she be a part of the family...

119
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,140
if she only takes what she wants...

120
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,410
and doesn't take any responsibility?

121
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,210
Tell her to come and live with me.

122
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,179
Let's see how long she will last.

123
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:06,850
That's up to Mom.

124
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,590
Do you have to live together
to be a family?

125
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,919
I told you not to go back
on your promise.

126
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,919
Don't be so mean, Grandma.

127
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,499
Are you really going to have
Oh Jung Eun live with you?

128
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,570
Dan Soo is refusing to budge.

129
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,609
What else can I do besides this?

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,039
When you covet something
you can't have,

131
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,979
you must face the consequences.

132
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,710
She'll learn that
through experience.

133
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:44,859
The baby was born prematurely.

134
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,559
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Come quickly.

135
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,400
What are you doing?

136
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,570
What's my next appointment?

137
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,169
Oh, yes, ma'am.

138
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,600
In an hour... So...

139
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,169
You have a lunch meeting
at Sujeonggwan.

140
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,220
I told your dad...

141
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:21,530
and the others not to come.

142
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:24,960
I must still be in pain,

143
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,900
so I didn't want you to be stressed.

144
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,729
Okay, good.

145
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,070
I just want to be alone for a while.

146
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,109
Oh, my goodness.

147
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,379
Where is that son of yours?

148
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:46,749
Why are you here alone?

149
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,890
Hey, the thing is...

150
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,989
Min Gi is away
on a business trip now.

151
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:53,820
- He can't come and go so easily...
- Hey.

152
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,929
My Gong Hee was all alone
in that house...

153
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,229
when she went into labor,

154
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,629
and she was brought
to the hospital alone.

155
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,400
How little do you care about her?

156
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,669
She's not some stranger.

157
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:04,369
She's your family
who lives with you.

158
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:06,970
How could you pay
so little attention?

159
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,679
That son of yours hasn't even called
since he went on that business trip.

160
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,840
And what about you?
You went to see your friends?

161
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,609
What on earth does my Gong Hee mean
to your family?

162
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,619
Did I go out while knowing
the baby would be born?

163
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,320
Hey. If you were going into labor,
you should've said so.

164
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,919
Why must you make me out
to be the mean one?

165
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,059
You didn't mention anything
before I left.

166
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:35,929
Oh, here he is.

167
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,970
Gong Hee, I'm sorry I came so late.

168
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,739
Come here. We'll talk more outside.

169
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,010
Hey, let go of me first!

170
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,049
Come on. Let's go.

171
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,290
Are you feeling okay?

172
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
What about the baby?

173
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,519
The baby is in the NICU...

174
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,060
for being born too early.

175
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,659
I had no idea. I was just working.

176
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,359
I came running as soon as I heard.

177
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,129
Had I known sooner,

178
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:10,430
- I wouldn't have left you alone.
- No.

179
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,869
Nothing would've changed
even if you had known.

180
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,409
What do you mean by that?

181
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,109
You became much busier
after we got married.

182
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,180
You'd leave the office with Ms. Kang
for meetings...

183
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:25,080
and go far away for work trips.

184
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,479
Even when you came home,

185
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,389
all you said was
that you were tired.

186
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:29,619
That was...

187
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,859
just because of work.

188
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,129
There's nothing going on
with Ms. Kang either.

189
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,430
She's just a colleague.

190
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,090
I explained it to you already.

191
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,399
(Ji Na)

192
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,139
Answer it.

193
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,279
It must be another important call
about work.

194
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,350
We're not done
wrapping things up yet.

195
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,619
Yes, so it's important.

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,389
You should leave.

197
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,519
I'll take care of things
for the trip first and come back.

198
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,290
And...

199
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,200
don't be so sensitive.

200
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,570
It's not what you think.

201
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:17,840
And that's not the problem
right now.

202
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,300
Then what is the problem?

203
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,440
Is it a problem that
I had our baby alone? Or...

204
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,180
is it a problem that
you only found out about it now?

205
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,180
No, that's not what I meant.

206
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,779
I really didn't know.

207
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,749
That's what I mean.
You were always like this.

208
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,590
It was fine because you didn't know.

209
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,450
And I had to endure things
because I knew about them.

210
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,359
But you know,

211
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,389
I now wish...

212
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,300
I hadn't known either.

213
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,960
If I hadn't known,

214
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,499
things might not have been so hard.

215
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,479
In life,

216
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,649
there will come a time
when you must make a decision.

217
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:03,749
When that time comes,

218
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,889
just think about
what makes you happy.

219
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,519
That's how you won't have regrets.

220
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,529
Our baby...

221
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,229
Momo...

222
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,529
came into this world too soon.

223
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,170
Momo should've had more time...

224
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,239
to grow in my womb...

225
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,139
and prepare more for this world,
but there wasn't time for that.

226
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,550
Our marriage
and my life since marrying you...

227
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,220
It might have been a decision...

228
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,119
that we made too soon
before we were quite ready.

229
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,359
If we had taken the time
to be more certain...

230
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,889
If we'd had...

231
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,889
more time to think things through
for each other's sake,

232
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,999
would things have been different?

233
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,100
What are you saying, Gong Hee?

234
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,470
I told you I'd take responsibility.

235
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,970
I know you're disappointed in me
right now.

236
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,570
But...

237
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,810
this wasn't something
we could control.

238
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,040
I'll protect the baby well
from now on...

239
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,509
You must be busy. You should leave.

240
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:09,450
And...

241
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,619
never come to see me again.

242
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,009
This marriage is already ruined.

243
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:42,080
Holding onto the sand
slipping through my fingers,

244
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,950
what exactly...

245
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,649
was I trying to protect?

246
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,200
All right!
Mr. Gu Dan Soo is coming back,

247
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,670
so we should...

248
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,840
deep-clean the office first,
everyone.

249
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:11,879
Director Lee,
we're the only ones here now.

250
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,139
Let's just take it easy.

251
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,879
And what? "Everyone?"

252
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,519
Can't you see that
there's no one else here now?

253
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,659
Executive Director Gu!

254
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,399
Welcome back

255
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,800
You expanded the business into Europe,
which is a difficult market,

256
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,670
and made a victorious return.

257
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:42,269
Seriously, it's so impressive.

258
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,879
Our stock price keeps going up.

259
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,180
Now that you're back,
I can sense that...

260
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,680
the atmosphere in the office
is changing already.

261
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,290
You produced such impressive results
in France.

262
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,759
I knew it!
The company really needs you.

263
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,999
By the way, how come
the office looks so empty?

264
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,200
Where did everyone go?

265
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:10,830
Oh, well...

266
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,009
Ms. Eom is on maternity leave
at the moment.

267
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:21,080
What about Ms. Maeng Gong Hee?
Where is she?

268
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,450
Oh, she had her baby,
so she's in the hospital now.

269
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,590
What? She had her baby already?

270
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,050
I know, right?

271
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,889
The baby was born early,
so we were worried.

272
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,960
But both she and her baby are okay.
What a relief.

273
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,700
I see that Mr. Seo
and Ms. Kang aren't here either.

274
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,800
They're both away on a work trip
at the moment.

275
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,369
They went away together?

276
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Yes.

277
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,139
They said they had
an important meeting with a client,

278
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,649
so I gave them permission.

279
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,460
They must've submitted
a detailed plan for this work trip.

280
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,960
Please bring it to me.

281
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,710
("The Life Before Us")

282
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,859
Hey, what is all that?

283
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,170
Did you pack your things
to go and stay with your family?

284
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,970
Good thinking.

285
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,409
Here I was, thinking I'd have to
cook you seaweed soup.

286
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,879
The baby won't be coming home
for another month,

287
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,009
so stay with your family for a bit.

288
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,180
Staying with your family
will help you recover fast.

289
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,180
Besides,
no matter what I do for you,

290
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,690
Kang Myung Ja
will nitpick everything I do.

291
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,420
I figured I should say...

292
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:14,759
my final goodbye before I left.

293
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,859
"Final goodbye?" What do you mean?

294
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:20,899
I must say,

295
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,269
I'm grateful to you for one thing
even in this situation.

296
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,340
What?

297
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,940
Because you're so mean to me...

298
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,680
until the very end,
I don't have to...

299
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,779
worry about getting attached to you.

300
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,580
For that, I thank you.

301
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,249
Goodbye.

302
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,220
Hey, what is this...

303
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Hey!

304
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:48,889
Hey!

305
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:52,859
What was that?

306
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,259
No way.

307
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,170
Does she want a divorce?

308
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,840
Is she going through
postpartum depression or what?

309
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,940
Should I tell Min Gi?

310
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,109
No, she's just acting up.

311
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,320
He's working now,
so I shouldn't bother him.

312
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,989
Oh, dear.
This is giving me a bad feeling.

313
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,090
Honey, how are things
at the postpartum care center?

314
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,430
Is it nice there?

315
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,189
And how's our Ssook Ssook?

316
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,230
Ssook Ssook is sound asleep now.

317
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,429
But I don't know
if I'm here to recover...

318
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,699
or if I'm locked up in prison now.

319
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,810
Prison? What are you talking about?
It's a nice place.

320
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:38,609
I have to eat seaweed soup all day
and nothing else.

321
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:41,709
I'm practically locked in this room.
I can't even open the windows.

322
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,250
Look at this. I'm not even allowed
to wash my hair.

323
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,080
My arms and legs are all swollen.

324
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,490
I feel like
I'm in solitary confinement.

325
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:52,990
Did Mom do something bad
and go to prison?

326
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,859
- What?
- No.

327
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:56,090
Mom's a good person.

328
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,659
It's just what it's like there.

329
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,600
No Ah, when you grow up
and get married,

330
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,600
- you'll understand everything.
- Yes.

331
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,639
Do I have to go to prison too?

332
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:09,010
What? No.

333
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
No.

334
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,209
You won't give birth yourself.

335
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:18,649
Then I should tell Ssook Ssook
how she can escape from prison...

336
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,419
as her big brother.

337
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:23,219
Okay.

338
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,820
All right. I'll be in touch.

339
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,659
Yes, send us
many videos of Ssook Ssook.

340
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:32,199
- Bye.
- My goodness.

341
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,530
No Ah and I will be in our room.

342
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,530
- Let's go.
- Okay.

343
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,629
- All right.
- Oh, boy. Let's go.

344
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:39,639
My goodness.

345
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,209
Oh, right. Didn't Gong Hee say...

346
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,679
she'd come home
once she was discharged?

347
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,139
How come she hasn't called us yet?

348
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,109
She said she'd stop by
Ssang Sook's house earlier,

349
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,480
but I haven't heard from her
since then.

350
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,250
She hasn't even fully recovered yet.

351
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,619
- I'll go and get her.
- Okay.

352
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:58,619
What?

353
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,590
Mom, I'm here.

354
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,760
Hey, come and have a seat.

355
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,530
Hey, how come you look so upset?

356
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,699
Do you still not feel well?

357
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,540
Mom.

358
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,409
Dad.

359
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,469
I think...

360
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,810
What is it?
Did the doctor say something bad?

361
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,990
I...

362
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,219
want to get a divorce.

363
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:35,659
What?

364
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,790
Oh, dear.

365
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,399
Hey, Gong Hee.

366
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,100
What happened?
Calm down and tell us.

367
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:48,969
What did you say?

368
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,240
You want what?

369
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,010
A divorce.

370
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:57,609
My gosh.

371
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,119
Let's talk in my room.

372
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,100
Oh, dear.

373
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,209
Divorce? What do you mean?
Can you explain what's going on?

374
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,709
You went to the hospital alone
when you went into labor.

375
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,709
Something must've happened.

376
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,679
Is Min Gi having an affair,
by any chance?

377
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
Mom...

378
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:35,949
My goodness.

379
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,659
Hey, what does that mean?

380
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,659
Is Min Gi having an affair?

381
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,490
I'll explain everything later.

382
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,600
Mom, Dad.
I want to get some rest now, okay?

383
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,000
Let's talk later.

384
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,000
Wait, Gong Hee.

385
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
- Hey.
- Oh, dear.

386
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,939
Honey, tell me what happened.

387
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,840
Did she go to the hospital alone
to give birth?

388
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:04,280
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

389
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,980
This is so strange.

390
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,590
Something must've happened...

391
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,889
for Gong Hee to say
that she wants a divorce.

392
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,629
- My goodness.
- Oh, dear.

393
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:24,939
What? Everyone has left for the day.

394
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
They suddenly said to come in
and report the details of the trip.

395
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,139
Well...

396
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:30,740
I'll take care of it.

397
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,780
Are you still in a bad mood
because of Maeng Gong Hee?

398
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:36,480
She suddenly called you,

399
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,280
so you ran over there to see her.
Isn't that enough?

400
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,919
What more does she want?

401
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,619
I think I should go home.

402
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,119
I heard she'd be coming home
from the hospital today.

403
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,060
What? Is your guilty conscience
kicking in again?

404
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,459
She wasn't due for another month,

405
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,500
and our work trip was planned
before that.

406
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,230
We did nothing wrong.

407
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,540
(Gu Dan Soo)

408
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,709
The boss is back.

409
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:04,310
I need to catch up on the reports,
so leave them on my desk.

410
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,780
Executive Director Gu Dan Soo
is back.

411
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:09,449
What?

412
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,619
Didn't they say
he'd be away for over a year?

413
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,050
The boss is back.

414
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,020
Submit your designs
from the past five months.

415
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,820
Gu Dan Soo.

416
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,859
Why is he back already?

417
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,330
(Gong Hee's father)

418
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,070
Hello, Father.

419
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,550
I had a call from the chairwoman.

420
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,580
She told me
to come and live with her.

421
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,490
Seriously, Grandma...

422
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,119
Mom, you don't have to do that.

423
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:53,090
How could you live there without me?

424
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,590
Dan Soo.

425
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,730
When you said
you were leaving for France,

426
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:04,730
I wanted to stop you from going.

427
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
But...

428
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,270
I couldn't do that because I knew...

429
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,909
your reasons for leaving.

430
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:22,389
The thing you wish for so deeply...

431
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,959
is for your family to get along.

432
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,359
I want to make that happen too.

433
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,600
I want to repay you
for your wishes now.

434
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:40,199
Living with Grandma
in the same house...

435
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,010
won't be easy.

436
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,010
I know.

437
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,139
But I still want to make it work.

438
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:48,649
Grandma has...

439
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,719
no intention of accepting you.

440
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,419
You and I also...

441
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,090
had to take a long detour
before we became a family again.

442
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,000
Of course, I'm scared too.

443
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,730
She was like a shadow
that tormented me for half my life.

444
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,600
But...

445
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,070
things are different now.

446
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,139
I have you by my side, Dan Soo.

447
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Mom.

448
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,649
Will you really be okay?

449
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,859
My son is this amazing and strong.

450
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:35,030
Why should I be worried? Right?

451
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:46,369
I'll ask Min Gi when he gets here.

452
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:47,639
Don't you know how Gong Hee is?

453
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:50,040
She endures things so much
that she can be frustrating.

454
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,740
If she's bringing up divorce,

455
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,510
I'm sure
this isn't just a simple matter.

456
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,810
Min Gi said he'd be here.

457
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,850
When he gets here,

458
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,050
let's hear what his thoughts are.

459
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,850
I can't help
but feel disappointed in Min Gi.

460
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,219
He only showed his face
at the hospital once...

461
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:08,359
and went right back
to his work trip.

462
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
You're here.

463
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,240
Let's talk inside.

464
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,070
Okay.

465
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,209
Wait.

466
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,439
Let me ask you one thing first.

467
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,780
Gong Hee says she wants a divorce.

468
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,050
Do you want the same thing?

469
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,520
Why won't you answer me?

470
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,030
Goodness.

471
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,730
Gong Hee was crying
because she didn't want to marry you,

472
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,969
but I pushed her into it myself.

473
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:56,469
You told me yourself
that you'd take responsibility.

474
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,909
You said you'd take care of the baby
and Gong Hee!

475
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:02,609
That's why I told Gong Hee...

476
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,780
to take your word for it.
I said we should trust you.

477
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,419
I held her hands and begged her!

478
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:11,590
No matter how upset she is,

479
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:14,719
she always looks out for her parents
and tries not to worry us.

480
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,490
So why would she do this?

481
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,100
Why would she come
all the way home...

482
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,959
and say that
she wants to get a divorce?

483
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
What on earth did you do?

484
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,209
I think she was disappointed in me
about something.

485
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,449
She packed her things and came here
without even telling me,

486
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,490
so I'm rather flustered too.

487
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:46,859
Then,

488
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:50,290
are you saying
this is just Gong Hee's idea?

489
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,300
Divorce isn't something
she can decide by herself.

490
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,070
You're wrong.

491
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,580
I'll decide what to do
with my own life.

492
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,250
What are you doing without
even discussing things with me?

493
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
What's going on?

494
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,359
I'll make myself clear
right here and now.

495
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,159
I'm strong enough without you.

496
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,199
And now,

497
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,199
I will choose my own path
to protect myself.

498
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,330
So...

499
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,669
I refuse the responsibility
that you speak of, Seo Min Gi.

500
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:37,939
You didn't protect me,

501
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:40,740
and I have absolutely no intention
of falling apart by your side.

502
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,480
Let's get divorced.

503
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:10,310
(My Merry Marriage)

504
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:13,639
So, there was a woman
Seo Min Gi used to date,

505
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:15,780
but he kept seeing her
even after you two got married?

506
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,949
You mean that sly fox
who came to our shop?

507
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:19,219
While I was gone,

508
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:21,550
you two had quite the flashy record
of business trips.

509
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,990
Ever since I heard he was back,

510
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,719
I've been boiling up on the inside.

511
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,659
When did you get here?

512
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:27,889
You didn't even let me know.

513
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,330
Maeng Ggong.

514
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:30,859
It's been a while.

515
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,629
