1
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,390
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,259
Do you really think...

3
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,560
Gu Dan Soo will inherit Jayce Group?

4
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,929
What?

5
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:00,800
If I promise you that I'll become
the chairman of Jayce Group,

6
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,440
will you give me your permission?

7
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,280
You've met Gu Dan Soo,
so you must know this by now.

8
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,079
He's not that capable.

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,890
I know Jayce Fashion very well.

10
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:17,590
I will show you...

11
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,820
what I can do.

12
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,929
Why are you telling me this now?

13
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,530
What if I go ahead
and tell the chairwoman...

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,070
that you have an ulterior motive?
Then what will you do?

15
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,439
- Mom.
- You can do as you please.

16
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,670
But you know
what will benefit you more.

17
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,640
You know the answer
better than I do.

18
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,109
If you choose Gu Dan Soo,

19
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,679
Jayce Group and Dodo Group
can merge,

20
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,649
and you may get a half of it,

21
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,479
but you'll never own
the whole thing.

22
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,719
But I...

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,920
could have Jayce Group...

24
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,859
become a part of Dodo Group.

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,659
Can I go ahead
and tell Chairwoman Hwang...

26
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,230
what you just said?

27
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,469
Mom.

28
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,540
Get up, Min Gi.
You don't need to be on your knees.

29
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,140
Get up, please.

30
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,379
And I have a favor to ask of you.

31
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,650
If you have something to tell me,

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,620
you can tell me anytime.
I'm all ears.

33
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:25,250
But please treat my mother...

34
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,090
respectfully.

35
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,159
Don't be rude to her.

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,900
She does not deserve...

37
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,870
to be treated like that.

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,909
So, your mother told you...

39
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,510
I'll see you at work.

40
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,819
I have to say, he's a catch.

41
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,030
He knows when to protect his pride
and when to swallow it.

42
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:09,629
Gosh, but his family
is too pathetic.

43
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,270
What a shame, seriously.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,870
Goodness.

45
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:17,139
What's wrong with you?

46
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,039
What do you mean?

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,379
Why do you keep getting
an upset stomach?

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,310
Are you...

49
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,219
perhaps...

50
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,319
pregnant?

51
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,219
Mom...

52
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,229
My goodness.

53
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,569
What am I thinking?

54
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,370
Well...

55
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,340
No, right?

56
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:54,009
Of course. No way.

57
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,909
I'm still shocked
by your brother's situation,

58
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,949
so I was just worried for a moment.

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Goodness.

60
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,990
You tend to eat too quickly...

61
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,819
and overeat.

62
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,330
Shouldn't you see a doctor
or something?

63
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,229
I just...

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,930
have a lot to take care of
at work these days.

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,930
I guess that's giving me
an upset stomach.

66
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,439
A lot to take care of? Like what?

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,169
Well, they keep giving me...

68
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,340
a bunch of work.
It's because I'm so talented.

69
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,949
If it's something you can't handle,
you should tell them that.

70
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,650
Becoming a permanent employee
is not that important.

71
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,349
Gosh, Mom.
You don't know what you're saying.

72
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,919
You should still go
and see a doctor today, okay?

73
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
Okay.

74
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,659
By the way,

75
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,229
I wonder how Hong Dan is doing.

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,400
Well, she should be coming back
to work today...

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,930
after her vacation.

78
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,030
If she comes to work,

79
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,669
you should ask what she plans to do.

80
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,370
Okay, Mom.

81
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,480
Gosh, I can't believe
what Gong Boo is putting me through.

82
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,910
How can he worry me so much
because of his marriage issues?

83
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,319
You should marry well...

84
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,490
so that I can have
some peace of mind.

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
Why is my marriage
suddenly coming up?

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,459
I mean, you shouldn't cause me
any more worries, at least.

87
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,959
Meet a good man...

88
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,399
and live a peaceful life. Got it?

89
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,920
How did you decide
to kneel before my mom?

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,019
I couldn't just sit back
and watch her mistreat my mom.

91
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,790
I'm sorry, Min Gi.

92
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,529
But I think
my mom has calmed down a bit.

93
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,129
Things seem hopeful.

94
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,670
That's good to hear.

95
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,329
I'll talk to my mom too.

96
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,470
See you later at work.

97
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:09,209
Where did you go
so early in the morning?

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,810
Come downstairs and have breakfast.

99
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:12,449
Mom.

100
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:13,949
Yes?

101
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,089
I'll be good...

102
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,189
so that no one can mistreat you.

103
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,290
Son.

104
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,000
You're right, Mom.

105
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:30,069
I am the best son in the world.

106
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,470
I'm sure I can become
more successful than anyone else.

107
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,040
I'll rise up higher than anyone.

108
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,110
So don't you worry.

109
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,310
Okay.

110
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,279
Thank you, son.

111
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,290
Here you go.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,930
Goodness,
you look like you're in full bloom.

113
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,660
Are you that happy to be married?

114
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,529
Yes. Of course, I'm happy.

115
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm about to die
from all the happiness.

116
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,939
That's all because
you had such an amazing officiant.

117
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,709
Just letting you know.

118
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,110
Oh, that's right.
That's where everything...

119
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,620
- started getting all tangled up.
- What?

120
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,180
What got tangled up?

121
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,160
Oh, nothing.
Your speech was so great...

122
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,459
that I was about to do the tango,
you know. Yes.

123
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,290
Is marriage really that great?

124
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,129
Then should I get married too?

125
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,370
Yes, it's great. It is,

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,699
but don't jump into marriage
with just any guy.

127
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,439
What?

128
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,009
Ms. Eom.

129
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,110
Can we talk for a minute?

130
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:54,449
Oh, my.

131
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,860
I'm so sorry, Ms. Eom.

132
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,920
Excuse me. Can you let go of me?

133
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,160
Can't you please talk to my brother?

134
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,699
Talk to him about what?

135
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,899
I don't mean about the child
but about my brother.

136
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,439
If he gets divorced like this again,

137
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,639
he might never recover from it.

138
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,439
Can you please talk to him
before you...

139
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,449
Forget it.
I'm disappointed in you too.

140
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,310
So, you're my sister-in-law now.
Is that right?

141
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,379
Try to put yourself in my shoes.

142
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,519
Could you say the same thing
if this was happening to you?

143
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,259
- I know how you feel. I do, but...
- My gosh!

144
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,360
I can't talk to anyone
with the surname Maeng...

145
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,060
for more than three seconds.

146
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,600
You're also not allowed
to come near me.

147
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,500
- Don't you dare talk to me.
- But...

148
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,399
Gosh, they're all the same!

149
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:51,439
Shoot. That didn't work.

150
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,879
Hey, Mom.

151
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,680
Ms. Eom came to work.

152
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,480
So, did you talk to her?

153
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,350
She won't even listen to me.

154
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,220
What is she planning to do?

155
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,550
She shouldn't just avoid things.

156
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,519
They need to talk things through.

157
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,220
Gong Boo...

158
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,430
should just consider this marriage
a failure too...

159
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,860
My gosh. His first marriage
lasted a month, at least.

160
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,100
This time, it only lasted a week.

161
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,570
How does it keep getting shorter?

162
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,840
Hey, be quiet.
Don't say such unlucky things.

163
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm hanging up.

164
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,639
So, what did she say?

165
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,809
Did Gong Hee talk to her?

166
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,049
She thinks the marriage is over.

167
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,580
He didn't even get to register
his marriage this time either.

168
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,350
Hey, how about...

169
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,250
you go over to her house,
Gyeong Tae?

170
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,019
I mean, who knows what might happen
if you visit her?

171
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,059
Me?

172
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,929
Would anything change...

173
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,299
if I were to visit her?

174
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:51,700
It's no use.

175
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,440
She put up a sign on her door.

176
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,379
"No one from the Maeng family
is allowed inside."

177
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,950
Right, if you get bitten by a dog
three times,

178
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,850
you'd put up a sign that says,
"Beware of the dog."

179
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,919
She was burned so badly
by the Maeng Family.

180
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,919
Of course,
she doesn't want to see us.

181
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,049
What will we do?

182
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,259
I don't think anyone
with the surname Maeng can go in.

183
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,399
Hang on a minute.
Who doesn't have that surname?

184
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,470
Right.

185
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,669
Me?

186
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,070
You want me to go and see her?

187
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,279
That's right.

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Is it me again?

189
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,779
Am I picking up the mess again?

190
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,519
Someone else causes trouble,

191
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,149
and I do all the cleaning up?

192
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,789
Gosh, I don't want to go either.
I have nothing to say.

193
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,820
What do you want me to say to her?

194
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,990
Just try something.

195
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,230
Anything you can say.

196
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,970
Give it some serious thought.

197
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,970
Hey, be quiet.

198
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,779
Why are you just leaving?

199
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,539
Are you mad?

200
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,679
No, I'm waiting for your answer.

201
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
What answer?

202
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,120
The answer to what I said
to your mother this morning.

203
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,259
I think I've shown you plenty.

204
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,090
I know.
You even got down on your knees...

205
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,559
and showed her
your vision for the future.

206
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,100
I was so moved.

207
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,669
Then from now on,
it's your turn to show me.

208
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,269
Okay.

209
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,009
I will look for a wedding planner.

210
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,940
We're both busy,

211
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,840
so I think it'd be good to hire
a professional wedding planner.

212
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,419
Mom's permission
isn't important anymore.

213
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:53,019
Thinking about really starting
on our wedding preparations...

214
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,490
makes me feel so giddy.

215
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,500
I told you to report to me
about the fashion show preparations.

216
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,740
Why haven't I heard anything?

217
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm busy.

218
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,440
If you're so curious,
just come to work.

219
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,409
Hey, are you really
going to be like this?

220
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,309
I have to get to a meeting. Bye.

221
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Hey...

222
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,750
My goodness.

223
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,250
Do you think I have no other way
of finding out besides you?

224
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:27,659
Oh, right.

225
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,429
(X-Man)

226
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:34,129
(X-Man)

227
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,049
Let's start the meeting.

228
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,360
Gong Hee.

229
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,399
How far along are we with Holly?

230
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,570
We will make all the revisions
Holly requested...

231
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,970
and send over samples
for confirmation when we get them.

232
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,399
- Come on. Wouldn't it be better...
- Everyone has their uses.

233
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,309
Why don't we ask Holly
to come to the office in person?

234
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,080
Let's use this chance
to see Holly in person.

235
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,210
I know.

236
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,450
It's my first time
working like this too.

237
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,549
To be honest,
if we just communicate online,

238
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,490
how do we even know
if this is the real Holly or not?

239
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:33,990
I want to...

240
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,429
respect Holly's wishes.

241
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,000
If Holly were to appear in person,

242
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,429
we'd lose people's attention.

243
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,830
As a fan, I think it's cool...

244
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,139
that Holly just wants
to communicate through design.

245
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,309
You can't be a fan and be professional
at the same time.

246
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,210
Gong Hee, I guess you don't know
how important this project is.

247
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:58,049
I am aware.

248
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,820
Gosh, this is why...

249
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,649
I wanted to turn down
the collaborative project.

250
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,789
People start having
different expectations.

251
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,269
(No one from the Maeng family
is allowed inside!)

252
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Mother.

253
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,340
My surname isn't Maeng.

254
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,210
(No one from the Maeng family
is allowed inside!)

255
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,080
I'll be honest.

256
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,090
I can't help but think
that the entire family...

257
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,120
tried to deceive me.

258
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,029
Of course, that is not the case.

259
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,289
Why would you think that?

260
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,730
How else would you explain it, then?

261
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,500
That little kid was wearing
the DNA test report around his neck,

262
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:53,070
sitting in front of my door
the day we got back...

263
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,769
from our honeymoon.
How's that possible?

264
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,039
Gong Boo had no idea either.

265
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,139
Soo Yeon didn't tell him on purpose.

266
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,210
They got divorced
just a month after their wedding.

267
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,009
He had no idea she was pregnant.
How could he have known?

268
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,049
I won't ask you to forgive him.

269
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,519
He really should have handled
the situation better.

270
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,259
But what can you do?

271
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:16,830
You two are married now.

272
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,759
I can get the marriage...

273
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,899
annulled.

274
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,629
You'll get your marriage annulled?

275
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,269
He's been married before,

276
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,539
and his ex-wife divorced him
because he cheated on her.

277
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:31,240
His clinic is running on debt,

278
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:34,309
and your house is tiny.

279
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,409
He can't afford to buy a home,

280
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,450
so he just moved into my apartment.

281
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
Our house is tiny?

282
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,389
I'm sorry
that our house is so small.

283
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,990
Well, please don't get me wrong.

284
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,730
All of you think I'm a joke
because I'm too nice.

285
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,000
They're the ones
who always cause trouble.

286
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,830
Why are they making me
clean up the mess?

287
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,029
What am I, a mop?

288
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,139
Well, I was just...

289
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,740
You see,

290
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,809
I can't stand
the Maeng family either.

291
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,309
I'm sick of dealing with them.

292
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,679
If there's anyone...

293
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,149
who has suffered more than I have
because of them, let me meet them.

294
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,580
But...

295
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,259
we're a family now, you know.

296
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,059
You must have a lot on your mind.
I know that.

297
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,730
I won't ask you...

298
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,429
to reconcile with him right away.

299
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,210
But we're a family, so...

300
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,440
I think differently.

301
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:43,379
I can't forgive everything
just because he's my family now.

302
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:46,519
How could I accept it
when I don't understand it?

303
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,980
If I'd shunned everything
I didn't understand,

304
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,990
I would've kicked out
everyone in the family by now.

305
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:54,960
I...

306
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,059
want nothing else.

307
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,570
I just ask you
not to leave Gong Boo, please.

308
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,970
I just feel so bad for my son.
That's all.

309
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,669
If his second marriage
fails like this too,

310
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,409
he really will hit rock bottom.

311
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,139
I feel so bad for him.

312
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,490
About the other problem,
we can talk about it later on.

313
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,929
But please take him back.

314
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,629
Please.

315
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:12,000
I told her I'd think of her
as my own daughter.

316
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
Would I ask her to do this
if she were my real daughter?

317
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:16,609
Forget about the marriage.

318
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,769
I'd tell her to leave him at once.

319
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,609
I really have no shame.

Hey, you.

323
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,390
You must be really stressed out.

324

keep happening to me?

About No Ah.

327
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,569
Doesn't he remind you of Dan Soo
when he was little?

328

No Ah?

329
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,140

at least.

He was always glued to you.

He was like, "I won't eat
until Dad brings Mom home,"

332

I don't want to see No Ah get hurt,
no matter what happens.

335
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,490
Dan Soo's situation
wasn't much different.

He suddenly had to stay
with strangers without his parents.

337
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,170
No matter how hard we tried
to take good care of him,

338
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,440
that whole situation
must've been very hurtful for him.

339
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,869
Having a family...

340
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,140

it's not where you belong.

342
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,819
by the experience of
being abandoned by his parents,

343
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,089
so he still has nightmares about it.

344
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:41,690
No Ah is the one
who has it the hardest now.

345

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,579
I really can't stand myself
these days.

358
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,150
I think I'm acting like
a so-called boomer these days.

359
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,819
You? Why do you say that?

360
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:24,029
I'm failing
to act like a mature adult...

361
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,559
in front of my son
and my daughter-in-law.

362
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,130
Thinking only from my perspective,

363
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,900
I hit my grown-up son.

364
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,299
Then I went to see
my daughter-in-law...

365
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,299
and practically asked her
to forgive my son.

366
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,069
How selfish.

367
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,069
That's actually not too bad.

368
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:40,480
I would have kicked Gong Boo out
long ago.

369
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,950
Come to think of it,
those who should repent never do,

370
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:48,619
while those who don't need to repent
always do.

371
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,220
Here's one right here.

372
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:53,289
My gosh! Hey!

373
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,819
Hey, Myung Ja.

374
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,859
I heard your five-year-old grandson
suddenly showed up.

375
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,559
What happened?

376
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:03,869
Did you put up surveillance cameras
in my house or something?

377
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:06,099
How did you know?

378
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,769
Goodness. She and her mouth.

379
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,309
Hey, what happened?

380
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,980
I mean, it's something
you'd see on the news.

381
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,750
I can't believe
that child showed up...

382
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,279
the day they got back
from their honeymoon.

383
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:24,950
Is it fun for you? Is it?

384
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,119
You spotted another opportunity
to provoke me.

385
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,660
Hey, I'm asking out of concern.

386
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,529
Why are you so twisted?

387
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:36,970
"Concern?" Since when
were you concerned about me?

388
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,940
Do you think I forgot everything
because I never bring up the past?

389
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,900
Are you my friend?

390
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,609
How could you call yourself
my friend?

391
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,009
Joo Ri, did you...

392
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,950
wrong Myung Ja in the past?

393
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:05,460
Holly wants to use
a silky fabric for the design.

394
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,160
Should I use something soft too?

395
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,299
Gosh, it's not easy to collaborate
with another designer.

396
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,700
Gong Hee, did you see this article?

397
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:20,640
- What?
- The article says...

398
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,039
Holly will appear
at the fashion show finale.

399
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,779
Did Holly agree to this?

400
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:28,180
What... No. How did this...

401
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Who said this?

402
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,119
"Holly, the fashion designer
who took the world by storm,"

403
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,630
"collaborates with Jayce Fashion."

404
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,960
"Will Holly's face
finally be revealed?"

405
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:49,799
Only the people in the company
know this information.

406
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,839
Was it perhaps Kang Ji Na?

407
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,480
She always tried
to get Gong Hee in trouble.

408
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,750
Is this how she will ruin things?

409
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,630
The person you want to meet
on the day of the first snowfall.

410
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,000
You all have someone like that,
don't you?

411
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

412
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:23,369
Ms. Kang Myung Ja?

413
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,839
- What?
- Hey.

414
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:31,650
He's calling you.

415
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:32,779
Oh, yes.

416
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,880
Could you tell us?

417
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,690
Do you have someone you want to meet
on the day of the first snowfall?

418
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,089
Well, yes.

419
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:46,559
I...

420
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,470
want to meet myself
when I was young.

421
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,069
Yourself when you were young?

422
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,470
Yes.

423
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:03,380
It was a snowy day. That winter,

424
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,009
I was having a really hard time.

425
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,349
"When will this pain end?"

426
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,190
"When will this despair
let go of me?"

427
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:16,420
Every day, I thought to myself...

428
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,660
in a daze.

429
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,029
That pain...

430
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,269
wasn't something that would end,
but something I had to bury.

431
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,269
And even if I buried it,

432
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,769
it would leave a chunk behind
in the end.

433
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,849
I want to tell myself that...

434
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:38,809
and comfort myself.

435
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,250
Myself from back then.

436
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,819
"The one I want to meet
on the day of the first snowfall..."

437
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,559
"is myself when I was young."

438
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,089
That sentiment itself is a poem.

439
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,130
If you write that down,
it would become a poem, right?

440
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,740
Now, Audrey.

441
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,410
Who would you like to meet
on a snowy day?

442
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,319
I...

443
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,529
I would like to meet my son.

444
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,740
The pure white snow
would cover up...

445
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,470
all of my flaws and mistakes,
so when it snows,

446
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,210
I want to meet my son
and confess to him.

447
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,319
That I am sorry...

448
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,950
that I'm his mom.

449
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,029
Hello.

450
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
So...

451
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
Oh, dear.

452
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
But...

453
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,980
Well, what brings you here?

454
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,279
Shouldn't you be at work now?

455
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,779
Where is Mother?

456
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,380
She went to the poetry workshop.

457
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,190
The shop is closed today.

458
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:28,559
I'm here to prepare for business.

459
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,490
I see.

460
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,430
You know...

461
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,569
I'm so ashamed to face you.

462
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,970
You must've come here
because you had something to say.

463
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Go on and tell me.

464
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
I'll tell you later.

465
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:49,980
Take care.

466
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,190
Goodness.

467
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,529
(My Merry Marriage)

468
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,140
Everyone, to the meeting room!

469
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,240
What's all the ruckus about?

470
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,410
There has been fake news spreading
about Holly showing up...

471
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,839
at the finale of the fashion show.

472
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,940
If you're a pro,
you can make the impossible happen.

473
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,039
Isn't that right, Gong Hee?

474
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,079
I'll try to convince Holly.

475
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,279
Why is this happening again?

476
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,750
The family has enough to deal with
right now.

477
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,349
Why am I doing this too?

478
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,490
I have to tell him.

479
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,319
Before it's too late.

480
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,619
