1
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,040
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,609
I'll tell you later.

3
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,409
Take care.

4
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:40,729
Goodness. Sweetie, let her go.

5
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,129
Let her go. Yes, good boy.

6
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,729
All right. Come back...

7
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,900
when Myung Ja is here.

8
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,199
He looks...

9
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:54,870
a lot like him.

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
I know.

11
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,779
He's like a carbon copy of Gong Boo.

12
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,519
If you see
Gong Boo's childhood photos,

13
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,349
you'll say he looks exactly like...

14
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,589
Oh, hey. Wait.

15
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:09,790
(Episode 60)

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,059
Oh, boy. I shouldn't have said that.

17
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:20,599
Grandpa, don't you think
you made a mistake?

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
What?

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,269
Yes, I guess.

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,170
I never know what to say to women
and how to say it.

21
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:30,980
I really have no idea.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,550
Do you know?

23
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:44,759
He is like Maeng Gong Boo's Mini-Me.

24
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:47,360
Why bother with the paternity test?

25
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,530
He really is like
a carbon copy of him.

26
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,830
What should I do?

27
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,239
What should Ssook Ssook do?

28
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:58,899
What do I do?

29
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:03,780
I...

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,580
I would like to meet my son.

31
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,830
The pure white snow
would cover up...

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,629
all of my flaws and mistakes,
so when it snows,

33
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,269
I want to meet my son
and confess to him.

34
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,410
That I am sorry...

35
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,980
that I'm his mom.

36
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,619
There's one word I want to hear.

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,589
My son calling me...

38
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:55,929
"Mom."

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
That one word.

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,700
You don't have to
answer my question.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,709
Does he live somewhere far away?

42
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,980
No, he doesn't.

43
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:14,149
But it feels far.

44
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,219
I can go there,

45
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,189
but I can't actually go there
and see him.

46
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,219
Then it won't be easy for you
to confess to him in person.

47
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,290
That's right.

48
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:31,660
Then how about
you write him a letter?

49
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,630
Oftentimes,

50
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,040
written words can convey
your sincerity more effectively.

51
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,239
A letter?

52
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,939
These days, most people...

53
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,739
just send emails or text messages.

54
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,540
I suggest...

55
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,179
you get a nice envelope...

56
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:52,649
and try to convey your sincerity
as you write each letter...

57
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,249
by hand.

58
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,119
Then...

59
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:58,790
your sincerity will reach him.

60
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,800
I didn't know you had a son.

61
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,399
What was that?

62
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,769
You kept it from us
but told the entire class?

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
I know, right? I ended up
telling the whole class...

64
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,739
without even realizing it.

65
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,910
Hey.

66
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,080
Where is your son?

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,749
Why can't you see him?

68
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,290
He doesn't live far away,
but it feels far?

69
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,619
You can go there
but can't actually see him?

70
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,219
Where does he live?

71
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,089
Oh, dear.

72
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,559
Aren't we close enough?

73
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,530
Why can't you tell us?

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,939
If I tell you,

75
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,840
the neighbors will gossip.

76
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:54,949
Why are you looking at me like that?

77
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:58,650
Are you saying you can't tell me...

78
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,980
because you're worried
I'd tell everyone?

79
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,189
I can't believe this.

80
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,520
What's the matter with you?

81
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,429
I can keep my lips sealed...

82
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,360
when I have to.

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,069
Just tell us when you're ready.

84
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:17,139
Come on.

85
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,900
- Tell me.
- Stop it.

86
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,770
Kang Myung Ja.

87
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:25,280
I liked your poem.

88
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,949
Honestly, I feel the same way.

89
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,579
I want to meet my younger self...

90
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:33,989
and comfort her.

91
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,520
You've been living comfortably
because you married well.

92
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
So, why would you say that?

93
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,790
Did you even understand my poem?

94
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,360
Hey, I had a hard time too.

95
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,900
Hard time, my foot.

96
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,759
Hey.

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,429
There are things about me
that you don't know.

98
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,400
Do you think
you know everything about me?

99
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,639
How?

100
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Hey.

101
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,879
Are you trying to praise her poem
or pick a fight with her?

102
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,780
She has a lot going on
even without you...

103
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,480
adding to her stress.

104
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,910
So, stop talking nonsense.

105
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:05,220
Goodness.
She didn't even want to come today.

106
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,020
I had to practically drag her here.

107
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:12,389
My goodness. I'm so touched
by your love for your sister-in-law.

108
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
Good grief.

109
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:14,929
Are you jealous?

110
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,259
Only losers get jealous.

111
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Let's go.

112
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,210
We're checking too.

113
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,739
No. Officially,
nothing's been confirmed.

114
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,540
If you publish
another speculative article,

115
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,110
we will take legal action.

116
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,420
Everyone, to the meeting room!

117
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,550
Hey.

118
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:43,819
What's all the ruckus about?

119
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,119
Well...

120
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,429
There has been fake news spreading
about Holly showing up...

121
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,129
at the finale of the fashion show.

122
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,429
How did this even come about?

123
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:53,900
My gosh. Holly is a superstar.

124
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,270
That's why the phone
has been ringing off the hook.

125
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:57,670
I see.

126
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,569
This is huge.

127
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,239
What's with that reaction?

128
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,439
It's because...

129
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,980
I'm more concerned about
this fury inside me.

130
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,119
I'm about to explode!

131
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,350
Gosh, let's go.

132
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,350
I just got here!

133
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,160
What? Just go.

134
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:22,259
Gong Hee.

135
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,230
What have you done?

136
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,369
Well, I only found out today
through the article.

137
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:28,869
I'm quite flustered now.

138
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,970
If we get them to publish
a correction and promote...

139
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,300
Everyone is excited now,

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,710
thinking Holly would show up
at the finale.

141
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:36,340
So, if we announce now
that it'll never happen,

142
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,739
will that promote the project?

143
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,009
Do you even call that a solution?

144
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,009
Enough!

145
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,910
We can't solve this problem...

146
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,550
by sitting here
and yelling at each other.

147
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,150
If we use Holly like this
to generate buzz,

148
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,650
but if Holly doesn't show up,

149
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,090
it'll ruin the company's reputation.

150
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,220
We should get them
to correct the article.

151
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,929
No. We should get Holly
on the stage, no matter what.

152
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:58,999
Well, Holly is adamant
about never revealing herself.

153
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:01,600
But you want Holly
at the finale of the fashion show?

154
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,530
That makes no sense.

155
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Really?

156
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,009
It'll be difficult, right?

157
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,210
If you're a pro,
you can make the impossible happen.

158
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,110
If it's doable, anyone can do it.

159
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,550
Isn't that right, Gong Hee?

160
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,319
I'll try to convince Holly.

161
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,860
My gosh, this fool.

162
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,829
Gong Hee was the one
who made this collaboration happen.

163
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,300
How about we trust her again?

164
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,360
Prove how capable you are, Gong Hee.

165
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,270
Is that so?

166
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:40,809
Since Gong Hee is the one
in charge of this project,

167
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,809
let's trust her and go for it.

168
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,840
After hearing that
Holly will be appearing,

169
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,879
the higher-ups are showing
so much interest!

170
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,249
I'll come up with a PR plan
for this.

171
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,179
Let me know if you need any help,
Gong Hee.

172
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,520
Gosh, Gong Hee. Seriously...

173
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,760
This is crazy.

174
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,089
Seriously...

175
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,000
My goodness.

176
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,709
I still think...

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,010
that you're quite impressive.

178
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,020
Pardon?

179
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,589
You said you'd take responsibility
and convince Holly.

180
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,589
Do you really think
you can convince Holly?

181
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,160
I'll have to try.

182
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
I can't give up without even trying.

183
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:40,160
Don't you think
it might be better to give up?

184
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,729
If things go wrong,

185
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,900
even bigger responsibilities
will be waiting for you.

186
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,540
If things proceed
and end up going wrong,

187
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,209
you'll have to
take responsibility for it.

188
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,439
Do you think you can do that?

189
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:54,809
With what right?

190
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:57,780
Becoming a permanent employee
at this company...

191
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,390
has been a great dream of mine.

192
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:04,219
I'm going to convince Holly
with my entire dream on the line.

193
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,020
That's how...

194
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,030
I'll take responsibility.

195
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,469
Hi, Reporter Park.

196
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:23,839
I liked the headline.

197
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,439
I'll leave it to you
in the future too.

198
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,280
Oh, come up with the next headline
beforehand.

199
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,620
Let's release it
on the day of the fashion show.

200
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:35,689
"Holly, a No-show
at Jayce Fashion Show."

201
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,589
"Who's to Blame?"

202
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,490
How does that sound?

203
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:42,890
Hong Dan was here?

204
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,400
Why didn't you have her wait?

205
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,870
Goodness, she said she'd come back
when you were here.

206
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,199
What could I do?

207
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:53,270
Come on.
You just let her go, didn't you?

208
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,010
I didn't have much to say to her.

209
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,439
Why did she say she came here?

210
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:02,479
Could she have come here
to get back together with Gong Boo?

211
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,079
No, it's not like that.

212
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,079
Oh, my.

213
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,319
Hello.

214
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,920
I'm letting you all know.

215
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,719
I will...

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
raise No Ah.

217
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:15,059
What about the clinic?

218
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,059
Business is slow anyway.
I should just close it.

219
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,770
What? You'll close the clinic?

220
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:22,270
What else can I do?

221
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,270
It's not bringing in much money,
and all I have is debt.

222
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,439
I should at least sell that
to raise No Ah.

223
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,969
I am a responsible man, you know.

224
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,510
- You darn fool!
- Oh, no!

225
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,709
- Oh, my!
- I ought to...

226
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,410
- No, don't!
- My gosh!

227
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,880
Relax.

228
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,380
Dad, where is No Ah?

229
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,849
I booked a consultation
at a daycare center.

230
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,219
He's at home with Grandma.

231
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:46,790
Will you send him
to a daycare center?

232
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,990
Well, yes. I'll go and talk to them.

233
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,199
Then, I'll be going now.

234
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,099
All right.

235
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,000
You'll close the clinic
to raise a kid?

236
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:01,040
Does he know how I put him
through medical school?

237
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,370
I couldn't even send Gong Hee
to any academies.

238
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,209
And all we had to eat was kimchi
for days on end.

239
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,309
We spent everything we had
on hiring tutors and supporting him.

240
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,819
And how did he even open up
that clinic?

241
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:15,349
The whole family gathered
all the money we had to open it.

242
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,160
How can he say that so easily?

243
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,959
How? My gosh.

244
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,160
He's not my child.
He's my greatest enemy!

245
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,000
- My gosh.
- Goodness, give it a rest!

246
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,229
Give what a rest?

247
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:29,170
How could you say that to me
right now?

248
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,400
- My goodness.
- Good grief.

249
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,170
Darn it!

250
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,740
My goodness!

251
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
- Darn it.
- Oh, dear.

252
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,910
Oh, goodness.

253
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,050
- Oh, boy.
- Goodness.

254
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,849
Come on in. Stay for a cup of tea.

255
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,150
Gosh, I'm sorry.

256
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,260
Oh, boy.

257
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,059
You must be so upset.

258
00:12:57,729 --> 00:12:59,459
Yes, well...

259
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,030
I'm sure Myung Ja feels worse.

260
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,640
You know,

261
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,740
her only joy in life was
boasting about her son.

262
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:14,079
It was like that
when he entered medical school,

263
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,650
and it was the same
when he became a doctor.

264
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:19,479
Also, when he opened his clinic...

265
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,160
She nearly fell ill
if she couldn't boast about it.

266
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,530
Of course, she should be proud.

267
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:29,729
My mother-in-law kept telling her...

268
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:33,500
she shouldn't boast so much
about her kids.

269
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:38,699
But watching
Gong Boo grow up well...

270
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,939
was the only thing
that kept her going.

271
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,109
Did you say
Gong Boo's son was No Ah?

272
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:51,719
Seeing No Ah...

273
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,849
reminded me of
when Dan Soo was young.

274
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,020
You must be upset enough as it is,

275
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,559
and I'm sorry
to lay my worries on you as well.

276
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,699
You just...

277
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,099
miss Dan Soo.

278
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,069
Today, at the poetry workshop,

279
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,339
I made up my mind about something.

280
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,010
What's that?

281
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,020
I'm thinking about
writing Dan Soo a letter.

282
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:26,020
I can't call him...

283
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,819
or visit him.

284
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,890
I'll try and send him a letter.

285
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:37,189
Even if I have to leave someday,

286
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,199
I want to try every chance I can.

287
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,199
You should see Dan Soo again.

288
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,069
I'm sure you'll get to see him.

289
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,339
But if I write a letter,

290
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:53,040
I'm not sure how to get it to him.

291
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,709
If I send it via post,

292
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,819
someone else
might receive it instead.

293
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,150
Well...

294
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:07,219
How about you do this?

295
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,059
Goodness.

296
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,130
Doesn't it feel refreshing
to wash up?

297
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,069
Washing up may be a chore,

298
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,469
but it feels refreshing afterward.

299
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:22,339
Is it refreshing?

300
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:24,540
Do you even know what that means?

301
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,709
It's when it feels cool and clean.

302
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,510
My, you're such a smart one.

303
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:33,979
Grandma, I'm home.

304
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:36,219
Oh, No Ah. Daddy is here.

305
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,959
Father, you're home.

306
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,929
That's right.
No Ah, we should go somewhere.

307
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,530
Where are you going?

308
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:46,929
We have a consultation booked
at a daycare center.

309
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,599
Grandma, I'm really sorry,

310
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,199
but could you get No Ah's clothes
from the room?

311
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,240
Oh, okay. I'll get them.

312
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,069
- Thank you.
- One moment.

313
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:55,809
Come here.

314
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:07,449
Goodness.

315
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,160
Does that feel good?

316
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,359
Oh, dear.

317
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,959
No...

318
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,870
Oh, goodness.

319
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,839
No. Why is my head spinning?

320
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,479
Goodness.
Why is this happening again?

321
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,979
The family has enough to deal with
right now.

322
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,479
Why am I doing this too?

323
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,079
Oh, gosh. I'm so dizzy.

324
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:45,620
There were some abnormal findings
during the surgery.

325
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,920
Once you recover,

326
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,260
you should undergo some more tests.

327
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,569
You found something strange
inside my body?

328
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,240
I should at least find out...

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,699
what this illness is, right?

330
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,380
Myung Ja is going through so much
as it is.

331
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:10,050
I must...

332
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,120
get my head on straight.

333
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,420
Oh, gosh. What's wrong with me?

334
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
Why...

335
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,899
The semester has already begun.

336
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:31,599
You won't be able to join
in the middle of the term.

337
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,210
Well, is it usually this hard?

338
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,809
Back in my day,
parents just had to pay...

339
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,470
to enroll their children
in a daycare center.

340
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,210
Things aren't like that these days.

341
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:41,710
Even families who live nearby
are on our waiting list,

342
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,409
hoping for a spot to open up.

343
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,419
I see.

344
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,919
It's common
for both parents to work these days,

345
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,720
so kids have to stay
at daycare centers.

346
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,889
Then, do we just have to wait?

347
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,559
Yes, there are quite a few people
on the waiting list, though.

348
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,300
But you should wait.

349
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,359
Oh, okay.

350
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,540
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

351
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,780
Do you have a dream?

352
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,579
I want to become an adult.

353
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,190
That's too big of a dream.

354
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,020
Becoming an adult...

355
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:26,159
is not an easy thing.

356
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,389
But you're an adult too, Dad.

357
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:31,159
I'm an adult?

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,430
Well, you see...

359
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,500
Getting old...

360
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,669
and becoming an adult
are two different things.

361
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,040
Becoming a decent adult...

362
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
is not an easy thing to do.

363
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,280
You don't have to understand it now.

364
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:52,879
Let's go, No Ah.

365
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Gosh, you.

366
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,290
Come on!

367
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,359
When you're eating carp bread,
you have to eat the tail first.

368
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,030
Yes, that's it.

369
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,559
You know how to eat it.

370
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,359
Yes.

371
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,329
- It's crispy, isn't it?
- Yes.

372
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,649
You haven't eaten anything, right?

373
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,980
I told you not to skip meals
even when you had to work.

374
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,050
Why won't you listen to me?

375
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,220
Well...

376
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,290
About Holly's designs,
they're all incredible.

377
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,430
This one is my favorite.

378
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Do you want to see it?

379
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,770
My, it really is incredible.

380
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:50,040
Having Holly show up at the finale
would be like hitting the jackpot.

381
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,839
I sent a bunch of emails
but haven't heard back.

382
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,250
That's okay.

383
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:57,280
We'll figure something out either way.
Don't worry.

384
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,300
You're both here.

385
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,930
Yes, she was showing me
Holly's design.

386
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,540
What design?
Everything's been finalized.

387
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,339
I wanted to check one more design.

388
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,409
I still have things
to finish off too.

389
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:30,250
I picked up some sushi
on my way back from the wedding.

390
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,220
Let's have it together.

391
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,020
Gong Hee.

392
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,190
What are you doing?

393
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,230
Yes.

394
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,669
I see that someone
already picked up some food.

395
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
I bought some food.

396
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,990
I have to tell him.

397
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:18,059
Before it's too late.

398
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,700
I think my mom has changed her mind.

399
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:25,470
She wants to have a meal with you.

400
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,569
My dad will be there too.

401
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,609
I'm surprised
that my dad will join us.

402
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,839
Normally, he doesn't really care
about what I do.

403
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm glad he'll be there too.

404
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,950
I thought we'd get married
without your parents at our wedding.

405
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,579
What? That shouldn't happen.

406
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,250
Then on the day I meet your parents,

407
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:45,990
we should decide
when our families should meet.

408
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Okay.

409
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,629
We're at work now.

410
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,430
Let's go to my place.

411
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,730
Hey, the fashion show
is around the corner.

412
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,940
Gong Hee is here.

413
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,700
She's pouring her soul into it,
knowing she's in charge.

414
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,240
Just let her
take care of everything.

415
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,470
She'll do a good job.

416
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:04,109
Come on.

417
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:06,579
Gosh, you.

418
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
I will tell him.

419
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,089
Mr. Seo has the right to know.

420
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,839
The weather forecast
didn't say it'd rain today.

421
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,180
I had no idea.

422
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:20,079
I knew nothing.

423
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,250
That moment,

424
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,659
whose face did I expect to see?

425
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,399
The person standing there
when I turned around.

426
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,030
Who was I expecting it to be?

427
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:45,669
Are you all right?

428
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,339
I saw you getting all soaked
without an umbrella.

429
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,349
I can't make Mom worry.

430
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:45,430
Who can I call now?

431
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:47,099

436
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,250
This one is pretty.

437
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:09,889
It'll suit you.

438
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,559
Hello?

439
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,510
Maeng Gong Hee.

440
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,280
Hey, what's wrong?

441
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,649
You're covered in sweat.

442
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:48,329
It's you, Gu Dan Soo.

443
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,089
You really came.

444
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:54,329
Did you get soaked in the rain?

445
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,869
You fool. Who gets rained on
when it's this cold?

446
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,270
Hey, you're burning up.

447
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Maeng Gong Hee.

448
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,250
Gong Hee, stay with me. Gong Hee!

449
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
My gosh.

(Elisian Wedding Hall, Seo Min Gi)

451
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,730
A good spot just opened up,

452
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,559
so I called you right away.

453
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,500
I see. Thank you.

454
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:29,629
Isn't this too rushed?

455
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:33,639
You two are in agreement
about this, right?

456
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,409
Don't worry. Please proceed with it.

457
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
This wedding...

458
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:39,780
will happen.

459
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:54,720
I love you, Maeng Gong Hee.

460
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,829
Even though
I realized it too late...

461
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,460
I'm sorry I realized it so late.

462
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:03,129
But I love you,

463
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:05,169

(My Merry Marriage)

465
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:31,930
I don't want to go home
to an empty house anymore.

466
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,700
I won't live by myself.

467
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,030
I don't want to be alone!

468
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,000
Let's split up now.

469
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,099
Let's break up.

470
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,240
- Maeng Gong Hee. To me, you're...
- Gu Dan Soo.

471
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,669
Let's just be strangers.

472
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:45,839
Let's just be strangers...

473
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,210
as if we never knew each other.

474
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:48,909
