1
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,919
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,899
There's someone else
you should be greeting today.

3
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,799
This is my grandson,

4
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:30,529
Gu Dan Soo.

5
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:41,139
I've been appointed as
Executive Director at Jayce Fashion.

6
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,249
I'm Gu Dan Soo.

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,639
About Maeng Gong Hee on my team.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,340
Make her a permanent employee.

9
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,109
You know
the fashion show was successful.

10
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,840
That was because
you appeared as Holly.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,880
If it hadn't been for her
to begin with,

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,249
I wouldn't have revealed
that I was Holly.

13
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:19,779
What?

14
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,149
Grandma.

15
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,550
Do you know how much love
she has for our company?

16
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,759
She says
she likes Jace Fashion's clothes.

17
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,789
She doesn't like any other company.

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,330
Why?

19
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,600
Because it's accessible.

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,199
Even if she wasn't wealthy,

21
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:39,929
she'd hold her mom's hand
and go to buy our clothes...

22
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,770
on important days
and days when she had to dress up.

23
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,270
She said that excitement was...

24
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,940
what brought her all the way here.

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,309
You left someone with such sincerity
as a temporary employee.

26
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,949
I think that's wrong.

27
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:55,050
She's long overdue for a promotion.

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,020
You care so much
about the company...

29
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,449
and our employees.

30
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,289
Are you still not interested
in running the business?

31
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,459
I'll appoint you
as an executive director.

32
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,690
Try leading the company yourself.

33
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,330
Lead your people...

34
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,229
and your business.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,940
But... Gu Dan Soo...

36
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,610
Keep up the good work.

37
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,509
- Yes, ma'am.
- Bye.

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,280
Gu Dan Soo is Holly
and the chairwoman's grandson?

39
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:28,650
Wait, this is...

40
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,789
What is going on?

41
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,160
My gosh, Gu Dan Soo.
You're a total FTP.

42
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,030
You're literally
a Fairy Tale Prince.

43
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,930
If I had known beforehand,
I would've flirted with him.

44
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,229
Hey, that's a pipe dream.

45
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:45,329
Imagine what
you'd have to go through...

46
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,970
if you dated
the chairwoman's grandson.

47
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,370
Do you know why
Cinderellas don't exist these days?

48
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,269
They all twisted their ankles
and fell over.

49
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,979
But seriously...

50
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,009
Gong Hee, you two have been friends
since childhood.

51
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,180
- Did you really not know anything?
- Right.

52
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:00,620
Well...

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
No.

54
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,489
My gosh.

55
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,690
(Executive Director, Gu Dan Soo)

56
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,259
Dan Soo, I knew you would...

57
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,130
Oh, I mean...

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,769
Executive Director Gu.

59
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,199
I knew you would return for certain.

60
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,009
Even when I heard you were Holly,

61
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,239
I wasn't surprised at all.

62
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,609
You are so handsome and talented.

63
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,780
I'd believe it if you said
you were Holly's grandfather.

64
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,049
So about earlier,
what did you think?

65
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,889
Very surprised, right?

66
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,660
Pardon? Oh, the employees?

67
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,229
I mean Gong Hee.

68
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:48,560
I'm sure she was surprised.

69
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,870
She tormented you so much until now.

70
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,269
But what can we do?

71
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,539
I will make sure
to put her in place...

72
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,509
so she can't say
anything unnecessary.

73
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,280
I wish you'd make a bigger fuss
out of this.

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Pardon?

75
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,479
As you said,

76
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm handsome and talented.

77
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,620
And I'm the chairwoman's grandson
and an executive director.

78
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:13,889
She might think differently of me,
don't you think?

79
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,030
Yes, that's right.
Totally different.

80
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,530
Why don't we have
a grand welcoming ceremony...

81
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,900
I mean...

82
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,669
How about a team dinner, sir?

83
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,169
We'll have all the employees
get together...

84
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,269
You may leave now.

85
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,009
Oh, yes, sir.

86
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
Yes?

87
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,590
Yes, Executive Director Gu.

88
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,289
Come and have a seat.

89
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,929
I've appointed Dan Soo
as an executive director.

90
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:01,799
And Min Gi has been promoted...

91
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:05,570
from the TF Team's marketing manager
to general manager.

92
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,179
I'm sure you're curious...

93
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,410
about why you've been promoted...

94
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,549
just because Dan Soo has returned.

95
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,150
There is a reason for everything.

96
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,090
I will be naming my successor
between the two of you.

97
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:24,729
Are you surprised?

98
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,729
I wasn't thinking of naming
any other candidates...

99
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,129
besides Dan Soo.

100
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,499
But Dan Soo told me
something interesting.

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,739
He said the competition between
the two of you had already begun.

102
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,979
I wanted to just hand it over,
but he refused to accept it.

103
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,410
I should take my grandson's side...

104
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,950
even if it's just to go along
with his whim.

105
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,850
But the evaluation will be fair.

106
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,789
I told you I'd give you a chance...

107
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,799
to stand by Dan Soo's side
if you assisted him well.

108
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Show me...

109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,470
how far ahead you can go...

110
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,869
when you stand side by side
with Dan Soo.

111
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,710
I believe you two can become
good competitors.

112
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,350
The best pacemaker who can help
the other progress.

113
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,679
I will see who backs off
at the finish line...

114
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,049
when the time comes.

115
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,460
(Chairwoman's Office)

116
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,109
Should I be grateful to you
or something?

117
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,710
For giving me
half of your opportunity?

118
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,510
Why are you being so prickly?

119
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:54,119
You also knew that
the competition had already begun.

120
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,090
I need to have
a proper competitor...

121
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,890
to boost my speed.
Grandma agreed that was true too.

122
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:02,419
You...

123
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,859
always stir up people's emotions
this way.

124
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,359
Are you sure you won't regret this?

125
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,100
About giving me
half of your opportunity?

126
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,470
The day I'm named
the next chairman of Jayce Fashion,

127
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,309
you will no longer have a place
in this company.

128
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,210
I'm so looking forward to that.

129
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,350
I really hope you do that.

130
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,249
The one who backs off
at the finish line...

131
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,950
will be decided then.

132
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,390
Then let's do this.

133
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,590
All right. Sounds fun.

134
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,609
Director Lee...

135
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,749
told me to bring you
some office supplies.

136
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,450
It seems you've become
a permanent employee.

137
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,350
(Maeng Gong Hee)

138
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:07,489
Oh, this?

139
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,689
But you are still running errands
to deliver office supplies?

140
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:12,989
It's fine...

141
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:14,200
Is it fine?

142
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Pardon?

143
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,830
Well, I mean...

144
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes, sir.

145
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,340
Don't become used
to unfair treatment.

146
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,869
And get rid of your habit...

147
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,179
of saying that something is fine
when it's not.

148
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,210
Hey, Gu Dan Soo. You...

149
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,749
How are you Holly
and the chairwoman's grandson...

150
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,220
You may leave if you're done here.

151
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Pardon?

152
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,119
Oh, right.

153
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,460
Do you have something more to say?

154
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,559
Ms. Maeng?

155
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,530
Well, no...

156
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:52,369
No, sir.

157
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Goodness.

158
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,080
He surprised me at the fashion show
by saying he was Holly.

159
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,290
And now, what? Executive director?

160
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,920
The chairwoman's grandson?

161
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,659
He won't even let me ask
what's going on by being distant.

162
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,389
What is this, Gu Dan Soo?

163
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,430
He's acting like someone else.

164
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,060
Like a total stranger.

165
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,310
Hello.

166
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,409
Oh, my.

167
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:36,739
Gong Hee.

168
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:39,350
I was going to call you.

169
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,379
Did the fashion show go well?

170
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,290
Yes, thank you for helping me out.

171
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,790
Goodness, I didn't do much.

172
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:51,629
By the way, what's with your face?

173
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:52,889
Is something the matter?

174
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Holly showed up at the fashion show.

175
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:57,670
For the finale.

176
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,269
Oh, my. Really?

177
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:05,239
Yes.
I still can't believe it, though.

178
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,509
But...

179
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,639
why don't you look happy about it?

180
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,879
You really wanted to meet Holly.

181
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,580
The thing is...

182
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,779
Holly was...

183
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:17,790
Dan Soo.

184
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:19,749
What?

185
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,460
What are you saying...

186
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,960
I never even imagined
that Dan Soo would be Holly either.

187
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,999
Oh, my goodness.

188
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:34,399
What... Dan Soo is Holly?

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,239
But why did he keep that a secret?

190
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:42,479
Well, I'm not sure
about the details either.

191
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,310
When he was joking
that he was Holly last time,

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,850
that must've been the truth.

193
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,279
I should've realized it
when he brought up...

194
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,720
the movie, "Breakfast at Tiffany's."

195
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,090
He really must've used the name
of the female lead in that movie.

196
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,290
Holly.

197
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,759
I told him about that movie a lot
when he was little.

198
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,399
He must remember that.

199
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,930
I thought he only resented me.

200
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,340
But were you actually missing me?

201
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:13,470
And you know what?

202
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,080
Dan Soo is
Chairwoman Hwang's grandson.

203
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,149
He also revealed that?

204
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,989
What? You don't seem surprised.

205
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,889
Did Dan Soo tell you already?

206
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,090
No, he didn't. I just...

207
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,999
He became the company's
executive director overnight.

208
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:36,499
Honestly,
I don't know what's going on.

209
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,800
I feel like it's all a dream.

210
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,200
It feels weird.

211
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,670
So, Dan Soo went back
to Jayce Fashion.

212
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,119
I'm home.

213
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:08,629
Your mother
won't even step out of the room.

214
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
What?

215
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,330
She's been stuck in her room all day
and didn't even eat.

216
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,070
Hey.

217
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,009
Just leave her alone
and give her some time to think.

218
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,279
Dad.

219
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,210
I'm sorry.

220
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,979
Auntie Gyeong Bok, I'm sorry.

221
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,249
Well, you don't need
to apologize to me.

222
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,560
But I'm really worried
about your mom.

223
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,859
Should I meet that guy, Seo Min Gi?

224
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,090
Gosh, don't.

225
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,129
It'll only make things
more uncomfortable.

226
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:49,840
Dad, I feel so bad
that I let you down.

227
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,340
I may not be a good daughter,

228
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,540
but I wanted to be
a sweet daughter to you.

229
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,979
What do you mean
you're not a good daughter?

230
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,609
Gong Hee.

231
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,779
To me, you're always...

232
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,920
the best daughter
any father could ask for.

233
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,019
That's right.

234
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,460
This situation
won't change anything.

235
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,200
We're meeting Ji Na's family today.

236
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,800
Can't you leave work early?

237
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,710
We should arrive before they do.

238
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,609
Who cares about the chairwoman now?

239
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,810
Come to the restaurant right away.

240
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't be late, honey. Okay?

241
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,550
My goodness.

242
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,519
Your son is breaking
my daughter's heart...

243
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,989
by marrying into that rich family.

244
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:46,960
I will wait and see
how well that goes.

245
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,700
I will put a curse on him!

246
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:51,830
Kang Myung Ja.

247
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,940
You might actually
put a curse on them,

248
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:57,139
so I will make sure...

249
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,239
Min Gi and Ji Na's wedding
happens without any issues,

250
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:01,979
no matter what.

251
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,779
Regarding Holly,
please don't publish any articles...

252
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,050
until you receive
our official press release.

253
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,649
We'll arrange an interview later on
and let you know.

254
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:15,090
Why aren't you here yet?

255
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,430
Your mother is already here.

256
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,759
I'm leaving now.

257
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,840
Mother.

258
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Yes.

259
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Well...

260
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:34,109
I think my parents are stuck
in traffic at the moment.

261
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,139
They'll be a little late.

262
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,749
Min Gi and my husband
aren't here yet either,

263
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:40,979
so we'll wait.

264
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,220
Is something the matter?

265
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,190
You look worried.

266
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:53,060
It's because of Maeng Gong Hee.

267
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,930
Maeng Gong Hee's mother said...

268
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,200
she'd tell your parents everything.

269
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
What?

270
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,810
We can't let that happen.

271
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,810
We had to overcome many hurdles
to get engaged.

272
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,340
- My goodness.
- Don't even mention my parents.

273
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,379
And what if Min Gi finds out?

274
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,749
Min Gi can never know.

275
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:15,979
He has
a strong sense of responsibility.

276
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,619
I can just picture how he'd react.

277
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,590
First, let's just make sure
this meeting goes well.

278
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,560
We'll deal with it
after this meeting.

279
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,399
She won't listen to us, you know.

280
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,999
That girl is just like her mother.

281
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,100
I feel anxious, Ji Na.

282
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,200
We'll make her give up...

283
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,840
as quietly as possible.

284
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,210
Min Gi cannot find out about this
until the end.

285
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:47,409
Oh, dear.

286
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,960
"Just like that,
the princess and the prince..."

287
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
"lived happily ever after."

288
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,830
Isn't it so amazing?

289
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,070
Aren't you happy for them?

290
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:07,540
Whatever.

291
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,999
What do you mean, "Whatever?"

292
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,109
You wanted me
to read you a storybook.

293
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,769
Should I get a different book?

294
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,710
You!

295
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,350
Don't you dare
fake being sick again.

296
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,720
I'll scold you.

297
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,749
You little brat. You already learned
to feign sickness.

298
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,690
I'm going to call Mom...

299
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,920
and ask her to read me a storybook.

300
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,830
Who? Your mom?

301
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,060
Doctor Lee Soo Yeon?

302
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,399
Mom reads me storybooks often.

303
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,670
Give me that.

304
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,430
What's so hard about it?

305
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,540
I'll read this to you.

306
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:42,999
("Snow White")

307
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,210
Well, this will be easy.

308
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:51,279
"Then the Evil Queen said this
with the apple in her hand."

309
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:58,820
"'Snow White, this red apple
looks just like you.'"

310
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,989
"'Your beautiful lips,'"

311
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,259
"'your rosy cheeks,'"

312
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,529
"'and your youth!'"

313
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,800
Hey, you're going
to make the kid cry.

314
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,899
Do you have to
make it sound so scary?

315
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,570
Talk about method acting.

316
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,970
Are you possessed
by the evil witch or something?

317
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,540
Evil Witch.

318
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,750
Hey! "Evil Witch?"
What are you talking about?

319
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,580
Hold on.
Snow White is about to appear.

320
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,290
"'My gosh. Thank you, ma'am.'"

321
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,219
"'But I...'"

322
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,730
"'only eat organic apples.'"

323
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,429
You're overdramatizing the story.

324
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,359
No Ah, don't listen.
You'll have a nightmare.

325
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:47,530
What? This much dramatization
is necessary.

326
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:49,899
Was it that bad?

327
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,639
Oh, we should have dinner.

328
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,050
What should we have for dinner?

329
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,550
I want Grandma's dumplings.

330
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,719
What?

331
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:05,490
Didn't you say
you only ate sunny-side-up eggs?

332
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,520
I guess
you like Grandma's dumplings.

333
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm craving Mom's food too.

334
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:15,230
Hey, why don't you and No Ah
just go and live there?

335
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:19,300
- What?
- I won't stop you.

336
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,770
Get out of my house, you two.

337
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,409
Private Maeng No Ah,
we will hide in the bedroom.

338
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Go!

339
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,939
Let's go!

340
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:29,510
This way.

341
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,679
They're like best friends
when they're making fun of me.

342
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,750
I'm trying too.

343
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Oh, boy.

344
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Gong Hee.

345
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,369
(Dry cleaning ready in 40 minutes)

346
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,570
(Bubble Up Laundry)

347
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,709
What brings you here, Mr. Seo?

348
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,949
You didn't answer your phone.

349
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,179
I need...

350
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,050
to ask you something.

351
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,889
This question may sound
absurd and ridiculous, but...

352
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Gong Hee.

353
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,129
Are you pregnant?

354
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,310
I need to know...

355
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,879
what everyone is talking about
behind my back.

356
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,010
Yes.

357
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,879
That's right.

358
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:45,919
I am pregnant,

359
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,189
and it is your child.

360
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,699
The baby is mine?

361
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,179
I don't get it.

362
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,109
It was only that one time.

363
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,919
I wondered what you might say...

364
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,850
if I were to tell you
about the baby.

365
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:21,020
I've imagined
all sorts of scenarios.

366
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,459
But none of them...

367
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,760
included such a question.

368
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,560
I never imagined something like this
would happen to me.

369
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,469
Right, so don't consider it
a part of your life.

370
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:36,699
I only told you because
you'd find out eventually anyway.

371
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,709
This child is mine.

372
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,780
It is none of your business.

373
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:43,679
But how could I not care?

374
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,679
You want nothing to do with it,
so just forget about it.

375
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:49,419
I really mean it.

376
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,619
I will not let it
get in the way of your future,

377
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,320
and I won't let it
affect your wedding plans.

378
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,290
So, put your worries to rest.

379
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:06,669
I'll find a way to take responsibility
for the situation.

380
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,240
No, you don't need to do that.

381
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,010
Bye, then.

382
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
You!

383
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,260
How could you not show up
to meet your in-laws?

384
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:36,530
You know how hard it was
to make that meeting happen.

385
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:38,500
How could you stand everyone up...

386
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,030
when both families
were getting together?

387
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,869
Go and meet with Ji Na's parents
this instant.

388
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,770
Apologize
and ask for forgiveness right now!

389
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,379
Why did you act like
you didn't know?

390
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,810
Why...

391
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,550
You knew all about it. So why?

392
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,090
I...

393
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,560
heard everything between you...

394
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
and Ji Na.

395
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,730
What?

396
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,629
Then, did you...

397
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:10,859
Yes.

398
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,270
I went and met with Gong Hee.

399
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:14,939
I confirmed it for myself.

400
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,369
Don't let her drag you down.

401
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,480
I'll take care of everything myself.

402
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,909
You should only think about Ji Na.

403
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:26,609
This is my business.

404
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,750
If anyone should be blamed,
it should be me.

405
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,219
It's a mistake I have to sort out,

406
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,219
and this is something for me
to think about and decide.

407
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,090
What will you think about?

408
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:36,919
What will you decide?

409
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,429
You should've...

410
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,230
told me first.

411
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,129
I knew you'd react this way
if you found out.

412
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,669
How could I tell you?

413
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,109
I know now.

414
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,139
I'll deal with it myself.

415
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:55,939
Don't interfere.

416
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Seo Min Gi!

417
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:03,980
Oh, no.

418
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
What do I do now?

419
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,090
What should I do?

420
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:29,939
Why didn't you answer the phone?

421
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,409
How could you stand me up
at the family meeting?

422
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,250
Do you even know what my mom said?

423
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,419
What on earth were you thinking?

424
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,719
I'm sorry, Kang Ji Na.

425
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,619
I don't think
I can spend my life with you.

426
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,859
What?

427
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,359
What are you saying?

428
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,859
I...

429
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,830
don't think I can marry you.

430
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:55,969
Is this perhaps...

431
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,340
because of Maeng Gong Hee?

432
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:01,740
I think this is it for us.

433
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:04,480
If it's about that issue, I will...

434
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,250
I'm sure saying sorry isn't enough.

435
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,619
But...

436
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,850
that's all I can say.

437
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,429
No. You will marry me. So...

439
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:36,240
Maeng Gong Hee.

440
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,350
How dare you...

441
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,389
Mom.

442
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:55,830
You should at least eat something.

443
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,980
The baby is mine?

444
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,709
Did you seriously tell Mr. Seo?

445
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,850
He already knew
when he came to see me.

446
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,889
So? Did he say
he'd take responsibility for it?

447
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,490
Are you anxious?

448
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,419
Enough to yell at me like this?

449
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,290
We have no intention
of canceling our wedding.

450
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,399
So, don't get any hopes up.
Just make up your mind soon.

451
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,629
About what?

452
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,030
If you keep putting it off,

453
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,030
you'll only lose your health...

454
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,639
and become unable to come to work.

455
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,139
Get the surgery as soon as possible.

456
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:15,340
I'll be sure to get you
enough vacation days.

457
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,510
It's fine.

458
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,879
Maeng Gong Hee!

459
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,550
Hey, Gong Hee.

460
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,290
The executive director
is asking for you.

461
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,219
He said to come right away.
It must be urgent.

462
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,580
(Executive Director's Office)

463
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,929
(Executive Director, Gu Dan Soo)

464
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,310
Why?

465
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,109
Is something wrong, Ms. Maeng?

466
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,949
Tell me what it is.

467
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,889
Gu Dan Soo.

468
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,490
Please hold me...

469
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,330
so I don't fall.

470
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,399
You said you'd pick me up.

471
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,699
Right now,

472
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,699
I need you so badly.

473
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,899
(My Merry Marriage)

474
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,500
You know, about Gong Hee...

475
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,139
She's still acting brave at work,

476
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:27,869
but that makes me feel
even worse for her.

477
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:28,980
Gosh, hey!

478
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,709
Look here, Ms. Maeng.

479
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,980
Well, I feel better
after seeing his face.

480
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,409
That guy showed up again.

481
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,219
Ms. Oh Jung Eun went with him.

482
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,350
Gong Hee, let me ask you
for a personal favor.

483
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,020
You're from Hanbit Printing, right?

484
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Yes.

485
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,189
Congratulations on your wedding.

486
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,760
Since everyone is here,

487
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,429
I have something to give you all.

488
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:47,659
What do you think you're doing?

489
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:49,429
Come with me.
