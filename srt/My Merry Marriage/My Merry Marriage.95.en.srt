1
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,309
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,319
She'll get a call once I die anyway.

3
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:38,290
Why does she keep looking for me?

4
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,630
I left after buying
my own burial gown.

5
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,860
Why are you looking for me,
Myung Ja?

6
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,209
I will take my ill body with me
until the end.

7
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:03,620
This is my wish, Myung Ja.

8
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,480
Please don't cry.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,590
If you cry,

10
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,029
your mom's heart aches
as if it's being torn to shreds.

11
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:31,080
Ma'am!

12
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:33,240
What are you doing out here?

13
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,080
(Episode 95)

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,119
- Help me. Take me back inside.
- What? My goodness, why...

15
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:39,919
- Help me. Let's go back inside.
- Okay, watch your step.

16
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,459
If she's not here,

17
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,959
and if I can't find her
anywhere in her hometown,

18
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,959
where can I go to look for her now?

19
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,759
Where did my mom go?

20
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,929
I left, thinking
I'd never see her again...

21
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:57,169
until I died.

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,140
I have to say, it is nice
to see her again like this.

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,679
My dear daughter, Myung Ja.

24
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,750
Forget all about
your incompetent mother now.

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,319
Just live your life, my dear child.

26
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:21,929
My goodness.

27
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,630
Hey.

28
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:27,569
The other business owners
in the building said...

29
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:30,130
this space had been sold.

30
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,069
I wanted to drop by
because I was worried.

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,039
How did it get sold so quickly?

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,910
Are you all right?

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,810
Well, the thing is...

34
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,650
Anyway,

35
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,380
are you planning to open...

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,819
a new alteration shop
in a different neighborhood?

37
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,789
Well, this shop...

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,630
I own it now.

39
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,359
What?

40
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,269
Dan Soo bought it for me.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
What?

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,009
Hold on. Dan Soo is the person
who bought this shop?

43
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:09,669
Yes.

44
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,509
He said he bought it...

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,910
so I could stay by my son's side...

46
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:16,850
and keep doing what I like.

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,419
Really?

48
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,819
Oh, my. So, you own this shop now?

49
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,989
Somehow, this happened.

50
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,530
My gosh. Look at you.
Your face is glowing.

51
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,130
Now that you can live comfortably
thanks to your successful son,

52
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,900
you look like a radiant flower
in full bloom. I have to say,

53
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:36,699
I'm kind of jealous.

54
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,910
Well, you know what?

55
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,440
I feel like you've changed...

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,049
since meeting Dan Soo again.
What's going on?

57
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:50,519
What?

58
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,389
I mean, you used to call me
so fondly all the time...

59
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,690
and acted like
you'd do anything for me.

60
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,220
But ever since
you met Dan Soo again,

61
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,430
you've been looking
rather uncomfortable in my presence.

62
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:06,030
Oh, no. It's just that...

63
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,729
I want to start working again,

64
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,239
so I have a lot to think about.

65
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,009
I see.
Hey, why would you work so hard?

66
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,009
Your rich son can afford
to buy you this building.

67
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,549
My goodness.

68
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,350
I'll be off, then.

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,720
I'll be out of your hair,

70
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,190
so keep working away.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,869
Goodness. She has a rich son now,
so she doesn't care about us?

72
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,669
We were so worried about her.

73
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,080
Seriously, she has changed.

74
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,309
Gosh, I can't believe this.

75
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,879
Oh, hey. What happened?

76
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,590
Did you find your mother?

77
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,320
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

78
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,260
If she didn't go to her hometown,

79
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,030
then where could she be?

80
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,229
I think something...

81
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:15,499
happened to her.

82
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:18,600
Hey! Why would you say that?

83
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,010
What am I supposed to do?
I can't find her.

84
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,439
I've been running around,

85
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,280
but I can't find
a single trace of her.

86
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,450
I'm so worried about my mom.

87
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,320
- Gyeong Bok, what should I do?
- My goodness.

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,989
Gosh, Myung Ja! You poor thing.

89
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,419
What should we do?

90
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,689
- Hey, don't cry.
- Oh, no.

91
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:47,200
Oh, goodness. Myung Ja.

92
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,129
Don't worry too much.

93
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,770
Please find my mom.

94
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:57,840
Please, I beg you.

95
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,510
Gyeong Tae.

96
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,309
Please find my mom.

97
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,549
I want to do whatever it takes
to find Mom.

98
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:13,960
If you're my husband...

99
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,530
If you're her son-in-law...

100
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,830
It's my only wish.

101
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,640
Please grant my wish.

102
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,039
Please, my mom...

103
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,809
Find my mom, please.

104
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:38,919
All right, okay.

105
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:41,419
All right, honey. I'll find her.

106
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:47,929
Yes, I will.

107
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:49,789
Myung Ja...

108
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,629
Okay, honey.

109
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,239
(Honey. Geon's mom.
If you're reading this letter...)

110
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,169
Hae Joon, are you watching us
from above?

111
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,080
Geon and I have been reunited.

112
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:10,979
Now, I have nothing more
to wish for.

113
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,320
You're already done for the day?

114
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,359
Yes, I wanted
to have dinner with you,

115
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,460
so I ran here.

116
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,160
Anyway, what were you reading
that you're crying again?

117
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,270
Oh, this.

118
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,470
Your dad's letter.

119
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,100
Dad's letter?

120
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,869
Yes.

121
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,239
Dan Soo,
you must miss him a lot too.

122
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,210
I guess your dad...

123
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,520
left this for me
because he knew I'd come back.

124
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,119
But he didn't know
it'd take so long.

125
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,460
Honey. Geon's mom.

126
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,429
If you're reading this letter,

127
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:03,299
that would mean you came back
to me and Geon.

128
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,939
I'm writing a few words...

129
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,270
in case we miss each other.

130
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,580
I know that you left us
because of me.

131
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,910
There wasn't any proper proposal
between us,

132
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,510
let alone a wedding.

133
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,150
We never had much to our names,

134
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,820
and whenever
my mother would approach us,

135
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,260
we couldn't even pack up
what little we had...

136
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,289
and had to move from place to place.

137
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,059
If I get to meet you again,

138
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,100
I want to start over.

139
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,200
I still love you.

140
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,669
And...

141
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,100
I don't resent you.

142
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,140
I miss you.

143
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,450
I'll run over to you
to see you soon.

144
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
There.

145
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:00,690
What did I tell you, Geon?

146
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,759
You said you were going out
to find Mom.

147
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,930
You told me to listen
to Gong Hee's mom and dad.

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,070
That's right. Mom and I...

149
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,739
will come back together,
holding hands.

150
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,570
Mom got lost.

151
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,909
I will come home with Mom, okay?

152
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:19,779
- Have fun with Gong Hee.
- Okay.

153
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,479
Dad, one more thing.

154
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,180
Can I play your guitar?

155
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,519
Of course, you can.

156
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,989
- But let's wait...
- Yes?

157
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,190
until your hands...

158
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,529
get to be as big as mine.

159
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,759
I'll teach you then, okay?

160
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:38,899
Okay.

161
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,649
I remember...

162
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,090
Dad from that day.

163
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,389
The day he left to go find you.

164
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,060
He left
with this letter he wrote you...

165
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:12,129
and a ring box.

166
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,129
But...

167
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:20,139
how do you have
this letter and the ring?

168
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,379
I received them too late
through someone else.

169
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,580
Through someone else? Who is that?

170
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,850
Are there others who knew Dad?

171
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,220
I want to meet and talk to them.

172
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,149
That's...

173
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,190
Oh, my.

174
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,190
I heard the news from Gyeong Bok...

175
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,330
that Dan Soo bought this shop.

176
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,800
Dan Soo, good job.

177
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,440
Thank you, Mr. Maeng.

178
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,070
Mom, I wouldn't have been able
to find you without his help.

179
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,070
Oh, please.

180
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,820
So, Dan Soo...

181
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,550
I'll see you at home.

182
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,989
Wait, you should stay
for a cup of tea.

183
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,090
No, I'm off.

184
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,999
Why are you acting like that
around Mr. Maeng?

185
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,070
Did something happen?

186
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,950
Do you still have more to do?

187
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,450
Yes.

188
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,320
Shall we go home together?

189
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,649
I'm done for the day.

190
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,190
No, you can head home first.

191
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,159
Okay, then. I'll be going.

192
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,479
You see, I really like this color.

193
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,320
It will never end
if I only have suspicions.

194
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,690
I must find out for myself.

195
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,259
What is this about?

196
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,499
Well, I mentioned
that I had something to ask you,

197
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,930
but you're not back yet.

198
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,600
I left the office for a meeting
and came straight home.

199
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,540
I'll text you my address.

200
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,340
You can come if it's urgent.

201
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:55,529
Come in.

202
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,060
Have a seat.

203
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Do you want something to drink?

204
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,279
I never thought
you'd be sitting on my sofa.

205
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:15,080
Is coffee okay?

206
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,409
It's decaf.

207
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,379
I need to ask you something.

208
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,050
What could it be?

209
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:24,619
I'm dying to know.

210
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,060
Take a look around the house
while you wait.

211
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,999
There are...

212
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,600
some items in my house
that might pique your interest.

213
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,619
I should get rid of it,

214
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:01,159
but I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

215
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,529
I never thought
I'd have you over at this house.

216
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,399
For me, this is the place
where Min Gi and I lived together.

217
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:14,970
You'll find traces of him
around the house.

218
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,279
The place where you lived together?

219
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:20,909
Would you like to see?

220
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,050
This place is...

221
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,350
full of Min Gi's traces.

222
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:50,409
Didn't you know...

223
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,779
that Seo Min Gi and I
lived together?

224
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,249
Oh, my. This must be news to you.

225
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,389
Seo Min Gi and I dated
for three years,

226
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,450
and we lived together
for over a year.

227
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,129
That's all in the past.

228
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,460
I came to talk about the present.

229
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,830
The present?

230
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,499
Like what?

231
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,670
Like why Seo Min Gi came home late
last night?

232
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,739
I guess you want to know
if he was with me.

233
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,609
You want to believe Min Gi's lie,

234
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,119
but you just don't believe him.

235
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:33,720
So, you want to confirm things
through me.

236
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,519
- Isn't that right?
- The person I'm doubting...

237
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,190
isn't my husband.

238
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,129
It's you, who keeps clinging to
the past that's over and done with.

239
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,259
"The past that's over
and done with?"

240
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,499
Do you really think
it's that simple?

241
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:50,869
What do you think it means
that we lived together?

242
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,239
We may not have had a wedding,

243
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,269
but we practically lived
like a married couple.

244
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,149
There's history between us.

245
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,119
A history that will never disappear
even if you get between us.

246
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,690
What makes you so confident?

247
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,859
Why shouldn't I be confident?

248
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,190
I am...

249
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,590
honest about how I feel.

250
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,029
You took what was precious to me.

251
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,470
I think you have to
pay the price for that.

252
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,269
Weren't you ready for this?

253
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,239
I will...

254
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:32,139
do whatever it takes
not to regret my decision.

255
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,450
For my child,

256
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,710
I will keep my family safe.

257
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:39,249
Is that so?

258
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,489
You must be sure of yourself.

259
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,550
Then, just do that.

260
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,259
Why did you come all the way here
to ask me?

261
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,029
Just believe your husband's lie
and go on with your life.

262
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,960
Seo Min Gi is a smart man,

263
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,200
and he'll come up
with some clever lies.

264
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
It's obvious.

265
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,040
He'll go on with flashy excuses,

266
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,639
like how
he will take responsibility.

267
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,470
How do you love such a cowardly man?

268
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,180
Will you please get out of the way
if you can't do it?

269
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,180
I am...

270
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,779
in love with that man.

271
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,859
I think...

272
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,989
this confirms what I needed to know.

273
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,230
Then,

274
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,300
it's time for me
to confirm something.

275
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,209
You.

276
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,709
Do you love Seo Min Gi?

277
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,550
I guess
you can't bring yourself to lie.

278
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,119
But...

279
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,919
I caught you.

280
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,590
You...

281
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,730
cannot love Seo Min Gi,

282
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:56,260
ever.

283
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:00,359
Do you think you can read my mind?

284
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,530
I know you think you loved him,

285
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,469
and your feelings were sincere.

286
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,570
But it was admiration, not love.

287
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,609
The fangirl mentality.

288
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,280
Coveting something
that can never be yours.

289
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,649
When you realize it,

290
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,119
it'll be too late.

291
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,679
Am I wrong?

292
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,750
Don't think you know everything
about us and our relationship.

293
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,320
Look at you getting worked up.

294
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,429
Does it hurt to hear the truth?

295
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,929
Even so,
you can't be hurting more than I am.

296
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,230
Shall I tell you how I am feeling
as I'm trying...

297
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:38,369
to hold out now?

298
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:39,969
No.

299
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:42,740
I don't want to know.

300
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,379
See? I warned you.

301
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,449
I told you it wouldn't be easy.

302
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,929
Min Gi was with me...

303
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:08,929
last night.

304
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,639
At my place, in my room.

305
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,369
He was with me last night.

306
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,709
You've made such a foolish choice.

307
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,080
You'll soon realize everything,
one by one.

308
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,290
The price for ignoring my advice.

309
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:32,219
You'll surely pay the price now.

310
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,500
(Bus Stop, Heungin Building)

311
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,540
(Seongchang-dong)

312
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,310
Aren't you getting on the bus?

313
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,359
I don't want to go to that house.

314
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:11,600
I want to...

315
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:14,060
go home.

316
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,260
Mom, I'm here.

317
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,429
I'm hungry, Mom!

318
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:45,459
Mom.

319
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,070
No Ah.

320
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,219
Oh, boy.

321
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,949
So, are you saying...

322
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:11,250
I'm getting stressed out
for no reason?

323
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,859
It's perfectly fine for your ex-wife
to meddle in No Ah's life?

324
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:16,290
Do you think I'm in the wrong
for having an issue with it?

325
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,429
No.

326
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,629
When did I say that?

327
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,139
We can't expect Soo Yeon
to completely ignore No Ah.

328
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,040
So, it'd just be easier
if the two of you...

329
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,469
looked away
as if you were complete strangers.

330
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:29,909
Oh, is that why...

331
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,909
you're distancing yourself
from all of it...

332
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:33,679
as if we're complete strangers
to you?

333
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:38,080
I see. You're really good at this.

334
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,719
You'll walk on this tightrope...

335
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:42,320
between Lee Soo Yeon and me until...

336
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,419
Until what?

337
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,959
- Goodness.
- You little...

338
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,429
Dad, do you have to pee?

339
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,770
What? Oh, no.

340
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
My gosh.

341
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,939
When did you get here?

342
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:05,609
You're home.

343
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,050
Oh, my! Auntie Gong Hee is here!

344
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,379
- No Ah.
- My goodness!

345
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:14,119
My one and only sister,
Maeng Gong Hee, is here.

346
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,919
It's so good to see you.

347
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,560
What brings you by?
Have you eaten yet?

348
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,490
You've been taking
those supplements, right?

349
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,689
Yes, Gong Boo.

350
00:22:24,389 --> 00:22:26,260
Why are you going overboard?

351
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,070
Oh, I see.
You must've upset Hong Dan again.

352
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,369
- Goodness.
- Be good to her.

353
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,270
How much longer
will you keep upsetting her?

354
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,300
Why are you nagging me too?

355
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,040
Help me out here, all right?

356
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:40,909
Anyway, what brings you here
at this hour?

357
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,780
Mother will be home late.

358
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,980
Right, no one was home,

359
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,480
so I was going to call you guys.

360
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,490
Anyway, where did everyone go?

361
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,350
Mother and Father...

362
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,060
have been running around
to look for Grandmother.

363
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,590
We just got home after eating out.

364
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,129
I see. I really hope
we find Grandma soon.

365
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:01,669
Maybe I should go out there
and look for her too.

366
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:02,730
Don't.

367
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,530
You're pregnant.

368
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,699
How will you do that and work too?

369
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:09,209
Auntie Gong Hee, is there a baby
growing inside your belly too?

370
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,139
Yes.

371
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:15,649
Your baby cousin is growing
inside my belly.

372
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,449
You'll meet these babies soon.
Lucky you, No Ah.

373
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:21,719
Does that mean
I'll have two baby siblings?

374
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:25,119
You silly goose. You'll have
a baby sibling and a baby cousin.

375
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,290
Don't you dare laugh
in front of me, you little...

376
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:32,899
Goodness.

377
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,129
Aren't things stressful at work?

378
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:37,070
You can tell me everything.

379
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:40,240
Work isn't stressful,

380
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,770
but Grandma keeps pressuring me
for no reason.

381
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:46,109
It doesn't scare me at all,

382
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,280
but I'm worried because of Gong Hee.

383
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,879
What if...

384
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:54,320
she can't do what she wants
because of me?

385
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:58,090
I know how hard she's been working,

386
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,990
so I'm worried.

387
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,459
Right, you don't want it
to affect her negatively.

388
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:04,790
We're both so grateful to her.

389
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,199
I should protect Gong Hee
so that she won't get hurt.

390
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:15,340
Hey, Dan Soo. You know this, right?

391
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,969
Gong Hee is married now.

392
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,480
You can worry about her as a friend,

393
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,310
but nothing more than that.

394
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:27,879
Yes. Of course, I know that.

395
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:32,159
I used to hate it
when she called me a friend,

396
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,189
but I'm now glad that
I can be there as her friend.

397
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,560
After some time,

398
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,929
all these emotions will become dull.

399
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:46,399
You think so?

400
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,740
Will these emotions
really become dull...

401
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:52,240
after some time passes?

402
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,330
Seo Min Gi and I dated
for three years,

403
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,000
and we lived together
for over a year.

404
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,760
There's history between us.

405
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,939
A history that will never disappear
even if you get between us.

406
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,480
What should I do?

407
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,550
What am I going to do?

408
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,679
What are you doing?

409
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,490
Oh, hey.

410
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:40,919
Why are you hitting the punching bag
with your head?

411
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,090
Because I don't have the energy
to actually punch it, okay?

412
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:46,230
Maeng Gong Hee,
where did your spirit go?

413
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,500
I guess
Seo Min Gi has done something wrong.

414
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,600
What is it?

415
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,310
What did he do wrong...

416
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,909
that you're here with a gloomy face?

417
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,350
Hey.

418
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:06,419
Are you all right?

419
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,090
Yes, it's nothing.

420
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,159
I keep getting mood swings
these days.

421
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:16,030
I heard it was to be expected
in early pregnancy.

422
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,129
Don't worry.

423
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,730
What do you mean it's nothing?

424
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,800
It's written all over your face.

425
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,040
You see, even when you were little,

426
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,439
your eye shape changed...

427
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:28,199
when you were trying not to cry.

428
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,439
Your eye shape becomes rectangular.

429
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,510
What?

430
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,409
Who has rectangular eyes?

431
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:39,379
You should eat something first.

432
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:50,230
All right.
I cooked you this ramyeon...

433
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,389
every time you had to work at night.

434
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,859
You're talking as though
you cooked me this every night.

435
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,800
Don't you remember?

436
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,369
Every time you said
you had to pull an all-nighter,

437
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:00,070
I cooked you ramyeon...

438
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,199
and picked up tteokbokki for you.

439
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,770
That's true. Thanks, Gu Dan Soo.

440
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,379
Thanks for this.

441
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,169
You can't swallow?

442
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,810
As if something is stuck
in your throat?

443
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:38,639
Just tell me.

444
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,510
What is it?

445
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:49,389
I feel like
there's this tangled mess...

446
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,820
sitting in my heart.

447
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,560
Where do I begin to untangle this?

448
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,929
Or should I just leave it as it is?

449
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:00,760
I'm not sure...

450
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,830
about anything.

451
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,070
What...

452
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,379
should I do, Gu Dan Soo?

453
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:32,060
(My Merry Marriage)

454
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,899
How shameless of you to come here.

455
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,070
I'm going to be brave
and make an effort as Dan Soo's mom.

456
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,939
You want me to accept
a mere thing like you as my family?

457
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:43,409
She said she'd spend the night
at her parents' house.

458
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:45,109
Did she discuss this with you?

459
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:46,340
Or did she go there
without telling you?

460
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,909
All of a sudden, without a word...

461
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,109
She didn't come home.

462
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,609
She must've been shocked...

463
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,179
from hearing
that we used to live together.

464
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,919
