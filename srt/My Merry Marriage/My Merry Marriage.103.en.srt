1
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,140
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,050
Hello, Mother.

3
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,980
Why did you want to see me?

4
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:33,949
I wanted to
have something delicious with you.

5
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,090
I ordered the food already.

6
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,089
Have a seat.

7
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,130
Mother.

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,729
You know that Min Gi and I
are seeing each other again, right?

9
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:50,569
You're seeing each other?

10
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,039
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

11
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:57,740
I thought
you were just working together.

12
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,350
Actually, we've been
seeing each other for a while.

13
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,550
What?

14
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,579
Then, do you mean...

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,520
you two had an affair?

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,289
I wouldn't call it an affair.

17
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,829
You know this too, Mother.

18
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,859
You can't split us apart easily.

19
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,959
But what on earth...

20
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,300
Is this what caused
the whole divorce thing to come up?

21
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,869
Yes.

22
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,569
Gong Hee also knew about it
the whole time,

23
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,610
but she pretended not to know.

24
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,240
She's meeting with Min Gi now.

25
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,339
I'm sure they'll go ahead
with the divorce.

26
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,809
But the baby was born already.

27
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,050
What do they plan to do?

28
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,149
Gosh, he can't get divorced.

29
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,449
I can't let that happen.

30
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,589
These days, divorce isn't
even considered a flaw, Mother.

31
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,929
But still...

32
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:48,530
I'm saying I'm fine with it.

33
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,459
I'll accept everything.

34
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,100
Did Min Gi ask you to marry him...

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,270
after he gets divorced?

36
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,140
Of course. That's what we should do.

37
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:04,709
We'll sort out
all of Min Gi's mistakes...

38
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,940
and wrong decisions together.

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,949
We didn't have enough trust
in each other,

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,750
so we just wavered for a bit.
That's all.

41
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:13,220
And what about the baby?

42
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,949
We'll take care of that.

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Take care of it?

44
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,390
Hey, is the baby
some kind of nuisance...

45
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,459
you need to take care of?

46
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,130
I mean that
you don't have to worry, Mother.

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Min Gi and I...

48
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,669
will manage things together.

49
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,169
My goodness. What a headache.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,489
I can't just let things go
like this.

51
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:48,949
What do you mean?

52
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,560
Even if they get divorced,

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,060
I should show my full support
for Gong Hee.

54
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,660
What will you do?

55
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,569
Oh, so that's what you mean.

56
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,769
This time,
I won't stay out of this either.

57
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,340
I won't feel better...

58
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,710
until I flatten
Jung Ssang Sook's nose...

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,310
like a piece of dumpling skin.

60
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,949
(Takeout Available)

61
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:29,389
(Maeng Dumplings)

62
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,030
Let's go.

63
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,039
(Maeng Dumplings, Changhwa Diner)

64
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,870
- Oh, dear.
- What's going on?

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,079
Hey, ladies. Where are you going?

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,220
(Mir Home Produce,
Tiffany Alterations)

67
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,729
- Hey.
- What?

68
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,960
My gosh!

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,799
What's up with your outfit?

70
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,229
I'm going to go on a trip
for the time being.

71
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,299
A trip, out of the blue?

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,970
We're going through
a family ordeal as it is.

73
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,810
That's why I have to go somewhere
and take shelter.

74
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,280
With that temper of hers,
Kang Myung Ja...

75
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,710
won't just sit back and watch.

76
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,780
If she finds out
about Min Gi and Ji Na...

77
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:26,479
Gosh, just the thought of it...

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,090
That girl can throw a mean slap.

79
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,220
And she'll pull out all my hair too.

80
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,489
If you knew that,

81
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,530
you should've been nice.

82
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,600
Please.
Enough with your useless advice.

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,499
Anyway, that's that.

84
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,369
Hey, wait.

85
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,270
What?

86
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:50,809
Gyeong Tae?

87
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,109
What?

88
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:55,809
Oh, no.

89
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,049
Hey! How could you let him in?

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,049
The kids are
already discussing divorce.

91
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:05,859
We need to discuss this
between both families.

92
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:08,289
My goodness.
Are you serious right now?

93
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,260
You don't even know anything.

94
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,760
Good grief.

95
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,059
My gosh.

96
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,799
Oh, my.

97
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,140
- Goodness.
- Oh, dear.

98
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,239
Hello...

99
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,169
I am here to put an end...

100
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,410
to the connection
between our families.

101
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,809
Well, the thing is...

102
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:29,249
My Gong Hee...

103
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:32,619
may seem cheerful and strong,
but to me,

104
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,150
she was my precious daughter...

105
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,559
I always worried about
in case she got hurt.

106
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,330
I'm ashamed to face you.

107
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,760
Letting my daughter go through
such an experience on her own...

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,499
crushes my heart...

109
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,799
and tears my heart to shreds!

110
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,739
But...

111
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:56,140
the kids just don't feel
the same way about each other,

112
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,939
so what can we do?

113
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,809
- Look...
- Jung Ssang Sook! You...

114
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,809
- What?
- I was wondering where you went.

115
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,309
- You were here all along.
- Yes.

116
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,919
All right, then.

117
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,150
Then we'll surely win
because we outnumber them.

118
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:08,489
Is that right?

119
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,160
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

120
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,919
- What?
- Goodness.

121
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,760
How could you do that
to my daughter?

122
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,160
But what did I do wrong?

123
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,169
I bowed my head
and asked you for a favor.

124
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,299
I asked you
to look after my Gong Hee.

125
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:27,169
Then you should not
have let this happen.

126
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,470
You shouldn't have let
anything like this happen!

127
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,879
Hey, getting married
isn't everything these days.

128
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,020
If the couple doesn't feel
the same way,

129
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,780
they could get a divorce.

130
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,549
So what?

131
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,020
You invited the woman...

132
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,619
your son
was having an affair with...

133
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,289
and mistreated my Gong Hee?

134
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:48,390
An affair?

135
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:50,859
- Goodness.
- What affair?

136
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,660
That kind girl had to go
to the emergency room by herself...

137
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,330
in the middle of the night!

138
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,770
I won't let you get away with this!

139
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,700
Both you and your son!

140
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,510
I'll make you pay
for your wrongdoings!

141
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,510
Hey.

142
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,080
Why is it my fault
that the baby was born early?

143
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,549
Why are you trying to blame me
and Min Gi for that?

144
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,379
- Words won't get through to you.
- Oh, my.

145
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:11,749
- Kang Myung Ja.
- What?

146
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:12,820
- I'll take you down...
- Goodness.

147
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,150
even if it's the last thing I do!

148
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,249
- Oh, no!
- Stop. My goodness.

149
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:17,720
- Don't get worked up!
- Let go!

150
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,020
- Let's not do this!
- You witch! Let's fight!

151
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,489
- How dare you!
- Get over here!

152
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,030
- No, you can't do this!
- Let go!

153
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,299
- You!
- My hair!

154
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,999
- You can't do this!
- No!

155
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,669
- Don't do this!
- My gosh!

156
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,929
- Let go of me!
- Everybody, stop!

157
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:30,939
- My gosh!
- Oh, my.

158
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,369
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

159
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,869
All of you, seriously...

160
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Oh, dear.

161
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,820
- You.
- Darn it.

by Mutual Consent)

(Applicant: Wife, Maeng Gong Hee)

164
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,460
Let me say this officially.

165
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:36,129
Let's get divorced.

166
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,840
Our baby was born.

167
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,910
And yet, you bring up divorce?
That's so irresponsible.

168
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:49,309
"Irresponsible?"

169
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,050
Hearing that from you...

170
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:55,749
is hilarious.

171
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,859
I am...

172
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:01,029
leaving you so I can be responsible
for Momo properly.

173
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,700
I think it'll be hard to show him
that his parents are happy together.

174
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,129
Since getting married,

175
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,899
I've never been happy,
even for a day.

176
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,040
No.

177
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,840
I was miserable.

178
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,940
I don't want to...

179
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:23,149
pass down
that misery to my child too.

180
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,249

I might have stuck with this, but...

182
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,759
now that I have Momo,

183
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:34,989
I can't just live like this.

184
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
I can't let Momo...

185
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,729
see his mom endure such misery...

186
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,570
as he grows up.

187
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,100
You said...

188
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,979
you weren't happy
while you were with me either.

189
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,940
You said
you didn't want to come home.

190
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,680
Happiness isn't something
we can get by trying.

191
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,879
Happiness is...

192
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,149
a matter of the heart.

193
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,889
I realized that...

194
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:06,920
over and over again...

195
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,690
throughout our marriage.

196
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,109
Then what about our baby?

197
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,139
We also need to decide
who will get custody of the child.

198
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,680
- When we submit the paperwork...
- I'm not asking about that.

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,249
That baby is my son.

200
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,649
I am his father.

201
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,119
Whether it's about
the parental rights or custody,

202
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,060
I have my rights too.

203
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:41,629
Give her parental rights
and full custody.

204
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,430
Let her take them all.

205
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,499
We're talking.

206
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,139
Give us some privacy.

207
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,040
Your divorce isn't just about
the two of you.

208
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,070
It involves me as well.

209
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:57,609
You just admitted...

210
00:10:58,109 --> 00:10:59,409
that you two had an affair.

211
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:04,350
I started dating him before you did,

212
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,749
and the two of us...

213
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,450
The way we feel about each other
has never changed.

214
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,649
Right.

215
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,820
I know that now.

216
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:17,729
Tell us what you want.

217
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,300
Whatever it is, you'll get it.

218
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,529
Do you want money?
Sure, we'll give you money.

219
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:25,670
Be it your alimony
or child support money.

220
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,869
We'll give you
however much you want.

221
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,070
Kang Ji Na.

222
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,009
We'll take responsibility
for what happened.

223
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:33,139
Is there a better solution
than money?

224
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,149
Money is the best solution.

225
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,550
No, this is about my child.
I am his father.

226
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,190
If that's what you want,
I can't divorce you.

227
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,019
This is why I came here.

228
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,330
Seo Min Gi.

229
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,100
Get it together.

230
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,369
Your marriage has been broken
for a while.

231
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
Tell us.

232
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,139
How much do you want?

233
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,970
Money?

234
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,109
I don't want
a single penny from you.

235
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,379
I refuse to raise my child...

236
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:09,609
with your filthy money.

237
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
What?

238
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,550
"Filthy money?"

239
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,159
I'll see you in court.

240
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:39,909
Gong Hee.

241
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:44,749
The baby...

242
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,479
I don't need you
to take responsibility.

243
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm off.

244
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,420
Just let me do this one thing.

245
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,989
Even just once a week,

246
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,529
please let me see the baby.

247
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,259
I know he's in the hospital now,

248
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:01,029
but it'll be hard for me to see him
once he's discharged.

249
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,639
I am his dad,
no matter what you say.

250
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,509
At least let me do that as his dad.

251
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,340
Please.

252
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,009
As you know, Momo is
my parents' first grandchild.

253
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,220
If you won't even let me see him
once a week,

254
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,889
I can't divorce you.

255
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,499
I told you I'd let you have your way
with everything else,

256
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,129
so you can at least grant
one wish of mine, right?

257
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,840
I'll let you be there for him
as his father.

258
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,210
Our ill-fated relationship
made me so miserable,

259
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,080
but you are still his dad.

260
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,050
I really hope...

261
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,019
you'll wholeheartedly cherish
your child.

262
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,970
- My gosh.
- I'm home.

263
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,970
Hey.

264
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,279
Come on in. Let's eat.

265
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,050
Okay, Mom.

266
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,019
Come and sit here, Gong Hee.

267
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,019
Thank you.

268
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,759
My gosh, Ms. Kang.

269
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,820
The soybean paste soup
tastes amazing today.

270
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,330
Even calling you an artisan
doesn't do you justice.

271
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,899
You should be given
the cultural heritage title.

272
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,700
Why, that...

273
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,100
Look at our tenant
with that sly tongue of his.

274
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,970
Because of you,

275
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,100
My mom doesn't care about me
even though I'm her real son.

276
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:50,340
Dan Soo may not be her real son,
but isn't he her ideal son?

277
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,540
He's our ideal son as we all wish
we had a son like him.

278
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,279
My gosh. You're right.

279
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,680
Dan Soo is our ideal son.

280
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,550
"Ideal son?" So what?
I am the real deal.

281
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,649
Goodness.
So what if you're my real son?

282
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,359
You're still asking for a spanking
even at your age.

283
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,659
Come on! Now,

284
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,659
I have two kids.

285
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,659
I'm no longer
everyone's punching bag.

286
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,470
Was Dad everyone's punching bag?

287
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,570
Yes!

288
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,310
What's the matter now?

289
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,609
I just...

290
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,979
missed seeing the whole family
sitting around the table...

291
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,389
while eating together.

292
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:39,960
Hurry up and eat.

293
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,529
Okay.

294
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,060
Yes, let's eat.

295
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,570
Here.

296
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:57,710
- It's good.
- Right?

297
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,180
It's so good.

298
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,249
Try this too.

299
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,080
You're giving me all the meat.

300
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,649
Maeng Gong Hee, sit here.

301
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,090
Oh, what is this?

302
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:17,899
Open it.

303
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,800
Hey, what is all this?

304
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,470
While walking along
the streets of France,

305
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,600
I bought
all the baby clothes I saw...

306
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,769
because I thought of Momo.

307
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:30,170
You bought so many things.

308
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,180
Try going to France and see
if you can resist the temptation.

309
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,180
When you're out walking,

310
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,680
you see shops that sell baby clothes
everywhere.

311
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,279
Look, they're so cute that
you must buy them once you see them.

312
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,119
They really are so adorable.

313
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I've been so all over the place...

314
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,590
that I didn't even have time
to buy Momo's clothes.

315
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,060
It was my first time
buying baby clothes.

316
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,389
The great Holly picked them.

317
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,700
You're right.

318
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,300
Holly picked out these things
for my Momo.

319
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:56,399
Thanks, Dan Soo.

320
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,840
Just you wait.

321
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:59,840
When Momo is healthier and older,

322
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,810
I'll design his clothes myself.

323
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,170
You'll design his clothes?

324
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,979
The baby clothing market in Korea
isn't big.

325
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,009
Babies grow out of their clothes
very quickly,

326
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:10,210
so people rarely buy nice clothes
for them.

327
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:13,779
I'll make luxurious clothes
for Momo.

328
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:17,149
Baby clothes?

329
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,960
Why are you making that face?

330
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,430
This is suspicious.

331
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,100
Something tells me that you'll start
burning the midnight oil again.

332
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,520
So, you're here at last.

333
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,429
Sorry for my late greeting, Mother.

334
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,760
"Mother?"

335
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:02,869
I am here as Dan Soo's mom,
you know.

336
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,699
You two were adamant about this,
so I couldn't stop you,

337
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:08,109
but I am against you
living together.

338
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:11,240
I suggest
you rethink your decision, Mom.

339
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,109
If you're that worried,

340
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,949
you should move in
and live with us too.

341
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:20,350
I really want to,

342
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,290
but there's someone
I'm worried about.

343
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,919
Don't worry about us.

344
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,929
We're both adults, you know.

345
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,530
It's our problem,

346
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,330
so it's only right that
we fix it between ourselves.

347
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,500
Let's see how long
that shameless face can last here.

348
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,699
If I could grant Dan Soo's wish
by doing this,

349
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,740
I'll do whatever it takes.

350
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,209
So, that's it for welcoming
the new family member?

351
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,080
You should welcome her
with a nice meal.

352
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,119
Welcome her with what?

353
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,550
Like you said,
she's my family, not a guest.

354
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,790
You said
you were my daughter-in-law.

355
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:01,889
I'd like to have a meal
prepared by my daughter-in-law.

356
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,359
What? Where did the housekeepers go?

357
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,570
I told them to take some time off.

358
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:11,800
I sent them on vacation.

359
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,639
Let's see if her hands...

360
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,080
can work as fast as
that sly brain of hers.

361
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,639
I knew you'd do this, Grandma.

362
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:23,709
Don't.

363
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,149
Mother, what should I do first?

364
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,790
The housekeepers aren't here,
so the kitchen is a mess.

365
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,060
Tidy up the kitchen first.

366
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,659
You're treating her
like a housekeeper, not your family!

367
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:39,929
I can't believe this.

368
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,939
This wasn't your promise.

369
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,139
Shouldn't you at least act like
you're trying to keep your promise?

370
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,040
You told me
to accept her as my family.

371
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,209
I am treating her
like a member of my family now.

372
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,209
Grandma.

373
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,310
Did you think...

374
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,949
I'd laugh with her
and live happily with her?

375
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,050
Do you actually think
we can get along overnight?

376
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:06,090
That would actually be more fake
and a way of tricking you.

377
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,590
All right. If you keep this up,

378
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,159
I'm going to take Mom
and leave again.

379
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,389
Go ahead.

380
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,929
If she can't even handle this much,

381
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,169
there would be no need for me
to accept her as my family.

382
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,840
My gosh.

383
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,409
You don't have to do all this.
Let's go, Mom.

384
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:31,719
Goodness.

385
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:33,750
I'm fine.

386
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,449
Don't mind me. Just go to work.

387
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,719
Mom,
why are you acting like this too?

388
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:41,320
I was determined to deal with this
when I decided to live here.

389
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,260
Compared to what the chairwoman
has done to me in the past,

390
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,490
this is no big deal.

391
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,830
I'm just glad
she didn't kick us out.

392
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:49,530
I feel like I can see hope.

393
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,939
Mom.

394
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,409
Dan Soo,
you gave me this opportunity.

395
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,209
I'll do a good job.

396
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:01,209
So, you shouldn't get angry
in front of the chairwoman either.

397
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,379
Okay?

398
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,219
My goodness.

399
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:12,560
Mom, I'm here.

400
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,090
Ma'am.

401
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,659
Oh, my.

402
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,929
Why are you here again?

403
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,230
What do you mean?

404
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,869
I wanted to come every day.
It was hard to stop myself...

405
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:24,939
for a few days.

406
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,340
She waited for you too.

407
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,740
She's just being grumpy.

408
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,369
I told you to wait
in the visiting room.

409
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:34,209
Why did you come all the way in?
It's a bother.

410
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:36,409
You always refuse to see me,

411
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,550
so I have no choice
but to barge into your room.

412
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,750
This is what my daughter is like.
She's so stubborn.

413
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,750
I see.

414
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:46,389
Has Mom been eating well?

415
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,189
Well, no.

416
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,260
Ma'am.

417
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,199
Have a good time with your daughter.

418
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,270
Mom, this is pumpkin porridge.
Try some.

419
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:04,540
What?

420
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:05,980
It'll be easy on your stomach.

421
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,480
Myung Ok and Myung Hee
came by earlier...

422
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,609
and brought me some food,
so I already ate.

423
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,179
Myung Ok and Myung Hee were here?

424
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,050
Myung Ja.

425
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,590
Yes, Mom?

426
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,389
Do you know what I regret the most
at this point in life?

427
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:26,929
The time when I got mad...

428
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,270
and spoke harshly to my sister,
Bok Yi.

429
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,770
I was ten years old,

430
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,740
and Bok Yi was 12.

431
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,609
That day,

432
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,350
I kept acting up to Bok Yi...

433
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,949
and spoke so harshly to her.

434
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,919
I told her that I hated her.

435
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,189
That I was embarrassed
that she was my sister.

436
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:55,429
Stuff like that.

437
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:57,990
But...

438
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,399
the next day,

439
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,100
Bok Yi left this world.

440
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,439
Why?

441
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,369
Back in the day,

442
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,980
people died of simple fevers too.

443
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,250
The hospital was so far away.

444
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,780
She died on Mom's back
on the way to the hospital.

445
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,889
I should've said...

446
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,919
that I actually really liked her.

447
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,159
I wonder why I was so spiteful.

448
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:30,429
All my life,

449
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,659
I've lived with regret in my heart.

450
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,669
Myung Ja, you had arguments...

451
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:43,109
with your brothers and sisters
because of me,

452
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,109
didn't you?

453
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:49,550
Don't be like that.

454
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:52,520
If the ugly words...

455
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,750
you spat out today...

456
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:58,659
become your final words,

457
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,330
you will live with regret
all your life.

458
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,300
You think
you can work things out tomorrow,

459
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,969
but who can guarantee
that there will be a tomorrow?

460
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,770
They were all saying something
about having you stay...

461
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,969
at a nursing home.
I was just so frustrated.

462
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,510
They don't even know how you feel.

463
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,010
Myung Ja.

464
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:24,250
You know how I feel,
and that's all I need.

465
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,820
You get how I feel, right?

466
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,090
Goodness, Mom. You don't have
any strength in your hands.

467
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,699
You should eat...

468
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,159
So,

469
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,770
what poem did you write today?

470
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,429
Go on and read it to me.

471
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
All right.

472
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,409
Ssook Ssook is here!

473
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,879
Ssook Ssook is here, Mother.

474
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,520
Hey, Ssook Ssook!

475
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,949
Oh, my. Welcome.

476
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,320
Come here.

477
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,990
My goodness.

478
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,060
She's gotten bigger already.

479
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:11,699
She used to be the size of my fist,

480
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:14,230
but she's already
the size of my palm now.

481
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,600
Goodness, I remember
when Gong Boo was this small too.

482
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,399
Dad?

483
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,070
Of course.
You were like that too, No Ah.

484
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,139
Don't you remember?

485
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,280
That's a lie.

486
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Hey, Maeng No Ah.

487
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,909
Are you all ready
to be a big brother?

488
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,980
Being a big brother is
a harsh path of struggle.

489
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,419
You will soon find out too, No Ah.

490
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,119
You will be ignored
and looked down upon left and right,

491
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,790
receive laser-sharp gazes,

492
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,859
and face even more painful punches
and kicks.

493
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:47,560
Just like
what Auntie does to you, Dad?

494
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:48,929
Yes.

495
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,770
- That's right.
- My goodness.

496
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,139
You shouldn't say that to a kid.

497
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,939
It's okay, Grandma.

498
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:57,340
I'm different from Dad.

499
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,780
Auntie also said Dad and I...

500
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,050
were only alike in our looks.

501
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,810
Hey, are you trying to get away
by yourself?

502
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,050
- Auntie.
- Oh, my.

503
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,090
- Auntie!
- By the way,

504
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:11,350
I don't see Gong Hee.

505
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,899
(Court)

506
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:29,369
I should've tried harder.

507
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,639
I feel like things ended in vain.

508
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:35,409
We contemplated things enough...

509
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,179
and decided it carefully.

510
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,020
And we've endured enough.

511
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,719
I meant that I feel this is a shame.

512
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:53,030
I wish you happiness.

513
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,129
As Momo's dad,

514
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,169
be happy.

515
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,070
Until the end,

516
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:03,369
you leave me...

517
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,639
with nothing to say.

518
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,219
I didn't know what I was doing,

519
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:52,520
but there were moments
when I believed this was love.

520
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,290
I wanted to believe it,

521
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,030
and I tried hard
to make things work.

522
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,040
One truth that I realized
after this long detour...

523
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,179
is that a sense of responsibility
that takes too much effort...

524
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,850
isn't exactly love.

525
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,449
You shouldn't get married like that.

526
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,750
Now,

527
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,689
it's time to find myself again.

528
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,000
(My Merry Marriage)

529
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,429
Let's go with Maeng In Sung.

530
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:37,530
How about naming her...

531
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,040
Maeng Rang Hee
so she grows up to be cheerful?

532
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,500
I was supposed to see him today.

533
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,169
I don't think I'll have time
other than today.

534
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,639
Mom went to a naming specialist
and got a name for Momo.

535
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:47,409
Is the baby doing okay?
What about the baby's name?

536
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:48,409
How could you
only talk about the baby...

537
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:49,510
as soon as you get home
