1
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,970
Why did you want to meet at my shop?

2
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,209
I suggested we meet here.

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,580
Besides, it'd be nice
to help boost your sales.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,119
Why should we meet
at an expensive restaurant?

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
We all know that
you can't afford it anyway.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,350
Am I wrong?

7
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,890
Hey, it's not like you know
how much I have in my bank account.

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,890
Calm down.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,529
She sure has a knack
for making everything sound so mean.

10
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,129
Gosh, stop.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,329
Today should be all about me.

12
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,129
My son is...

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,669
finally getting married.

14
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,270
- My gosh. Congratulations.
- Let me see.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,669
Oh, my. I know he recently passed
the civil service exam.

16
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:58,239
And he's getting married right away?

17
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,309
Congratulations.

18
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,679
I should be able to tell you
some good news soon too.

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,349
About what?

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,690
Are they already talking
about marriage after the blind date?

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,520
No, he turned down
the blind date after all.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Why?

23
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,989
Didn't he break up with the daughter
of the department store family?

24
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,190
You asked me
to set him up with someone.

25
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:19,160
My goodness. Is that true?

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,830
Oh, dear.

27
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,900
You bragged about it nonstop.

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,010
Actually, they didn't break up.

29
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,279
You know how young couples get
when they fight.

30
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,779
I guess I read the situation wrong.

31
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,180
Things are going well again
between them.

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,510
Are you sure about that?

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,950
Aren't you just deluding yourself
into thinking that?

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,950
She says
she can never forget my Min Gi.

35
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,950
So, what can he do?

36
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,519
To be honest, I don't like her.

37
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,290
I can't break them up when they say
they can't live without each other.

38
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,960
You kept bragging
about your future daughter-in-law...

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,659
from a powerful family.

40
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,400
Right. You bragged about it
in advance, so if it falls through,

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,499
it'll be so embarrassing.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,409
Your daughter got her hopes up.
I feel bad for her.

43
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:06,809
Hey, what do you mean
my daughter got her hopes up?

44
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:10,180
Your son led her on.

45
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,650
Every evening after work,
he called her...

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,120
- and took her out for dinner.
- Every day, he called her and...

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,990
Are you sure
he wants to get married?

48
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:19,859
If he really does, he's a weirdo.

49
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:23,829
Hey, there's nothing weird
with my son.

50
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,130
I know you're heartbroken
because your daughter,

51
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,700
who's a mere intern,
got her hopes up,

52
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,070
but that's your problem.

53
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,269
I'm heartbroken? "Heartbroken?"

54
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,339
I am relieved. So relieved!

55
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,339
- Hey!
- What?

56
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,350
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

57
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,089
Did you think I'd leave you alone?

58
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:57,359
You took Hae Joon away from me.
Was that not enough for you?

59
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,630
I took Hae Joon away from you?

60
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,369
Who was the one
that took my son from me?

61
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,369
Leave at once.

62
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,899
Don't show up in front of me again.

63
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:08,709
If you want to live, that is!

64
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,280
Do you think you can hide the fact
that I'm Geon's mother forever...

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
by doing this?

66
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:17,980
You even changed Geon's name.

67
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Of course, I had to get rid...

68
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,290
of that ugly name
you'd come up with.

69
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:23,989
Did you think
I'd let him keep that name?

70
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,429
Don't tell me...

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,230
you met Dan Soo.

72
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,669
No, she didn't.
I've already checked, ma'am.

73
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,709
If you hover around Dan Soo,

74
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,739
I'll carry out
the terms of our agreement.

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,049
Don't forget that
this is your last chance.

76
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,780
Live the rest of your life...

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,820
as if you're dead.

78
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:56,119
I won't run away anymore.

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,660
I've been running away
my whole life. I will never...

80
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,000
Think about your despicable parents.
Your filthy blood.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,500
Do you want it
to ruin Dan Soo's future too?

82
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,070
The money I gave your father!

83
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,940
- Mr. Seo.
- Yes, ma'am.

84
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,049
I assume you showed up again...

85
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,320
because you were ready
for the consequences.

86
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,790
Ma'am.

87
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:38,599
Ma'am, I'll never show up
in front of Dan Soo.

88
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:41,670
Please let me watch him from afar.

89
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:45,000
Please just let me
watch Dan Soo from afar.

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,469
Please, have mercy on me.

91
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,579
I beg you.
Please give me some time. Please?

92
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:54,979
Please, ma'am.

93
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,610
- Please give me some time.
- Don't do this!

94
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,450
- Ma'am, please...
- Don't do this.

95
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,389
- Don't do this!
- What are you doing?

96
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,920
- Please...
- Please get up. Don't do this.

97
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,820
I'll help you up.
Hold on. Please get up.

98
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,130
Please... Please help me.

99
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,860
Help me.

100
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,329
- Please leave.
- Are you all right?

101
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,130
You two, please leave. Now!

102
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,430
(Oh J. Eun)

103
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,010
You should get going, ma'am.

104
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,969
I'll come back here
and take care of it.

105
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,539
Do not let her go like this.

106
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,610
We absolutely can't let her
show up in front of Dan Soo.

107
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,719
Ma'am, you should go home
and get some rest.

108
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,550
Your health comes first.

109
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,659
You two should really reconcile.

110
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,389
Will you two keep fighting forever?

111
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,930
She's right. I feel so anxious
every time I meet you girls.

112
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Stop fighting, you two.

113
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,769
Myung Ja always provokes me first.
You girls know that too.

114
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:53,370
Then don't make me provoke you.

115
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,180
Hey, Ssang Sook put her scarf
around my brother's neck.

116
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,209
What?

117
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,409
Does that make sense to you girls?

118
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,519
I told you. His neck looked cold.

119
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,849
I was worried he might catch a cold.

120
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,250
What are you, a doctor?

121
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,320
Why do you care
if my husband catches a cold?

122
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,550
It's none of your business.

123
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,120
Before he became your husband,

124
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,729
we were close friends who grew up
in the same neighborhood. Why?

125
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,490
"Same neighborhood?"

126
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,529
Hey, did you live
in the same neighborhood?

127
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:22,370
No. We lived in Seoha-dong,
and she lived in Dongsang-dong.

128
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,099
You. Should I go ahead
and tell the girls...

129
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,909
what you did to my husband?

130
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,010
Forget it!

131
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,479
I won't come to your shop anymore.

132
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,380
Don't come!
We won't sell anything to you!

133
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,519
- My goodness.
- You're always welcome here.

134
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,450
- Get home safely.
- All right, bye.

135
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,750
- Bye.
- See you soon.

136
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,990
All right. Thanks for coming.

137
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,990
No problem.

138
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,459
My goodness.

139
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,360
You get so angry
whenever you see Ssang Sook.

140
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,159
And you keep getting feistier.

141
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,670
Whenever I see Ssang Sook's face,

142
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,670
my blood boils. What can I do?

143
00:06:57,269 --> 00:06:58,269
Gosh, whatever.

144
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,839
I'm sick and tired of acting
as your personal firefighter.

145
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,209
But I was worried...

146
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,310
that Gong Hee might like her son.

147
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,349
I'm so relieved
that it's not the case.

148
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,849
Yes, I couldn't be more relieved.

149
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:13,620
If you two became in-laws...
My gosh.

150
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,149
Just thinking about it
gives me a terrible headache.

151
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,159
That's why I told Gong Hee
not to even dream of it...

152
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,959
to prevent it from happening.

153
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,229
Right, you made the right call.

154
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,329
Oh, right.
We have a group reservation later,

155
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,969
but we've run out of green onions.

156
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,200
What? Already?

157
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,700
We've been pretty busy, you know.

158
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,339
Hold on. Should I run to the store
and get some now?

159
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,709
No. I have them stocked up at home.

160
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:37,779
I'll run home and get some.

161
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:38,940
Okay, go.

162
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,539
Oh, boy.

163
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,579
Ssang Sook, that girl.
Look at this fluff. Is she a cat?

164
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,750
Did she have to wear that fur coat?
Goodness.

165
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:49,849
What are you doing?

166
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,130
You didn't come home last night.

167
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,659
You should've come straight
to the shop.

168
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,329
What are you doing here now?

169
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,769
Porridge.

170
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,200
You're making porridge?

171
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,700
What for?

172
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,310
I told you. Detective An is sick.

173
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,510
If he's sick,
his wife should take care of him.

174
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,979
Why should you make porridge
for him?

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,649
Well, his wife is sick too.

176
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,120
He gave it to her while kissing her.
Funny, right?

177
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,620
I don't want to know
whether or not they kissed.

178
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,089
Then you could've just asked me
to make some porridge for them.

179
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,019
Why are you doing this?
It's so unlike you.

180
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,360
Come on. I can do this much.

181
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,670
Suit yourself.

182
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,099
Goodness.

183
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,570
When your own wife is sick...

184
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,700
Forget porridge.

185
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,240
You never even take anything
out of the fridge for me.

186
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:51,680
This upcoming fashion week
is all the rage already.

187
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,349
Everyone says the company that gets Holly
will generate the most buzz.

188
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:57,290
It's already the talk of the town.

189
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,020
I know.

190
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,829
So, go and get Holly.

191
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,300
I'll contact the agency and try
to negotiate with them again.

192
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,700
Negotiate with them again? How?

193
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:10,499
Come up with a solid plan!

194
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:14,570
So...

195
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,109
instead of the agency,

196
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,379
what about making
a direct offer to Holly?

197
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,890
I think
Holly has lived a lonely life.

198
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,119
I believe Holly wants
to comfort those...

199
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,459
who are lonely just like her
through her designs.

200
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:37,229
How about I try sending an email?

201
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:38,999
Know your place.

202
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,999
I'm in charge of this.

203
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:44,739
Try it.

204
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,009
Director Lee.

205
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,209
We desperately need this.

206
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,479
We should do something!

207
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,050
Gong Hee, you send Holly an email.

208
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,650
If you get a response,
let's plan things all over again.

209
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:19,469
Let's meet at the cafe
in front of the office after work.

210
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,469
I'll be waiting.

211
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,820
Let's hear why he didn't come...

212
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,259
and why he didn't even call.

213
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,160
You're meeting Seo Min Gi today,
aren't you?

214
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Hey.

215
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:50,530
What if someone hears you?

216
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,140
Did you do something wrong?

217
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,940
Why date someone
if you're going to keep it a secret?

218
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:57,440
That's because
it's an office romance.

219
00:10:58,839 --> 00:10:59,839
After you meet him,

220
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
call me.

221
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,810
Why?

222
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,950
Just do as I say.

223
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,589
Why are you so reckless?

224
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:09,690
It's the same with Holly.

225
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,320
How could you say you'd do it
without any plans?

226
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:16,489
What?

227
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:19,129
What's wrong with him?

228
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,430
Oh, my.

229
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Goodness.

230
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,369
- What...
- Ma'am, let me check your IV.

231
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,079
My gosh. Where did she go?

232
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,879
Wait.

233
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,849
(Registration, Cashier)

234
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:43,690
Goodness.

235
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:46,190
(General Ward B)

236
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,959
Oh, excuse me.

237
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,530
There's a female patient
who was admitted last night.

238
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,099
She's pretty tall
and strongly built.

239
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,670
Her hair comes down
past her shoulders.

240
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,739
- Ma'am, she's not here.
- Haven't you seen her?

241
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,070
I think she has run away.

242
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,379
I'll see where she went
and go after her.

243
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,879
Oh, okay. Thank you.

244
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,910
Goodness. Where has she gone?

245
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,459
Oh, dear.

246
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,290
Audrey.

247
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,660
Why are you sitting here like this?

248
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,969
Please... Help me.

249
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:31,239
Hae Joon's family
won't leave me alone.

250
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,900
If they know
that I'm living near Geon...

251
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,440
I can't get caught.

252
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,109
Mr. Maeng. Please...

253
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,109
They're scary people.

254
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,910
They're scary people.

255
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,579
- Help me.
- I will help.

256
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,920
I'll do whatever it takes.

257
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,150
Don't worry.

258
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,790
Let's go.

259
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,119
Oh, please...

260
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,999
They say...

261
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,800
they can't allow anyone
besides her guardian...

262
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,770
to check the security footage.

263
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,170
So? Are you saying you lost her?

264
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,739
I'm looking for her
in every way I can.

265
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,339
We don't know what she might do.

266
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,670
Dan Soo...

267
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,280
If my Dan Soo were to find out...

268
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,879
Ma'am, you must get some rest...

269
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,479
How could I get any rest?

270
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,089
How on earth did she find out
that Hae Joon had died...

271
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,520
and come here like this?

272
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:26,119
She was hiding quietly for 20 years,

273
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,119
but all of a sudden?

274
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,530
Does she have money issues?

275
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,570
I'll look into that too.

276
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:37,369
She must want something...

277
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,040
to suddenly show up like this.

278
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,270
The likes of her never let go
once they've got their grips on you.

279
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,410
That vermin.

280
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,379
If I can control her with money,
I'll do that.

281
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:50,680
If not, I will make her afraid.

282
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,390
She is...

283
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,190
a dirty secret weighing me down
all my life.

284
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,560
I will never let Dan Soo meet her.

285
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,239
Miss.

286
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,280
You should smile.

287
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,180
If you smile brightly
with a wedding dress on,

288
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,009
the groom will be blown away.

289
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:23,150
As if.

290
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,520
The man out there
probably won't care that much.

291
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,920
Whenever he says anything,
he just has to mention my age.

292
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,989
Does he think he won't get older?

293
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:37,629
Am I the only one
who gets older each year?

294
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:42,270
Come on. Any man would be overcome
with emotions in this situation.

295
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,900
And even the most stoic groom...

296
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,499
will be moved to tears...

297
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:49,440
to see his bride
in a dress like this.

298
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,810
Then, he'll start acting
like a photographer...

299
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,079
and take 100 or 200 photos.

300
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,079
You just can't stop them.

301
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:57,849
Will he...

302
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,780
really act like that?

303
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:10,390
Here comes the bride.

304
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,709
What's with his reaction?

305
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,009
It's not like him to be so touched.

306
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,150
Oh, my.

307
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:37,589
This is seriously incredible.

308
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:42,729
Does it look that nice?

309
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,060
How does it cover it up so well?

310
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:46,729
What?

311
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,629
Cover what up?

312
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,540
How does it cover up
her belly fat so well?

313
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,440
This isn't just a dress.

314
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,469
It's the result of modern science.

315
00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:01,249
The shape of the torso covers up
your chubby belly perfectly.

316
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:03,979
Who is the designer?
Is it a scientist?

317
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,020
No...

318
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:08,719
That's enough.

319
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,489
And this isn't just belly fat.
This is...

320
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:15,030
It is proof that
our Ssook Ssook is growing well.

321
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,790
Yes, I'm an ob-gyn.

322
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,229
I've seen so many women's bellies
in early pregnancy.

323
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,700
Your belly right now...

324
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,570
is exactly
100 percent pure belly fat.

325
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,369
Hey! Shut your mouth.

326
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,869
Unbelievable.

327
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,209
It's a wonder of the world!

328
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,040
This design is a miracle.

329
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,849
I told you to shut your mouth.

330
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:37,079
Why? Turn around.

331
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,520
Let's see
if your love handles are poking out.

332
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,780
You punk!

333
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,879
No, miss!

334
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:49,729
I think I heard something...

335
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
This is all your fault.

336
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:54,629
Whatever.

337
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,140
I'm sorry.
Were you waiting for a while?

338
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,150
Compared to how long I waited
in the park,

339
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,680
this wasn't that long.

340
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,289
Gong Hee.

341
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:53,719
I actually have something
to tell you.

342
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,630
What is it...

343
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,330
that you're hesitating so much?

344
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,100
Let's...

345
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,670
break up.

346
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,239
Pardon?

347
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,140
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Is that...

349
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,489
What do you mean...

350
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Why?

351
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:28,959
At least give me a reason...

352
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,029
There must be a reason.

353
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,529
I don't think
I can tell you the details.

354
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,100
I think that would be better
for you too.

355
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:41,670
I don't understand
anything you're saying right now.

356
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:45,709
It just happened.

357
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,219
"It just happened?"

358
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,519
Do you know
when I heard that before?

359
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,959
When my parents made me...

360
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,529
quit going to a study hall
to pay for my brother's tutors.

361
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,259
When I was taken out
of the school's scholarship list...

362
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,630
because of
a professor's favorite student.

363
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,069
That's what people say...

364
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,769
when they don't even have
a good reason to give.

365
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,009
"It just happened."

366
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,809
"I can't bother to tell you,
so just understand."

367
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,580
That's what that means.

368
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,719
Please know this, though.

369
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:31,390
I was sincere in every moment...

370
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,519
I was with you.

371
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,330
If you were sincere
in every moment...

372
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,170
(Ji Na)

373
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,709
(Ji Na)

374
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,350
Well...

375
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,749
That was an urgent call.

376
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,850
I should get going.

377
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,489
So,

378
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,430
that's it?

379
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,700
I know I'm not allowed
to say the word "sorry."

380
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,410
But still, I'm sorry.

381
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,110
I'm really...

382
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:32,749
sorry.

383
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,880
As of today,
Seo Min Gi's time is mine.

384
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,390
Would you marry me?

385
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,559
You blindsided me.

386
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,890
I didn't put a ring inside a cake.

387
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,469
What will you do if I say no?

388
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:25,170
Then we'll fight like crazy again.

389
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:28,910
What should I break this time?
Not the vase.

390
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,410
I'll break the TV or something.

391
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:39,819
I was going to
propose to you properly again.

392
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,749
For a man like you,

393
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,459
I don't care
if I have to propose first.

394
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:52,499
All you have to do
is give me your answer.

395
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,700
Why do you need to hear my answer?

396
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:57,930
You already know my answer.

397
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,940
Sorry about that!

398
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,799
Have some.

399
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,269
You know, I'm not a good cook.

400
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,309
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

401
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,809
You help me out every single time.

402
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:18,950
Eat up so that
you can get your strength back.

403
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,219
You didn't tell Myung Ja, did you?

404
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,059
About Dan Soo.

405
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,529
It's not that I don't trust her.

406
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,700
But if she finds out,

407
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,299
Dan Soo might find out too.
I'm just scared.

408
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,539
I didn't tell anyone.

409
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,269
Put your worries to rest.

410
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:45,380
Am I being too greedy?

411
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,479
Leaving this place is probably
the right thing to do, but...

412
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:53,779
Don't leave.

413
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:56,549
Stay by Dan Soo's side.

414
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,059
You regretted your decision
in the past.

415
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,819
Don't do something
you'll regret again.

416
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,390
Life is too short for that.

417
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,630
I'll help you.

418
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,569
But if I stay by Dan Soo's side...

419
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:12,840
Can I really do that?

420
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,209
He may resent you,

421
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:17,209
but you are still his mother.

422
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:22,209
Embrace his resentment...

423
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,319
so he won't have to
keep it bottled up inside...

424
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,779
and feel miserable anymore.

425
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,390
Hurry up and eat.

426
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,860
You need to get your strength back.

427
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,709
Hurry up and recover.

428
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,680
Once you pull yourself together,

429
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:59,120
I'll tell you everything.

430
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,850
If you tell me
to get down on my knees, I will.

431
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,890
If you want me to beg you,

432
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:05,590
I will.

433
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:09,989
I'll give you the ring
and confess...

434
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,729
everything to you.

435
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
My gosh.

436
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,569
Why? What is it?

437
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:25,940
I've never tasted
porridge like this before.

438
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:30,450
I can feel every grain of rice
moving around in my mouth.

439
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,779
Oh, no. Goodness.

440
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,049
I'm sorry. Oh, boy.

441
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,289
Goodness. Let me see.

442
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:45,259
- It wasn't like that earlier.
- Here, I'll finish it.

443
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,430
But I gave you a lot.

444
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,430
That's okay.

445
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,809
Tell me the truth.

446
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
What is going on between you
and Ssang Sook's son?

447
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,850
What do you mean, what's going on?

448
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
You two.

449
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,620
Nothing's going on, right?
Can I trust you on that?

450
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,620
You need to be careful
when men just want to play you.

451
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,330
Don't be naive
and get betrayed later on.

452
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,559
Mom, what are you talking about?

453
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,660
He wasn't trying to play me.

454
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,729
Then what was he doing?

455
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:24,930
He's engaged.

456
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,410
What? He's what?

457
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,340
Ssang Sook
couldn't stop bragging about it.

458
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,239
She said she'd be able to tell us
some good news soon.

459
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,180
Apparently, his fiancee is
from a powerful family.

460
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,450
My goodness.

461
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,950
No way. You must be mistaken, Mom.

462
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,819
No, I am not mistaken.

463
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,090
She kept bragging about it nonstop.

464
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:48,219
She looked like she'd give out
wedding invitations soon.

465
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,229
Mr. Seo Min Gi...

466
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,630
is getting married?

467
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,870
Yes, I told you. What is with you?

468
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,200
Mom, tell me more.

469
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,140
What more do you want to hear?

470
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,410
Don't tell me
you had a one-sided crush on him...

471
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,910
without knowing
that he had a girlfriend.

472
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,009
No, it's not that.

473
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:09,479
Hey, forget him.

474
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,219
You should never fall for a man
who is nice to every woman.

475
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:17,519
Do not fall head over heels
for a man like that.

476
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,660
Why would I? I would never.

477
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,930
My goodness.

478
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,130
I guess she really liked him.

479
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,610
Hey.

480
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,009
I told you to call me
when you were done. Why...

481
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,150
Maeng Gong Hee.

482
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,850
What's wrong with me?

483
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,519
Tears keep rolling down my face.
How strange.

484
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:56,489
Are you all right?

485
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,190
(My Merry Marriage)

486
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,989
Hearing this
might make you uncomfortable.

487
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,100
Could you help me
so I can see Dan Soo often?

488
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,370
Don't you think Gong Hee and Dan Soo
are more than just friends?

489
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,769
Not Gu Dan Soo.

490
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:42,709
Gong Hee should date someone better.

491
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,209
I wanted to check something
with you.

492
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,110
Are you getting married?

493
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:50,080
Is that why you broke up with me?

494
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,519
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
