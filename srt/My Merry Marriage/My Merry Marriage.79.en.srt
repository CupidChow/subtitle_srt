1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,169
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,940
How much can you give me?

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,109
On the condition that I give up
being Dan Soo's mom...

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,980
and that I'd never show myself
before my son again.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,619
How much will you give me?

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
So, it was you?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,870
The woman
who ruthlessly abandoned me and left?

8
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,899
Are we going somewhere?

9
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,640
Yes, we're going to meet Mom.

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,269
Really? Where's Mom?
Let's hurry, then.

11
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,239
But I have to meet someone
before that.

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,409
Hang out
at Gong Hee's place for a bit, okay?

13
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,420
Then can I play with your guitar?

14
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,120
My guitar? Sure thing.

15
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,620
When I'm back, I'll teach you
how to play the guitar.

16
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,260
Nice.

17
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,859
<i>I can't find the nightingale</i>

18
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:27,930
Teach me how to play that song.

19
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,829
All right. When I'm back,

20
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,599
we'll practice the song together.
Sounds good?

21
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,599
Yes.

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,010
Hold it. Like this.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,739
Mr. Gu!

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Hello.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,409
Oh, Gong Hee. You're here.

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,849
Do you mind playing with Geon
for a bit?

27
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:53,489
Of course, I don't mind.
That's why I'm here.

28
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,019
Don't you worry.

29
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,819
Let's go, Geon.
You're ready to have fun, right?

30
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,490
I probably look really stupid
right now.

31
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,460
Maeng Gong Hee.

32
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,530
What would you say
if you were here now?

33
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,840
Why must you leave me alone?

34
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,180
Why aren't you by my side now,

35
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,419
Maeng Gong Hee?

36
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:06,590
Here.

37
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,590
Just try one.

38
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,259
I can eat a whole bowl of rice
with just one piece.

39
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,500
My gosh, it stinks.

40
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,229
I told you to throw it away.
Why must you be so stubborn?

41
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,509
It's good.

42
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,080
Don't throw it away.

43
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
What is this?

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,180
Min Gi, you can't eat
soy sauce marinated crab.

45
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,349
You're allergic to shellfish.

46
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,189
Oh, no. You can't eat it, Mr. Seo?

47
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,550
You didn't even know that
about your husband?

48
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,259
Why didn't you tell her?

49
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,689
He must've told me in the past.
I guess I forgot.

50
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,129
It's okay if I eat it occasionally.

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,960
It is not okay.

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,500
You react badly
as soon as your lips touch them.

53
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,199
Also, stop calling him "Mr. Seo."

54
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,039
It makes me feel suffocated.

55
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,710
Goodness.
I'll get indigestion thanks to you.

56
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,180
Dear me.

57
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,819
No Ah, you look like
you've grown a lot.

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,419
I told you to call me often.

59
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,090
Didn't you miss me?

60
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:13,889
Mom doesn't want me
using my cell phone,

61
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,659
so I couldn't call you.

62
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
"Mom?"

63
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,699
No Ah, who are you talking about?

64
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,430
I'm your mom.

65
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,040
What? I have another mom here.

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,040
I have two moms.

67
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,910
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,980
No Ah.

69
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,040
Mom is right here.

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,250
At daycare, my teacher told me
to write about my mom,

71
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,680
so I wrote two separate paragraphs.

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,819
About Lee Soo Yeon and Eom Hong Dan.

73
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,490
You're both my moms.

74
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,519
Why are you calling that woman
your mom?

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,459
No Ah, you only have one mom, okay?

76
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,230
No Ah, give me your phone. Come on.

77
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,069
Listen, Ms. Lee Soo Yeon.

78
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,240
Why do you keep calling No Ah?
You are confusing him.

79
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,480
What on earth
did you say to No Ah...

80
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,879
that he's calling you Mom?

81
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,379
He's calling me Mom
because I am his mom now.

82
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,009
Is he supposed to call me Dad, then?

83
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,420
Don't you even think about...

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,089
how this could confuse No Ah?

85
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,750
You stay out of this.

86
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,860
Put Maeng Gong Boo on the phone.

87
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,089
Let me talk to his father right now!

88
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,000
Who are you to order me
to put my husband on the phone?

89
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,329
Hey, Lee Soo Yeon.
What's with you, seriously?

90
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,279
Here,
listen to this story for a bit.

91
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,079
I'll come back in a bit
and read you the book. Here.

92
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,149
Let me warn you again.
You have no rights over No Ah.

93
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,420
Let the boy sleep
and live your life.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,459
I am No Ah's mom.

95
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,930
I can't let that woman
steal my No Ah from me!

96
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,430
Didn't she abandon him
as if he was a burden?

97
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,360
What is this nonsense
she's saying now?

98
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,930
I'm going to hang up now.
I wish you all the best.

99
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,240
"I wish you all the best?"

100
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,310
My goodness. Did you have to
act all cool even in that situation?

101
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,910
No, I wasn't trying to act cool.

102
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,910
I wanted to be sincere.

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,550
She abandoned her son and left,
so she should live well.

104
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,290
Why does she keep calling him
when he's doing fine?

105
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,759
Who keeps calling?

106
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,589
What's going on? Is it about No Ah?

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,430
The thing is,

108
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,329
No Ah's mom...

109
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,430
Soo Yeon keeps calling No Ah
at bedtime,

110
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,699
so I told her to stop calling.

111
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,399
No Ah's mom is...

112
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,839
- Hong Dan now.
- Right.

113
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,470
Does Soo Yeon want to take him back?

114
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,839
Well, she left him with you,

115
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,180
- but she might want to take him...
- No.

116
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,550
I won't send him back to her.

117
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,550
No Ah is my son.

118
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,149
Yes, of course.

119
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,019
She abandoned him, so that's it.

120
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,389
How dare she want him back?

121
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm worried because of Soo Yeon.

122
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,500
She has quite a temper too,
you know.

123
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,370
Oh, please.

124
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,910
It'll all be fine.

125
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,240
What if she stubbornly insists
on taking him back?

126
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,639
No Ah is still young.

127
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,709
He'll be so confused.

128
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,050
No Ah is young,
but he's thoughtful and wise,

129
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,779
so he'll be all right.

130
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,350
Are you going to be so nonchalant
about this again?

131
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,660
Well, it's not like...

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,189
Soo Yeon is going to come back
right away.

133
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,459
I'm just anxious. That's all.

134
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,500
I have a bad feeling about this.

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,430
You're always worrying
for no reason.

136
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,569
That's a bad habit of yours.

137
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,740
Worrying for no reason?

138
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,639
My worries have always come true.

139
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,410
I'm the only one
who worries about this family.

140
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,339
You're always distracted
by other people's worries.

141
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,149
What? What did I do?

142
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,480
Am I wrong?
You keep going out and disappearing.

143
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
And you're always having nightmares.

144
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,620
You should worry
about your family that much.

145
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,019
Why am I the only one
who's worried all the time?

146
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,899
I called you both here...

147
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,930
because the competition
to choose my successor...

148
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,399
might have to be expedited.

149
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,800
The Holly Project
is getting good feedback.

150
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,139
In order to convince the board,

151
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,339
it would be good
to keep this momentum going.

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,480
I thought you were going to
give us more time.

153
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,110
I can't wait for too long.

154
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,590
I'm about to achieve my goal.

155
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,289
Will you be able to catch up?

156
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,259
Isn't direction more important
than speed?

157
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,759
While you were wandering the world,
designing clothes on a whim,

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
I kept my place at Jayce Fashion.

159
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,299
I know this company well.

160
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,639
I will show you what I can do
in a faster and stronger way.

161
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,009
Please make your decision
once you see the outcome.

162
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,480
If that's what you say,

163
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,080
I should wait and see.

164
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,980
But I can't give you too much time.

165
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,019
Bring me good results.

166
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,450
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,360
If you're finished,
I'll be going now.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Grandma.

169
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,470
Why are you so anxious
and in a rush?

170
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,039
Is it because I asked you
about Ms. Audrey?

171
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,350
Did you perhaps hear something?

172
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,679
No.

173
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,250
You said you lent her money.

174
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,350
And that was why
Mr. Seo went to see her too.

175
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Isn't that right?

176
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,759
Oh, yes. I did.

177
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,129
Well, is there some reason
I shouldn't know?

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,259
Of course not.

179
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,570
Then what makes you so anxious
and rushed?

180
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,740
It's as if you've been caught
with a secret no one can know about.

181
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,649
This man, Holly, seriously...

182
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,519
The collaboration line
from the fashion show...

183
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,149
had great responses,

184
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,350
and he already sent over...

185
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,490
these designs.

186
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,730
This one.

187
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,929
Don't you think it'll be a huge hit?

188
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,200
I was so impressed too.
He must really be a genius.

189
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,870
All I gave him was the idea
of using recycled materials,

190
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,169
and he completed these so quickly.

191
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,669
I knew he had an extraordinary aura.

192
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,639
It doesn't even look like
a recycled material.

193
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,480
And it's totally different
from the designs from the show.

194
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,549
Oh, I like it.

195
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,080
It might be good
for getting the word out...

196
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,690
about Holly's good influence.

197
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,389
It would help
our company's image too.

198
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,259
Of course. Let's proceed with this.
Sounds good?

199
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,600
It really leaves you in awe.

200
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,029
- Look at these lines.
- I know, right?

201
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,440
About what you said
during the meeting...

202
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,179
The Holly project.

203
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,710
I wish you'd take your hands off
of that project.

204
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,679
Excuse me?

205
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,190
But I've been in charge
of this project since the beginning.

206
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,360
If Gu Dan Soo
pulls off this project,

207
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,590
the chairwoman will pass
the group down to him right away.

208
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,500
That position doesn't belong
to Dan Soo.

209
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,899
So, you should take your hands off
of that project.

210
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,399
What? I don't really get it.

211
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,970
Why are you telling me
to quit the project?

212
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,139
I told you.

213
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,840
If he pulls off this project,

214
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,309
he will inherit the group.

215
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,740
That position is...

216
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,480
the one I've been dreaming of.

217
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Gong Hee.

218
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,559
We're a married couple now,
so I'll be honest with you.

219
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,690
The chairwoman said she'd give me
and Dan Soo an equal chance.

220
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,799
A chance to compete...

221
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,200
to become
Jayce Fashion's next chairman.

222
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,340
So?

223
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,940
Dan Soo doesn't have what it takes
to lead Jayce Group.

224
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,710
A capable person should be
in that position.

225
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,950
A family succession is
an unreasonable...

226
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,210
and outdated concept.

227
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,220
So, you mean you've been working
all this time for that position?

228
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,049
I'm nearly there now.

229
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,620
I need some time.

230
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,029
I...

231
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,330
want to become a stronger father
for our child.

232
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,340
I can't let my child
live as a servant too.

233
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:47,269
Gong Hee.

234
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,539
Can't you take my side?

235
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,309
At least for our child's sake.

236
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
No.

237
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,750
I can't take your side.

238
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,620
Is it because of Gu Dan Soo?

239
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,320
It's neither for Dan Soo
nor for you.

240
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,159
And I don't agree that
this is for our child's sake.

241
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,299
Working at Jayce Fashion
was an old dream of mine.

242
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,070
I never even thought about
who's master and servant.

243
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,139
Thinking that way in life...

244
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,379
is too cruel on yourself.

245
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,279
I want our child
to watch its parents dream...

246
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,580
and have a positive outlook on life.

247
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,190
I'll consider I never heard
what you just said.

248
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:59,580
At the meeting,

249
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,409
they all loved your designs
using the recycled materials.

250
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,320
The director was going on about...

251
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,820
how it'd be a huge hit.

252
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,720
As our genius designer,

253
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,389
you just keep designing
as you've been doing.

254
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,929
I've brought you
some minor revisions.

255
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,259
Maeng Gong Hee.

256
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,200
You knew, didn't you?

257
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:29,139
You told me to go to Ms. Audrey.

258
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,710
Didn't you know everything
when you said that?

259
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,179
Did you meet with Ms. Audrey?

260
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,720
Did you hear?

261
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,789
So you knew.

262
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,019
Even when you knew,

263
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:49,230
you didn't tell me.

264
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,799
Why? Because you couldn't care less
about me?

265
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,570
I only found out recently too.

266
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,870
I wanted you
to hear it directly from her.

267
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,539
Did Ms. Audrey tell you everything?

268
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,580
No.

269
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:06,480
I just found out.

270
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,779
How?

271
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,580
I heard her talking to my grandma.

272
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,850
Dan Soo.

273
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,620
Don't let that woman know...

274
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,490
that I know about this.

275
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,590
That itself is unpleasant.

276
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,360
Why are you calling your mom
"that woman?"

277
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,000
Forget it. You should go now.

278
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,129
- Gu Dan Soo.
- Ms. Maeng Gong Hee.

279
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,070
You may go now.

280
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,139
Are you okay?

281
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,940
What if I say I'm not okay?

282
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,539
Can you handle that?

283
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,279
It's not like
you can comfort me now anyway.

284
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,250
- Don't be like that...
- Get out.

285
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:51,419
I want to be alone.

286
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,669
(Executive Director's Office)

287
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Hey.

288
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,580
I heard you took
a bunch of food to your in-laws.

289
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,950
I guess you'll visit us soon
with food from your in-laws too.

290
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,620
Gosh, how good will it taste?

291
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,250
Oh, right.
I have to bring food in return.

292
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,620
When I got married,
we skipped all that...

293
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,389
since I don't have my own family.

294
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,860
But it would be nice
if you did that for your parents.

295
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,230
I'm sure Mother is waiting.

296
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,799
What's this?

297
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,029
My gosh. I'm off.

298
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,639
Oh, dear.

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,169
I'm sure Mother isn't even thinking
about this.

300
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,639
What should I do?

301
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,179
(Food for in-laws)

302
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,049
(High Quality Fruits and Rice Cakes,
Best Fruit Baskets)

303
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,389
All right.

304
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,990
Let me see.

305
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,200
All right. Let me taste this.

306
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,470
Yes, that's it.

307
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,000
I can tell
it's Maeng Gyeong Bok's recipe.

308
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,009
Whenever she brought this from home
when we were kids,

309
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,109
the whole class would swarm around
to get a taste.

310
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,779
<i>Squeeze that out</i>

311
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,609
(Myung Ja's daughter)

312
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,349
Oh, dear.

313
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
What's up?

314
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,119
Mother.

315
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,130
Would you be okay with me
having dinner with my family today?

316
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,099
With your family? Why?

317
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,529
Oh, I have to visit them
to drop off something.

318
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,700
Sure, do whatever you want.
What about Min Gi?

319
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,170
I think he's working late today.

320
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,240
All right.

321
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,250
I have to keep up
with my low-sodium diet.

322
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,710
Why did they have to send me this?

323
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,819
And why is it so good? How annoying.

324
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,089
All right. Let's see now.

325
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,500
It's so good.

326
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,670
Oh, no. I shouldn't be doing this.

327
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,140
My goodness.
I need to watch my figure.

328
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,309
No, I shouldn't eat this. Stop.

329
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:23,839
No.

330
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,410
Whatever. I should just eat it.

331
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,680
Yes, I'll eat it. It's so good
that I can't stop myself.

332
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,380
Whatever.

333
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,289
There's no way Jung Ssang Sook
sent us food that she made herself.

334
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,390
Oh, my. Should I open this one too?

335
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,289
They're all from a famous place.

336
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,490
They'll be delicious.

337
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,700
My goodness. Is this food or art?

338
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,000
It does look luxurious.

339
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,430
Oh, my.

340
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,769
How are we going to eat these
when they're all so pretty?

341
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:55,809
My, I guess Ssang Sook has accepted
the fact that we're in-laws now.

342
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,880
She is doing her duty
as your mother-in-law.

343
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,450
You acted like the world would end
once you two became in-laws.

344
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,049
It's actually no big deal, right?

345
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,150
No big deal, my foot.

346
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,079
I still wake up
in the middle of the night.

347
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,490
Knowing her, there's no way
she'd be nice to you.

348
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,859
Tell me how she treats you.

349
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,359
If she's mean to you, I will just...

350
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,789
You'll just what?

351
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,500
You should be fawning over her
so she'd be nice to Gong Hee.

352
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,829
They say having a daughter
puts you at a disadvantage.

353
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:23,869
What's wrong with having a daughter?

354
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,339
Why should it put me
at a disadvantage?

355
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,769
If she hurts my daughter's feelings
even just a little bit,

356
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,039
I'll make her pay for it.

357
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,640
Don't worry.

358
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,109
Both Mother and Father
are nice to me.

359
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,980
Good. Just tell us
if they're ever mean to you, okay?

360
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,480
Mom, try this.

361
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,650
- Here. Auntie, try this.
- All right.

(General Manager Seo Min Gi)

363
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,420
Ms. Eom said earlier...

364
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,329
that Gong Hee would visit her family
after work.

365
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,599
Shouldn't you go with her?

366
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,869
What are you doing?

367
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
(Jayce Fashion and Hermes)

368
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,509
A collaboration with Hermes?

369
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:05,980
This is a huge project.

370
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,009
Are you leading this project
on your own?

371
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,420
Once Dan Soo and Gong Hee launch
a new collection under Holly's name,

372
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,349
Dan Soo's influence in the company
will only grow.

373
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,420
I need to generate
meaningful results...

374
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,190
where I can take full credit.

375
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:24,230
You're talking as though
you want to be...

376
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,599
the next chairman of the company.

377
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,740
I can help.

378
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What?

379
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:37,009
It's a collaboration
with a global luxury brand.

380
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,339
Designing for the top one percent.

381
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,680
Do you think you can find
someone better than me?

382
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,319
If you have a goal,
you ought to accomplish it.

383
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,920
And I can help you
accomplish your goal.

384
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,490
This is work, you know?

385
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:00,529
Let's see.

386
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,200
First off, I like your approach.

387
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,400
With your experience
in the marketing team,

388
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm sure you've already come up
with a solid PR strategy.

389
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,240
Leave the designs to me.

390
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,079
The best designer should design
for the A-list customers.

391
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,009
I should go.

392
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:18,650
Where are you going?

393
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,210
Mom.

394
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,309
Mom!

395
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,119
Mom.

396
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,660
Mom!

397
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,390
Mom.

398
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,430
Mom.

399
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,920
My gosh.

400
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,119
Dan Soo.

401
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm here to ask you something.

402
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,660
I've been racking my brain,

403
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,599
but I really can't figure out
the answer.

404
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,039
I see.

405
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,569
What is it?

406
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,009
A while ago,

407
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,809
you told me that you had a son.

408
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,849
But you don't live
with your son now.

409
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Did you abandon him?

410
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:11,529
Dan Soo.

411
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,529
I was abandoned too, you see.

412
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,730
By my own mother.

413
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,809
How would a parent feel...

414
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,779
after abandoning their own child?

415
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:27,809
I'm curious.

416
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,619
Tell me.

417
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,490
Did you abandon your son?

418
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,619
Well...

419
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,259
I mean, I...

420
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,339
I was just kidding.

421
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,839
I knew you'd never do such a thing,
Ms. Audrey.

422
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,579
You're always so nice to me.

423
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Right.

424
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,690
Well, Dan Soo.
Would you like a cup of coffee?

425
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,220
I made some coffee earlier.

426
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,359
One moment.

427
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Gosh, it's hot!

428
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:37,849
Does it hurt?

429
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,950
No...

430
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,990
I'm fine.

431
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,019
That's strange.

432
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,089
I'm...

433
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,529
still the little boy
who's scraped his knee...

434
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,630
by falling over
in the torrential rain.

435
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,940
My scraped knee...

436
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,579
still hurts to this day.

437
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:19,859
Dan Soo.

438
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,519
Please be quiet...

439
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,930
and stay still.

440
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:29,299
Just for a moment.

441
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,420
Gu Dan Soo,
did you have to go somewhere?

442
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,470
Did something happen?

443
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,769
Ms. Audrey...

444
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,869
I met her.

445
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,279
She...

446
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,779
ruined everything.

447
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,019
My dad...

448
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,619
and my life too.

449
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,960
Don't say that.

450
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,990
She's your mom, whom you missed
even in your dreams.

451
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,329
You told her not to go,
not to leave.

452
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,869
I know you've always missed her.

453
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:47,670
What do you think you're doing?

454
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:50,640
Why, you little...

455
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240

00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,029
- Ta-da!
- It's a gender reveal party...

458
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,099
for the baby, Mother.

459
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,069
Lee Soo Yeon
won't suddenly come back, right?

460
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,069
Maeng Gong Boo.

461
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,400
I'll take No Ah back.

462
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,470
Gu Dan Soo.

463
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:22,009
I can tell you're faking that smile.

464
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,839
I can see everything.

465
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,640
Do you know something, Mr. Maeng?

466
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,539
Please tell me the truth.

467
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,779
In the end,
you're asking me about my sin.
