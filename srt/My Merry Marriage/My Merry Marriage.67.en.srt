1
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,490
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,559
Do you hear that?

3
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,500
The baby's heart is beating well.

4
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,000
You can't come in here
when I'm with a patient.

5
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,239
Mom!

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
You!

7
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,050
Why are you...

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,350
What are you...

9
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,020
doing here?

10
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,109
Here. Good boy.

11
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,479
You know, I make
delicious soy sauce marinated crab.

12
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,049
Do you want to try it?

13
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,060
Soy sauce marinated crab?
What's that?

14
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,989
You know what a crab is, don't you?

15
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,799
It walks sideways like this,
you know?

16
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:35,359
Yes, I know.

17
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,230
You catch them...

18
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,269
and soak them in soy sauce.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,739
Then you take them and...

20
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,969
What? My goodness.

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,810
Oh, no. Did that sound too cruel?

22
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:50,379
No Ah.

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,810
Like this.

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,150
Like this.

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,319
- Like this!
- Mom! Let go. Let's talk, okay?

26
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,390
- Come here.
- Mom, let me explain!

27
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,519
- Honey!
- Come in here.

28
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,719
- Mom!
- Oh, boy.

29
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,560
Oh, no. Something must've happened.

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,859
- Mom...
- Honey, my goodness.

31
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,730
Tell me.

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
Your baby...

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,969
Is Ssang Sook's son...

34
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,670
the father of the baby?

35
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,439
Goodness.

36
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,810
My gosh!

37
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,379
No!

38
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,849
Hey! What are you planning to do?

39
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,219
What will you do? Answer me!

40
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,560
Apparently,
that guy is getting married.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,889
He's marrying the daughter
of a rich family or whatever.

42
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,729
His mom has been bragging about it
all around town.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,629
And what about you?
What will you do?

44
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,569
Why are you going to the clinic
by yourself?

45
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,939
Mom, I'm fine.

46
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,509
This is my baby.
It has nothing to do with them.

47
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,379
Come to your senses, you fool!

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,939
If you get pregnant...

49
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,050
before you get married,

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,050
people nastily wag their fingers
at you...

51
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,849
behind your back.

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,849
So, what about a woman
who raises a child without a dad?

53
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,259
They look at those moms with pity
for their whole lives.

54
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,960
It doesn't matter
if they're successful or rich.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,490
They just look at those moms
with pity.

56
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,169
I can't watch you live your life,
being treated like that.

57
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:19,729
Does that guy...

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,370
even know about this?

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,539
This has nothing to do with Mr. Seo.

60
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,340
As Mom said,
he's going to marry someone else.

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,180
I'll just live on my own!

62
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,449
You will live as a single mom?
Is that it?

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,319
As people watch you pitifully
for the rest of your life?

64
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,530
I can do this. I'll pull this off.

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,300
So, please watch and support me.
Mom, Dad!

66
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,229
Watch and support what?

67
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:54,000
How could we just stand by
and watch?

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,569
You decided to have the baby?

69
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,909
Do you even know
what it means to have a child?

70
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,620
Isn't this Mother's voice?

71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,150
Hey, did you come to get No Ah?

72
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,219
Yes. But is something going on?

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,659
There's a big commotion
because of Gong Hee.

74
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,259
- Oh, my. Hey.
- Mom!

75
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,759
What's wrong with you?

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,969
Come with me to the clinic, okay?

77
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,599
I don't care about your decision
or respecting your wishes.

78
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,539
- Oh, my. What are you going to do?
- Goodness.

79
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,439
Talk after you let go of her hand!

80
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,770
Mom, please don't do this.

81
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,579
Be quiet! Don't say a word.
Just come with me!

82
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:39,209
I will never let you
become a single mom.

83
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,250
- Come on!
- Mom.

84
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,449
- Wait, what is...
- Oh, dear.

85
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,620
all this about?

86
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,319
Oh, my goodness.

87
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,560
What's wrong? It's okay.

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,629
It's okay. Yes. Oh, dear.

89
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:55,029
What do we do?

90
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,529
Well...

91
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll talk to Gong Hee for a minute.

92
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,300
Honey, please help Mother calm down.

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,009
- Okay.
- It's okay.

94
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,240
Don't cry.

95
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,680
My goodness!

96
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:12,949
- Oh, dear.
- Let's go.

97
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,079
- Gong Hee, let's go.
- Come on, No Ah.

98
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,180
Dad.

99
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,589
What is going on?

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,000
Tell me.

101
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,430
I know you've made a tough decision.

102
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,339
How could I not know?

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,370
Before I got married,

104
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,310
I had made up my mind to have
Ssook Ssook and raise my baby alone.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,850
But it's different for you.

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,480
You're finally becoming
a permanent employee.

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,620
It's not like you can quit now.

108
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,850
And you'll keep seeing him
all the time at work.

109
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,620
Are you sure you won't regret it?

110
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,100
Goodness, what should we do?

111
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,990
Ma'am, Dan Soo is home.

112
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,720
Then you should've called me
right away.

113
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,689
He told me not to let anyone
into his room.

114
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,160
- Yes.
- Revealing my face was my decision.

115
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,370
Don't worry.

116
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,100
I'll keep working as Holly.

117
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,370
Dan Soo.

118
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,170
I'll call you back later.

119
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:46,509
You brat.

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,439
Why did you do that?

121
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,540
Why didn't you tell me?

122
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,750
Grandma, have you been doing well?

123
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,620
You left for a trip
and didn't even call me.

124
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,329
Then, you suddenly show up
to surprise your grandma like this?

125
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,600
And you turn out to be
that famous designer, Holly?

126
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,399
I was so surprised.

127
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,839
I can't be
an immature spoiled boy forever.

128
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,610
For you...

129
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
and for my own sake too.

130
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,250
- Here.
- Thank you.

131
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,160
My poor mom.

132
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,629
I'm worried about Mother too,

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,560
but I'm even more worried
about Gong Hee.

134
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,170
She is really determined to have
and raise the baby on her own.

135
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,399
It won't be easy, though.

136
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,300
Is it because
you remember how it was for you?

137
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:53,269
Well, I tried to pretend not to,

138
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,680
but I kept lingering near you...

139
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,379
and ended up marrying you,
but it's not like that for Gong Hee.

140
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,120
She's acting brave,

141
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,649
but think about how she must feel
on the inside right now.

142
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm sure she's an absolute mess.

143
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,490
Did you say he was Seo Min Gi?

144
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,660
Why, I ought to...

145
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,930
- Give me his phone number.
- My gosh.

146
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:14,259
Don't get involved.
You might just make things worse.

147
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,300
But he's a piece of trash.

148
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,769
But Mr. Seo doesn't know.

149
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,329
He doesn't know.

150
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,699
Just leave it up to Gong Hee.

151
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,740
The ones who are directly involved
should deal with these things.

152
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,839
Gosh, seriously.

153
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,750
How could you fool me like that?

154
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:40,389
When did you start designing?

155
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:44,259
Well, you were always a good artist,
even as a little kid.

156
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,459
You don't like it...

157
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,129
when I talk about my childhood.

158
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,970
What?

159
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,700
I started doing this
because of my mom.

160
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,870
I don't remember Mom very much,

161
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,039
but I remember clearly
that she made clothes for me.

162
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:04,179
Even after Mom left,

163
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,450
I didn't take off those clothes
and kept wearing them.

164
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,450
Until they became old and worn.

165
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,250
I didn't take them off
even when kids called me a beggar.

166
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,659
You hate it when I bring up my mom.

167
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,529
I thought you wouldn't like it
if I designed clothes.

168
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you want to...

169
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,000
find your mom?

170
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,769
No.

171
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,409
I'm sure she had her reasons
for abandoning me.

172
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,840
What use would it be
to ask her why she did it...

173
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,409
after all these years?

174
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,909
I have no regrets.

175
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,070
When I think about it,

176
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,110
I've always been on the run
throughout my life.

177
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,340
From my mom
who ran a bar by the docks...

178
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,049
and from my dad,
the conman and criminal.

179
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,279
The whole time.

180
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,320
Even after I met you,

181
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,990
a part of me always felt anxious.

182
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,159
I never knew
when the misfortune that followed me...

183
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,529
would hurt the people I loved.

184
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,200
But you know, Hae Joon,

185
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,070
I will...

186
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:40,409
become stronger.

187
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,049
I won't simply back off anymore.

188
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,950
I won't run away.

(Maeng OB-GYN Clinic)

190
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,500
An abortion isn't
as easy as you think.

191
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,929
There are some serious
physical aftereffects,

192
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,240
and although
it isn't illegal anymore,

193
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,110
it's only allowed
under unavoidable circumstances.

194
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:15,240
And Gong Hee's decision is
what matters the most.

195
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,350
Aside from the law and ethics,

196
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,019
an abortion is
in the realm of bodily autonomy.

what one's body will go through...

198
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,750
in the present and future.

199
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,259
I know what you're worried about,

200
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,129
but you can't simply take away
her right to choose.

201
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,399
You know too.

202
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,169
You must see them too.

203
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,399
The moms who raise their kids...

204
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,269
without a husband...

205
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,370
or a family.

206
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,980
It's not enough...

207
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,409
just to see them
with pity and sympathy.

208
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,649
People might sympathize
with their struggles to their faces.

209
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,820
But behind their backs,
people will ostracize them...

210
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,120
and keep them at a distance.

211
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,620
"That person is a single mom."

212
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,789
"That kind of person,
that kind of woman."

213
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,759
"She's that kind of mom."

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I...

215
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,669
really don't think
I can see Gong Hee live like that.

216
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,879
Even if you call me old-fashioned,

217
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,409
predictable, and foolish,

218
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,220
I don't care.

219
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,750
I'd just hate...

220
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,720
to see people
point fingers at my daughter.

221
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,090
I'd rather die than see that.

222
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,360
I want to go...

223
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,330
and ask that guy right now
what he plans to do,

224
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,830
but I'm forcing myself to hold back.

225
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,269
I understand how you feel, Mom.
And...

226
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,340
I'm really upset too.

227
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,210
But please...

228
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,509
be patient
and give Gong Hee some time, okay?

229
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,850
Gosh, Mom.

230
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,889
Mom, are you all right?

231
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,649
Should I take you home?

232
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
No.

233
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,889
I have to go somewhere.

234
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,360

Your achievement
did so much for the company.

241
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,279
The fashion show
elevated Jayce Fashion's status.

242
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,250
You must've worked very hard
to prepare for it.

243
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,519

the collaboration with Holly nicely.

Since all eyes
are on the project now,

247
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
it's make or break for us.

248
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,399
Yes, I'll remember that.

Yes, just tell me
what you need done.

Bring me the pieces
from the collection...

259
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,559
to be sent to the stores.

260
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,690
Don't leave out a single piece.

261
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,929
Yes, got it.

What would Gu Dan Soo say
if he saw this?

267

"Is it a gold medal or something?"
He'll say that.

270
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,620
Yes, I'm so happy.

271
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
This is even better
than a gold medal.

I want to be congratulated by...

275
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,139
isn't Mr. Seo.

Have you heard from Dan Soo
by any chance?

279

No, I have not.

280
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,590
Really? Then has he emailed you
from Holly's email address?

281
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,320
I haven't heard from him at all
since the fashion show.

282
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,600
Okay. If you hear from him,
let me know right away.

Tell you what?

286
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,029
I already told you everything.

287
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,070
Did you...

288
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,470
meet my daughter
before you came to see me?

289
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:13,909
Let's sit down.

290
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,539

Yes, I did.

292
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,480

Hey, try putting yourself
in my shoes.

294
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,549
Wouldn't you be angry?

My son is getting married soon.

296
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,990
To a rich family's daughter.
The date has already been set.

297

Look, they already got
their wedding invitations printed.

298
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,299
Look at this.

00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,539
Hey!

300
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,940
Good for you
for having such an amazing son.

301

Hey, do you think your son
is the only one with a future?

302
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,710
Who is he
to ruin my daughter's future?

303
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,450
I will not let your son
get away with this.

304
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,419
He's marrying into a rich family?

305
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,460
I will contact your future in-laws
and tell them everything!

Myung Ja,
you're too worked up right now.

307
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:11,000
Think rationally,
for your daughter's own sake.

308
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,629
What? "Think rationally?"

309
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,570
Did you go to my daughter first...

310
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,000
because
you were thinking rationally?

311
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,110
What did you say to her?

312
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,610
What did you say to Gong Hee?

313
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,940
I told her to go to the hospital!
Why?

314
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,349
I told her
not to ruin my son's future.

315
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,410
Hey!

316
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,849
How dare you
break my daughter's heart like that?

317
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,920
Who are you
to treat my daughter like that?

318
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,289
Why did you do that to my daughter?

319
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,789
My gosh.
Why did you do that to my daughter?

320
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,170
My Gong Hee has big dreams.

321
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,099
I couldn't raise her
like a princess,

322
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:51,539
but she grew into a wonderful person
with a warm heart.

323
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:55,609
My daughter is brave and honest.

324
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,180
My husband and I
have done nothing for her,

325
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,819
but she always thanks us
without resenting us once.

326
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:05,150
She is my sweet daughter.

327
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,750
But...

328
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,859
you broke her heart like that?

329
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,529
How dare you
tear her heart to shreds?

330
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:13,730
Who do you think you are?

331
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,359
You're wasting your time,
yelling at me here.

332
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,730
Go and persuade your daughter.

333
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,500
You should've kept a watchful eye
on your son!

334
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,170
Hey.

335
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,839
You failed to keep an eye
on your daughter.

336
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,779
Your daughter kept hitting
on my son.

337
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,440
- My Min Gi...
- Hey!

338
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,210
Are we trying to figure out
who is more at fault right now?

339
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,450
Hey!

340
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,589
I'm so upset too.
This situation is driving me crazy!

341
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,819
I was so worried about Min Gi...

342
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,359
that I had to do something.

343
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,329
So please, Myung Ja.

344
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,670
Do something about your daughter!

345
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:54,230
Do something, please!

346
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
My gosh.

347
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,710
Oh, dear.

348
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,309
My goodness.

349
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
I will...

350
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,519
never forgive you.

351
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,349
Don't you forget that.

352
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,990
Your son is breaking
my daughter's heart...

353
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,420
by marrying into that rich family.

354
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,430
I will wait and see
how well that goes.

355
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,059
I will put a curse on him!

356
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,750
What should I do
when something like this happens?

357
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,920
When you're a mom,
there's no manual to go by.

358
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,630
What should I do
in a situation like this?

359
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,799
Can someone tell me? Please?

360
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,039
Oh, boy.

361
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,009
You keep sighing nonstop,
just like your wife.

362
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,279
Let me step out and get some air.

363
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,450
Yes, go fishing or something.

364
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,289
Cheer up and snap out of it, okay?

365
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:23,920
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

366
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,430
Gyeong Bok.

367
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,200
How come
Mr. Maeng looks so upset today?

368
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,529
Did something bad happen?

369
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,269
Don't ask. It's a family matter.

370
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,670
Nothing good will come out of
telling someone outside the family.

371
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,910
Anyway, what's up?

372
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,509
Do you want some galbi dumplings?

373
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,839
Oh, no.

374
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:45,680
I have a customer,

375
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,880
so I want to get some snacks
for him.

376
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
A customer?

377
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:51,549
(Maeng Dumplings)

378
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,359
What? You said he was a customer.

379
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,559
It's Detective An.

380
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,599
Hey, sleepwalker.
Why is Detective An your customer?

381
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,269
Oh, I know.

382
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,809
You must be in a pickle
because of me.

383
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,079
What?

384
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,410
Come on. Don't give me that.

385
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,579
I can tell at a glance.

386
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,420
He keeps hovering around...

387
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,849
to see me. Am I wrong?

388
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,660
He goes to your shop...

389
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,029
and comes here. Back and forth.

390
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,130
Oh, yes.

391
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,329
Goodness. I knew this would happen.

392
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,269
The other day, I could tell...

393
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,940
from the way he kept staring at me
with those intense eyes.

394
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,279
I shall go in
and cook something for him, then.

395
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm sorry,

396
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,460
but I don't want the ladies
to get the wrong idea,

397
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,390
so do you mind
keeping your distance?

398
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,960
If you follow me all the way here,
it might...

399
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,730
I'm afraid I can't do that.

400
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,200
We never know
when those people might come back.

401
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:19,509
Here.

402
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:21,509
All right.

403
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Here is your snack.

404
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,630
You have some flour on your face.

405
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Mom.

406
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,940
You were in my dream.

407
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,039
Everything is all right, isn't it?

408
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,750
Yes, there's nothing special.

409
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:35,319
What is it? Tell me.

410
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:40,650
Gong Hee is...

411
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,359
pregnant.

412
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,089
Ssang Sook's son.

413
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,960
It's his baby.

414
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,460
Mom, what do I do?

415
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,900
Well...

416
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,000
What can you do?

417
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,369
You can have them get married.

418
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,009
Getting pregnant before marriage
is no big deal these days.

419
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,079
They even call a baby
a wedding gift.

420
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,250
Ssang Sook's son... That jerk...

421
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,849
is getting married to another woman.
That's why I'm going crazy.

422
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,019
Goodness.

423
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,359
And what is Gong Hee saying?

424
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,759
She says she'll have the baby.

425
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,970
She'll have the baby
and raise it on her own.

426
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,539
Does this make any sense?

427
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,309
What do I do, Mom?

428
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,509
Well, what can you do?

429
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:41,880
Just tell her to do that.
What other choice do you have?

430
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,450
Mom.

431
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,789
How can I watch Gong Hee
become a single mom?

432
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,329
It's her life,
and she must live it her own way.

433
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,730
You can't tell her...

434
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,400
to live it the way you want her to.

435
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,430
But how can I just watch my baby...

436
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,200
live such a hard life, Mom?

437
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,440
You have to learn life
from experience.

438
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,609
What can you do?

439
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,410
Did you want her
to only walk down a rosy path?

440
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,079
That's being too greedy.

441
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,049
She'll be walking down a rocky road.

442
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,650
My gosh. How can I watch that?

443
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,960
Gong Hee is a strong girl.

444
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,529
Just watch her as she keeps going.

445
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,700
A parent's fence
should be at a far distance.

446
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,900
If the fence is too close,
it will suffocate your children.

447
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,009
Goodness, don't cry. Stop crying.

448
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,880
If a mother cries,

449
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,849
her children's hearts
will only ache more.

450
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,690
Wipe your tears
and get back up soon.

451
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,490
Oh, dear.

452
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:03,930
My goodness. What do I do?

453
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,299
Gosh, her heart must be
aching so much.

454
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,170
Oh, dear.
What will I do about my Myung Ja?

455
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:15,279
My goodness.

456
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,210
Darn it.

457
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,950
What do I do?

458
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,819
Oh, dear.

459
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,019
My gosh.

460
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,579
Gong Hee, take a look at this.

461
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:52,809
What?

462
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,880
Gosh, Mr. Gu Dan Soo.
What on earth is this?

463
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,349
What?

464
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:01,349
(Change of Personnel)

465
00:27:01,349 --> 00:27:02,759
(Gu Dan Soo,
appointed as executive director)

466
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,359
"Executive Director, Gu Dan Soo?"

467
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,630
Oh, my.

468
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
My goodness.

469
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,470
Oh, my. What brings you
to our office, ma'am?

470
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,299
There's someone else
you should be greeting today.

471
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,170
This is my grandson,

472
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:21,880
Gu Dan Soo.

473
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,519
I've been appointed as
Executive Director at Jayce Fashion.

474
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:34,650
I'm Gu Dan Soo.

475
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,599
(My Merry Marriage)

476
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,640
Gu Dan Soo is Holly...

477
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,970
and the chairwoman's grandson?

478
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,869
Gong Hee, you two have been friends
since childhood.

479
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,509
Did you really not know anything?

480
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,740
You! Don't you dare
fake being sick again.

481
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,109
I'll scold you.

482
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:34,250
Evil Witch.

483
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,650
- Hey.
- Evil Witch.

484
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,950
I'm trying too.

485
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,190
Gong Hee's mom said so.

486
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,589
What if Min Gi finds out?

487
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,420
Min Gi can never know.

488
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,089
What brings you here, Mr. Seo?

489
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:47,430
I need to ask you something.

490
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,099
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
