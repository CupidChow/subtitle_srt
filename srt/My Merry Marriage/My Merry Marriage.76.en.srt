1
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,470
(Guidelines were strictly followed
when filming with children.)

2
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,809
It's not happening.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,649
Tell me it's not true, Seo Min Gi.

4
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,920
Does it make sense to you?

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,090
With Maeng Gong Hee, of all people.

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,820
I know you wanted her
out of your life.

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,020
And you're marrying her?

8
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,129
It's not even funny.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,399
I can't even laugh!

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,300
It's all over now.

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,540
Doing this won't change anything.

12
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,910
But I did everything
you told me to do.

13
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,010
You said we should get married.

14
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,550
You said that was the kind of love
you wanted.

15
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,220
So why won't you take responsibility
for what you said?

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,989
Those sweet words
you whispered in my ear.

17
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,160
You promised to marry me.

18
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,099
Why won't you take responsibility
for your own words?

19
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,370
Come back to me now,
before it's too late.

20
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,639
You're an ambitious man.

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,710
Do you think Maeng Gong Hee
can help you fulfill your ambitions?

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,880
Not a chance.

23
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,549
Marry me...

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,919
and go to Dodo Group.

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,519
I'm sure my dad will acknowledge
how capable you are.

26
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,389
Kang Ji Na.

27
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,200
That's not the kind of life
you want to live.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,230
You...

29
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,600
didn't want to hear people saying...

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,939
you had it easy
thanks to your wealthy parents.

31
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,139
That's what got you this far.

32
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,340
Right, so I'm telling you that
I'll give up on my pride for you.

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,809
If I can be with you,

34
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:10,549
I'm okay with anything. Please?

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,549
I'm not okay with it, Ji Na.

36
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,990
I want to achieve things
on my own too.

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,760
Then what about Maeng Gong Hee?

38
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,460
Does she have the means
to help you achieve that goal?

39
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,429
It has nothing to do with her.

40
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,070
I'm very close to achieving my goal.

41
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,639
I'll get there on my own.

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,089
You look absolutely stunning.

43
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,459
The groom-to-be should've been here
to see this.

44
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,000
We should take
some pictures or videos.

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Stand over here.

46
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,570
No, it's okay.

47
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,700
But still...

48
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:08,669
Are you sure you don't want him
to see the dress?

49
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:12,040
He'll see it on the day
of our wedding anyway.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,919
My baby sibling is in here?

51
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:26,119
That's right, No Ah.
Your baby sibling is in there.

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,230
Say hi to Ssook Ssook.

53
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,500
Hi, Ssook Ssook.

54
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,399
When Ssook Ssook is born,

55
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,399
do I have to go back to my mom?

56
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,549
Are you planning
to send No Ah back to his mom?

57
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,179
What? That's nonsense.

58
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,750
No way.

59
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,359
She irresponsibly left her son here
and moved away.

60
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,359
Why would I send him back?

61
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,389
I know. I agree.

62
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:04,000
That being said,

63
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:05,859
when Ssook Ssook is born,

64
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:09,399
we should probably move
to a bigger place.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,940
We can't keep sleeping
in the living room.

66
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,169
We need one more room.

67
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,010
Well, we can't afford to move.

68
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,609
Why? You said
the clinic was doing well.

69
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,810
You have several
outpatient appointments each day.

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,380
Come on. I know
you're working very hard these days.

71
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,419
I thought you were doing better
financially.

72
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,919
Well, I want to
pay Gong Hee back first.

73
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,760
I can't afford to help her
with her wedding expenses,

74
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,560
so I should at least pay her back.

75
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:37,300
What?

76
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,500
You even borrowed money
from Gong Hee?

77
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:42,670
I had no choice.

78
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:46,469
So, you already owed her money,

79
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,039
but she gave you money again...

80
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,170
when we got married?

81
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,539
Yes, that's how she is.
That's my Maeng Ggong.

82
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,550
Goodness me. Are you serious?

83
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,550
My gosh.

84
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,550
Unbelievable.

85
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,050
How embarrassing.

86
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:07,459
This is what we'll do.

87
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,060
What? What will we do?

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,200
We'll get the security deposit
on this place...

89
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,399
and give it to Gong Hee.

90
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,630
My goodness.

91
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,500
Then where will we live?

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,469
We'll move into Mother's place.

93
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,039
What? We can't do that.

94
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,979
Who lives with their parents
these days?

95
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,839
We'll only live there
until we buy our own place.

96
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,810
You need to think realistically.

97
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,079
Do you know how much money
we'll need once our baby is born?

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,450
If we live with Mom,
we won't have to worry about food.

99
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,719
Exactly. They need to eat anyway,

100
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,820
so they'll just have to put
a few extra spoons on the table.

101
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,389
On top of that,
Mom will look after our baby too.

102
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,099
Our baby is her grandchild.
She can't refuse.

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,200
Once Gong Hee gets married
and moves out,

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,670
Mom will feel lonely too.

105
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,969
Yes. If we move in,

106
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,000
she definitely won't be lonely.

107
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,440
So, this is good for us
and for everyone else.

108
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,539
The daughter-in-law will be happy,

109
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,709
and the mother-in-law
will do the happy dance.

110
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,779
Nice.

111
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,510

"Wherever you are,
please send us your blessings."

113
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,950
They didn't even write
to come to their wedding.

114
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,050
(Seo Min Gi and Maeng Gong Hee)

115
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,130
"Congratulate us wherever you are."

116
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,529
It's so you, Maeng Gong Hee.

117
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,070
Did you ask for me, Mr. Gu?

118
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:27,940
I did my homework.

119
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,339
My gosh. You finished this
in just one day?

120
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,450
Easy-peasy.

121
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,579
You really are Holly.

122
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:39,180
The genius fashion designer, Holly.

123
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,920
What? Did you think I was lying?

124
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,320
Oh, my. I'll use these designs...

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,860
and finish the proposal
by the end of the day.

126
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,690
Slow down.

127
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,529
You always try to rush through life.

128
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,670
Have a cup of tea with some cookies.

129
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,670
Take your time, okay?

130
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,070
Well, my vacation begins tomorrow.

131
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,310
Oh, right. It's tomorrow.

132
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,839
Well, I'm not coming.

133
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,779
I never expected you to come.

134
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,019
What's with that reaction?
Are you sad?

135
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,889
No.

136
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,459
How could I expect you to be there?

137
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,089
That look on your face tells me
you're not telling me the truth.

138
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,099
You asked for my blessing
from wherever I was.

139
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,200
It doesn't seem like
Seo Min Gi came up with that phrase.

140
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,539
Isn't that how you feel?

141
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,240
If you were thinking of
getting a money gift from me,

142
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,539
it means you have no conscience.

143
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,550
It's not like you're going to
give me a huge amount anyway.

144
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,820
Hey, who am I?
I'm Holly, the designer.

145
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,279
My money gift would be
on a whole other level.

146
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,289
I thought you weren't coming.

147
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:49,289
I won't go.

148
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,389
You've lost
a very important connection.

149
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,589
You'll regret letting me go
for a long time.

150
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,389
Save the money gift
and use it for something good.

151
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,500
I'll be going now,
Executive Director Gu.

152
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,240
How could I watch that?

153
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,709
The sight of you...

154
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,639
standing there,
holding another man's hand.

155
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,380
Goodness, I haven't even bought
Gong Hee an outfit...

156
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,190
since she became an adult.

157
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,260
Why would a parent buy clothes
for her adult child?

158
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,659
It's normal to feel bad
about every little thing...

159
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:29,190
when your daughter is
about to get married.

160
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,000
Goodness, give it a rest.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,260
How many times
are you going to check them?

162
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,329
I just don't feel at ease.

163
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:36,899
Is there anything I left out?

164
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,500
Grandma!

165
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,300
- Oh, my.
- I heard Grandma was here,

166
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,339
- so we came running over.
- Yes, come on in.

167
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:43,570
- Goodness.
- Great-grandma.

168
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,279
- My dear.
- Hello, Grandma.

169
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,810
Yes, I'm glad you're here.
Oh, how cute you are.

170
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,209
Oh, you must be packing
Gong Hee's things.

171
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,780
She's been packing
and repacking on repeat.

172
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,050
She keeps putting things in
and pulling them back out.

173
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,050
I see.

174
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,060
When Gong Hee moves out,

175
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,989
will you be okay, Mom?
Won't you be lonely?

176
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,759
My heart aches
whenever I think about that.

177
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,099
Yes, I know.

178
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:09,599
I can't stand the thought of you
being lonely, Mother.

179
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,140
Why would I be lonely?
It will be a relief.

180
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,739
Come on, Mom.
I know you don't mean that.

181
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,339
It's not good
to live a lonely life, Mom.

182
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,950
That could lead to depression,
you know.

183
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,050
That's right, Mother.

184
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,180
The house
should be full of family...

185
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,450
to overcome depression...

186
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,690
- during menopause.
- What?

187
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,759
Come on.
Her menopause ended long ago.

188
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,190
Sure, I'm an elderly woman
who looks back on her menopause.

189
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,329
My goodness.

190
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:37,160
- Hey.
- Oh, Ms. Im.

191
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,759
- Have you been well?
- Hello.

192
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,359
- Yes, come on in.
- Hello.

193
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,530
You're coming home together.

194
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,200
Yes, Gyeong Sol heard
Mother was here...

195
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:46,200
- and wanted to say hello.
- Oh, my.

196
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,239
Gong Boo, tell Gong Hee
to come down for dinner.

197
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,339
Oh, okay. Stay here.

198
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,410
Come and have a seat.

199
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,550
I guess I'm really...

200
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:03,790
moving out.

201
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,570
I should really...

202
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,209
throw this out now, right?

203
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:27,579
Maeng Gong Hee.

204
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,020
- What?
- Hey.

205
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,719
I guess
you're really getting married.

206
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,150
Did you pack up all your stuff?

207
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,119
When did you get here?

208
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,359
I came to have Mom's food.

209
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,759
I came right in time for dinner.

210
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,729
Hey, check your bank account.

211
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,200
What? What's this?

212
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,469
The money I borrowed from you.

213
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:52,400
I added a generous amount
for interest.

214
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,109
What? Why?
It's not like you have money.

215
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:56,739
You have a lot of expenses.

216
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,940
Hong Dan helped me out.

217
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,410
What? Gosh, you can't do that.

218
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,879
I can't accept this.

219
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,050
Forget it. Hey, I'm working hard
to make money, okay?

220
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,589
Don't you know
what my life motto is?

221
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,749
I always pay things back,
whether it's money,

222
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,259
kindness, or revenge.

223
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,890
My goodness.

224
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,959
Anyway, just know that
your life hit the jackpot...

225
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,229
when you met Ms. Eom.

226
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,900
Agreed.

227
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,629
The more I spend time with her,
the more I realize how great she is.

228
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,329
Although,
I sometimes get confused...

229
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:24,300
whether she's my commanding officer
or my wife.

230
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,099
Listen to what Hong Dan says.

231
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:28,670
That's how you'll live a good life.

232
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,839
Hey, just make sure
you live a good life.

233
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,680
Call me if things are tough
after you get married.

234
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,450
If that Seo Min Gi
or whatever his name is upsets you,

235
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,020
tell me right away.
I'll teach him a lesson.

236
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,890
Don't worry. I'll live a good life.

237
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,959
Be sure you do.

238
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:47,629
You shouldn't worry Mom as well.

239
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Thank you.

240
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,869
I just changed out the sheets
and curtains in a hurry.

241
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:02,869
Is that okay?

242
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,310
Of course. Thank you for everything.

243
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:06,709
Min Gi.

244
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,050
I can't help but think
you're too good for her.

245
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,950
After everything I did
to raise you...

246
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,749
Having you get married...

247
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,420
in such a rush
to a girl like that...

248
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
I simply can't...

249
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,459
Gong Hee is a good person.

250
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,129
Please be kind to her, Mom.

251
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,469
Oh, whatever.

252
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,540
You're too good for her.
Way too good.

253
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,979
Come to my house.

254
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,180
If you don't come now,

255
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:49,290
I'm going to die.

256
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,359
Kang Ji Na. Don't do this.

257
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,959
Do you think I can't do it?

258
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,089
Get here right now.

259
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,030
Before I write your name
in my suicide note and off myself.

260
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,430
You will have to attend...

261
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,270
my funeral before you go
to your own wedding.

262
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:08,540
What a sight that would be.

263
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Don't wait for me.

264
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,190
- It's so delicious.
- Do you guys starve at home?

265
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,790
With Grandma's side dishes
that we take home,

266
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,900
we manage to get by somehow.

267
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,599
Oh, my...

268
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,700
He just says the weirdest things.

269
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,499
Where did you learn to say that?
Here, try this.

270
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,810
Wait, don't you do anything
around the house at home?

271
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,979
They're both working parents.

272
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:50,009
I'm sure they're busy
taking care of their kid after work.

273
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,920
Well, sure.
There wouldn't be time to cook food.

274
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,349
I can picture it clearly.

275
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:55,650
Go ahead and say it.

276
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:58,190
Should we come and live here?

277
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,190
- What?
- Oh, my.

278
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,489
What are you saying?

279
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,129
Well, you know.

280
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:03,430
Once Gong Hee moves out,

281
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,800
there won't be anyone left at home.

282
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,930
Your son should come
and keep the house safe...

283
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,300
for you to feel at ease, Mom.

284
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,300
What a load of nonsense.

285
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,599
You just mean you want me
to babysit and cook for you.

286
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,839
Come on, Mom.
You hit the nail on its head...

287
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,410
Mother,
it's just until the kids get older.

288
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,310
They say kids' relationships
with their grandparents...

289
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,950
have a huge effect
on their emotional development.

290
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,219
Right, honey?

291
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
- That's right.
- Hey, that hurts.

292
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,020
They've done research
on this stuff, Mom.

293
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,890
- Right.
- Well...

294
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,619
Sure, the room will be empty.

295
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:35,190
It would be nice to live together.

296
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,290
Gyeong Tae.

297
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Read the room.

298
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,400
Are you sure that's a good idea?

299
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,839
By the way,
I don't see Dan Soo around.

300
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,310
Oh, I called him,
but he said he'd be home late today.

301
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,310
Oh, right.

302
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,009
Gong Hee, why aren't you eating?

303
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,780
Oh, right.

304
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,849
"I'll be so busy and tired
all day tomorrow."

305
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,119
That's what I was thinking.

306
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,859
Seriously, why are you doing this?

307
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,400
You came in the end.

308
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,310
Seo Min Gi.

309
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
I was scared
you really wouldn't come.

310
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,550
Weren't you scared?

311
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:32,849
Didn't you come
because you were scared I might die?

312
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,050
You're not your normal self now.

313
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,020
Go and see a doctor tomorrow.

314
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:38,619
No.

315
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,530
I should go to Seo Min Gi's wedding.

316
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:46,599
Seo Min Gi
and Maeng Gong Hee's wedding.

317
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:50,499
But that Seo Min Gi is...

318
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,400
in my house right now.

319
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,009
The groom
whose wedding is tomorrow...

320
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,940
came to me.

321
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,849
Get a grip!

322
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,119
You said your love was over.

323
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,729
You said you were over me,
so why did you come running...

324
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:16,890
at a single phone call from me? Why?

325
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,099
(Maeng Gong Hee)

326
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,900
Hey.

327
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,469
What do you think you're doing?

328
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,239
Why?

329
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,839
Weren't you prepared for this much
when you came here?

330
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:38,180
You came to me
the night before your wedding.

331
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,719
That's what your heart wants.

332
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,959
Do you still not get it?

333
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,489
If things were really over
between us,

334
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,499
you shouldn't be here now!

335
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,700
You shouldn't have come.

336
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,040
Do you think I still have feelings for you
because I came here?

337
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,680
Please come to your senses.

338
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,150
Grit your teeth and live your life.

339
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,479
And don't call me like that
ever again.

340
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,650
This will be my last time
coming here.

341
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:27,999
Hey.

342
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,269
Ji Na, seriously...

343
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,190
(Team Manager Seo Min Gi)

344
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:03,069
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

345
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,150
Dan Soo!

346
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:22,719
What?

347
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:27,289
Oh, hello.

348
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:29,930
I guess
you're heading home from work.

349
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,959
Yes. I guess
you're on your way home too.

350
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,799
It's still cold.
Why are you dressed so lightly?

351
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,410
That shirt...

352
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,110
You still wear that shirt?

353
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,610
Oh, yes. Thank you again.
I love this shirt.

354
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,620
It's not warm enough
for this kind of weather.

355
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:53,819
I guess you poured
your warm heart into it.

356
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,319
It's very warm.

357
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,690
Anyway, get home safely.

358
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,660
You too. Bye.

359
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,719
Dan Soo...

360
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,489
missed his mom very much.

361
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,690
After his mom left,

362
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,890
I was the one by his side.

363
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,690
When Dan Soo was little,

364
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,299
he missed his mom so much...

365
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,069
that he cried a lot.

366
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,799
He cried every day,

367
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,370
and that's why he ended up
with his nickname, Snot Face.

368
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,370
He said his mom made his clothes...

369
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,309
and refused to take them off.

370
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:56,650
I said I'd just wash them for him
and give them back,

371
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,080
but he still refused
to take them off,

372
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,150
even after other kids
made fun of him for smelling bad.

373
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,559
Still to this day,
Dan Soo calls out for his mom...

374
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,259
when he's having a nightmare.

375
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,729
It looked like he was having a dream
about the day his mom left.

376
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:16,600
He kept saying, "Don't go."

377
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:18,140
"Don't leave."

378
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,739
He yelled at the top of his lungs.

379
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:28,549
His mom left, but it wasn't
because she didn't love him.

380
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:30,509
I want Dan Soo...

381
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,749
to know that
she still loves him very much.

382
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:36,850
I really want him to know that.

383
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,729
I should make him a warm jacket.

384
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,190
As your longtime friend,
I should do this much.

385
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,890
But I won't congratulate you.
This is about my loyalty.

386
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,930
If I congratulate you,

387
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,830
I'll look pathetic.

388
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Why is this...

389
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,640
She said she threw it away.

390
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:37,549
Maeng Gong Hee, you...

391
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,819
Grandma, Mom.
I want to sleep here tonight.

392
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:46,690
Hey, this room is too small
for the three of us.

393
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,690
Come on.

394
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,930
We'll sleep right next
to each other! Like this.

395
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,160
All right, let's sleep.

396
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,229
This is nice.

397
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:02,640
Oh, dear.

398
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,880
Why are you sighing again?

399
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:10,150
I'm more worried about you
than me becoming in-laws...

400
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,749
with Ssang Sook.

401
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,479
I'm worried you're choosing a path
you don't really want to take.

402
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,019
Even when you fell over,
you hid your wound...

403
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,090
and acted like you were okay
even though it was painful.

404
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:22,559
I'm worried you'd just smile
and act like you're okay...

405
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,959
while keeping everything bottled up.

406
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,759
Mom, why are you worried again?
My goodness.

407
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,729
Grandma, tell Mom to stop worrying.
All she does is worry.

408
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,140
Don't worry. Gong Hee will be fine.

409
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,410
Mom.

410
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,539
I thought I'd feel relieved
once she got married.

411
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,610
But I don't feel relieved at all.

412
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,509
I feel like something heavy
is sitting on my chest.

413
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:45,850
I don't know what's wrong with me.

414
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,249
Every mother feels that way.

415
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,650
That was exactly how I felt
when you got married.

416
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,160
Do you know
what broke my heart the most?

417
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,259
Your wedding day was supposed
to be the happiest day,

418
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,269
but I couldn't even smile
because I kept crying.

419
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:03,700
It made me feel horrible.

420
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,400
That's exactly how I feel now.

421
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,299
I keep getting teary-eyed.

422
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,910
Oh, dear. I shouldn't cry
at her wedding tomorrow.

423
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,180
I'm worried.

424
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,979
Should I just...

425
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,279
keep living with you here, Mom?

426
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,150
If you've changed your mind,
let me know.

427
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,660
I can totally take care of you.

428
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,559
My goodness.
I know you don't mean that.

429
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,759
Come on.

430
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,029
Once you move in with that family
after your wedding,

431
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:39,299
don't try so hard to please them.

432
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,940
You come first.

433
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:44,410
She's right.

434
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,039
Treat yourself as if you're...

435
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,610
the most precious person
in the world.

436
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,479
Even if the world wears you down,

437
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,019
you should never wear yourself down.

438
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,420
I'm sure that's your mother's wish.

439
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,690
All right?

440
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,559
Yes, I'll live a happy life.

441
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,969
This feels so nice.

442
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:15,940
This is so nice.

443
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,749
Mr. Seo Min Gi...

444
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:25,120
and Ms. Maeng Gong Hee's wedding
will begin now.

445
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,650
The beautiful mothers
of the bride and groom...

446
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,450
will light the candles.

447
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,299
Be nice to my daughter.

448
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,569
If you make my daughter cry,

449
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,209
I will make you pay for it.

450
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,479
That will depend on how she behaves.

451
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,009
How could you expect me to be nice
to your daughter, Kang Myung Ja?

452
00:24:57,749 --> 00:25:00,120
The mothers will enter now.

453
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:09,630
Just hold my hand, will you?

454
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,130
Who said
you could forcibly grab my hand?

455
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:39,390
Please give me a moment.
I'll be right out.

456
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,630
I came to tell you something.

457
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:51,999
Last night,

458
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Min Gi didn't answer your call,
right?

459
00:25:58,539 --> 00:25:59,539
How...

460
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,049
did you know?

461
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,950
Min Gi...

462
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,920
was with me...

463
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,489
last night.

464
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,630
At my place, in my room.

465
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,459
He was with me last night.

466
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,249
Min Gi...

467
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,920
was with me...

468
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,590
last night.

469
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,630
At my place, in my room.

470
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,299
He was with me last night.

471
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,930
Should we...

472
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,900
run away?

473
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:10,569
Why aren't you coming in?

474
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,529
(My Merry Marriage)

475
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,200
Why aren't you coming in?

476
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,670
We're late. Let's get going.

477
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,739
We're going to live here
from now on.

478
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:43,840
Who said you could do that?

479
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,479
No Ah wants to live with Grandma.

480
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,309
I broke so many people's hearts
by choosing this path.

481
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,850
I have to live a good life,
no matter what.

482
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,479
