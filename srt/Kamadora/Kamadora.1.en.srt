1
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:04,582
Are you Jacob?

2
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:05,655
I am.

3
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,721
You were supposed
to be here hours ago.

4
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,200
I didn't know it was in
the middle of nowhere.

5
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,843
We've been going in circles trying
to find this place.

6
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:28,340
Is that him?

7
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:30,423
Yeah. Where's my money?

8
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,586
- Abner!
- Mrs. Adeng, I'm off.

9
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:02,462
- Okay, go on.
- Thanks for the meal!

10
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,005
Mrs. Adeng, I'm off to work.

11
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:06,341
- I'll go ahead!
- Son! Come down here! Breakfast is ready!

12
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,635
- Yes, Mom! I'll be right there!
- Okay! Okay!

13
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:11,137
- Hi, Mrs. Adeng!
- Hi! Happy Monday morning!

14
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:14,241
Wow! This looks so good,
Mrs. Adeng!

15
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,433
Dried fish with salted
eggs and tomatoes!

16
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,557
Winner combo! I’m gonna
eat with my hands!

17
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:24,292
Of course! We should be full
and always smiling in the morning.

18
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,908
- Come eat, Abner!
- Hey, Abner!

19
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,989
By the way, Ica, is your store
doing much better?

20
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,621
Do you have more
customers these days?

21
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:33,154
It's doing better, Mrs. Adeng.

22
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,745
More and more people
are going out.

23
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,842
They're not scared of
the virus anymore.

24
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,750
Some people don’t even wear
a face mask anymore.

25
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,043
- Huh?
- Mm-hm!

26
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:45,505
And though it's supposed to be
the rainy season,

27
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:47,924
the days are too damn hot.

28
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,760
Most customers are just at the
mall for the air conditioning.

29
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,555
They're not really buying anything.
Just window shopping.

30
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,451
- Eat, son!
- Okay, Mom.

31
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:58,394
Time flies, huh?

32
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,838
I can't believe
it's August again!

33
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:04,190
It's Daddy Hernan's
sixth year in the UAE!

34
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:10,113
Well, on my next birthday,
it's just us three again!

35
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,075
I guess you're right,
Mrs. Adeng.

36
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,845
I haven't even met
Daddy Hernan.

37
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,663
But don't worry.

38
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,042
Pretty soon Abner will be bringing
home a girlfriend.

39
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:26,354
Is that true, son? Are you going to
introduce a girlfriend to mom?

40
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,622
No, Mom!

41
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,065
Ica just loves teasing me.

42
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,259
Don't drag me into your conversation.

43
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:36,615
- I should go, Mom. I'm gonna be late.
- Don't be so sensitive, son!

44
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:39,212
Finish what's on your plate!

45
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,880
I really should go now, mom.
I'm going to be late.

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,715
We have an exam today.

47
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,800
Hey, hey, hey.
My kiss. Here.

48
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,177
Kiss!

49
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,149
Kiss your auntie!

50
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:50,009
Hey, Ica wants a kiss!

51
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:54,310
Oh! Abner's all grown up!

52
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,494
Be careful, son!

53
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,881
- Yes, mom!
- Be safe!

54
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,231
He's in a hurry!

55
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,959
Come on,
let's eat, shall we?

56
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:03,404
He hates being teased.

57
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:05,308
- You like the food?
- Yummy!

58
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:08,708
- My favorite!
- Have some more!

59
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,759
[peopel clamoring]

60
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,203
- Hurry up!
- Oh no, I'm late already.

61
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,539
- Let me have a look at that.
- Oh, stop it.

62
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,552
Thanks.

63
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:42,912
Hurry!

64
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,053
Take a look at this, bro.

65
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,596
Out of the way.

66
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,181
Take a look!

67
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:00,352
Hey, friend!
I love your makeup!

68
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:01,397
Can I borrow it?

69
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,623
Did your policeman
give you that?

70
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:03,748
Don't be silly!

71
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,287
I saved up for this!

72
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:10,084
Why don't you ask Arnold
so you can be pretty like me!

73
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:14,099
The stock room boys
don't earn that much.

74
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,628
Pfft, he rarely even takes me out.

75
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,530
Then when I invite him
to watch a movie,

76
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:23,037
he'd just tell me, "Let's not!
Let's just watch Vivamax!"

77
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,194
[chuckles]

78
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,584
- Have you heard?
- What?

79
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,589
They say Mr. Galvez is boning
someone in his office.

80
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:31,670
Huh?

81
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,614
Should we report that pervert?

82
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:39,873
Apparently, he tells girls to come
into his office if they need anything.

83
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:43,284
Your hand stinks!

84
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,685
What did you have for breakfast?

85
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,352
- Dried fish!
- Dried fish!

86
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,014
Whatever!
See you girls later!

87
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,705
- Okay, see you.
- See you. Bye!

88
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,090
- Wash your hands. It stinks!
- Let's have lunch together!

89
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,741
You'd better get there
before Galvez! You...

90
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,405
You know what's in
the handbook.

91
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,326
I shouldn't have to
explain it to you.

92
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:11,194
No one is allowed to leave
their station until breaktime.

93
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:15,266
Did you leave your phones
in your lockers?

94
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:16,992
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

95
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,962
Okay. Customer is always right.
Got it?

96
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,035
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,440
We welcome you to this wonderful place

98
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,443
where beautiful things never cease to amaze

99
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,729
whatever you need,
indeed you will find

100
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:37,354
this special place will blow your mind

101
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:40,382
At Davidson's Superstore,

102
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:43,681
find what you're looking for!

103
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,422
Everything that you adore!

104
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,740
- Enjoy...
- Look at this, ma'am.

105
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:48,891
It looks good on you.

106
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,085
- What size are you, ma'am?
- Size 36B.

107
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:53,232
Okay, let me check.

108
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:56,758
- What color would you like?
- What do you have in mind?

109
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:58,577
- This one? Okay.
- Mine's all black.

110
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:00,375
Okay, okay.

111
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,344
I think this looks good.

112
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:12,399
Calling the attention of the parent
or guardian of the missing little girl,

113
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:16,649
wearing a white dress and red shoes.

114
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,610
You may head to the
customer service area...

115
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,285
Ma'am?

116
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,519
Excuse me, ma'am.

117
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:52,113
I'm sorry, but--

118
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:56,328
I've been following you
around the store.

119
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,242
Your tummy was flat
just now and then...

120
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:02,656
when you got out of the
fitting room, it's bulging.

121
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,414
You bitch...

122
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,358
How dare you insult a customer?

123
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:10,394
What are you insinuating?
That I'm a thief?

124
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,214
Who's the manager here?

125
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:14,235
Where's your manager?

126
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,820
Please call sir Jason.

127
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:21,774
Ma'am, if I were you,
I wouldn't make a scene.

128
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:24,078
I've caught you
red-handed, ma'am.

129
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:27,701
What are you saying?
You're making me dizzy.

130
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:30,312
If something happens to me,
I swear, I'll sue you!

131
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,180
- Sir Jason--
- Are you the manager?

132
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:34,219
What do you think you're doing?
What's happening, Jessica?

133
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:37,099
Sir, this woman just started
accusing me of bullshit.

134
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:41,303
Sir, I've been following
her in the store.

135
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,274
She wasn't pregnant
before but now,

136
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,250
when she got out of the fitting room,
she suddenly has a bulge.

137
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,054
Who are you trying to fool, lady?

138
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:49,728
Watch your mouth,
stupid bitch.

139
00:10:49,753 --> 00:10:53,250
You really think I'd be interested
in your cheapass clothes?

140
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:54,490
Listen to me, you moron,

141
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:55,891
you're just a saleslady.

142
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:59,024
Get that?
And I'm a customer. Idiot.

143
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,805
I have a lot of money!

144
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:05,563
Besides, you're no better than dogs
running around in here!

145
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,218
How dare you call me a thief.

146
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:11,727
- Want me to slap you?
- Ma'am! Ma'am!

147
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:13,250
Ma'am, please
don't be like that.

148
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:17,329
Let's have some
respect for our staff.

149
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:21,685
It's better to talk
in our office.

150
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:24,247
Let's not make
a scene here, okay?

151
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,490
Okay? Let's go.
Please follow me.

152
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:27,989
Excuse me, ma'am?

153
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,630
How dare you talk
down on us.

154
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:33,406
We are not dogs here.

155
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,563
Us salesladies are working
as hard as everyone else.

156
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:42,223
We put up with scanty wages

157
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,834
and have to pay for stolen
merch by people like you!

158
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:47,785
You're a thief!

159
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:49,952
I'm not a thief!

160
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,562
I already told you!

161
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,955
[people murmuring]

162
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,474
- You! Call security!
- Yes, sir?

163
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,586
- I've been noticing her a while ago.
- No worries sir.

164
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:05,074
So that's what she's been up to.

165
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:09,016
Please escort madam to
the security office, okay?

166
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:10,587
Please.

167
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:12,531
Come along, ma'am.
Please com with us.

168
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:14,061
Come along now.

169
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,766
Next time, keep your mouth shut
in front of everyone, okay?

170
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:26,123
Did you really have to
talk about those things?

171
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:30,352
We'll talk in my office
later, understood?

172
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:43,344
- Where should we eat?
- At the usual.

173
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,246
Or the one beside it.

174
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:46,414
Let's go.

175
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:47,774
I want one too.

176
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,292
Oh, comrades!

177
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:56,867
Let's thank our champion!

178
00:12:57,045 --> 00:13:01,781
The one who defends against
the exploitation of salespeople.

179
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:05,518
Let's give it up
for Jessica "Ica" Fajardo!

180
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:11,939
Your lunch is on me!

181
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:14,719
Oh! Thanks!

182
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:15,766
You're welcome!

183
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:20,790
It's true though, what
I said earlier, right?

184
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,695
They keep taking
advantage of us.

185
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,235
They're so quick to pin
the blame on us!

186
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,289
Yes! Exactly!

187
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:32,258
Why should it come out of our own pockets
when the register is short?

188
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:36,398
What can we afford with our
meager salary after all the cuts?

189
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:37,555
Barely anything, right?

190
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,672
- Nothing. It's all gone.
- Yeah, practically nothing.

191
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,535
Take Inday, for example.

192
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,075
She keeps getting charged
for missing items.

193
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,911
This couple, Melai and Arnold.

194
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:55,235
They can't even afford to go on dates
because movie tickets are so expensive!

195
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,558
But… they have a
Vivamax subscription!

196
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,858
Take it to Vivamax!
Take it to Vivamax!

197
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,367
Take it to Vivamax!
Take it to Vivamax!

198
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:07,796
Why'd you have to talk about us?

199
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm gonna pinch you!

200
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:12,362
Just eat!

201
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:19,693
- Our break is barely over!
- So what? It's fine.

202
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,414
We won't take long.

203
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:24,627
Fine.

204
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:37,659
Calling the attention
of all sales personnel,

205
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:38,699
please proceed to your posts.

206
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:40,475
Hurry up, let's go.
We might get late.

207
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,814
...sales personnel,
please proceed to your post.

208
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,306
Bye.

209
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,337
Bye.

210
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,868
Calling the attention
of all sales personnel,

211
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,673
please proceed to your posts.

212
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:07,804
- Here you go, sir.
- It's hot here in your department store.

213
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:12,758
Can't you turn up
the air conditioning?

214
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:24,556
Miss, can you help
me fit the shoe?

215
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:26,341
It hurts when I bend over.

216
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,046
Hey, miss!

217
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,870
Why'd you stand up?

218
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:57,968
You see?

219
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,841
You didn't even
put it on properly.

220
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:07,344
Miss, what--

221
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:14,141
Miss, this feels like
a bigger size.

222
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,477
Are you sure this is size 12?

223
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:20,212
It looks more like
a size 15.

224
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,429
Sir, that's a size 12.
You can check.

225
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:26,551
Maybe you're not as
big as you think you are.

226
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:28,642
You think so?

227
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:33,546
You think I'm not big?

228
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,176
You bitch?

229
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:45,477
Want me to shove my cock in your mouth
so you know how big it is?

230
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:49,103
Sir, please don't be rude.

231
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:54,108
We're talking about your shoe size,
not your cock.

232
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,850
So if you're not gonna buy,
kindly leave.

233
00:18:57,907 --> 00:18:59,363
You're just tiring me.

234
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,423
Now wait a minute!

235
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,916
You're rude!

236
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:05,219
I'm the rude one?

237
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:08,056
You've been peeking at my breasts
since you got here!

238
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,347
Hey!

239
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,136
You stupid saleslady!

240
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,931
I'm a customer!
A customer!

241
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:17,181
And the customer is always right!
Ever heard of that?

242
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:19,649
Don't you know that?

243
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,728
- Sir. Sir!
- Sir. Sir!

244
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:30,156
Sir. Sir!

245
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:33,626
I'm really sorry, sir.
I'm really sorry.

246
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,169
I will talk to our
staff about this.

247
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,853
I'm really sorry.

248
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:43,018
You. You're the manager?

249
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:44,406
You're the manager here?

250
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,566
Can you fire this woman?

251
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:48,756
Fire her!

252
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,139
- We deeply apologize, sir.
- She's out of line!

253
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:51,999
How dare she disrespect
a customer!

254
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,627
She humiliated me!
In front of everybody!

255
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:56,332
I'm very sorry, sir.

256
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,288
Melai! Melai!

257
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:02,196
Please assist sir.

258
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:04,265
Hi, sir. This way please.

259
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,322
Please let me assist you, sir.

260
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,368
Right this way, sir.

261
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,024
Hey, manager!

262
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,434
You should fire her!

263
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:14,157
We're on it.

264
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,312
What are you doing, Ica?

265
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:27,557
Come with me to my office.
We'll talk there.

266
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:37,407
Mr. De Guzman to customer service.

267
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,251
You're really a pain in the ass.

268
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:04,235
You know?

269
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:07,742
Why don't you get it?

270
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,696
Didn't I tell you? Do not argue
with our customers.

271
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:15,899
What happens if those people
file a complaint against you?

272
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,467
Or worse,

273
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,315
Post on social media
about the kind of service--

274
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,789
The way we deal
with our customers?

275
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,462
Huh?

276
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,150
Give us bad reviews?

277
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:34,363
Sir, you saw what he
did to me, didn't you?

278
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:36,110
He threw a shoe at me.

279
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:40,403
And bullshit to the customers who say
I'm the one who shows no respect.

280
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:42,375
They have no respect!

281
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:44,914
Oh, that's right…

282
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:48,222
Customers are always right!

283
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,133
Unfair!

284
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,746
You know what--
That's enough, okay?

285
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,633
You know I can just
call up HR right now

286
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,915
and tell them that
you want to resign.

287
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:09,697
Huh?

288
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:11,358
Is that what you want?

289
00:22:15,822 --> 00:22:17,047
Sir...

290
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:18,934
Please don't, sir.

291
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:23,110
You know this is my
only source of income.

292
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,314
This is my only livelihood.

293
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,196
For the room I'm renting.

294
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:30,407
I've got no family left, sir.

295
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:33,642
Sir, have mercy.

296
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,493
Don't do this to me.

297
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,864
I'm not a hard man to please.

298
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:47,633
You know I've always
had a crush on you.

299
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:49,523
Right?

300
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:53,774
Come on..

301
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:23,687
Put it in your mouth.

302
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,702
- I wonder if Ica's okay...
- Yeah, I'm worried.

303
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:43,897
There she is!

304
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,162
How did it go?
Did you get fired?

305
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:49,069
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

306
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:52,140
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, and they can't fire me!

307
00:25:52,568 --> 00:25:54,695
Galvez will get
what's coming to him!

308
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:57,262
Really, I'm fine!

309
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:58,549
Don't worry anymore

310
00:25:58,574 --> 00:25:59,825
- Are you sure?
- 100 percent.

311
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,710
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

312
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:20,104
Look, it's sir Dave!

313
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:21,905
Oh shit,
he's so cute!

314
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,267
- He looks yummy!
- Come on. We're gonna get yelled at.

315
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,417
Oh my god,
he's staring at you.

316
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,619
Thank you, sir.

317
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,377
Dad.

318
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,918
You called for me?

319
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:54,645
You know what?

320
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,643
I just couldn't believe
this is happening so fast.

321
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:04,964
I still remember when our
department store first opened.

322
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:09,612
This was the place to go shopping.

323
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:13,273
I got so excited when
people flocked to the mall.

324
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:17,038
All the lights would twinkle
there in Christmas time.

325
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:22,825
Dave, this was every family
in Camanava's favorite hangout.

326
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:27,352
That's why this is
so precious to me.

327
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:34,837
This is where all our
businesses started.

328
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,418
The reason why
the corporation grew.

329
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:44,513
But this is the last time
I will ever see it.

330
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:49,304
And I really have to say
goodbye to my office.

331
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,217
I leave it all up to you, Dave.

332
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:58,480
You're in charge now.

333
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:04,269
Dad, you're just getting
a checkup in the States.

334
00:28:05,362 --> 00:28:07,058
Everything will be alright.

335
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,324
And while you're away,
I'll take care of things here.

336
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,333
And I trust you.

337
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,403
I won't let you down.

338
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,527
Sir Dave!

339
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:34,202
Sorry.
Good afternoon, sir.

340
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:35,995
Can you assist me?

341
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:37,735
What do you need,
Sir Dave?

342
00:28:38,626 --> 00:28:40,190
I need good sets of clothes.

343
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:42,683
Ah, hold on, sir.

344
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:49,656
Here, Sir Dave. I think
these will look good on you.

345
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:54,611
Come.

346
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:00,702
Sir Dave!

347
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:01,940
Jason.

348
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:03,546
- What a pleasant surprise!
- How are you?

349
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:06,216
Sir Dave's so handsome!

350
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:08,325
Do you want me to assist you?

351
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,757
It's okay.
She's here.

352
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:14,960
This way please, sir.

353
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,442
Another win for Ica.

354
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,757
I wouldn't mind
assisting sir Dave!

355
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:23,983
Dream on!

356
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:26,858
Come on, back to work.
The prize is won!

357
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:28,129
Let's go!

358
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,718
Miss?

359
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:49,700
Hello, sir?

360
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:52,278
Can you help me
with the fitting?

361
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,286
Huh?

362
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:57,040
Get in.

363
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,835
Maybe I should try it on.

364
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,611
You can't go in, sir.

365
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,962
Why not?
It's the fitting room.

366
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,297
Sir, just use a different one.

367
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,340
It's not allowed?

368
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,924
- Who's in there?
- Sir Dave's fitting some clothes.

369
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:34,076
Sir Dave's fitting in some clothes.

370
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,186
- Sorry, sir. Let's just use the other one.
- We can't let you through.

371
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:37,851
Sorry about that.

372
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:52,886
You like that?

373
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:19,913
Calling the attention of sales personnel,
Ms. Jessica Fajardo.

374
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,031
Please proceed
to the admin office.

375
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,203
Calling the attention of sales personnel,
Ms. Jessica Fajardo

376
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,261
- Please proceed to the admin office.
- Are you okay?

377
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,287
- Please proceed to the admin office.
- Yeah.

378
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,238
So did you see his abs?

379
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:30,414
- What did you say?
- Did you see his abs?

380
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,312
Someone will hear you!

381
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:34,212
Yeah, he was just wearing briefs.

382
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:36,256
- Tell us more!
- I bet you were so nervous.

383
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:37,969
- Is he big?
- No.

384
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:41,039
- Stop talking, somebody might hear you.
- Tell me!

385
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:43,024
Hi, Ica!

386
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,836
I wish I had
assisted him instead.

387
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:46,215
Hi, Ica!

388
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,758
It's Roman.

389
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:58,945
Hi Melai. Hi Day.

390
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,430
Hi, Roman!

391
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,148
You want me
to drop you off?

392
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,784
No, it's okay.
We can take the jeep.

393
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,976
- You sure?
- Looks like you're going somewhere.

394
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:07,969
We are.

395
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,122
Thanks, though!

396
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,732
- Okay. Bye!
- If you say so.

397
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,342
Bye! Be safe!

398
00:34:42,053 --> 00:34:44,545
Where do you wanna go tonight?
I got my salary today.

399
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:48,382
I want to go home.

400
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:50,747
Just give your salary to your wife.

401
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:52,774
Your family needs it more.

402
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:56,211
Not this again.
I told you when I'm with you,

403
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:57,406
you're the wife.

404
00:34:57,866 --> 00:35:00,423
Stop doing this shit.
You're pissing me off.

405
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:01,984
I don't wanna be
your mistress anymore!

406
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:03,633
I'm so sick of this!

407
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:07,097
I set aside some money.
You can have all of it.

408
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:08,336
Just let me go!

409
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:11,059
Why do you say it like that?

410
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:12,320
Why, are you locked up?

411
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:14,788
You can do everything
you want, can't you?

412
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:16,943
Right?

413
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,320
I didn't even see you
the whole of last week.

414
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:23,781
You don't answer
my texts or calls either!

415
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:25,811
Huh? And you tell me there's
no phone signal where you were?

416
00:35:26,318 --> 00:35:27,736
Why? Who do you have
someone on the side?

417
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:29,226
Who's sharing
your bed these days?

418
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:32,439
- Tell me!
- Ow!

419
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,799
Stop that! That hurts!

420
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,960
- Screw you!
- Let go--

421
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,266
You bitch!

422
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:41,256
If it weren't for me,
you'd be living in the streets!

423
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:42,347
Did you forget?

424
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:44,789
That I took you in when
your father went to jail!

425
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:47,069
Damn you!

426
00:35:49,956 --> 00:35:51,249
Remember,

427
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,059
we've got your father.

428
00:35:54,514 --> 00:35:55,850
What was our agreement?

429
00:35:58,235 --> 00:36:00,696
That I will tell you where
you can find your father,

430
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,224
once you've paid off
all your debts.

431
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:05,800
That's my only condition.

432
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:09,833
But until you pay me,

433
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:12,495
you will do everything I tell you.

434
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,384
You will do whatever
I want you to do.

435
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:15,437
Do you understand?

436
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:18,359
I'm not your property, Roman!

437
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:21,321
Yes, you helped me
and sheltered me,

438
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:23,198
clothed, and fed me but...

439
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:26,253
coming with you that night
is the biggest regret of my life!

440
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:28,136
I've had enough!
I'm not your slave!

441
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:29,996
Shit! Stop nagging!

442
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:31,915
You bitch!
You and your stupid mouth!

443
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:32,874
I should just punch
your lights out!

444
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:35,168
- You're hurting me!
- So you can be with your mother!

445
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:36,878
- Want that?
- Let go of me.

446
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,713
Damn you.

447
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,432
Shit...

448
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,242
Okay, I’m sorry.

449
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,719
Go on. Choose where
we're gonna go.

450
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:54,633
I don't want you to think
I'm a bad person.

451
00:36:55,743 --> 00:36:56,795
And all right.

452
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,608
I will release you
on one condition.

453
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,843
You will pay me
one million pesos.

454
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:04,798
I will tell you
where your father is.

455
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,586
You will get your freedom.
But until you get me that,

456
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,422
I'd like you to
just do as I say.

457
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:11,542
That's all I'm asking.

458
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:15,183
So now, choose where
we're gona go.

459
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,877
Don't ruin the night.
Please.

460
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,341
Don't ruin for the both of us.

461
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:22,854
I apologize.

462
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:27,562
I'm not angry.

463
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,418
Not mad at you.

464
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:34,644
Come on. Just pick.

465
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:38,273
Please. Don't be mad.
Let's get out of here.

466
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,696
Let's go. Come on.
Don't be mad.

467
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:43,406
Stop being angry.

468
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,210
So?

469
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,491
- Are we okay?
- Yeah, okay.

470
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:51,870
That's what
I was telling you.

471
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,734
You were gonna ruin our night.

472
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:08,321
- I guess I'll go.
- Yup.

473
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:11,696
- Call me later, okay?
- Cut it out!

474
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,213
Hey! Good morning, Abner!

475
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:20,448
Where have you been?

476
00:41:22,372 --> 00:41:23,938
It's too damn early
for that attitude!

477
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:27,007
What about you? Do decent women
go home at this hour?

478
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,532
Look! All the nosy neighbors
are gonna be talking about you.

479
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,662
So what?
Are you my brother?

480
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,952
Good morning, Mrs. Adeng!

481
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:47,313
Hey. Morning it is.

482
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,818
What happened? Why didn't you
come home last night?

483
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,379
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way.

484
00:41:54,404 --> 00:41:58,700
After all, you might as well
be my daughter.

485
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,245
But of course,
if you actually were my child,

486
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:05,081
a young lady like you
coming home at this hour,

487
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:07,071
it's not a good sight, you know?

488
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,826
What would the neighbors think?

489
00:42:11,392 --> 00:42:15,897
And then they see you step
out of your boyfriend's car.

490
00:42:18,678 --> 00:42:20,221
But you know,
to be honest,

491
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:23,599
I don't mind
what you want to do.

492
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:27,191
I'm just saying
this because I care.

493
00:42:28,855 --> 00:42:32,025
And as you know,
I'm a teacher, Ica.

494
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,569
I wouldn't like to be told

495
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:40,533
that as a teacher, I have no power
to straighten out those under my roof.

496
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:44,495
Just take extra care,
Ica, please? Okay?

497
00:42:46,456 --> 00:42:48,330
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Adeng.

498
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:51,048
I feel ashamed.

499
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:56,346
You know Roman, if I don't do
as he says, it's another big fight.

500
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,495
But don't worry,
this is the last time.

501
00:43:01,024 --> 00:43:03,056
Thank you for your
concern, Mrs. Adeng.

502
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,370
Not at all. It's nothing.

503
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:08,369
You know, you'd better
come join us.

504
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:09,929
Come eat. Have breakfast.

505
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,706
Here. There's eggs and coffee.

506
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:14,025
- Hotdogs.
- Ah, no need, Mrs. Adeng.

507
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,424
I'm still full.

508
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:16,845
What?

509
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:19,092
I'll go upstairs.

510
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,758
Abner, eat!

511
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:23,291
We're gonna be late.

512
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,757
Come straight home, okay?

513
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,826
Yes, Ma. I will.

514
00:43:40,426 --> 00:43:41,909
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

515
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:43,518
- Okay, be safe!
- Take care, Ma!

516
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,170
- Okay! Okay.
- Take care!

517
00:43:45,195 --> 00:43:47,948
- See you.
- Bye, Ma. Take care!

518
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:54,820
Bro, class is cancelled.
There's a rally and ma'am is absent.

519
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:21,986
Listen to me.

520
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,077
You know what to do.

521
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:27,461
Pack your things.

522
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:30,948
Let's meet after three days.

523
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:33,728
You already know where.

524
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:39,181
It's just the two of us
once this is done.

525
00:45:41,095 --> 00:45:43,633
Just make sure
no one notices you.

526
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:47,023
Everything will be alright.

527
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:34,992
Holy shit, Abner!

528
00:46:35,017 --> 00:46:37,019
Ica! What the hell!
You startled me!

529
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,713
What are you doing?

530
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,082
You're jerking off?
Watching porn?

531
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:42,984
What? No!
You're wrong!

532
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,835
I literally caught you!

533
00:46:45,987 --> 00:46:48,948
Don't deny it!
You're jerking off!

534
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:53,452
Yes, I was!
I'm sorry!

535
00:46:53,872 --> 00:46:54,998
I'm such a dickhead.

536
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:57,574
Don't be silly!
How old are you anyway?

537
00:46:57,999 --> 00:46:59,709
- Seventeen?
- Yeah.

538
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,046
That's natural for
teenage boys like you.

539
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:05,907
At seventeen I wasn't even
a virgin anymore.

540
00:47:06,483 --> 00:47:09,420
Don't worry.
I won't tell your mom.

541
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:11,920
But on one condition!

542
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:14,598
What condition is that?
You love picking on me

543
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,930
just because you got me
on a chokehold!

544
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:19,770
Well, naturally!

545
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,539
I will keep your secret.

546
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:24,180
It'll be our secret!

547
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,008
Okay, listen.
This is my condition.

548
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:30,716
Go to the store and
buy me a napkin.

549
00:47:30,741 --> 00:47:31,985
With wings!

550
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:33,304
Come on, Ica!

551
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:35,845
Don't make me do that!
I'm a guy for crying out loud!

552
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:38,625
You're really gonna ask me
to buy you a napkin?

553
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,828
Your choice.
It's pretty simple, really.

554
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:46,758
I might mention it
to your mom

555
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:52,360
that her son is skipping school,
jerking off, and a Peeping Tom.

556
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:55,594
Don't! Don't tell her.
I'm gonna do it.

557
00:47:56,281 --> 00:48:00,399
I can't let you tell mom
I'm skipping school to jerk off.

558
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:04,646
She'll slap me for sure if she
finds out I'm peeping on you.

559
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:07,840
Go on, then.
You're a smart kid after all.

560
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,465
Get out and buy my napkin.

561
00:48:09,528 --> 00:48:12,615
Sorry. It's because
I have a crush on you.

562
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,577
I've been fantasizing about you
for a long time.

563
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,089
"Sorry"? Are you nuts?

564
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:23,313
Don't think about it.
I totally get it.

565
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,653
Jerkface.

566
00:48:26,678 --> 00:48:28,430
Get to it.
Buy me my napkin.

567
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:30,174
Yeah, yeah.

568
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:36,378
- With wings, okay?
- Yes!

569
00:48:44,563 --> 00:48:47,566
I'm excited. I think
it's gonna be delicious.

570
00:49:07,002 --> 00:49:09,714
Don't worry.
I'll teach you.

571
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:09,647
Abner!

572
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,337
- What?
- I'm on my period, remember?

573
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:14,111
Do you eat blood stew?

574
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:21,577
I'm on my period.
We can't!

575
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:26,832
You know, Abner,
this is my last day here.

576
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:28,556
So thank you.

577
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:32,642
Thank you for making me
happy on my last day.

578
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:35,299
Stop it with the drama.

579
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:38,636
You're taking me
out of the zone.

580
00:50:40,674 --> 00:50:42,635
I can take
responsibility for you.

581
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:44,305
Stupid boy!

582
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:46,477
Let's keep this a secret, okay?

583
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,751
Of course.
Dirty little secret.

584
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:49,947
Promise.

585
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:57,071
But this, we can do this.

586
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:18,388
Hurry up!

587
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:24,045
Hurry up!

588
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:09,102
Everything's set.

589
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:12,556
We'll finish this tonight.

590
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:16,584
Just make sure you
don't get followed.

591
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:24,644
Hi, Mrs. Adeng.

592
00:52:24,669 --> 00:52:27,860
Oh, hey.
You're going out?

593
00:52:28,596 --> 00:52:30,598
I thought you didn't
have work today?

594
00:52:30,623 --> 00:52:32,212
Besides, it's past lunch.

595
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,693
Yeah.

596
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:36,020
But I need to go to the store.

597
00:52:36,045 --> 00:52:38,005
My supervisor asked me
to come in.

598
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,536
He said he needs to talk to me.

599
00:52:40,353 --> 00:52:45,179
Oh, no. I'm gonna cook sinigang,
your favorite.

600
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:47,071
I didn't know you
were going out.

601
00:52:47,473 --> 00:52:48,807
Will you take long?

602
00:52:51,665 --> 00:52:53,696
Yes. I might take a while.

603
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,398
We might not even
see each other again.

604
00:52:56,688 --> 00:52:57,686
What?

605
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:00,819
Why is that?

606
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,280
What's wrong?

607
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:05,129
Are you leaving for good?

608
00:53:06,327 --> 00:53:08,538
Is that why you're carrying all that?

609
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:12,623
I only meant that

610
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,858
maybe we won't see each
other again today,

611
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:18,479
because you'll be asleep
by the time I get back.

612
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:19,797
That's what I meant.

613
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,157
So that's it.

614
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,474
- Mrs. Adeng.
- Yes?

615
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:34,002
Here's my payment
for last month's rent.

616
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:38,982
And here's my two months advance.

617
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:41,314
So I don't spend
the money on accident.

618
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,141
Wow!

619
00:53:45,215 --> 00:53:47,118
Thank you so much!

620
00:53:47,834 --> 00:53:51,439
You're paying in
advance now, huh?

621
00:53:51,553 --> 00:53:55,849
You'd better wait for dinner so
you can have something to eat.

622
00:53:55,874 --> 00:54:00,295
Ah, that's okay.
I really should be going, Mrs. Adeng.

623
00:54:10,712 --> 00:54:12,376
Can I give you a hug?

624
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:14,518
Of course!

625
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:16,209
Come here.

626
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:26,207
Hang on.

627
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:31,445
Is there a problem?
Is something bothering you?

628
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,178
Would you like to talk about it first?

629
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:34,304
It's nothing.

630
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:35,970
I just wanted to thank you because

631
00:54:35,995 --> 00:54:40,833
you treated me like family here,
like your own daughter.

632
00:54:41,628 --> 00:54:43,505
I really appreciate it, Mrs. Adeng.

633
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:47,593
Are you okay?

634
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,345
- Are you sure?
- Yes, ma'am.

635
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,665
Okay. I'll go ahead.

636
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,101
All right. Be safe, okay?

637
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:57,244
When you get home,
I'll save you some dinner.

638
00:54:57,269 --> 00:54:59,157
And thanks for this.

639
00:54:59,182 --> 00:55:00,372
No problem, Mrs. Adeng.

640
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:01,398
- Take care!
- Take care, Mrs. Adeng!

641
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,466
Okay.

642
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,900
Abner!

643
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:06,020
Mom!

644
00:55:06,045 --> 00:55:07,782
Come down here.

645
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:08,875
Coming.

646
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,320
Buy me some okra.

647
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:15,556
We're missing some ingredients
for the sinigang.

648
00:55:17,506 --> 00:55:20,300
Our sinigang is missing
an ingredient. Okra.

649
00:55:21,744 --> 00:55:22,828
- Mom.
- Yeah?

650
00:55:22,828 --> 00:55:23,971
Was that Ica who just left?

651
00:55:23,996 --> 00:55:26,874
Yes. She said her supervisor
called for her.

652
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:29,290
But she'll be back.
Go on! Buy me the okra.

653
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,164
What are you standing around for?

654
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:37,484
Okra! Mind you buy
the right vegetable! Okra!

655
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:39,632
Okay, mom.
Okra. Okra!

656
00:55:40,363 --> 00:55:43,449
Okra, okra. I swear to god.

657
00:55:46,087 --> 00:55:48,590
I'm broke, sir.

658
00:55:49,118 --> 00:55:50,748
My salary keeps getting cuts.

659
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:53,275
I've got nothing left
to pay the bills with.

660
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:58,509
You know,
according to the records,

661
00:55:58,534 --> 00:56:00,494
you owe us a lot of money.

662
00:56:01,814 --> 00:56:04,025
I can do anything.

663
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,670
What do you mean by 'anything'?

664
00:56:12,695 --> 00:56:14,029
Anything you want.

665
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:39,330
I can't believe
you're done, sir!

666
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:51,363
Let me check your bag ma'am.

667
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,890
- Thank you.
- Let's eat.

668
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:54,750
- Where do you want to eat?
- Let me check your bags.

669
00:59:55,248 --> 00:59:56,625
Let's just go to my place.

670
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,001
I will cook for you.

671
00:59:58,026 --> 01:00:00,904
- Then let's watch Vivamax.
- Thank you so much!

672
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:05,047
It's always Vivamax with you.
Treat me to a movie for once.

673
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:07,669
Thank you.

674
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:16,420
Hi, Melai. Where's Ica?

675
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:17,991
Huh?

676
01:00:18,936 --> 01:00:20,541
Ica's not here.

677
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,498
Just tell me where Ica is, Melai.

678
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:27,026
Huh? Her phone's not ringing,
she's not online?

679
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:30,257
I told you Ica's not here,
Roman. Relax.

680
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:31,761
She's on leave today.

681
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:33,976
Then I went to your boarding house.

682
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:36,422
They said she came here because
your supervisor asked her to come in.

683
01:00:36,953 --> 01:00:39,528
Ica already told me your
supervisor's harrassing all of you.

684
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,140
They're probably doing
something in his office as we speak.

685
01:00:42,165 --> 01:00:43,765
Tell me who this Galvez is.
Where is he?

686
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:47,711
Tell me where he is!

687
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,398
There's Galvez.

688
01:00:51,203 --> 01:00:52,253
Are you Galvez?

689
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:53,390
Are you Galvez?

690
01:00:53,803 --> 01:00:54,906
Are you?

691
01:00:55,267 --> 01:00:57,019
Hey bastard, where is Ica?

692
01:00:57,044 --> 01:00:58,462
Tell me where she is!

693
01:00:58,856 --> 01:00:59,899
What are you--

694
01:00:59,946 --> 01:01:01,094
What do you mean "Ica"?

695
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,496
How would I know?

696
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:03,983
She's absent today.

697
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:05,426
Where is she? Tell me!

698
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:08,475
Why are you asking me?

699
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,258
Don't come near me.
Why are you closing in?

700
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:13,125
I'm a police officer, back off!

701
01:01:13,585 --> 01:01:16,063
Screw you, you bastard!
Don't you know? I'm a policeman.

702
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:18,850
I finally have time for you.

703
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,937
You bastard. Why are you
harrassing my girlfriend?

704
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:23,475
You son of a bitch.
Damn you!

705
01:01:25,968 --> 01:01:27,231
Son of a bitch.

706
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:31,130
Go inside first!

707
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:33,820
Come here, you bastard!

708
01:01:37,013 --> 01:01:38,070
Get up!

709
01:01:38,124 --> 01:01:41,382
All you idiots turn a
blind eye to this snake?

710
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:43,017
So?

711
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:47,562
He's harrassing all the
female employees here!

712
01:01:47,587 --> 01:01:50,382
Now that you know,
just do your jobs!

713
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,931
Got it? You asshole!

714
01:01:53,956 --> 01:01:55,578
Hey, cut it out!

715
01:05:58,359 --> 01:05:59,464
Melai!

716
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:00,718
Melai!

717
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:05,413
Melai, wake up! Melai!

718
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:07,913
Ica. What the heck!

719
01:06:09,722 --> 01:06:11,515
What are you doing here?

720
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,626
Did you shoot Melai?

721
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,540
Shut up. If I didn't shoot her,
she'll identify you!

722
01:06:16,565 --> 01:06:17,851
She's a witness!

723
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:20,211
You shouldn't have shot her.

724
01:06:20,236 --> 01:06:22,405
We don't have time.
Let's go!

725
01:06:23,462 --> 01:06:26,335
Melai, sorry! Sorry!

726
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:29,535
Shit, Ica, get out of here!

727
01:06:33,248 --> 01:06:35,041
Let's go!

728
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,546
She won't hear you.
She's dead!

729
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,456
We're here live at
Davidson's Department Store

730
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,890
here in Caloocan City,

731
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,792
where a fire broke out.

732
01:07:01,948 --> 01:07:04,951
According to reports and resources,

733
01:07:04,976 --> 01:07:08,374
the fire spread out too fast
and took the whole building.

734
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,242
Our firefighters are
currently on the situation.

735
01:07:11,616 --> 01:07:14,802
Authorities are still investigating
the origin of this incident.

736
01:07:14,827 --> 01:07:16,620
Sigrid Polon, reporting.

737
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:42,052
This isn't the end of the story.
Ica's story has just begun.

738
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:45,629
Let's go, we're departing soon!

739
01:07:45,654 --> 01:07:48,656
Three more!
Heading to Sapang Palay!

740
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,233
Balintawak! Balintawak!

741
01:07:51,258 --> 01:07:53,296
He brought me to his home.

742
01:07:53,321 --> 01:07:56,038
He informed his wife Monica

743
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:57,807
that I would be staying
with them from then on.

744
01:07:57,832 --> 01:08:00,460
She's gonna be staying with us
for a while. Don't we have a spare room?

745
01:08:00,485 --> 01:08:01,903
Wait. Wait, your niece?

746
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,015
But from the very beginning,
ma'am Monica didn't like me at all.

747
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:08,443
But Roman would
always answer for me.

748
01:08:08,468 --> 01:08:10,095
...so I brought her here for a while.

749
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:11,171
Is it okay?

750
01:08:11,196 --> 01:08:13,114
All right, fine.
I'll get the room ready.

751
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:14,195
Sure.

752
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:27,966
Because of that, I endured Monica's
mistreatment of me for two years.

753
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,718
When Roman isn't home,

754
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:35,156
- she treats me worse than a maid.
- Ica! What the hell!

755
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:37,806
- Are you trying to burn my house down?
- I'm so sorry!

756
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:39,913
She would hit me, curse at me.

757
01:08:39,938 --> 01:08:42,357
Monica! What's wrong with you?
You're hurting her again!

758
01:08:42,472 --> 01:08:46,059
Again? Serously? She tried
to burn down our house!

759
01:08:46,342 --> 01:08:48,441
Are you gonna take her side?

760
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:49,406
Why do you have to hit her?

761
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:50,898
- What good is she?
- You think I'm taking her side?

762
01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:53,406
- Yes! That's what you always do!
- Tell me, was it right to hit her?

763
01:08:53,446 --> 01:08:54,739
And what about you?
You think you're doing the right thing?

764
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,007
What's your problem?

765
01:08:56,554 --> 01:08:57,590
Shit!

766
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:00,452
But that's not the worst of it.

767
01:09:01,201 --> 01:09:03,342
When I turned sixteen,

768
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:06,749
Roman showed his true intentions.

769
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:21,764
Often when ma'am Monica wasn't around,

770
01:09:21,998 --> 01:09:27,622
he would suddenly come home
and feast on my young body.

771
01:09:29,614 --> 01:09:31,677
Be quiet, jeez.
Don't fight it.

772
01:09:33,107 --> 01:09:34,981
- Your ma'am Monica isn't home.
- Please don't, sir.

773
01:09:35,006 --> 01:09:36,662
I couldn't do anything.

774
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:39,363
I was powerless against him.

775
01:09:40,471 --> 01:09:42,807
He would always remind me

776
01:09:42,832 --> 01:09:45,764
that I owe him for taking me in

777
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:47,514
and that my father's life
is in their hands.

778
01:09:47,539 --> 01:09:48,631
Come on!

779
01:10:37,677 --> 01:10:39,133
Nothing happened, okay?

780
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:43,348
Nothing happened.
Remember that.

781
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:45,917
Don't tell your ma'am.

782
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:48,974
Hey!

783
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:51,238
Don't tell your ma'am, okay?

784
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:52,857
Don't tell Monica!

785
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:55,009
He said if I ever run away from him,

786
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,470
I will never see my father again.

787
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,463
Ica, there's a lot of--

788
01:11:21,396 --> 01:11:23,584
You monsters!

789
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:24,647
What is this?

790
01:11:24,672 --> 01:11:27,607
- I will explain!
- How can you explain this?

791
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:30,812
- No!
- You bitch!

792
01:11:30,837 --> 01:11:32,063
I said I can explain!

793
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:33,840
How? What the hell
is wrong with you!

794
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:36,442
- Let me explain!
- How can you explain this?

795
01:11:36,467 --> 01:11:38,670
You're screwing your niece?

796
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:41,670
- Stop screaming!
- So you're the one who's mad?

797
01:11:41,695 --> 01:11:43,443
I'm going to explain it to you!

798
01:11:43,468 --> 01:11:45,482
Damn you! Let go of me!

799
01:11:45,507 --> 01:11:46,834
Let go of me!

800
01:11:48,419 --> 01:11:51,006
I wandered in the streets after that.

801
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:53,872
Until the next day,

802
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:56,490
Roman found me on a sidewalk.

803
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,670
And he brought me to a hidden
safehouse in Montalban, Rizal.

804
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:25,462
He said it's where they hide away
the witnesses in their cases.

805
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,896
Police assets whose lives
are in danger.

806
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:33,651
And the victims, too,
so they can be safe.

807
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:36,795
I stayed there for a year.

808
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:39,662
I was seventeen years old.

809
01:12:40,667 --> 01:12:42,794
I preferred my life there.

810
01:12:43,888 --> 01:12:46,919
Far from Roman,
away from that devil.

811
01:12:47,342 --> 01:12:49,904
And that's where
I met Mr. Narsing.

812
01:12:50,789 --> 01:12:54,162
He's also a police asset and
the keeper of the safehouse.

813
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:56,218
He takes care of all of us.

814
01:12:57,099 --> 01:12:59,060
He taught me to be strong.

815
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:01,821
To be brave and smart.

816
01:13:02,624 --> 01:13:05,217
And that's where
I formed my dreams,

817
01:13:05,242 --> 01:13:09,654
that one day, I will be able to escape
from the shackles Roman placed on me

818
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,768
and my father and I will meet again.

819
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:44,637
Looks like I win this
round, too, Mr. Ching.

820
01:13:46,599 --> 01:13:49,602
You have all the luck tonight.

821
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:52,679
Are you sure you're not cheating?

822
01:13:53,348 --> 01:13:55,183
You're always winning.

823
01:13:55,981 --> 01:13:57,357
Me? Cheat?

824
01:13:58,291 --> 01:13:59,500
For what?

825
01:14:00,397 --> 01:14:02,273
This is just a game, Mr. Ching.

826
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:08,537
Okay, then. One more round
so we can win some of it back.

827
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:11,714
- I'm in for another round.
- Sorry, boys.

828
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,847
I'm tired.
We've been playing all night.

829
01:14:15,555 --> 01:14:17,975
Besides, I have a
business meeting.

830
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:20,880
Bullshit, Dave!

831
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:26,561
You asshole, leaving
after raking all the money.

832
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,295
You're a jerk.

833
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:31,903
You're just a bastard!

834
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:35,342
Bastard!

835
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:36,704
Listen, old man!

836
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:40,314
Don't talk to me
like that, got it?

837
01:14:41,203 --> 01:14:42,747
Screw you!

838
01:14:44,723 --> 01:14:47,559
Hey, watch it.
Go ahead, try me.

839
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,209
You don’t know me.

840
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:52,556
Know your place.

841
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,941
Where are you?

842
01:14:59,966 --> 01:15:01,717
I came from the province.

843
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:04,130
I've been waiting for an hour.

844
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,365
I'm at the crossing.

845
01:15:13,851 --> 01:15:15,853
Do you have a job opening?

846
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,073
Sir, this way, sir!

847
01:16:32,076 --> 01:16:34,339
So you own this big building, sir.

848
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:35,907
I didn't know you were bigtime.

849
01:16:37,674 --> 01:16:39,301
You should come in.
I'll treat you to lunch.

850
01:16:39,326 --> 01:16:41,170
Ah, it's okay, sir.

851
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:44,650
I should go back to looking
for a job and a place to stay.

852
01:16:44,675 --> 01:16:46,514
Probably somewhere
in Monumento.

853
01:16:46,663 --> 01:16:47,694
Are you sure?

854
01:16:52,686 --> 01:16:54,006
Here's my calling card.

855
01:16:56,771 --> 01:16:58,437
And take some of this money.

856
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:01,787
For saving my life.

857
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:06,318
Look for a boarding house near here.

858
01:17:07,346 --> 01:17:08,597
Then call me when you're ready.

859
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,355
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll take care of you.

860
01:17:10,989 --> 01:17:13,283
I will give you a job here
in our department store.

861
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:16,733
Thank you, sir.
I'm grateful.

862
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,439
Take care.

863
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:27,193
And that's how Dave and I started
our friendship.

864
01:17:27,456 --> 01:17:31,043
He secretly hired me to work
at their department store.

865
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,700
He had me trained to be a janitress.

866
01:17:35,111 --> 01:17:37,322
Until I reached my second year

867
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,983
and became a stock girl in charge
of inventory in the warehouse.

868
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:48,216
And on my third year,
I became a saleslady.

869
01:17:51,255 --> 01:17:53,437
But we had an agreement.

870
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:56,842
That we would keep it a secret
that we know each other.

871
01:17:57,336 --> 01:18:02,536
Because Dave wanted to have an eye,
or a spy inside the department store.

872
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:05,901
When I settled in my new job,

873
01:18:06,545 --> 01:18:08,756
that's when Dave took
a serious liking to me.

874
01:18:09,305 --> 01:18:11,849
He would take me out
on dates in secret.

875
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,209
But all throughout our
three years together,

876
01:18:15,283 --> 01:18:18,661
no one even noticed
we were in a relationship.

877
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,920
Because I'm not just a saleslady,

878
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:23,053
I'm also a good actress.

879
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:29,001
Dave and I have been keeping
our relationship a secret for three years.

880
01:18:29,445 --> 01:18:32,323
And though I remained
enslaved by Roman,

881
01:18:32,471 --> 01:18:37,193
and harrassed by Mr. Galvez,
I endured all of it

882
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,173
just to protect Dave.

883
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,998
Because we've put
some plans into motion

884
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:47,154
and they cannot be foiled
by my personal issues.

885
01:18:47,725 --> 01:18:50,897
A week before the department store
burned down,

886
01:18:51,224 --> 01:18:53,935
Dave and I had all our plans laid out.

887
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:57,396
And I have been preparing myself
for this for a long time.

888
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,740
In the plan, I will go about my work
as a saleslady as usual.

889
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:04,972
But I need to get in

890
01:19:04,997 --> 01:19:08,959
and study the movements of
the people in the admin office.

891
01:19:09,404 --> 01:19:13,717
That's why I tend to make a scene
and end up getting reprimanded

892
01:19:13,762 --> 01:19:17,045
so I'll be called into
Mr. Galvez's office.

893
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:21,380
What they don't know is,
I'm doing all of it

894
01:19:21,405 --> 01:19:25,186
so I can snoop around and find
where they keep the audit files.

895
01:19:25,211 --> 01:19:27,545
Here's the clincher.

896
01:19:28,034 --> 01:19:29,053
The truth is...

897
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:33,436
the department store hasn't been
doing so well for several years now.

898
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,740
Dave's father has accummulated debts

899
01:19:36,765 --> 01:19:38,795
from numerous businessmen
trying to keep it afloat.

900
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,454
And in order preserve
their remaining assets,

901
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:45,904
Dave thought about setting
the department store on fire.

902
01:19:45,929 --> 01:19:49,264
So that they can claim
a substantial amount of money

903
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,858
from the insurance company

904
01:19:50,883 --> 01:19:55,053
amounting to 250 million pesos.

905
01:19:57,067 --> 01:20:00,172
That's where I come in.
So no one will notice.

906
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,115
I will sneak into the audit department

907
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:08,562
and burn all the important documents
and files on the computers.

908
01:20:09,188 --> 01:20:10,189
By doing so,

909
01:20:10,397 --> 01:20:16,264
all evidence and documents that prove the
company's going bankrupt will be destroyed.

910
01:20:16,424 --> 01:20:18,468
And there's one more
thing Dave wanted me to do.

911
01:20:18,951 --> 01:20:25,053
He will send me the combinations of
all their safes in the Finance department.

912
01:20:25,318 --> 01:20:29,625
All of the department store's
daily earnings

913
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:33,803
are kept there for a week before
being deposited in the bank.

914
01:20:35,586 --> 01:20:40,739
So while we were at the resort,
Dave taught me how to open a safe.

915
01:20:41,133 --> 01:20:45,334
I studied the rotation of the combination
over and over again

916
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:47,111
until I perfected it.

917
01:20:47,263 --> 01:20:50,030
Every part of the plan has
been laid out meticulously.

918
01:20:50,055 --> 01:20:52,850
Even my death in the fire.

919
01:20:55,463 --> 01:20:57,490
Do you recognize this ID and wallet?

920
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:59,193
Could you please identify?

921
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:05,108
Yes, it's--

922
01:21:06,107 --> 01:21:09,029
This is Jessica Fajardo. Ica.

923
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:13,698
She's one of my tenants here.
For five years now.

924
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,696
Ms. Macatangay,

925
01:21:16,179 --> 01:21:17,638
we found her body
at the burned down

926
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:21,311
Davidson Department Store last Tuesday.

927
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,122
Her face was almost unrecognizable

928
01:21:24,716 --> 01:21:26,094
due to the fire.

929
01:21:26,658 --> 01:21:33,060
We recovered only these IDs
and her wallet to help identify her.

930
01:21:36,043 --> 01:21:41,798
I'm really sorry,
but Ms. Jessica Fajardo is gone.

931
01:21:47,048 --> 01:21:49,373
What are you saying?

932
01:21:52,631 --> 01:21:54,654
Ica...

933
01:21:57,627 --> 01:22:00,004
Ica...

934
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:09,864
You know,
I will miss you so much.

935
01:22:10,496 --> 01:22:12,373
I'm getting so antsy.

936
01:22:13,218 --> 01:22:16,388
A bit nervous and unsure.
Mixed emotions.

937
01:22:17,615 --> 01:22:19,075
Why should you be nervous?

938
01:22:20,256 --> 01:22:21,303
You did great!

939
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:26,614
Once the insurance company's
certification is issued,

940
01:22:27,646 --> 01:22:29,231
after the investigation,

941
01:22:30,218 --> 01:22:32,721
my father can claim 250 Million.

942
01:22:34,452 --> 01:22:35,620
So let's celebrate!

943
01:22:48,185 --> 01:22:50,178
Let's celebrate!

944
01:22:50,672 --> 01:22:52,597
- Congrats!
- Congrats!

945
01:23:06,219 --> 01:23:08,138
The money's in the room,
by the way.

946
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:11,359
I didn't touch it.
Not a single cent.

947
01:23:12,981 --> 01:23:14,022
That's yours.

948
01:23:16,023 --> 01:23:18,693
Use the money to
create a new life.

949
01:23:20,571 --> 01:23:21,865
It's all mine?

950
01:23:23,384 --> 01:23:24,510
Thanks, Dave!

951
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:29,150
I can finally see my father
and pay off all my debts.

952
01:23:30,045 --> 01:23:31,098
Thank you.

953
01:23:31,471 --> 01:23:32,722
I love you, Dave.

954
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:46,574
After this,

955
01:23:48,699 --> 01:23:50,409
we can't see each
other anymore.

956
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,139
Why?

957
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:57,611
We have to end this.

958
01:23:58,831 --> 01:24:01,708
For your safety
and for my family.

959
01:24:04,866 --> 01:24:06,868
Nobody can know
that you're still alive.

960
01:24:08,581 --> 01:24:10,624
Nobody can know about us.

961
01:24:15,858 --> 01:24:16,920
I'm getting married.

962
01:24:19,732 --> 01:24:22,234
You know how it is.
Papa's Chinese.

963
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:42,169
Use the money to carve
a new life for yourself.

964
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:51,341
Just make sure no one can know
about what we did, okay?

965
01:24:59,056 --> 01:25:00,433
How stupid can I get?

966
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,678
How could I even think
I'd have a chance with Dave?

967
01:25:04,282 --> 01:25:07,076
I'm nothing but a lowly saleslady.

968
01:25:08,547 --> 01:25:10,382
But thanks anyway, Dave.

969
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,948
You became the instrument
with which I can change my life.

970
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:18,513
I will never forget you.

971
01:25:18,992 --> 01:25:24,456
And on this day, I will surrender
my heart and soul to you completely.

972
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:22,187
San Felipe! San Felipe!

973
01:29:22,212 --> 01:29:24,152
It's leaving! More spots left!

974
01:29:24,177 --> 01:29:26,620
San Felipe! San Felipe!

975
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:29,164
San Felipe! Come on in!

976
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:35,504
San Felipe! San Felipe!

977
01:29:35,529 --> 01:29:43,699
San Felipe! Few spots left!

978
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:25,341
Celia!

979
01:30:27,834 --> 01:30:28,919
Celia!

980
01:30:29,109 --> 01:30:30,555
- Coming!
- Damn it!

981
01:30:31,087 --> 01:30:32,922
- Come quickly!
- Yes! We'll be right there!

982
01:30:32,947 --> 01:30:35,199
- Goddamnit! I'm exhausted!
- Here we are!

983
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:39,127
- Ica!
- Ma!

984
01:30:39,877 --> 01:30:41,795
Come out immediately
when I call for you!

985
01:30:41,897 --> 01:30:44,358
Yes, I know.
We're here. Ica!

986
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:47,566
There. Grab the rope.

987
01:30:48,574 --> 01:30:49,784
Then pull.

988
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:51,414
Yes. Okay.

989
01:30:52,175 --> 01:30:55,402
- One. Two. Three.
- Many years ago,

990
01:30:55,427 --> 01:30:57,878
Uncle Ruel came
home one night,

991
01:30:58,155 --> 01:31:01,682
and he brought with him three corpses
wrapped in burlap.

992
01:31:02,267 --> 01:31:04,839
Yes, dead people.

993
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:08,934
Uncle Ruel worked
as a hired killer.

994
01:31:09,276 --> 01:31:12,196
He gets paid to kill people.

995
01:31:12,248 --> 01:31:14,206
And to get rid of the evidence,

996
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,160
he will remove the bodies
from the scene

997
01:31:16,185 --> 01:31:17,933
and bring them home to us.

998
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:19,543
It's part of the fee.

999
01:31:20,748 --> 01:31:25,550
And my mother and I would
dispose of the bodies.

1000
01:31:26,056 --> 01:31:30,352
That's been our life since
mom left my father Dado.

1001
01:31:30,686 --> 01:31:32,191
Mom cheated on him

1002
01:31:32,624 --> 01:31:35,808
probably because of all the hunger
and hardships we endured.

1003
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:37,788
Pretty soon she was
switching lovers,

1004
01:31:38,673 --> 01:31:41,092
and Uncle Ruel was one of them.

1005
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:43,582
And what's even more painful

1006
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:46,643
is that she took me with her
to go live with her new man.

1007
01:31:46,718 --> 01:31:49,050
I hated my mother!

1008
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:53,035
But there was nothing
I could do as a child.

1009
01:33:11,595 --> 01:33:13,180
No, please!

1010
01:33:24,448 --> 01:33:28,092
And my mother didn't rescue me!

1011
01:33:28,117 --> 01:33:31,394
She let a dragon devour me
in that shanty that night.

1012
01:33:33,877 --> 01:33:36,316
When suddenly,
my protector came barging in!

1013
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:39,261
You son of a bitch!
Let go of my daughter!

1014
01:33:46,272 --> 01:33:47,482
You bastard!

1015
01:33:57,158 --> 01:33:58,257
Son of a bitch!

1016
01:33:58,282 --> 01:33:59,324
Dado!

1017
01:34:00,003 --> 01:34:03,271
Why are you--
Get out of here!

1018
01:34:03,316 --> 01:34:05,735
You shit! Leave us alone!

1019
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,844
You bastard.

1020
01:34:07,032 --> 01:34:08,066
Ruel!

1021
01:34:08,091 --> 01:34:09,488
You think you can
just walk in here?

1022
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,172
- You son of a bitch.
- Ruel! Don't! Ruel!

1023
01:34:11,197 --> 01:34:12,303
Asshole!

1024
01:34:12,328 --> 01:34:13,347
Take this!

1025
01:34:20,066 --> 01:34:21,243
Shit!

1026
01:34:25,027 --> 01:34:26,711
Ica, stop!

1027
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:29,745
Ica!

1028
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,152
Stop! Stop, Ica!

1029
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:34,527
Come here.

1030
01:34:34,552 --> 01:34:37,199
Give me the knife.
Let go! Let go of it!

1031
01:34:37,635 --> 01:34:40,839
Listen to me.
Darling, listen to me.

1032
01:34:40,954 --> 01:34:43,097
You didn't kill them, okay?

1033
01:34:44,132 --> 01:34:47,480
Goddamnit, Ica.
You're just a child!

1034
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:51,753
Listen to me carefully.

1035
01:34:51,778 --> 01:34:53,878
It was me!
I killed them.

1036
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:56,245
I killed them!

1037
01:34:56,495 --> 01:34:58,496
I killed them!

1038
01:34:59,142 --> 01:35:00,535
Not you.

1039
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,686
Dad!

1040
01:35:04,096 --> 01:35:05,351
Dad!

1041
01:35:06,227 --> 01:35:07,604
Find me.

1042
01:35:08,628 --> 01:35:10,005
Yes, Dad.

1043
01:35:15,433 --> 01:35:17,929
Dad, be careful.

1044
01:35:18,763 --> 01:35:20,140
Find me.

1045
01:35:21,581 --> 01:35:23,435
Yes, Dad.

1046
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:26,696
There, there.
Don't worry.

1047
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:29,308
I'll take you to your relatives.
Do you know where they are?

1048
01:35:31,213 --> 01:35:33,780
I have no relatives here.

1049
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:38,105
I have no family left.

1050
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:43,202
Go ahead.
You can go.

1051
01:35:45,305 --> 01:35:48,495
Roman took advantage
of my innocence.

1052
01:35:48,623 --> 01:35:51,646
Placing my life in
his hands that day,

1053
01:35:52,088 --> 01:35:54,816
was as good as resigning
my soul to the devil

1054
01:35:55,304 --> 01:35:58,515
to be sunk deeper into hell.

1055
01:36:08,038 --> 01:36:10,165
Hello, Ica. You've been calling me
nonstop since last night.

1056
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:11,483
Can you stop pestering me?

1057
01:36:12,431 --> 01:36:14,519
Huh? What do you want?

1058
01:36:15,233 --> 01:36:16,860
Are you in San Felipe yet?

1059
01:36:16,885 --> 01:36:19,262
Damn you, Roman.
I'm just making sure.

1060
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:22,790
I'll be in San Felipe soon.

1061
01:36:23,312 --> 01:36:26,482
I paid you the one million.
Did you receive it?

1062
01:36:27,107 --> 01:36:32,529
You'd better make sure you gave me
the right address to find my dad.

1063
01:36:34,187 --> 01:36:38,275
If not, I'll come back for you
and make you pay!

1064
01:36:39,826 --> 01:36:41,244
You talk big now, huh?

1065
01:36:41,611 --> 01:36:44,558
Hey. We've got nothing to do with
each other now, you understand?

1066
01:36:44,593 --> 01:36:46,453
So don’t call me again.

1067
01:36:46,478 --> 01:36:47,785
Got it? You bitch.

1068
01:36:47,862 --> 01:36:49,781
Screw you. Asshole!

1069
01:37:31,871 --> 01:37:33,873
- Good day, sir.
- Good day to you too.

1070
01:37:33,898 --> 01:37:35,792
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure.

1071
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:39,228
- Let's check the bag first.
- Go ahead.

1072
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,010
The chief is over there.

1073
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,289
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning too, miss.

1074
01:37:57,314 --> 01:37:58,898
Can I ask you something.

1075
01:37:58,923 --> 01:38:00,089
Sure, what is it?

1076
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:03,878
I'm looking
for Diosdado Fajardo.

1077
01:38:04,447 --> 01:38:07,464
Ah, Dado!
Yes, I know him!

1078
01:38:08,059 --> 01:38:09,227
He's a very nice man.

1079
01:38:09,796 --> 01:38:11,506
He has plenty of friends here.

1080
01:38:11,531 --> 01:38:15,347
Because he's kind and we
take good care of him here.

1081
01:38:17,303 --> 01:38:19,054
- Really?
- Absolutely.

1082
01:38:19,503 --> 01:38:21,652
All the prisoners here
know him.

1083
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:23,490
I would like to meet him, sir.

1084
01:38:23,642 --> 01:38:24,893
Haven't you heard?

1085
01:38:26,633 --> 01:38:30,678
During the pandemic, many prisoners
were hit by the virus.

1086
01:38:31,592 --> 01:38:33,052
Dado was one of them.

1087
01:38:33,671 --> 01:38:35,715
Sir? Where is he now?

1088
01:38:36,230 --> 01:38:37,302
He's already gone.

1089
01:38:38,796 --> 01:38:41,924
His body was cremated immediately
because that's strict policy at the time.

1090
01:38:43,616 --> 01:38:46,121
Can you tell me your name
so I can find it in our files?

1091
01:38:47,531 --> 01:38:49,784
Miss? What's your name?

1092
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:55,375
I'll leave you here for now, Miss.
I'll look for his files in the office.

1093
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,746
Are you Jacob?

1094
01:39:53,771 --> 01:39:54,824
I am.

1095
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,909
You were supposed
to be here hours ago.

1096
01:39:57,934 --> 01:39:59,310
I didn't know it was in
the middle of nowhere.

1097
01:39:59,335 --> 01:40:01,254
We've been going in circles
trying to find this place.

1098
01:40:16,471 --> 01:40:17,535
Is that him?

1099
01:40:17,759 --> 01:40:19,719
Yeah. Where's my money?

1100
01:40:21,601 --> 01:40:22,936
Here.

1101
01:40:28,406 --> 01:40:29,425
Thanks.

1102
01:40:33,163 --> 01:40:34,644
I'll dispose of it.
