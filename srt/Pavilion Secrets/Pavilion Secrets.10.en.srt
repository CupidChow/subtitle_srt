(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 10=

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,319
Not even going to put up a tombstone?

5
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,000
A handful of earth facing the sky.

6
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,879
He lived a carefree life.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,896
He doesn't need these things.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,959
It's getting late.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,360
Let's go back.

10
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:19,728
I want to stay with him a little longer.

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,416
When a person dies,
it's like a lamp going out.

12
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:24,992
There's no need to grieve excessively.

13
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:27,680
Aren't you curious

14
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:29,440
about what really happened?

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,599
No.

16
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,016
You're hiding something from me.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,760
No.

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,199
He had a lingering illness.

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,879
Even if he hadn't been injured here,

20
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,952
he would have had
at most half a year left.

21
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,480
So his death

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,336
has nothing to do with you.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,559
That's not what I'm asking.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,128
If you won't tell me, fine.

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
(Why does Su Shan
have a portrait of my auntie?)

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,759
(Wait.)

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,240
(The woman in this painting
looks like my auntie,)

28
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,992
(but her demeanor is different.)

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,639
Lunch is ready.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm restless.

31
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:46,630
I don't feel like eating.

32
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,320
Well,

33
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,759
I'll ask Liu Su to prepare
some mung bean soup.

34
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,119
I don't want green.

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,039
Well...

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,839
Lotus seed soup?

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,839
Plum jelly?

38
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,360
Lotus seed soup with ice.

39
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,199
Okay.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,216
Why are you so kind to me?

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,199
Preparing meals is normal.

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Answer me.

43
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,360
Professionally,

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,199
I'm your retainer.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,679
Personally,

46
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,279
I admire you.

47
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,240
It's only natural to be kind to you.

48
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,839
(You're still lying to me.)

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,639
General!

50
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,456
(Daily Life Record of Yun Yin)

51
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,440
What's this?

52
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,399
This is from Mr. Su.

53
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,664
He risked his life to break into the
Peach Blossom Hut and bring it to me.

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Mr. Su!

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Mr. Su!

56
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,520
Are you okay?

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,880
You finally showed up.

58
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,039
Why did you ask me to come here?

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,110
(Daily Life Record of Yun Yin)

60
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,040
Keep it safe.

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
What is this?

62
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,799
It's something very important to you.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,399
Mr. Su!

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,399
I can't be saved.

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,799
What happened?

66
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Who hurt you?

67
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,519
No one hurt me.

68
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,160
It's just that my time

69
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,160
has come.

70
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,040
Mr. Su!

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,239
Mr. Su!

72
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:50,480
Mr. Su!

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,760
This contains

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,920
letters from a couple,

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
various mechanical blueprints

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,056
and the mundane details
of a pregnant woman's life.

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,839
You're his adopted son.

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,440
Why did he risk
his life to retrieve this

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,079
and give it to me instead of you?

80
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,839
Is this related to my origins?

81
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,839
I won't tell you

82
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,239
for your own good.

83
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,040
Not knowing where you came from,

84
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,799
your home,

85
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,600
and your parents!

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
How can that be good?

87
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,880
Alright.

88
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,160
You're a descendant of the Mo family.

89
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,600
This journal

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
was left to you by your mother.

91
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:33,952
I don't believe you.

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,679
The peach blossom mark on your back

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,160
is also evidence.

94
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,600
A birthmark could just be a coincidence.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,320
You've seen the portrait too.

96
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,880
The woman in it is named Yun Yin,

97
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:45,670
the twin sister of Imperial Consort Yun

98
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,480
and your mother!

99
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,496
Look at the eyes and eyebrows,
do they resemble yours?

100
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,640
Similar eyes and eyebrows
don't prove anything.

101
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Let me ask you.

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,480
Did you hate taking medicine as a child?

103
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,560
Every time you took medicine,

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,799
you needed to eat candied plums

105
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,320
from the Wang family on East Street.

106
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,559
How do you know that?

107
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,880
It's all written in this journal.

108
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,799
When you were young,

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,192
you hated the bitterness of medicine.

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,679
Your mother would go to the Wang's

111
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,544
to buy candied plums
to help you take it.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,559
Though the plums were sour,

113
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,839
you loved them.

114
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,320
In summer,

115
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,576
you loved lotus seeds.

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,239
Ms. Yun would carefully
remove the bitter lotus hearts

117
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:21,959
for you to enjoy.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,839
Ms. Yun?

119
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,232
When I was young,
I was your father's apprentice.

120
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,160
Back then,

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,359
we were like siblings.

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,959
When did you recognize me?

123
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,064
At the Hongxiu Pavilion.

124
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,472
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

125
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,760
It's useless.

126
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,720
You had lost your memory.

127
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,920
You didn't remember
anything from back then.

128
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,640
Whether it's parental love

129
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,600
or the pain of losing your family,
it's all in the past now.

130
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,789
Knowing it would
only bring you more trouble.

131
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,216
It's better for you not to remember.

132
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,959
But...

133
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,839
But they were rebels.

134
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,119
Accusations can be made without reason.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,239
You also researched the secrets

136
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,359
of the Mo family.

137
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,880
Did you find anything weird?

138
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Even if they were rebels,

139
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,440
they were still your parents.

140
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,519
Yun Shu...

141
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,559
I need some time alone.

142
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,832
(There are two jars of wine
under the peach tree.)

143
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,640
(We buried them together long ago.)

144
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,279
(We agreed)

145
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,839
(to open them on the day I passed)

146
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,640
(my master's exam.)

147
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,440
(The seal)

148
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:48,320
(has your name on it.)

149
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,390
(Shu, Mo)

150
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,440
Mo. Shu.

151
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,399
Yun Shu from the Mo family.

152
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,040
So this really is my home.

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,280
Mo Shu is not the Yun Shu
of the Mo family.

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,359
It's Shen Mo and Yun Shu.

155
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,359
What should I write?

156
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,840
Just our names.

157
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,559
Look, I've written it.

158
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:43,960
Jesus. You wrote it wrong.

159
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,648
It's not the "Mo" from the Mo family.

160
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:48,479
Let's just go with it then.

161
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,919
Ten years from now,

162
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,919
we'll dig up this wine again.

163
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,599
Whoever doesn't come is a dog.

164
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,159
Whoever doesn't come is a dog.

165
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,239
Mo...

166
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,679
What did you

167
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,239
call me?

168
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,840
Why can't I remember

169
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,840
things from the past?

170
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,559
Yun Shu,

171
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,320
from now on,

172
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,039
you're a boy.

173
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,679
This is your home now.

174
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,799
And I'm your auntie.

175
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,039
And also,

176
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,039
if you can't remember

177
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,640
what happened in the past,

178
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,728
let's just forget about it.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,640
Okay?

180
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,039
(Shu'er is sick
and won't take her medicine.)

181
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,679
(Fortunately, I prepared some)

182
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,119
(Wang's candied plums.)

183
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,520
(My hands are swollen
from peeling lotus seeds all day.)

184
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,400
(But seeing Shu'er enjoy them,)

185
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
(my heart is filled with joy.)

186
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,320
Spending so much money,

187
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,520
only for it to go to waste.

188
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,239
Such a waste.

189
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,599
General,

190
