=Pavilion Secrets=

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,350
(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 12=

4
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,040
You concealed your identity
and approached me.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,200
What is your true purpose?

6
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,280
If you don't tell me,

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,520
I'll beat you until you talk.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,200
Shu!

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,256
Your body hasn't recovered yet.
Don't exert yourself.

10
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:28,272
I hid it because I was afraid
you'd hate me.

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,840
Because the reason
behind the Mo family's downfall

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
is connected to me.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,280
The Mo family's influence in the world
even made the imperial court tremble.

14
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,200
As I grew closer to the Mo family,

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,759
accusations

16
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,919
and slanders followed.

17
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:52,040
The Mo family
and the deposed Crown Prince Shen Mo

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,910
are honest
with no intention of rebellion.

19
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:55,040
His Majesty believed rumors

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,759
and was suspicious.

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,119
If he wants to investigate, do it.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,240
Ms. Yun, you've misunderstood.

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,639
We didn't come on behalf of His Majesty.

24
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,800
(The Arsenal Valley has been
heavily surrounded by troops.)

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,800
(My father said)

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,168
(he must find evidence
before convicting anyone.)

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,919
(But those below him all know)

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,944
(that this case must be an ironclad one.)

29
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,559
(I never expected)

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,768
(that there would be
a massive fire that day.)

31
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,599
Later, I miraculously escaped

32
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,040
with the help of my personal guards.

33
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,760
But I couldn't bring you out.

34
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,189
So you knew from the beginning

35
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,304
that I was your junior sister?

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,919
No.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,319
I approached you

38
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,816
to investigate the truth
behind the Mo family's case.

39
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,360
Eunuch Zhang was one

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,519
of the arsonists from that.

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,040
(So,)

42
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,480
(I really misunderstood him.)

43
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,480
Don't worry.
I'll see this through to the end.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,319
I'll clear the Mo family's name.

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,479
General Yun,

46
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,320
did you come down here
to be a snail girl?

47
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,679
Excuse me.

48
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,320
Although I dressed as a woman that day

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
at the Hongxiu Pavilion,

50
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,479
I'm still a man.

51
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:44,624
Please have some self-respect.

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
Man?

53
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,279
But I have never seen

54
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,279
such a handsome man.

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,039
General,

56
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,160
are you actually a woman
disguised as a man?

57
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:01,000
If you dare talk nonsense,

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll cut out your tongue.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,320
I'm so scared.

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,039
Unreasonable.

61
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,039
Stop looking.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,320
Your junior sister sent it.

63
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,279
You saw it?

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,399
Not only did I see it,
but I also flirted with her.

65
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,000
I think

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,960
she must be in love with you.

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,000
Nonsense.

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,399
Between me and her,

69
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,360
it's purely the bond
of elder and younger siblings.

70
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,880
She's even cooking for you now.

71
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,000
Still siblings?

72
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,839
A bowl of pear soup

73
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,119
is nothing.

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,440
If you don't believe,

75
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,839
why not cooperate with me
to perform a duet?

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,720
Then everything will be clear.

77
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,720
Alright, let's talk about the matter.

78
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,440
The spy in the palace
sent a message saying

79
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:58,880
that after Yun Shu met
with Imperial Consort Yun,

80
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,080
Imperial Consort Yun
personally strangled a maid.

81
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,160
Imperial Consort Yun
is always kind and compassionate.

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,479
She doesn't seem like a ruthless person.

83
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,839
It's all for Yun Shu.

84
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,199
After killing the maid, it's said

85
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,839
she cried all night under the covers.

86
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
Now, he won't think
my complexion is bad, right?

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,799
Forget it.

88
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,640
I'm wearing men's clothes today.

89
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,079
General, once Liu Su finishes packing,

90
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,279
we can set out.

91
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:15,100
Why hasn't she returned
to the Pavilion yet?

92
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,239
Who?

93
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,160
You mean Madam Meng?

94
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,949
She's been pestering
Master Song these days.

95
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,072
She even said she wants
to come with us to the mansion.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,119
You don't want to know

97
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,959
if Yun Shu has feelings for you?

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,519
Listen to me. Don't move.

99
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,239
Don't wait.

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Let's go.

101
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,079
Not waiting?

102
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,559
They're in love over there.

103
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,279
What am I waiting for?

104
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,760
What about them...?

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,440
Let them catch up.

106
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:07,456
(General's Mansion)

107
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,160
Qian Yan,

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
didn't I say I didn't
want to see him again?

109
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,119
General...

110
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,880
I...

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,559
Qian Yan!

112
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll show him what for later.

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Alright.

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,920
What did I do wrong?

115
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,760
I'll apologize to you, okay?

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm not angry.

117
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,200
How dare I be angry with you,
Master Song?

118
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,480
(You're indeed angry.)

119
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,119
I'm the General
and you're the deposed Crown Prince.

120
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,480
If people find out that you're

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,839
living and eating in my mansion,

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,079
it'll be a death sentence
for both of us.

123
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,839
I told you

124
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,200
that I'm here to help you.

125
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,669
You can't help me

126
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,696
with what I'm about to do.

127
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,480
How can't I help you?

128
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
Since I took charge of the Pavilion,

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
I've had people secretly
investigate that matter.

130
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,359
I'm just like you,

131
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,888
wanting to know the truth of that year.

132
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,720
What about Madam Meng?

133
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,679
She was the fiancée of one
of my personal soldiers.

134
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
That soldier died protecting me,

135
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
so she's stayed by my side ever since.

136
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,720
I've always treated her like a sister.

137
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,640
(Sister?)

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480
What are you staring at? Eat.

139
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,000
Alright.

140
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,640
Master,

141
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,239
what are you eating?

142
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,839
