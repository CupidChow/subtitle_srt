=Episode 18=

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,399
Corrupt the imperial harem.

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,959
The crime deserves death.

6
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,079
Shen Lan, do you want to die?

7
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:27,319
Fine.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,399
Let everyone see

9
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:31,079
how I corrupt the imperial harem.

10
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:35,000
Then I can die with you.

11
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,200
You're afraid?

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,200
How could you be afraid?

13
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,839
Haven't you been using my feelings

14
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,400
to protect Yun Shu?

15
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:09,800
I have maternal feelings for you.

16
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,400
Absolutely no improper thoughts.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,639
My father hasn't
summoned you in a long time.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,919
Lonely in the deep palace.

19
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,839
I don't believe
you've never thought of me.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,879
You're crazy!

21
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:32,879
I am crazy!

22
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:33,630
If I'm not, how

23
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,550
could I've been obsessed
with you for so many years?

24
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,680
Like a puppet, manipulated by you.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,599
Working hard for Yun Shu.

26
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,519
So you hate Yun Shu?

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,360
I don't hate her.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm even grateful to her.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,080
Without her,

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,000
you wouldn't even look at me.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,519
But

32
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,599
she's been quite a nuisance lately.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,559
Lan'er,

34
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,839
I beg you,

35
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,559
please spare Yun Shu, okay?

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,639
She's my only concern

37
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,240
in this world.

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Please, Lan'er.

39
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,800
Lan'er, look at me.

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,440
I'll do anything you want.

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,919
Really.

42
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,520
One day,

43
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,320
I'll make you willingly submit to me.

44
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,479
No!

45
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,360
Shen Lan!

46
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,800
Shen Lan!

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Send the imperial physician
to examine her wound.

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,416
(Crown Prince of Xi framed the head
of the Thousand Machines Pavilion.)

49
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,679
General's figure

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,559
is truly that of a woman.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,559
Silly! Look at you!

52
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,440
Everyone can see it except you.

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,720
What?

54
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm a lady.

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,199
Does it disappoint you?

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,919
No, no, no.

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,399
Instead, I admire you even more.

58
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,320
You're truly a heroine among women.

59
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,279
A valiant woman warrior.

60
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,279
Stop flattering and keep pasting.

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,320
General,

62
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,720
will this work?

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,639
(Crown Prince of Xi)

64
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,310
(abuses public power.)
Just by pasting these,

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,839
claiming that Master Song was imprisoned
by Crown Prince in revenge,

66
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,639
will this save him?

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,360
The truth doesn't matter.

68
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,960
His Majesty cares most
about public opinion.

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,559
If we stir up a storm of rumors

70
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,600
and cause panic,

71
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,000
he will have to consider
the will of the people.

72
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,199
Our undercover agents

73
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,960
in the court have also sent word

74
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,550
that His Majesty
has issued an oral edict

75
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,024
to personally interrogate Master Song.

76
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,119
It's not enough.

77
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,160
They are the main attraction.

78
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,640
Can you help me read what this says?

79
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,880
Don't bother.

80
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,200
It's definitely about
His Highness's petty grudges

81
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,710
and his persecution of Song Huanbei.

82
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,920
These days, the city is filled
with nothing but this.

83
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,559
I heard that recently,

84
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,600
many people have
been arrested for talking

85
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,870
about His Highness behind his back.

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,959
Just walking along,

87
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,519
a sack suddenly fell from the sky

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,279
and they were beaten up.

89
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,079
Please spare us, sir!

90
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,440
Stop! Please spare us!

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,359
Stop!

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,829
Let us go!

93
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,870
Dare you speak ill of His Highness
behind his back?

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,168
Do you know what crime that is?

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you His Highness's men?

96
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,440
Well...

97
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:10,839
Please forgive us.

98
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,200
We will never do it again.

99
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,069
Never again.

100
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,730
Your Highness,

101
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,279
what do you...

102
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,399
Kill them

103
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,656
and sink them.

104
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Your Highness, please spare us.

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,440
My mistake...

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,519
Your Highness, it's not a big deal.

107
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,320
I think a beating will do.

108
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,519
If we kill them,

109
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,720
we have to dispose the bodies.

110
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,880
Then scram!

111
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,509
Did you hear that?

112
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,800
His Highness told you to scram!

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,559
Your Highness, thank you!

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,239
Shen Lan never imagined

115
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:52,040
his reputation would
be destroyed like this.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Eighty-seven now.

117
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,359
Dawn is breaking soon.

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,320
Let's go back.

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,359
Multiple assault cases outside

120
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,760
are now attributed to you.

121
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,350
There's a lot of public outrage now.

122
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:15,040
Even His Majesty
has been informed of this.

123
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,608
He wants you to release Song Huanbei.

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,799
Your Highness,

125
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,519
should I clarify these rumors?

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,959
My father doesn't care about the truth.

127
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,239
He just wants an obedient son.

128
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,480
Order the imperial dungeon

129
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,920
to release Song Huanbei immediately.

130
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,464
I'm afraid he won't come out willingly.

131
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,399
Do I have to beg him to come out?

132
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,959
Excellent maneuver, Master Song.

133
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,880
Just one meeting with my father,

134
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,600
and you've turned things around.

135
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,000
All thanks to His Majesty's
esteemed reputation

136
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,160
and Your Highness's mercy.

137
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,399
When have I been merciful to you?

138
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,799
If it weren't for the fact

139
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,000
that you didn't stab me
to death back then,

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,920
even with all my skills,

141
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,456
I wouldn't have been able to use them.

142
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,079
You can leave here now.

143
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,440
My legs are numb.

144
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,559
Give me a hand,

145
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,239
Your Highness.

146
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,440
(Wait and see.)

147
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,600
(I'll flay you alive sooner or later.)

148
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,920
By the grace of Heaven
and the Emperor's edict,

149
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:34,640
Yun Shu, concealing her female identity,

150
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,320
wielded military power
and discussed state affairs,

151
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,039
deceiving the Emperor
and deserving death.

152
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,520
However, considering her
ten years of military service

153
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,400
and her contributions,

154
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,239
Yun Shu's death sentence is commuted.

155
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,640
She is stripped of her rank as General.

156
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,000
She is ordered to reflect on her actions

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,239
and not betray the Emperor's kindness.

158
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,679
It is so decreed.
