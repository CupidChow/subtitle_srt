(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 7=

4
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,159
General, look!

5
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,119
I got him!

6
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:39,360
You sent someone to follow me?

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,479
So what?

8
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,360
If I didn't do it,

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
I wouldn't know you're two-faced.

10
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:46,880
It's not poison.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,632
Even on your deathbed,
you're still stubborn.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
I clearly saw you take the box.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,840
Then what did my master do

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
after that? You saw it?

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,919
Master Song, what do you think?

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,632
Your Highness,
what do you expect me to...?

17
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,680
Kill Yun Shu

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,440
to prove your loyalty.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,879
I knew you had ulterior motives.

20
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,839
Kill or not kill?

21
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:18,440
It's up to you.

22
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,919
Killing Yun Shu

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,720
would put you in a position of dishonor.

24
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,160
I won't do

25
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,519
such things.

26
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,239
Yun Shu has contributed greatly to Xi.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,000
If I were to kill her on your behalf,

28
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,160
what would people say about you?

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,680
Imperial Consort Yun
treats Yun Shu very well.

30
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,040
If I were to kill Yun Shu for you,

31
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,559
your relationship with
Imperial Consort Yun would be severed.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,440
Besides...

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,879
What else?

34
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,360
Besides,

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
Yun Shu is the most
important person in my life.

36
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,919
I will never let Yun Shu get hurt.

37
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,000
Smooth-talking.

38
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,000
Exactly!

39
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,160
Smooth-talking.

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,112
Who knows if you're making
up lies to deceive us.

41
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,360
Won't you ever stop?

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
I'm fine, see?

43
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,160
You all, leave.

44
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,280
Is there anything else to explain?

45
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,880
This is a sleeping potion.

46
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,904
I was afraid you wouldn't sleep well,
so I stole it from my foster father.

47
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,360
As a head...

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,160
Stealing?

49
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,360
Right.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,399
General!

51
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,720
It's Mengmeng's letter
from Thousand Machines Pavilion.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Thank you.

53
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,320
(General, Thousand Machines Pavilion
is interesting.)

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,320
(I've learned a lot here.)

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,768
What do you mean, Sir?

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,592
I'm bored. Let's have a sparring match.

57
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,559
Yun Shu!

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,399
Yun Shu, are you okay?

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,880
Hey!

60
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,039
What are you doing?

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
Ungrateful.

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,559
Try using your internal energy.

63
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,000
Toxic heat accumulation.

64
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,119
Use your internal energy

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,759
to forcibly suppress it.

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,399
It may alleviate the pain temporarily,

67
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,320
but over time,
it will block your meridians.

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,800
I just opened up two
of her main acupoints.

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,399
She should feel much better now.

70
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,160
That's right.

71
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,239
You said yesterday
you wouldn't save her.

72
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,200
Who saved her?

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,959
I didn't save her.

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,359
It was just a sparring match.

75
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,600
Just a sparring match.

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,360
If it's broken, discard it.

77
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:39,600
Here you are.

78
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,839
For me?

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,519
As an apology

80
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,320
for what I said that day.

81
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,239
But

82
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,959
you said that day

83
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,760
this was for your crush.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,350
I'll give it to you first.

85
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,200
When I meet my crush,

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
I'll buy a new one for her.

87
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,079
Okay.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,480
Thanks.

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,359
Last night,

90
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,279
I don't know which rascal

91
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,480
snuck into my pharmacy again
to steal medicine.

92
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,600
What do you mean by stealing?

93
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
You're my foster father.

94
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,640
She is the girl

95
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,119
from the Mo family,

96
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,160
right?

97
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,079
Should I put these away?

98
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,679
Or

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,399
should I take...

100
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,720
She's Mo Wanshu,

101
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:43,920
right?

102
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,279
Yes.

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
I knew it.

104
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,440
I was right!

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
Heaven has eyes.

106
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,200
Finally, the Mo family has an heir.

107
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,440
You little rascal!

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,399
Why did you keep this from me?

109
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,959
In your eyes,

110
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,679
am I

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
so unreliable?

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,559
The more people know,
the more danger there is.

113
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,399
For such a big matter,

114
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,880
I was only protecting her.

115
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,119
You're right.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,839
Well...

117
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,600
She's lost her memory now,

118
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,079
and doesn't know her background?

119
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,359
Not knowing is good too.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,279
Let that fire

121
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,160
be extinguished twelve years ago.

122
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,760
The Mo family has an heir.

123
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
What are you doing?

124
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:46,200
Sir,

125
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,648
what's wrong with your eyes?

126
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,920
It's nothing. Just the sand
got in my eyes.

127
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,200
(But there's no wind.)

128
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,959
Actually, I came

129
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,959
to ask you for a favor.

130
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,000
Tell me.

131
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,279
I was wondering if you have a method

132
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,799
to treat nightmares and palpitations.

133
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,200
Palpitations?

134
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,959
Well...

135
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,760
Wait a moment.

136
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,600
This

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,768
is effective for palpitations.

138
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,320
Take it.

139
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,839
What's this?

140
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
This is a Bloody Lingzhi.

141
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,239
Only he has this in the world.

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,320
It's one of a kind.

143
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,600
It's just an ordinary herb.

144
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Well...

145
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,959
Keeping it won't make

146
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,839
any more herbs, right?

147
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,480
Thank you, Sir.

148
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,359
Take your time!

149
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,640
Hey,

150
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,359
I feel like you're nicer
to her than to me.

151
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,920
Are you jealous?

152
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,320
Jealous of what?

153
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,839
Get to work.

154
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,000
We need to dry all of these properly.

155
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,040
Auntie!

156
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,000
Shu'er.

157
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,720
Guess what good thing I brought you.

158
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,239
What good thing?

159
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,880
This Bloody Lingzhi
promotes peaceful sleep.

160
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,359
It's the best cure for your nightmares.

161
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,959
This medicine...

162
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,479
Where did you get it from?

163
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
A wandering physician.

164
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,719
(Bloody Lingzhi is a rare medicine,)

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,679
(only possessed by Su Shan,
the physician of the Mo family.)

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,200
(Could it be...)

167
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:47,239
How old is this physician, then?

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,799
He's...

169
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,359
In his fifties, I think.

170
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,080
(If Su Shan hadn't died back then,)

171
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,000
(he'd be around fifty now.)

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,640
Shu'er,

173
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,719
do you remember what he looked like?

174
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,719
His appearance...

175
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:01,799
Why do you ask, Auntie?

176
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,119
Shu'er,

177
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:03,880
I...

178
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:05,520
Are you afraid I'll be deceived?

179
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,200
Don't worry. This medicine
is definitely genuine.

180
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
I know.

181
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,080
(Could it really be him?)

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,640
Please wait.

183
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:28,410
An appointment with an old friend.

184
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,640
Hey, don't get in the way.

185
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,559
Take a look at this.

186
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,736
