00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,350
(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 26=

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
His Majesty...

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,559
You killed His Majesty.

6
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:26,520
You've killed two birds
with one stone, huh?

7
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,360
Guards!

8
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:34,439
Song Huanbei assassinated the Emperor.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,400
Arrest him!

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,879
Yun Shu,

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,120
I know you're deeply in love
with Song Huanbei,

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,456
but Song Huanbei
assassinated the Emperor.

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,800
That's a crime that extends
to his entire clan.

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,680
Think it through carefully.

15
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,352
Are you still going to protect him?

16
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,680
Accusations

17
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,839
can be fabricated.

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,000
It was just him
and my father in the study.

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,048
Could it be that my father
committed suicide?

20
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,199
Your Highness,

21
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,400
the imperial guards in the army
are all under your command.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,879
When I came in,

23
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,440
I didn't see a single guard.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,239
Isn't this a trap set up by you

25
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,480
to frame me?

26
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,319
Ridiculous.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,559
I am the Crown Prince of this dynasty!

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,289
Why would I assassinate him?

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,760
Because you're afraid that His Majesty

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,440
will reopen the case of the Mo family.

31
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,760
And then,

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,199
your position as Crown Prince
will be jeopardized.

33
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,480
What does that case have to do with me?

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Whether it's related or not,
you know it well.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,879
It was you who framed the Mo family,

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,780
fueling the flames
that led to their annihilation.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,319
What?

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,136
Dare you do it but not admit it?

39
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,479
I didn't expect

40
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,960
that you know so much.

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,440
But you're not smart enough.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,559
Deposed Crown Prince Shen Mo

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,639
colludes with the remnants
of the Mo family.

44
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,600
Yun Shu

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,440
assassinated the Emperor.

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,320
Arrest them!

47
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,960
Stop!

48
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:36,839
Lan'er,

49
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,559
you're too impatient.

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,679
Well,

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,559
you dare to conspire
against me together.

52
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
Your Highness,

53
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,880
don't you know the saying?

54
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,720
"The mantis catches the cicada,

55
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,288
but the sparrow
is watching from behind".

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,679
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I'm Song Huanbei.

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,072
Knowing the words
of thousands of households.

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,639
Your Thousand Machines Pavilion

59
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,271
is quite capable.

60
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,696
It's a mere reputation in the world.

61
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,040
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Rise.

63
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,559
Yes.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,479
Since it's just a reputation,

65
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,720
with your talents,

66
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,080
wouldn't you want to enter the court

67
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,559
and make a difference?

68
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,279
Yes.

69
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,104
If so, when the Crown Prince selects
virtuous and capable individuals,

70
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,559
why are you unwilling?

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,520
Because

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,679
he isn't a wise ruler.

73
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,279
Throughout the court,

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,160
everyone praises him for his wisdom.

75
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,199
Where did you get such an idea?

76
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,264
Please, Your Majesty, take a look.

77
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,800
You!

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,240
You're spying on him?

79
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,960
Your Majesty, forgive me.

80
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,239
I merely do not want you to be deceived.

81
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,600
The matters written here...

82
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,640
If even one of them is proven false,

83
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,440
you'll

84
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,679
face the death penalty!

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,136
I understand, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,880
Song Huanbei.

87
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,320
Yes.

88
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,600
Dare you make a bet with me?

89
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,600
I want to see for myself

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
what kind of person

91
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,559
my Crown Prince truly is.

92
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,040
So that's how it is.

93
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,119
Shen Lan,

94
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,600
what more do you have to say?

95
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,160
The victor becomes king,
the loser an outlaw!

96
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,320
Lan'er,

97
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
I thought

98
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,679
I could entrust this kingdom to you,

99
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,119
but I never expected

100
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,040
that you would be
so manipulative and power-hungry.

101
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,160
Truly,

102
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:07,959
unworthy of the throne.

103
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,040
Father,

104
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,239
do you truly intend
to entrust the kingdom to me?

105
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,519
What did you say?

106
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,079
Shen Mo has been deposed

107
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,440
because you feared
the great influence of the Empress's

108
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,760
maternal family in court!

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,040
Marrying Yun Yi

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,624
is because you want
the military power of the Yun family!

111
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,600
Investigating the Mo family

112
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,920
is because you're afraid
of their numerous disciples

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,119
might rebel!

114
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,000
Every single thing

115
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,600
is your unspoken intentions.

116
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,480
I've taken care of them all for you.

117
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,519
Now,

118
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,079
you think I'm scheming for power?

119
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,760
How dare you!

120
00:05:50,624 --> 00:05:52,720
How dare you speculate
on my will and act recklessly?

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,519
Until now,

122
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,880
you still haven't repented.

123
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,040
Repent?

124
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,200
Repent?

125
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
I repent.

126
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,799
Lan'er...

127
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,279
Lan'er,

128
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,760
don't continue making mistakes.

129
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,119
Auntie!

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,119
Auntie...

131
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,880
Auntie...

132
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,839
Auntie!

133
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,160
Auntie...

134
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,000
Shen Lan!

135
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:17,880
Yun Shu!

136
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,080
Yun Shu,

137
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
I've won this round.

138
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,000
You tricked me again.

139
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,559
If you keep losing focus,

140
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,559
I'll really win.

141
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,960
His Majesty's emissaries

142
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,440
have come twice already.

143
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,440
Don't you intend to recognize him?

144
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,760
After all, he's your father.

145
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,039
Royalty knows no family ties.

146
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,799
Now that I've finally settled down,

147
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,520
I don't want to get involved

148
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,544
in the court's intrigues
and power struggles again.

149
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,960
Stand up.

150
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,200
Let me have a look.

151
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,440
Alike...

152
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,559
It's just like...

153
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:35,919
Your Majesty,

154
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,799
may I be excused now?

155
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Mo...

156
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,760
Have you

157
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,599
heard the rumors lately?

158
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,239
That you're

159
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,159
the former Crown Prince,

160
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,359
Shen Mo.

161
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,039
I only know

162
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,760
that the deposed Crown Prince Shen Mo
died twelve years ago

163
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,320
in the great fire at the Mo family.

164
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,479
If there's nothing else,

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,760
I'll take my leave.

166
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,400
I lost.

167
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,239
We agreed

168
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,840
that the loser must
grant the winner a request.

169
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
Go ahead.

170
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,719
Let me think about it carefully.

171
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,640
Should I ask you to cook

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,359
or chop firewood?

173
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,550
The herbs haven't been harvested yet.

174
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,280
And the books need to be aired out.

175
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,799
There's plenty of housework
to do anyway.

176
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,119
Promise me,

177
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,000
we won't bring up anything

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,960
related to the palace.

179
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,320
Let's move on,

180
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,039
