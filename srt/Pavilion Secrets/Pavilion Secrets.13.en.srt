00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 13=

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,479
Master,

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,079
what are you eating?

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,680
Feed me.

7
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:32,279
Your Highness,

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,880
Imperial Consort Yun killed your spy

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
placed in her palace.

10
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,360
Whenever Yun Shu is involved,

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,040
she'll do anything.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,560
Should I eliminate her

13
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,279
to prevent future trouble?

14
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,360
Prepare a potion for her.

15
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,599
Yes.

16
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:03,680
Sit properly.

17
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,839
Eat your own food.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,639
General, try this.

19
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,760
This tastes good.

20
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,080
This one is good, too.

21
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,839
Master,

22
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,720
try this.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
It's delicious.

24
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,839
This one's also good.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,760
And this one.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,279
Also delicious.

27
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,279
General, why aren't you eating?

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,599
I'm not hungry.

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,160
Enjoy your meal.

30
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:42,839
General.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Imperial Consort Yun
prepared some pear soup today.

32
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,440
Knowing you like it,

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,639
she asked me

34
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,919
to bring you some.

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,000
Leave it there.

36
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:53,480
General,

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,720
Her Highness said
to drink it while it's hot.

38
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,360
Mother, do you dislike

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,679
the maids I assigned?

40
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,360
Why is there no one
on duty today in the palace?

41
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,639
What are you trying to say?

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,440
I've said

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,039
you could raise Yun Shu by your side.

44
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,160
She can still be a general.

45
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,279
But she must never

46
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:42,119
know her true identity.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,639
The Mo family case is settled.

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,199
I promise she won't
continue to investigate.

49
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,240
How can you guarantee that?

50
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:54,000
Has she ever listened to you?

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,080
What do you want then?

52
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,119
A dead person's mouth

53
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,960
is the most secure.

54
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,360
Shen Lan!

55
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,399
She's your cousin.

56
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,360
Cousin?

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm not your son by blood.

58
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
Where did this cousin come from?

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,679
As a prince,

60
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,800
you'll be the future emperor.

61
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,880
You must be tolerant.

62
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,000
I tolerate her,

63
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,679
but who tolerates me?

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,279
Who can tolerate me?

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,479
Father has more than one son.

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,119
How did he depose Shen Mo?

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
He can do the same to me!

68
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,199
If he knows the descendant of a traitor

69
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,320
holds military power,

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,080
will he think I'm plotting a rebellion?

71
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,039
What do you want me to do?

72
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,839
A poison from the Western Regions.

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,960
Colorless and odorless.

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,399
Yun Shu will die

75
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,080
without any suffering.

76
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,960
No!

77
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:10,559
You can't do this.

78
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,079
I know you won't do it,

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,119
so I already sent it
to the Yun residence.

80
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,959
General, are you afraid

81
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,239
Her Highness poisoned it?

82
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,279
No, Auntie would never harm me.

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Appearances can be deceiving.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,320
Don't be so naive.

85
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,720
Why do you think we should test it?

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
A gift from Her Highness!

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,399
You can't be disrespectful.

88
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,760
If you refuse, there must be
something wrong.

89
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,239
General,

90
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,239
let me have this pear soup instead.

91
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:54,270
I've been entertaining you all morning.

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,399
My throat hurts.

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,239
Master, you don't
see yourself as an outsider.

94
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,480
General, I shall take my leave.

95
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,720
You hit me for her?

96
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,119
Yes!

97
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,640
Rushing to send a message to Yun Shu?

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,040
I've already

99
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,239
sealed that secret passage.

100
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,079
Why can't you tolerate her?

101
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,559
Because you're mine!

102
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,920
You can only be kind to me!

103
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,519
Why does she deserve your affection?

104
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,040
Wait to collect her corpse.

105
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,519
You want to kill me to avenge her?
