(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 2=

4
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:29,719
Wearing so much,
how can you wash it clean?

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,000
General, if you want to see my body,

6
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,639
it should be done on the bed.

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,000
Lewd man!

8
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,080
Watch out!

9
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,799
(The tattoo is gone.)

10
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,360
Have you seen enough?

11
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,840
You're not the head
of the Thousand Machines Pavilion.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,160
I am.

13
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,199
The fake news about the head's

14
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,040
kylin tattoo on his shoulder

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,199
was released by me.

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,800
My intention was to deter petty thieves,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,760
but I didn't expect

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,839
to attract someone
who lusts after my body.

19
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,120
Who lusts after whose body
is not certain yet.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,919
Be careful!

21
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:37,800
(This is...)

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,839
General!

23
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,599
Are you okay?

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,520
The assassin has been dealt with.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,639
(As expected of a lady.)

26
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:05,800
General,

27
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,639
you're not even that old,

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,360
so how do you have so many enemies?

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,399
Master Song,

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,559
are you also here
to seek revenge from me?

31
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,559
You might not believe it,

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,199
but I'm here to help you.

33
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,759
Then let me see
your sincerity and strength.

34
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,160
The assassin was sent by Wang Kui.

35
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,679
Find him.

36
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:43,639
Master.

37
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,039
You're indeed prescient.

38
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,839
Yun Shu is not the nephew
of the Imperial Consort Yun,

39
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,800
but a child saved

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
(Liu Su, Lead Guard of Thousand Machines Pavilion)
by her many years ago.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,679
Yun Shu has been acting

42
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,919
according to her instructions for years.

43
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,000
(In that case,)

44
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,919
(Yun Shu is a puppet.)

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,039
(The Mo family crossbows did not disappear
with that great fire years ago,)

46
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,360
(but have emerged again.)

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,720
(It's all related to
the Imperial Consort Yun.)

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,639
(Perhaps,)

49
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,279
(she is the mastermind behind it all.)

50
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,199
Three days later,

51
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,679
reveal Wang Kui's whereabouts

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,720
to Crown Prince Shen Lan of Xi.

53
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

54
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:32,919
Go.

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,632
General, you seem so eager
to have Wang Kui killed.

56
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,639
Could it be that he knows some secret?

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,520
What secret could I possibly have?

58
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,639
Why do you mean by this,

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,479
Master Song?

60
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,279
I just want to know

61
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,520
what would happen if your true gender

62
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,279
was revealed.

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,399
What exactly do you intend to do?

64
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,000
Then don't blame me for being rude.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,440
Still won't admit you're a lady?

66
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,000
General!

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
Liu Su said Wang Kui was found.

68
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,160
That man was just...

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,399
I didn't see anything.

70
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,200
Did you hear it?

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,519
Wang Kui has been found.

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,320
So what?

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,559
Aren't you going to kill him?

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
Lead the way.

75
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:07,600
(General's Mansion)

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,760
You ride.

77
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,920
You're only taking me?

78
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,640
Are you scared?

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,839
Here you are.

80
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
(General's Mansion)

81
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,279
If you want Wang Kui dead,

82
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,160
just ask and we'll send someone.

83
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,799
Why go yourself?

84
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,839
Actually, if we just
capture Wang Kui alive,

85
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,920
we can extract

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
what you want to know.

87
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,839
You don't need to go in person.

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,440
I thought Thousand Machines Pavilion
was omnipotent,

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,440
but now it seems
the world has overpraised it.

90
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,320
What do you mean?

91
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,559
If you were truly omnipotent,

92
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,839
how could you not know

93
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,760
that all I want now
is for you to shut up.

94
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,352
(Hongxiu Pavilion)

95
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,959
We're here.

96
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,399
Won't you help me up?

97
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,600
Wait a second.

98
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,839
Wang Kui has hired many guards.

99
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,279
Please be careful, General.

100
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,559
If he's not here,

101
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,200
I'll hold you accountable.

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,160
Don't worry.

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
I promised to help you kill Wang Kui.

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,120
I'm not running away.

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,679
(Hongxiu Pavillion)

106
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,280
(I already said I'm not going to run.)

107
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,520
(But you still tied me up.)

108
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,279
(Shu'er should meet with Wang Kui now.)

109
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,519
Sister,

110
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,480
your Shu'er has grown up.

111
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, I'll burn these childhood things

112
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,119
for you

113
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,119
