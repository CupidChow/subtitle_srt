4
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,200
That's about it...

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,520
General!

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,680
General!

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,159
Are you awake?

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,680
I've come to bring you some milk.

9
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:45,799
General,

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,119
last night...

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,760
Don't even mention last night!

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,920
Didn't you say you
were going to find Wang Kui?

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,960
Why aren't you leaving yet?

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,800
(Thousand Machines Pavilion)

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,119
I'll see what tricks Wang Kui
has up his sleeve this time.

16
00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:10,360
General,

17
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,599
this doesn't look like
there's an ambush here.

18
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,480
Be careful!

19
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,400
Wang Kui,

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,760
I am Song Huanbei, the head
of the Thousand Machines Pavilion.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,360
I've come to meet you
as entrusted by General Yun Shu.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,160
Since it's just the two of us,
please show yourself.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,040
Aren't there three of you?

24
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,279
It's you!

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,559
You're the head
of the Thousand Machines Pavilion?

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,599
Right.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,909
Where is the token?

28
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,440
(Thousand Machines Pavilion)

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Can I go over there now?

30
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,919
Stop!

31
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:56,959
Turn around.

32
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,839
Where's the item?

33
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,479
General Yun, don't worry.

34
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,679
Once I'm out of the city,

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,479
I'll naturally give you the item.

36
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,320
You dare to negotiate?

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
Stop!

38
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,759
His life

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,039
is in my hands now.

40
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,440
Do you really think General Yun

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,679
would care about my life?

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,800
If I cared about his life,

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,039
why would I let him give you the token?

44
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,399
Hand over the item!

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,119
Killing me won't do any good.

46
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,360
I don't have the item on me.

47
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,479
Is that so?

48
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,639
Not carrying
a life-saving item with you?

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,279
You think I'm easy to fool?

50
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,360
I'll give you.

51
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,479
It's just

52
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,600
in the back room.

53
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,360
You really won't talk until you're hit.

54
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,399
Lead the way.

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,119
The others stay outside.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,679
Not trying to run, are you?

57
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,639
General Yun,

58
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,320
please spare me.

59
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,240
Spare you?

60
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,240
You didn't think about today
when you were up to no good.

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
Sir!

62
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,360
Sir! Please spare my father!

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,360
Are you okay?

64
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,240
Wang Kui escaped.

65
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,119
Although it's the General's Mansion,

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,679
this is my room.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Don't you knock before entering?

68
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,240
Let me do it.

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,399
General,

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,160
men and women
should keep their distance.

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
I've seen plenty of men's bodies.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
There's no difference.

73
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,440
What are you hiding from?

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,079
General,

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
are you here to apologize?

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,200
Why should I apologize?

77
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,640
Do you know
if I hadn't dodged that arrow...

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,119
I knew you could dodge it.

79
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,239
And what about you?

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,440
What?

81
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,119
You knew I could dodge that arrow,

82
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,600
so you shot it.

83
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,119
But you didn't know
what was in that room!

84
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,079
And you dared to go in?

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,880
I was reckless.

86
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,480
Thank you for today.

87
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm not looking
for your thanks, General.

88
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,600
In this position,

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,839
your every step is a risk.

90
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,279
You should never be reckless.

91
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,600
My life was given
by the Imperial Consort Yun.

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,519
No matter who gives you your life,
you only live once.

93
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,920
So you can't be reckless.

94
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,000
(Why is he so anxious?)

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Sir.

96
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,119
Mengmeng?

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,799
Please take me in.

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,440
Do you think the General's Mansion

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,160
is somewhere you can just walk into?

100
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,760
General likes me,
and makes me new clothes.

101
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,440
That's not true.

102
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
She's wearing old, ragged clothes.

103
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,000
It bothers me to see it.

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,839
My clothes aren't new either.

105
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,200
How about making me a new set as well?

106
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,200
That's a new hairpin
from our Tianyi Shop.

107
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,640
The delicate lily leaves on it

108
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,760
symbolize lovers
eventually being united.

109
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,799
(It does look nice.)

110
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:11,959
(But it's a pity)

111
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,000
(I don't wear
lady's clothing that often.)

112
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,480
General, if you like someone,

113
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,079
you can buy it and give it to her.

114
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,320
I don't have anyone in mind.

115
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,279
Just measure your clothes.

116
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,600
I'll take this hairpin.

117
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,559
What are you buying this for?

118
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,040
To give to someone special.

119
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:39,000
Chase him!

120
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,320
Chase!

121
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,359
This way.

122
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,399
Hurry!

123
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:22,510
(Shen Lan, Crown Prince of Xi)

124
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,600
Come play a game with me.

125
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,359
Your Highness,

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,959
regarding the black market crossbows,
I truly didn't participate.

127
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,079
All the accounts I received

128
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,600
were through Eunuch Zhang's hands.

129
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,440
I really don't know anything,
Your Highness.

130
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,640
Wang Kui, what are you talking about?

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,839
I don't understand.

132
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,839
I'm just here to send you
to where you belong.

133
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,679
You and Eunuch Zhang
stole the Mo family's blueprints

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,399
and secretly made crossbows
to make money.

135
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,119
You even dared to hide
fake accounts from me.

136
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
How could I not kill you?

137
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,119
I only found his token.

138
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
The confession doesn't
seem to be on him.

139
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,320
(Wang)

140
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
Then find it for me.

141
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,839
Dig up the earth if you have to.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
Burn it all.

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,799
Nothing he touched should remain.

144
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,760
Yes, Your Highness.

145
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,359
Greetings, Mother.

146
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
After your mission,

147
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,119
Lan'er, you must be tired.

150

152
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,840
You may leave now.

153
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,440
Yes.

154
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,760
I came late at night

155
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,599
to present a gift to you.

156
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,040
(Wang)

157
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,119
Wang Kui is dead.

158
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,919
You don't have to rely
on Yun Shu for everything.

159
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,400
After all, you and I are true family.

160
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,039
But that confession
hasn't been found yet.

161
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,840
Mother,

162
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,280
what exactly did Imperial Physician Wu
say in his confession?

163
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,440
Yun Shu disguises herself as a man,

164
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,560
and she is a descendant
of the Mo family.

165
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,440
Imperial Physician Wu had your father's
trust before he passed.

166
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,280
If not for my negligence back then,

167
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,880
perhaps he wouldn't have discovered it.

168
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,799
If this confession were to spread,
not only the throne would lose,

169
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,256
but even the entire Yun family
would be implicated and punished.

170
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:29,072
(Imperial Physician Wu's Confession)

171
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,479
This is the confession
found on Wang Kui.

172
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,960
Wang Kui is already dead.

173
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,080
I've confirmed

174
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,039
that the two executors
of the Mo family's downfall

175
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,359
were Wang Kui and Eunuch Zhang.

176
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,119
But...

177
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
I can't yet confirm

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,559
if Shen Lan was the mastermind.

179
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,919
This matter must not
be revealed to Yun Shu.

180
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,520
Shen Lan must be eager

181
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,559
to get this confession now.

182
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,239
Yes.

183
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,550
He's invited you to meet
at the Dianyun Pavilion.

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,559
Should I

185
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:56,039
reject him on your behalf?

186
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,039
