00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 22=

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,760
Get up!

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,360
This is barely the start. Hurry up!

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,280
I quit!

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,048
This is more tiring
than marching in battle.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,600
How about

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,520
I learn cooking instead?

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,079
I did some cooking in the military.

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,440
You can cook?

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,279
That's right.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,279
Our general's cooking is delicious.

14
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,400
Everyone in the army raves about it.

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,520
Alright then.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,000
But if your cooking isn't good,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you'll have to practice.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,479
Here's the last dish.

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,400
You've worked hard.

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,599
Look at you,

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
all sweaty.

22
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,400
May I ask,

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,559
what is this dish?

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,919
Tomato and egg soup. Haven't you had it?

25
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,440
(Who serves tomato
and egg soup with shells?)

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,080
(Did I say something wrong?)

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,360
(Maybe she's never had it. )

28
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:26,559
Madam Meng, you go first.

29
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:27,040
Come on.

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,319
Drink up.

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,239
It's delicious.

32
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,440
I've never tasted such a wonderful soup!

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
Really?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here, have this whole bowl.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,639
Here's yours.

36
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,720
And this is yours.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,479
Eat up.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,479
General rarely cooks,

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,639
so enjoy it thoroughly.

40
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,240
Yes, Master.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,679
This is truly delicious.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,039
Really?

43
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,520
Let me try too.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,919
General,

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,000
your cooking skills
have improved tremendously.

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,679
This dish is simply

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,240
out of this world.

48
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,039
Come on. Master Song, try it.

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,360
Okay.

50
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,360
How is it?

51
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,600
General, you don't cook often,

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,479
so this is already impressive.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,520
Come on.

54
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Let's all eat.

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,679
Eat up.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,759
Don't be shy.

57
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,559
Qian Yan, here.

58
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Eat more.

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,919
Liu Su, look how thin you've become.

60
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,119
You should have this meat.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,639
You've worked hard taking care
of General. You deserve it.

62
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,559
Eat it.

63
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,119
By the way,

64
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,000
I have one more dish to bring out.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
Wait for me.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,119
Here's the dish.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
This is disgusting.

68
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm not eating

69
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,960
that next dish.

70
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,559
Yeah...

71
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,880
Yun Shu,

72
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,160
they ate something bad this morning.

73
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,279
General, we didn't mean to deceive you.

74
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,720
I know.

75
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,880
Still angry?

76
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,040
No.

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,959
You're lying.

78
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:12,799
Look at your pout.

79
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,720
I heard from Madam Meng today

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
that you practiced walking all day.

81
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,600
I want to learn how to be

82
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,399
a lady.

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
But you already are a lady.

84
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,040
I mean, the kind
that everyone acknowledges.

85
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,079
Before,

86
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,320
I became a General for my auntie.

87
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,600
Now, I want to be a lady

88
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,079
just

89
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
for you.

90
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,784
You don't have to do anything for me.

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,799
Just be yourself.

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,959
Be myself?

93
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,760
Do what you want to do.

94
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,959
What I want to do...

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,279
Little drunken cat.

96
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:48,320
