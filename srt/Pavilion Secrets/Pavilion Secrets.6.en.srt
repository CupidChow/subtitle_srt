00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,350
(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 6=

4
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:17,680
Your highness, you summoned me

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,600
not just for tea, right?

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,200
Do you have Wang Kui's belongings?

7
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,560
Master Song, you revealed Wang Kui's

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,520
hiding place to me

9
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:38,959
as a gesture of goodwill.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,439
But why would you hide it?

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,919
Because

12
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,520
I want to meet you, Your Highness.

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,759
Me?

14
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,319
I want to be your right-hand man.

15
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:55,840
Give me a reason to choose you.

16
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,520
Because of Thousand Machines Pavilion.

17
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:06,360
I'm willing to devote
the entire Thousand Machines Pavilion

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,199
to assisting you.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Words are not enough.

20
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,519
What do you

21
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,440
want me to do?

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,199
(Thousand Machines Pavilion is
the largest intelligence agency today.)

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,199
(If I truly have the support of him...)

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,760
Kill Yun Shu

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,319
to prove your loyalty.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,519
But you and Yun Shu are cousins, right?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,520
Why do you want to kill Yun Shu?

28
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,800
Whether to kill or not

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,040
is up to you.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,760
General.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,120
Mengmeng, practice it twice by yourself.

32
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes, General.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,440
General,

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,679
Wang Kui is dead.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,919
His body was burned to a pile of bones.

36
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,400
Have you found anyone responsible?

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,199
Not yet.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,679
They cleaned it up well.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,240
On the body,

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,880
I only found this.

41
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,679
(Silk from the Western Regions?)

42
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,440
(This is the Crown Prince's doing.)

43
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,920
No need to investigate further.

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,600
Wang Kui had done many wrongs.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,279
Many people wanted him dead.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm just worried

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,279
about how to tell Mengmeng.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,479
Hurry up!

49
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,240
Hurry!

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,559
Come over!

51
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,240
Hurry and bring the ice blocks!

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,839
Hurry!

53
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,639
Hurry up!

54
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:51,960
Come here!

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
What's going on here?

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,479
General's

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
old illness has flared up again.

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,839
What old illness?

59
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,119
Stop asking. Can't you see I'm busy?

60
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,160
You can't go in.

61
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,080
Move aside!

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,080
Get out!

63
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,839
I know some medical knowledge,
so I can help you.

64
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,880
No need.

65
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,759
I'll just soak in ice water.

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,720
It's a temporary relief
which will result in disaster.

67
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,800
There's a violent energy
within you that's rampaging.

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,839
Suppressing it forcibly will backfire.

69
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,160
You have a solution?

70
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,639
Let's try it first.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,479
You all

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,360
get out.

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

74
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,519
It has eased somewhat.

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,799
But the pulse is still very heavy.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,079
What's the story
behind this old illness?

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
It's a childhood ailment.

78
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,640
How so?

79
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I'm an orphan.

80
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,880
When I was young,
there was a sudden fire in my house.

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,720
Though I survived,
the heat poison was difficult to expel.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,200
From time to time,
I still feel hot and agitated.

83
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,959
I've seen many physicians,

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,399
but none could find a cure.

85
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,519
(If it weren't for me,)

86
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,640
(you wouldn't have to suffer like this.)

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,200
What's wrong?

88
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:55,559
Nothing.

89
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,720
I know a physician
who should be able to cure your illness.

90
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,079
Thank you for your kindness.

91
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,119
But first,

92
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:04,880
help me figure out

93
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,720
how to tell Mengmeng about Wang Kui.

94
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,119
After all,

95
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,559
he was her only relative.

96
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,399
General.

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,959
Come in.

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,600
Ginseng soup?

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,480
Great. I feel weak. Thank you.

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Actually,

101
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,320
I already know

102
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,640
he is dead.

103
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,559
Right?

104
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:38,679
How did you find out?

105
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,679
Qian Yan told others.

106
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,440
(Qian Yan, it's you again.)

107
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,959
(Wait for your punishment.)

108
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,040
It's weird.

109
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:50,000
Why do I feel a chill down my spine?

110
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,720
You little rascal!

111
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:11,920
Who told you to read my letter?

112
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,399
Hey,

113
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,519
why are you drinking again?

114
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,679
How dare you speak to me like that?
I'm your foster father!

115
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,440
He's your foster father?

116
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,760
Yes.

117
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,359
He doesn't seem reliable.

118
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,000
But he's a skilled physician.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,480
He can definitely cure your illness.

120
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,239
Don't flatter me.

121
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,279
Are you sick?

122
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,519
Yes.

123
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,239
Hold out your hand.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,559
Come on.

125
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,320
(Does it really work?)

126
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
(It does.)

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,519
Don't you trust me?

128
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
No.

129
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,160
(This old man can even read my mind.)

130
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,839
Of course I can.

131
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,880
Your pulse is in my hands.

132
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,239
He just loves
to guess people's thoughts.

133
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:11,720
Hey,

134
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,320
how is it?

135
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,839
Let's talk inside.

136
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:22,640
Let's go.

137
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,600
Say something.

138
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,920
His illness is...

139
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,799
Sir, please speak freely.

140
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,119
You were

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,920
born in a hot sweltering place?

142
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,799
So you must

143
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,079
have lived in an environment
constantly scorched by fire?

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
When I was young, I experienced a fire.

145
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:55,959
That's it!

146
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,440
That's correct.

147
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,600
How old are you?

148
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,200
Where did that fire occur?

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,239
Look at my Bamboo Grove Hut,

150
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,359
does it feel familiar to you?

151
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,079
Hey!

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,279
Don't ask him about these things.

153
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
He doesn't remember anything
from his childhood.

154
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,640
It's useless to ask him.

155
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,320
This...

156
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,519
You really

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,079
don't remember anything?

158
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,679
Yes.

159
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,040
Your fire toxin is difficult to cure.

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,399
But don't worry, stay here first.

161
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,520
Song Huanbei, come out with me.

162
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,320
Tell me honestly,

163
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,000
what's the background

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,760
of that girl in the room?

165
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,400
Well,

166
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:50,039
she's just a friend from the court.

167
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,640
You're lying again!

168
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,479
Her eyes that convey affection

169
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,760
are exactly like Miss Yun Yin!

170
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,760
Physical similarity
doesn't mean anything.

171
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,760
The entire Mo family,
with hundreds of people,

172
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,880
perished in a fire twelve years ago.

173
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,640
None survived.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm also part of the Mo family.

175
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,679
You really don't trust me?

176
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,760
Isn't it what you always say?

177
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,200
In life, it's good

178
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
to be a little vague.

179
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,719
You!

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,440
You don't tell me
a single truthful word.

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,479
Then I won't save that girl.

182
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,039
Hey!

183
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,919
You're not saving her, huh?

184
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,719
Then I won't give you any of the ten

185
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,000
jars of good liquor in my cellar.

186
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,039
Master...

187
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,799
The liquor

188
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,440
was stolen last night...

189
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,280
You stole my liquor, didn't you?

190
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,640
It's indeed good liquor.

191
