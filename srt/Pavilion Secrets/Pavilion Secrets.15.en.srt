00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:14,840
You...

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,799
You're trying to harm me.

6
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,120
General!

7
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,440
Mo...

8
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,279
Yun Shu...

9
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:42,919
Mo!

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,200
Mo...

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,240
It's okay.

12
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,680
The fire has been put out.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
It's fine.

14
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,799
It's okay.

15
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:11,319
What a clever trick indeed.

16
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:12,630
The medicinal properties

17
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,239
of the pear soup and the fragrance

18
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,160
from this box clash.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
If one doesn't know pharmacology,

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,144
they wouldn't even be able to detect it.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,120
The poisoner is truly cunning.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,160
(Could it really be Auntie?)

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,376
The poison has been neutralized.

24
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,440
Thanks to Physician Su's Yulu Pills.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,239
Or else, he will be in danger.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,319
I frightened you last night.

27
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,760
It's okay.

28
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,879
I narrowly escaped
a fire many years ago.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,919
Seeing candles

30
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,199
reminds me of that fire.

31
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,720
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,279
Something wrong
with the food box Auntie sent.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Perhaps there's

34
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,479
some misunderstanding...

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,559
I'll go ask her to clarify.

36
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,080
Shu'er.

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,320
Do you really think
this is a misunderstanding?

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,216
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,000
I need to find out for sure.

40
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,039
Rest well first.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
Shu'er,

42
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,759
are you okay?

43
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,128
Is everything alright?

44
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,320
Seeing that I'm still alive,

45
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,559
are you happy

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,759
or disappointed, Auntie?

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,608
The secret passage is sealed.

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,880
Do you no longer want to see me?

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
Or did you assume I would die?

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,360
No need to see each other again.

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Shu'er,

52
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:18,160
how could I not want to see you again?

53
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,720
I...

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,800
Her Highness is thirsty,

55
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,639
so I've coming to serve tea.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,679
Besides, Her Highness's throat is sore.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,479
The imperial physician advised

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,119
not to speak much.

59
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,672
I ordered the secret passage
to be sealed.

60
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,039
You've grown up,

61
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,184
and are in charge of military affairs.

62
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,160
It's not proper to come here often.

63
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,240
So as not to be criticized for having

64
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,080
my relatives meddle in politics.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,679
Fine.

66
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,704
What about the pear soup?

67
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,720
The pear soup...

68
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:15,880
It...

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,040
It must be a misunderstanding!

70
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:18,550
It definitely wasn't you who sent it.

71
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,040
No.

72
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,600
I had someone do it.

73
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,848
Just because I'm investigating
the case of the Mo family?

74
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,959
Why?

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,839
Could it be

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,256
that the incident has something
to do with you?

77
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,320
Shu'er!

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,880
How could I possibly

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,119
have killed my own sister?

80
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,359
Then tell me, why?

81
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,976
You said you didn't
enter the burning building.

82
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,359
Then how did you see my mother

83
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,160
for the last time?

84
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,880
Your parents did die because of me,

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
but it's not what you think, Shu'er.

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,519
Because of you?

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
Great. Just because of you!

88
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,839
I'm going to kill you today

89
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,920
to avenge my parents.

90
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:35,104
You don't deserve
to look at my mother's portrait.

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,760
And don't ever mention
your sisterly bond again.

92
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,000
Shu'er!

93
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,519
I, Shu'er,

94
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,200
kneel to thank you

95
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,119
for nurturing me, Auntie.

96
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,160
From now on,

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,160
we are strangers.

98
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,959
No, Shu'er!

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,880
Shu'er, listen to me!

100
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,359
Shu'er...

101
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,079
No!

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Shu'er.

103
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,839
She sealed the secret passage

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,799
and killed my parents.

105
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,519
She even tried to kill me.

106
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,959
Don't be afraid.

107
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm here.

108
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,160
But I can't kill her

109
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,440
to avenge my parents.

110
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,279
You're naturally kind-hearted.

111
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,520
She did raise you for so many years.

112
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,216
You don't have to
be too hard on yourself.

113
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,559
Mo...

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,799
I'm here.

115
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,119
I'm so tired.

116
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,960
Just go to sleep then.

117
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,559
General?

118
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,456
What are you doing?

119
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:33,919
Well,

120
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:36,030
General was injured
and was carried back to his room.

121
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,960
I need to go check.

122
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,119
What can you do there?

123
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,960
Don't go.

124
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,200
Go to chop wood.

125
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,919
Who chops wood at night?

126
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,679
Let's go! Hurry up!

127
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,239
Don't pull me.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,760
Don't go.

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,119
Okay.

130
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,119
I'll stay here.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,919

how was your wedding night

155
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
last night?

156
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,960

00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:16,960
Didn't Master Song stay here

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,359
last night?

159
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,679
Stop talking nonsense!
He just stayed with me.

160
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,919
So, did you two

161
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,159
do nothing last night?

162
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,119
Could it be that he has
a problem in that place?

163
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,520
That doesn't seem right.

clearly like each other.

168
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,559

169
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,799
and waste the beautiful time?

170
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,559
