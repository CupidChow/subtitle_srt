(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 4=

4
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,000
General,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,760
how did you come out of his room?

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,959
General,

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,799
Song Huanbei is a bad man.

8
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:20,520
Think about it.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,000
The Thousand Machines Pavilion shelters

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
wanted criminals and fugitives
from the imperial court.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,399
So how could their head be any good?

12
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,760
He's just good-looking on the outside.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,440
You mustn't let him deceive you.

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,360
I know you're close to him.

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,640
The young masters from the South Garden
have been here for so long,

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,680
but you only called them
to listen to music and write poems.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,159
You've never let them stay overnight.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,840
I didn't let Song Huanbei
stay overnight.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,159
I saw everything.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,200
You!

21
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:46,799
What did you see?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,439
General, you left in hurry
and forgot your medicine.

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,200
You took the sedative, and this medicine
is to relieve fatigue and replenish energy.

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,759
How dare you drug the general?

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,639
Qian Yan,

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,080
it's not his fault.

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,360
Master Song, thank you for your kindness.
But I won't take...

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,120
Don't eat dried orange peel
and plums, right?

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,279
This one's not sour. Try it.

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,000
You...

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,360
What's wrong?
Are you still feeling unwell?

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Nothing.

33
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,160
(Indeed, she has the same taste
as my junior sister.)

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,800
Thank you.

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,440
I have official duties to attend to.

36
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,519
Do you need help?

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,120
Is it your place to meddle
in imperial affairs?

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,000
General means for you to leave.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,879
Okay.

40
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,160
Then take care of the general.

41
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,960
I don't need you to tell me.

42
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,760
You're only good
at serving tea and water

43
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,879
and flattering people.

44
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,176
You're more scheming than those
from the South Garden.

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,839
Qian Yan, stop thinking about him.

46
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,199
Pass the order. Seal off the entire city.

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,519
At any cost,

48
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,000
we must find Wang Kui.

49
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,639
Yes.

50
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:05,040
(Why has Song Huanbei
been so attentive lately?)

51
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,200
(The medicine from Song Huanbei
is really effective.)

52
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
(My strength have
improved significantly.)

53
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,880
What happened?

54
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:25,880
General,

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,512
someone shot an arrow
at the gate of our mansion.

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,639
It was Wang Kui.

57
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,320
He's making demands.

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,032
(From Wang Kui)

59
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:41,640
(He wants the highest token
of Thousand Machines Pavilion)

60
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,160
(in exchange for what he has.)

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,720
(Will Song Huanbei agree to that?)

62
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,520
Master,

63
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,919
our people have taken Wang Kui

64
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,759
and evaded the search.

65
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,039
They're now hiding
in an abandoned house.

66
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,199
Well done.

67
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,199
He'll definitely
take the bait this time.

68
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,039
However,

69
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,720
Wang Kui sent a letter
to the General's Mansion today.

70
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,639
Not seeking help from us,

71
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,399
but instead turning to his enemy?

72
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,679
Interesting.

73
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,479
Go and keep an eye on him.

74
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:11,919
Yes.

75
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,440
Song Huanbei.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,479
Our General wants to see you.

77
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,479
(General's happiness depends on me.)

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,679
What are you doing?

79
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:30,000
Shouldn't that be what I say to you?

80
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,160
(It's done.)

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,040
(Qian Yan!)

82
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,600
Since it's a misunderstanding,

83
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,920
could you please untie me?

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,600
With this situation,

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
isn't it fulfilling your wishes?

86
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,519
What wishes?

87
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,239
Tonic medicine.

88
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,559
Fruits.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
Nighttime wine.

90
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,000
What's the purpose

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
behind your recent attentiveness?

92
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,720
I...

93
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:06,839
(Her attitude)

94
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,519
(towards the past is still unclear.)

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,720
(I can't speak directly.)

96
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,720
Well,

97
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,880
I have a request for you.

98
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,600
Speak.

99
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,959
Do you know

100
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:19,920
about Mo family?

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,799
The Mo family

102
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,640
that were burned?

103
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
You knew it?

104
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,559
I've only heard of them.

105
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:30,480
Your words

106
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,200
are enough for me to hear.

107
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,760
No need to share them with others.

108
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,600
Why?

109
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,959
It's a sad story
for Imperial Consort Yun.

110
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,399
Her sister

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,000
died in that fire.

112
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,119
Why do you ask

113
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,559
about the Mo family?

114
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,920
General, do you know about
the new crossbows in the army?

115
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,920
They're all based on Mo's designs.

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,279
I thought the blueprints

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,679
were in your possession.

118
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,359
It's all thanks to Crown Prince.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,959
He led the design team
at the Military Foundry.

120
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,680
(Looking at her expression,)

121
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,800
(she truly knows nothing
about what happened then.)

122
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,440
Are you done?

123
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,279
Now it's my turn.

124
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,799
Master Song,

125
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:17,279
may I borrow
the Thousand Machines Pavilion token?

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,200
Is it for Wang Kui?

127
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,839
What does he have that's so valuable

128
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,959
for you to go to such lengths?

129
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,000
Just tell me, will you give it or not?

130
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,399
Since you've asked,

131
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,880
I'll give you.

132
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,440
Neat.

133
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll wait for you to retrieve it.

134
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,040
What's wrong with you?

135
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,559
I feel dizzy.

136
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:02,359
(This is...)

137
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,959
(Aromatic aphrodisiac?)

138
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,760
How dare you!

139
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,559
I suggest you take off your clothes too.

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,519
This medicine

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,559
makes the blood flow faster.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,679
Let me help you.

143
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,000
You...

144
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,600
What about you?

145
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,000
