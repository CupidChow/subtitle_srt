00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 8=

4
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:22,040
Please sit.

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,079
No need, thank you.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,120
I wonder

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,440
who you are?

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
You're Yun Yi?

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,159
I never expected

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,520
to meet another member
of the Mo family again.

11
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,360
I don't understand what you are saying.

12
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:46,680
People of the Mo family

13
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,319
all perished in the fire years ago.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,080
My apologies.

15
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,000
I invited you here today

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,639
to express my gratitude in person.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,439
Did you give
the Bloody Lingzhi to Shu'er?

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,639
Today, that girl

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,480
was seeking medicine for you?

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,879
Yes.

21
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:12,919
Yun Shu is considerate.

22
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,360
To lead the Yun Family Army for me,

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,888
she disguised herself
as a man for so many years.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,680
I owe her so much.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,280
This is a Western wine,
a tribute from a foreign tribe.

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,000
Please try it first.

27
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:26,360
Well,

28
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,400
just say what you want to say.

29
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,839
I invited you here

30
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,000
to help me paint
a portrait of my sister.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,839
To ease my longing.

32
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:41,480
You and Miss Yun Yin

33
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,040
are sisters by blood.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,519
If you miss her,

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,559
just look in the mirror.

36
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,839
You'll see her reflection.

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,160
My sister was radiant and outgoing.

38
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,952
I've been in the palace
for twenty years.

39
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,480
How can I compare to her?

40
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,959
I think you're troubled

41
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,519
by nightmares and palpitations.

42
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,400
It's best to avoid alcohol.

43
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,279
As for Lady Mo's illness,

44
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,039
I'll do my best.

45
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:11,270
I shall take my leave.

46
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,768
(Mo)

47
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,360
Sister!

48
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,000
Sister!

49
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,496
(Twelve Years Ago)
Kill them!

50
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,000
Sister!

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,720
Sister!

52
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,600
Sister!

53
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,639
Sister!

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,520
Sister!

55
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,360
Sister!

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,759
Sister!

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,000
Mother,

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,944
don't be afraid.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,880
Lan'er,

60
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,839
why are you here?

61
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:46,832
I'm here because I
was worried about you.

62
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:47,919
You had a nightmare?

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,839
I keep dreaming about the past.

64
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:00,440
You have a headache?

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,199
Let me rub it for you.

66
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,200
Mother,

67
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,248
who was that person you met
today outside the palace?

68
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,959
An old acquaintance.

69
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:26,559
He once received kindness
from the Mo family.

70
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,440
I just wanted to catch up with him.

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,720
Let's not talk about the past anymore.

72
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,119
Every time you have a headache,
it's because of the past.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,200
By the way,

74
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,799
I'm taking care of Shu'er's situation.

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,640
Her old illness

76
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,239
should be cured this time.

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,200
You know everything?

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,399
Mother,

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,200
even if I don't want to know,

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,600
someone will come and tell me anyway.

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,519
You

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,279
just focus on getting better.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,839
I'll take care of everything for you.

84
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,320
Rest assured.

85
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,640
Are you okay?

86
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:29,799
You're

87
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,839
too good at enduring pain.

88
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,760
Going through the small cycle
of acupuncture

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,399
is incredibly difficult.

90
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,959
Have some tea to soothe your throat.

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,559
Thanks.

92
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,920
Your fire poison,

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,109
accumulated over time,

94
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,632
will be harder to deal with later on.

95
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,344
And it might not
be completely eradicated.

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Actually,

97
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,160
there is a way to eradicate it.

98
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:52,928
Why didn't you say so earlier?

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,040
It's not that I didn't want to say,

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,760
but this method is not easy.

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,640
You two...

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Well...

103
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,229
You might not be able to do it.

104
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,550
No matter how difficult, I'll do it.

105
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,000
Tell me.

106
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,990
Need to find some
special medicinal ingredient?

107
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,040
It's not that mysterious.

108
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,088
Healing and saving lives
is not like fortune-telling.

109
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,079
However, my method

110
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,000
is meant for lovers.

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,200
Are you lovers?

112
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,720
Why does it have to be lovers?

113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,880
That's how it's written
in the ancient medical texts.

114
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,200
If you don't believe me,

115
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
then forget about it.

116
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,119
What constitutes as lovers then?

117
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Whether there's love or not,

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,640
I can tell.

119
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,519
You two can discuss it.

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,079
We're both guards.

121
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,440
Why am I chopping wood

122
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,920
while you're eating an apple?

123
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,399
When Physician Su asked someone to work,

124
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,239
I slipped away.

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,109
You usually seem so quiet.

126
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,192
How come you're so sneaky?

127
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,200
Physician Su, what's going on?

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,000
You look so happy.

129
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,359
It's something good!

130
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,159
After chopping the wood,
you carry it to the kitchen for me.

131
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,640
Liu Su is free, so let him do it.

132
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,399
Alright.

133
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,519
Who is it?

134
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,519
It's me.

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,559
What do you want?

136
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,279
Won't you invite me in?

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,079
Sure.

138
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,720
What happened?

139
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,239
Can't sleep?

140
00:08:40,784 --> 00:08:42,470
Thousand Machines Pavilion
has many treasures.

141
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,799
I want to ask

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,679
if there's any kind of

143
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,080
love-inducing sect?

144
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:49,599
You...

145
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,799
What did you just say?

146
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,440
I know this might be

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
an unusual request,

148
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,479
but I want to be cured.

149
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,239
He said it can only work for lovers.

150
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,440
So I thought...

151
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,359
Don't have to think about it.

152
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,559
It's all his nonsense.

153
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,359
There's nothing like that in the books.

154
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,640
How do you know?

155
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,719
I...

156
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,520
Because

157
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
I read that book.

158
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,119
Really?

159
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,280
I'll leave then.

160
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,624
You dropped your book.

161
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,479
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,280
It's not mine.

163
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
No need to explain.

164
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm not explaining.
I stole it from my foster father.

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,719
I used it to cure your illness.

166
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,159
Do you

167
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,440
even believe yourself?

168
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,239
Did you steal my book?

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
You two

170
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,119
stole it together?

171
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,840
This...

172
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,239
Is this book really yours?

173
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,056
You're pretty good at pretending.

174
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,760
Since you're both so eager,

175
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
then tomorrow,

176
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,640
we'll try

177
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,479
this method.

178
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:19,880
I...

179
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,239
Didn't you feel that they were

180
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,080
acting strange at the table today?

181
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:36,880
No.

182
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,000
They're going to take
a medicinal bath together later.

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,119
What's wrong with buddies
taking a bath together?

184
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,679
Do you know what you remind me of?

185
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,119
You're like this piece of wood.

186
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
Hopeless.

187
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:02,919
Please.

188
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,440
How can we bathe with you here?

189
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,679
I forgot that I'm in the way.

190
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,239
Take your time.

191
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,200
Is it

192
