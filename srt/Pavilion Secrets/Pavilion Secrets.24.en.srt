=Episode 24=

4
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,550
Did you not get enough rest last night?

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,799
Why is your face so pale?

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,639
I hate being kept in the dark.

7
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:30,959
Who is it?

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,880
Me?

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,400
How could it be?

10
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:42,759
Trying to deceive me again?

11
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,240
I already know everything.

12
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,840
You mean the erotic painting of Mr. Su?

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,439
Well, that painting

14
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,119
is also a keepsake.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,119
Not that one.

16
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:56,400
Mengmeng?

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,790
It's not that I don't want Mengmeng
to be the bed-warming child.

18
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,639
I just think the current
situation is uncertain.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,040
I...

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,799
Not that one too.

21
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,040
Well...

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,919
Won't you tell me?

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,279
Nevermind.

24
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,190
Something happened to Yun Family Army.

25
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:19,400
Why didn't you say anything?

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,239
Yun Family Army?

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,639
Yun Shu!

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,400
Yun Shu!

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,959
Move aside!

30
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,000
Yun Shu!

31
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:29,000
What are you doing?

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,199
The Yun Family Army
is trapped in Yongzhou.

33
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:32,160
I have to go save them.

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,760
Move aside!

35
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:34,550
Yongzhou is thousands of miles away,

36
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:35,800
and you, a mere commoner, alone,

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,480
what can you do?

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,319
Song Huanbei!

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,560
I just want to know,

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,839
are you going to stop me or help me?

41
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,959
Yun Shu!

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,959
The news is false.

43
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,879
I'm faking it too.

44
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:50,550
Someone is listening.

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,559
Move aside!

46
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,759
Yongzhou defense map?

47
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,080
Your master truly has excellent tactics.

48
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,399
My master said

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,559
this is his sincerity in serving you.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,839
Thoughtful indeed.

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,240
How is Yun Shu?

52
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,520
She is eager to save the soldiers

53
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,039
but is being stopped by Song Huanbei.

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,360
It seems the news of
Yun Family Army being trapped is true.

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,559
So we must

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,800
do this favor.

57
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,240
Qian Yan.

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,720
Yes.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,639
Guard the entrance. Don't let anyone in.

60
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,080
Yes!

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,720
General said no one is allowed to enter.

62
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,600
Who let you in? Get out!

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,360
At least let me explain.

64
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,559
Alright.

65
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,639
Then I'd like to hear your explanation.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,639
Don't go in.

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,199
What's wrong?

68
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,839
Listen to me.

69
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,679
Going in now would be
like walking into a trap.

70
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,679
You're really good at acting.

71
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,320
Shen Lan has planted
many spies in my mansion.

72
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:48,919
It didn't matter before,

73
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,399
but now we have to be careful.

74
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:52,880
Don't worry.

75
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,410
I've asked Madam Meng to investigate.

76
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,279
It won't be long before we have a list.

77
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,240
Still studying this book?

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,160
You like it so much?

79
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,399
Yes.

80
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:04,360
Then let me teach you.

81
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,392
Really?

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,352
Yes.

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,839
Call me "sweetie" and I'll teach you.

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,640
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,328
Would you please open the door?

86
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:31,510
The Yun Family Army
are trapped in Yongzhou

87
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,399
for several days now.

88
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:34,119
Without reinforcements,

89
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,559
they'll be annihilated.

90
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,160
Aren't you worried?

91
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,559
You must be very worried.

92
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,320
Don't worry, I'll lead
my personal guards and go.

93
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,504
I'll risk my life
to save the Yun Family Army.

94
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,399
But it's a long journey...

95
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,432
I wonder if we'll see each other again.

96
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,239
Won't you even look at me?

97
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,079
Do you remember this place?

98
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,079
It was here,

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
when I thought I was dying.

100
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,320
You opened the door.

101
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,559
I never expected a decade
has passed already.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,640
Life in the palace is tough,

103
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,959
but we've made it through together.

104
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,079
Won't you even see me one last time?

105
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,320
Fine.

106
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
If you don't want to, then don't.

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,399
I've brought you some calming medicine.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,880
It's outside the door.

109
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,688
Remember to take it regularly.

110
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,079
If possible,

111
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,279
pray for my safety as well, okay?

112
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,440
Your Highness, are you really going?

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,000
What if it's a trap?

114
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,799
Fortune favors the bold.

115
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,239
I want to earn the loyalty
of the Yun family.

116
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,840
It requires putting my life on the line.

117
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,799
Then let me come with you...

118
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,200
Yue'er!

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,480
Yes,

120
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,679
Your Highness.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,480
I'll keep a close eye on the capital.

122
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,160
