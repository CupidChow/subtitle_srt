00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,550
(Today, I'll raid the dungeon
to rescue Huanbei.)

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,599
(It's fraught with danger.)

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,680
(If by chance I meet my untimely end,)

9
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:49,040
(I've made the following
arrangements for my affairs.)

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,520
What's this?

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,840
Bring it over!

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Why are you still doing it
when it's dangerous?

13
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,629
I'll trade my life for yours.

14
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,688
What's wrong with that?

15
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,720
It's wrong!

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,870
(Crown Prince Shen Lan is unvirtuous.
Let's discuss matters.)

17
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,440
Think about it carefully.

18
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,104
Exactly what's wrong with it?

19
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,200
He was so angry that he
didn't come back all night?

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,080
How should I apologize to him?

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,368
It's not customary
for women to apologize to men.

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,440
Men are like that.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,919
Just ignore him for a couple of days.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,600
But speaking of which,

25
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,279
he's angry because he cares about you.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,320
Well,

27
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,119
since he cares about me,

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,976
I should definitely apologize to him.

29
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,919
So, what's your plan?

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,279
I was wrong.

31
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,679
Please talk to me.

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
Do you know where you went wrong?

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I know I shouldn't
have written a final letter.

34
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,080
How will you do in the future?

35
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,720
From now on, I won't worry you anymore.

00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,399

I'm angry at myself.

43

apologize to me like this.
