00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,350
(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 9=

4
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,680
Why are you taking so long to undress?

5
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:24,920
I...

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,840
I'm embarrassed.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,800
Go check if the windows
are closed tightly.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,959
Okay.

9
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:31,319
I'll go check now.

10
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,279
Sorry.

11
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,608
He doesn't have any sense of propriety.

12
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,759
It's okay.

13
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,080
Let's begin.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,216
Gather your thoughts in extremity.
Control your spirit and illusion.

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,080
Neither form nor supreme.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,120
All directions are illusory.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,416
Using yin and yang
without transformation.

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,176
Guarding the spiritual hall of Qi.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,568
Stopping breath and reversing its flow.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,216
Filling the pulses and removing form.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,080
Break!

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,680
Break...!

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,599
Yun Shu!

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,336
You overtly agree but covertly oppose.

25
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,839
If you don't believe me,
don't ask me to treat you.

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,360
It's you who's messing around.

27
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,720
Just treat the illness.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,800
What's this rule about lovers?

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,559
I'm the one messing around?

30
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,199
If you're not lovers,

31
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:09,639
what does this look like when the two
of you, a man and a woman,

32
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,160
naked in front of each other?

33
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,399
You don't mind, huh?

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
Anyway, you plan

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
to be single for the rest of your life.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,240
But what about her?

37
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,839
Does she plan to become a nun?

38
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,839
So why don't you two just get married?

39
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,080
Shut up for a moment.

40
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,000
May I ask, Sir,

41
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,600
why do lovers have to be involved?

42
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,559
Well, here is the thing.

43
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
Your illness

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,872
is because the fire poison
hasn't dissipated.

45
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,000
The martial arts you practice

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,360
is a technique that strengthens Qi
and generates Yang.

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,559
So, it's becoming
increasingly difficult to cure.

48
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,279
Now,

49
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,000
we're using his strength
to help you reverse the flow of Qi.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,520
And draw the Yang poison
into the medicinal water.

51
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,559
But you don't listen.

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,520
At best,

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,839
you'll experience cold extremities.

54
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,479
At worst, convulsions and spasms.

55
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,399
If you two care about it,

56
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,479
then let's go with acupuncture.

57
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,440
Well...

58
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,208
Let's continue the sitz bath then.

59
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,759
It's all my fault.

60
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,520
This time,

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,320
we'll do whatever you say.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,839
Yun Shu.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
What's this?

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,000
Use it

65
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,880
to cover my eyes.

66
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,669
It's not necessary.

67
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,648
We're both open-minded.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,039
Wait...

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,960
I...

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
(I'm not that open-minded either.)

71
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:51,960
What?

72
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,744
Actually, my foster father is right.

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
We're of different genders.

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,199
Even if it's for healing, being naked,

75
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,112
I should consider your feelings.

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,440
I'll cover my eyes,

77
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,119
so you can feel more at ease.

78
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,440
Thank you.

These past few days,

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,239
I don't know how many times I've

111
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,200
heard you say "thank you".

112
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,200
I won't say it anymore then.

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,480
General!

114
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,079
Are you done?

115
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,320
I see the light is on now.

116
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Don't move.

117
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,959
Qian Yan, get out!

118
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm sorry about earlier.

119
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,359
It's fine.

120
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,640
Go back and tell Crown Prince

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,000
that I'll save this person's life.

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,640
With me here,

123
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,920
you can't kill him.

124
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,888
Are you alright?

125
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,600
Let me tell you,

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,839
I was just drunk today.

127
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,399
Or I would've dealt with her already.

128
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,349
It's even a thorny tiger whip.

129
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,080
That little girl's hands
are really fierce.

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,480
Well,

131
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,600
do me a favor.

132
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,559
Tell me.

133
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,799
Recently, I heard from Liu Su

134
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,920
that several members
of Liangzhou have fallen ill.

135
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,799
I've been absent
and have a lot of work piled up.

136
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,480
How about

137
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,160
you go help me deal with it?

138
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,750
Afraid I'll get into trouble?

139
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,559
Who was just boasting earlier then?

140
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,239
"With me here, he can't kill him."

141
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,040
Shen Lan

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,608
is not easy to deal with.

143
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,720
Like dog follows master.

144
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,679
I can see that.

145
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,720
Not a good person.

146
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,799
Why does he want to kill me?

147
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:14,040
Maybe he's afraid that Yun Shu's
secret of dressing as a man

148
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,912
will be known by you.

149
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,984
So he wants to silence you.

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,760
If that's the case,

151
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,799
he seems quite invested in Yun Shu.

152
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,679
What about

153
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,119
what happened back then?

154
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,536
I'm still investigating.

155
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,640
You...

156
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,720
Since you asked, I'll do it for you.

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,119
When do you want me to leave?

158
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,608
The day after tomorrow.

159
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,200
That's soon!

160
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,679
You're not even polite
about chasing me away!

161
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,559
All right. Let's go.

162
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,320
I'll help you.

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,119
Slowly.

164
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,479
Take it easy.

165
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,880
What are you doing?

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
This is the chessboard
you left unfinished?

167
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,080
I was just playing around.

168
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,320
There's no candy shop nearby.

169
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,184
I bought you this instead.

170
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,760
Try it. It's sweet too.

171
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,280
Is it difficult?

172
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
This chessboard is hard to solve.

173
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,239
Want to try?

174
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,919
If I can solve this chessboard,

175
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,440
can you grant me one wish?

176
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,359
Okay.

177
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,152
You're agreeing
without asking what it is.

178
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:26,679
I won't ask.

179
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,559
Speak up.

180
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,712
What do you want me to do, General?

181
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,599
Let's get married.

182
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
Let's get married.

183
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,520
Mr. Su is leaving soon,

184
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,679
but he's truly worried about you.

185
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
He wants to see you get married.

186
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,760
It's just another performance, anyway.

187
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,359
Let's fulfill his wish.

188
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,559
Marriage is not something
to be taken lightly.

189
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,640
You can't be so rash just to fulfill

190
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,599
someone else's wish.

191
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,760
Not like that.

192
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,400
Having such a family member
who cares about you deeply,

193
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,664
you should try to oblige him.

194
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,880
Then,

195
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,599
what about you?

196
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,440
Me?

197
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,960
What about me?

198
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,640
What about

199
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,760
your own marriage?

200
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,799
It's just

201
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,159
stepping into the sedan chair blindly,

202
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,239
bowing three times,

203
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:46,239
and drinking some wine.

204
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,359
No!

205
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
It's different.

206
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,080
What's different?

207
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,352
With the blessings
of family and friends,

208
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
holding the hand of your beloved,

209
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,799
making a promise
under the stars and moon,

210
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,496
it's a bond that can be etched
onto the stone of eternity.

211
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,280
Don't worry.

212
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,016
Since we're getting married,

213
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,656
I'll take care of it.

214
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,880
Okay.

215
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:34,479
It's sweet.

216
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,359
You're here.

217
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,479
What do you want me for, Master?

218
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,479
Go to the market tomorrow
and buy some things.

219
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,880
Don't hold back on the money.

220
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:51,808
(List of Presents)

221
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,840
Getting married?

222
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Who's getting married?

223
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,359
Me.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,520
Alright, hurry up and go.

225
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,520
Don't just stand there.

226
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,719
Yes.

227
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,559
The stitching is passable.

228
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,280
The fabric is decent.

229
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,280
It's just the size...

230
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,760
Isn't it a bit small?

231
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,039
No, it's adjusted according
to the General's measurements.

232
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,359
Wait...

233
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,919
Why is it for the General to wear?

234
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,599
Because my Master can't fit into it.

235
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,880
It's the lady's clothing.

236
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,520
Yes.

237
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,880
Our General is marrying your Master.

238
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,320
Why is the General wearing this?

239
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,039
Because the Master can't fit into it.

240
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,359
It's not about fitting or not fitting.

241
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,919
It's about who wears it.

242
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,599
Our General is the husband.

243
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:50,080
He's the one on top.

244
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,479
Your Master is the bride,

245
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,479
the one on the bottom.

246
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,239
Do you understand?

247
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,359
Wait...

248
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,559
Where are you going?

249
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,039
Have you understood?

250
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:05,159
It seems you've understood.

251
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,440
No wonder you could
solve my chessboard puzzle.

252
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,280
You learned quickly.

253
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:20,799
Master,

254
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,119
everything has been prepared.

255
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,919
Thank you.

256
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,239
Send a message to Madam Meng.

257
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,440
Ask her to come tomorrow
as my hairdresser.

258
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,640
Yes.

259
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,119
This is from Mr. Su for you.

260
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,000
Well...

261
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,119
Can't he just speak his mind?

262
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,672
(To Song Huanbei: I know I'm dying.)

263
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:44,670
(But I've got the journal
of the Mo family.)

264
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,192
(Take care of yourself. From Su Shan.)

265
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,190
