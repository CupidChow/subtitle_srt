=Episode 14=

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,600
You want to kill me to avenge her?

5
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:40,599
I knew it!

6
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:42,479
You can't bear

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,080
to kill me!

8
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,479
There's no poison
in that bowl of pear soup.

9
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,400
I just wanted to see

10
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,520
who's more important to you,

11
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,119
me or Yunshu.

12
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,040
Insane!

13
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,439
You're insane!

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,160
Get out of here.

15
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,879
Get lost!

16
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,120
Right.

17
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,919
I'm insane.

18
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,760
Yes.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,040
I'm crazy.

20
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:20,639
I'm crazy!

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,919
I'm crazy!

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,800
Madman.

23
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:41,680
Is it done?

24
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,360
Yes.

25
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,319
But...

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,519
It seems Song Huanbei
has sensed something.

27
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:48,760
What about

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,839
I'll retrieve the food box?

29
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:54,319
(Yun Shu can't die today,
no matter what.)

30
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,360
(Or Mother will blame me for it.)

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,599
(Killing Song Huanbei
wouldn't be a loss either.)

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,319
No need.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,120
But Your Highness,
you wanted to recruit him, didn't you?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,440
There will be other chances
to kill Yun Shu.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,832
But the head
of the Thousand Machines Pavilion

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,479
isn't that easy to kill.

37
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,984
Your Highness, take care
of your wound first.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,759
Send a new group of attendants.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,240
Keep a record of everything
Imperial Consort Yun

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,279
does and give it to me.

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Yes.

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,759
Master, are you alright?

43
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,080
I'm still here, aren't I?

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,880
Even if it's fine,

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,199
you should let me check it.

46
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,160
It's too dangerous.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,759
I won't drink it.

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,559
But Yun Shu will.

49
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,320
Stop studying this stupid box.

50
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,759
Don't you want to see her?

51
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,639
Otherwise,

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,440
she'll never know
about your deep feelings.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,119
I should remind Yun Shu.

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,919
Although the pear soup is fine,

55
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,720
it was too suspicious
when it was delivered.

56
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,680
We need to be careful.

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,160
I feel terrible.

58
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,240
Master! Hurry!

59
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,839
I can't breathe!

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,240
Hurry, Master!

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,960
I can't stand it!

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,520
Quick!

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,360
Don't panic, Master.

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,752
Your clothes are hard to undo.

65
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,759
Let me help you.

66
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,000
Over here.

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,800
Over here.

68
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,440
Lift your arm a bit.

69
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,080
Okay.

70
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,360
You...

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,440
Yun Shu...

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,240
He's been poisoned!

73
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:50,064
This must be a misunderstanding.

74
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,199
I'll go ask Auntie for the antidote.

75
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,720
If she really poisoned him,

76
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,930
would she give you the antidote?

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Saving him is the priority.

78
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,680
Take off his clothes
and breathe for him.

79
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
I'll go find the antidote.

80
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,600
How do I breathe for him?

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,759
Mouth to mouth!

82
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,799
You're awake.

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,519
(My fingers are black.)

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
(It's the same as Yun Shu's parents
before they died.)

85
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,079
Deposed Crown Prince Shen Mo!

86
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,200
Someone sent me to kill you.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,839
You still feel a bit hot.

88
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,519
I got a basin of cold water.

89
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you alright?

90
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
Wash your face first.

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,799
Here.

92
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,799
Be careful.

93
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:44,480
What's wrong?

94
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,119
Who sent you?

95
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,760
Speak up.

96
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,320
Who sent you to kill me?

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,119
It's me, Yun Shu.

98
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,359
(Deposed Crown Prince!)

99
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
(Your death is near.)

100
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,160
(Wash your neck and wait for it.)

101
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
(Shen Mo!)

102
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,119
(Kill him!)

103
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:13,920
(Surrender!)

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,799
(Kill the deposed crown prince,
and there will be great rewards.)

105
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,600
Mo...

106
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:20,359
Master!

107
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,480
Master, it's me!

108
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,559
You...

109
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,519
You're trying to harm me!

110
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:29,839
