00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,959
(It's this person.)

25
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,919

Don't open it yet.

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
What's this mysterious thing?

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,599
It's still early.

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,328
Why not go to the Lantern Festival
and take a look?

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,199
Okay.

36
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,360
General!

38
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,800
Something's wrong!

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,399
What's wrong? Speak up!

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,176
Shen Lan has surrounded
the entire mansion with troops.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Your Highness,

42
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,000
what is the meaning of this?

43
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,360
Yun Shu, you're a lady,

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,399
but you've pretended
to be a man for years,

45
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,639
deceiving His Majesty
and scheming for military power.

46
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,279
I've been sent by His Majesty's orders
to arrest you.

47
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,568
This is Imperial Consort Yun's idea,
isn't it?

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,839
You've committed the crime
of deceiving the Emperor.

49
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,616
Even Imperial Consort Yun
can't save you.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,160
I had mercy on her,

51
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,600
but she wants to drive me to my ruin.

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,279
As siblings,

53
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,919
if you surrender your military power,

54
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,000
I can leave you with a whole body.

55
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
What do you say?

56
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,880
You only brought a few men.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,279
Do you underestimate me?

58
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,759
My dear cousin,

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,440
my crossbow is faster

60
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,600
than your sword.

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,759
Try it?

62
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,479
Wait!

63
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:50,759
Your Highness,

64
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,119
don't be hasty to arrest anyone.

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,039
I have a deal

66
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,119
to discuss with you.

67
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:00,784
Oh?

68
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,199
You desire military power

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
because several princes

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,520
have been restless recently,

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,520
threatening your position
as Crown Prince.

72
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,152
The intelligence network of my pavilion

73
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,479
spans the entire world.

74
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,079
Wherever there are people,

75
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,880
I have information.

76
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,239
If you release Yunshu,

77
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,736
the Thousand Machines Pavilion

78
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,799
will be at your disposal.

79
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,200
Song Huanbei,

80
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:33,664
you don't seem like someone
who lets emotions cloud your judgment.

81
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,880
You're also a man of passion.

82
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,640
If someone were to harm
Imperial Consort Yun,

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,079
this deal would be highly profitable

84
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,040
for you.

85
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,640
Dare you untie me and fight me?

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,640
Shut up.

87
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,079
General.

88
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,559
Where is him?

89
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,079
Master Song is still stalling. Let's go.

90
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,959
Such a good deal,

91
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,440
but I sense something fishy about it.

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,959
Your Highness!

93
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,880
Your Highness,

94
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,728
Yun Shu has been rescued
by the Thousand Machines Pavilion.

95
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,640
Song Huanbei,

96
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,160
what a clever ruse to lure us away.

97
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,880
Send more men to pursue them.

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,119
Lock him up,

99
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,880
and throw him in the imperial dungeon.

100
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes.

101
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,359
Hey,

102
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,600
meal is ready.

103
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,359
Hurry up.

104
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,760
I'll keep watch outside.

105
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,559
Thanks.

106
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,270
Why are you here?

107
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,359
I'm here to rescue you.

108
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,040
If I'm going to leave this place,

109
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll do it with dignity.

110
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,000
You have no idea.

111
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,000
There are many ways
to torture someone here.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
You might not survive.

113
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,760
Shen Lan was just tricked by you,

114
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,088
so he's less likely to let you go.

115
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,760
I'm worried about you in here...

116
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,160
Don't worry.

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm fine.

118
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm just worried about you.

119
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,359
I know.

120
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,000
I know it all.

121
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Do you trust me?

122
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,119
Then listen to me.

123
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,839
You already have a plan?

124
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,640
You leave here

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,096
and help me with something.

126
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:12,760
Okay.

127
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,839
I understand.

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,079
Haven't you been
sleeping well these days?

129
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,200
You have dark circles.

130
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,239
Go back and get some rest.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,799
And eat on time.

132
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,480
Do you understand?

133
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,840
Go.

134
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,280
Please, Your Majesty, have mercy.

135
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,520
Forgive Yun Shu.

136
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,640
Please, Your Majesty...

137
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,159
She started

138
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,760
by kowtowing in His Majesty's chamber.

139
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,000
But His Majesty grew annoyed

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,159
and sent her back.

141
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,880
Then she continued in her own palace,

142
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,440
kowtowing towards
His Majesty's direction.

143
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,479
No one could persuade.

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,039
Forgive Yun Shu.

145
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,039
Please, Your Majesty, have mercy.

146
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,719
Forgive Yun Shu...

147
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
Let me go!

148
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,840
Let go!

149
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,119
Let go of me!

150
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,840
Put me down!

151
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,280
Put me down!

152
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,719
Put me down!

153
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,960
Let me go!

154
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,479
Let me go!

155
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,239
Let go...

156
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,760
How dare you! I'm your mother!

157
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:49,552
Don't ever mention the word
"mother" to me again.

158
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,080
Don't you understand how I've felt

159
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,160
