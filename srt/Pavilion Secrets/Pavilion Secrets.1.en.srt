1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
(Song Huanbei,)

2
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,719
(you truly puzzle me.)

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,520
Let's begin when you're ready.

4
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,360
Alright.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,440
(Back then,)

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,400
(it was you who risked your life
to save me in my time of peril.)

7
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,159
(but it was also you)

8
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:39,560
(who obstructed my plans at every turn.)

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,000
General, be careful!

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,439
(Who are you really?)

11
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,360
(what do you want?)

12
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,064
=Pavilion Secrets=

13
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:08,450
(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

14
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:12,160
=Episode 1=

15
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:15,020
(One Month Ago)

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,559
(Yun Shu, General of Xi,)

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,599
(has disguised herself
as a man for years.)

18
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,319
(Yet no one has ever
doubted her gender,)

19
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,400
(because she is ruthless.)

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,319
(Funeral)

21
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,400
(Yun Shu, General of Xi)
(Everyone in Xi knows)

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
(Yun Shu, General of Xi)
(that the handsome general)

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,160
(is also a cruel
and merciless living devil.)

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,319
(Funeral)

25
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,599
Everyone, rise up.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,919
Imperial Consort Yun

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,992
knew that Eunuch Zhang had passed away.

28
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:53,000
She sent me to bring back
one of his belongings, as a keepsake.

29
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,199
How about

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,080
taking these hands

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,199
that have served diligently,
even if not meritoriously?

32
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,360
Yun Shu!

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,919
How dare you disrespect Eunuch Zhang?

34
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,559
Presumptuous.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
General, be careful!

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,528
(Song Huanbei, a musician)

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,399
Are you...?

38
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,320
General, thank you for saving my life.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm Song Huanbei, a musician.

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,880
I've heard much about your fame

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,400
and admired you for a long time.

42
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,472
Please allow me
to stay with you, General.

43
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,120
You risked your life
to block the blade for me.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,720
So I won't abandon you.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Qian Yan,

46
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,640
take him back to the mansion
for treatment.

47
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,279
Yes.

48
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,399
I've asked around.

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,080
The guards at the gate said

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,679
Song Huanbei seemed
to have known in advance

51
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,919
that those men would attack you.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
This man is suspicious.

53
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,639
It was he who blocked the blade for me,

54
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,119
but his first words were

55
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,399
to thank me for saving his life.

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,080
- I'll have him expelled immediately.
- Wait.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,640
The mantis catching the cicada,
unaware of the golden oriole behind.

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,960
The more suspicious,
the more valuable to keep.

59
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,848
(Imperial Consort's Chamber)

60
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,208
(Yun Yi, Imperial Consort of Xi)

61
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,399
You're back.

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,519
Auntie,

63
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,200
look.

64
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,040
Do you think the new clothes
you bought me are pretty?

65
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,279
Do I look like your sister?

66
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,160
Really like her.

68
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,359
Quite pretty.

69
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,119
Making such a beautiful girl like you

70
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,200
dresses up as a man...

71
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,239
It's all my fault.

72
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,880
I did it willingly.

73
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,720
Besides, dressing up as a man
to lead troops and fight

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,880
is indeed more convenient.

75
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,600
Mind your behavior.

76
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,880
By the way,

77
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,720
Auntie,

78
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,600
I went to the Zhang mansion and chopped

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,720
off the hands of Eunuch Zhang.

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,240
If anyone dares to touch you again,
don't blame me for being rude.

81
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,839
Shu'er, this is a royal scandal.

82
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:26,000
It's not appropriate to make a fuss.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,760
I know.

84
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,440
Those people outside

85
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,600
think Eunuch Zhang

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
was killed for corruption.

87
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,040
He got off easy.

88
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,239
And that Wang Kui!

89
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,640
His death is not far off.

90
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,279
Look at you!

91
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,200
Not acting like a proper lady at all.

92
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,239
I called you here today

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,200
to assign you an important task.

94
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,279
It's you?

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,399
General.

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,840
You know there's a secret room here?

97
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
I don't know.

98
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,320
I'm here

99
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,079
to deliver soup to you.

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,239
I just passed by the study, thinking you
were still studying military matters.

101
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,519
So I made a bowl

102
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,200
of your favorite Five-flavor Soup.

103
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,200
And I brought it to you.

104
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm warning you.

105
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,160
Put aside your sneaky plans.

106
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,600
Our spies inside the palace
have passed on intelligence.

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,520
We suspect that General Yun was
the mastermind behind the Mo family's downfall.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,640
Our spies can't even
infiltrate the General's Mansion.

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,119
Yun Shu is also odd.

110
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,679
A man bearing the stigma
of keeping toy boys

111
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,119
yet never spending the night with them.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,200
Could he be dressing as a man?

113
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:01,440
Looks like

114
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,880
I'll have to meet

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,239
this renowned general
who's conquered the battlefield.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,880
General,

117
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,559
all of my thoughts

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,079
are on how to serve you.

119
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,839
It's late.

120
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,239
Let me serve you at night.

121
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,640
No need.

122
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,359
I have someone to serve me.

123
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,519
But as far as I know,

124
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,160
all the toy boys in the mansion

125
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,720
are already asleep.

126
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,720
What?

127
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,399
Do you want to meddle in my affairs?

128
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:47,920
I dare not.

129
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,640
Get out.

130
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,079
Yes.

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,119
I called you here today

132
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,079
to assign you an important task.

133
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,760
This is a tattoo on the back shoulder

134
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,000
of the head
of the Thousand Machines Pavilion.

135
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,920
Thousand Machines Pavilion?

136
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,239
The Thousand Machines Pavilion
is an intelligence agency

137
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,680
independent of all countries.

138
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,399
I fear they intend to overthrow

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,799
the court of Xi.

140
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,959
(Could he be the head
of the Thousand Machines Pavilion?)

141
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,239
General,

142
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
what are you doing?

143
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,479
What's that pattern on your shoulder?

144
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,720
General, you made a mistake.
There's no such pattern.

145
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,480
It's just the flickering candlelight.

146
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,479
You wanted to serve me, didn't you?

147
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,719
Go to the hot springs tomorrow

148
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,200
and clean yourself up first.

149
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,719
Yes.

150
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,520

sooner or later.)
