00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 19=

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,680
You go take a bath first.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,672
After going through so many days,

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,200
you've lost weight.

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,799
Wait, I'll cook you a bowl of noodles.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,640
(What's wrong with her today?)

9
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:01,919
Are you thirsty?

10
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:02,880
Have a cup of tea first.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,559
Okay.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Are you hungry?

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,360
Why are you so nice?

14
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:24,080
You're in prison because of me.

15
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,224
Of course, I should be nice to you.

16
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,680
Well,

17
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,199
this kindness

18
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,160
isn't enough.

19
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,599
What else do you want?

20
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,519
I want to hear you call me "sweetie".

21
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,599
Sweetie...

22
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,400
I didn't hear that.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,519
Say it again.

24
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,760
Actually,

25
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,639
I saw the marriage contract
you put in the box.

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,119
Don't open it yet.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,320
(Marriage Alliance Correspondence)

28
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:32,048
(I wish to tie my hair with yours
as companions, and never regret it.)

29
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:35,008
(Until the seas dry up
and the rocks crumble.)

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,080
May we grow old together

31
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,839
with no regrets.

32
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,120
Haven't you wanted
to confirm our relationship?

33
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,880
Sign your name,

34
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,399
and we'll exchange them.

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,720
Then I'll be your husband.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,839
We vow to be together,

37
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,752
our love enduring
like the sea and stone.

38
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,199
Yun Shu.

39
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,160
Song Huanbei.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,039
Kneeling in reverence.

41
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,744
(Yun Shu and Song Huanbei)

42
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,559
I know this is a bit hasty,

43
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,824
but after the Mo family's
case is resolved,

44
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,720
I'll give you a proper ceremony.

45
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,559
Engagement.

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,880
Setting the date.

47
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,888
Presenting gifts.

48
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,088
Inquiring about names.

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,568
I'll make up for everything.

50
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,040
What's wrong?

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,279
Did I scare you with my eagerness?

52
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,200
No.

53
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,079
It's just that I finally have a home.

Last night...

I don't remember anything
about last night.

70
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,959
I was asking,

71
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,679
did you sleep well last night?

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
I slept very well.

73
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,420
(I should stop teasing her.)

74
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,000
Come.

75

It doesn't hurt anymore.

78
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,279
What's wrong?

79
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,600
Nothing.

80
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
After your incident,

81
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,119
everyone was avoiding you
like the plague.

82
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,760

in front of His Majesty.

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440
She is my Auntie,

85
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,359
so she had to make an effort.

86
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,519
To avoid being seen

87
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,679

89
