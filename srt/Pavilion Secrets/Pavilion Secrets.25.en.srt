00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 25=

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,424
Commander Zhou's letter?

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
He said there are

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,328
many injured soldiers in the army.

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,072
He'll meet me once he's settled them.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,239
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,048
I couldn't protect
the soldiers completely.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,959
Shen Lan is perceptive.

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,880
If there were no casualties in the army,

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,520
he would definitely become suspicious.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,639
Then all our efforts would be in vain.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,479
By the way,

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,319
how is he?

16
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,768
He suffered some superficial injuries.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,119
To earn this glory,

18
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,799
he risked his life.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,279
Rest assured?

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,479
General, it's me.

21
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,400
Come in.

22
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:02,279
General,

23
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,160
all the spies have been identified.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,216
What should we do with them?

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,040
It's not the time to deal with them yet.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,199
Just monitor the information
they're spreading.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,599
Yes.

28
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:14,279
Let's not talk about that.

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,239
Madam Meng,

30
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,599
prepare a few appetizers in the kitchen.

31
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,599
These past few days,

32
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,279
you've barely eaten or drunk.

33
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:22,639
You need to eat on time.

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,279
I...

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,800
I have to go out with Madam Meng today.

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,959
I won't be eating at home.

37
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:31,080
Let's go.

38
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,199
You must have prayed for me, right?

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,199
As long as you're safe.

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,120
I knew it!

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,959
You're just harsh with your words.

42
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,839
When the knife flashed before my eyes,

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
do you know what I was thinking?

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,199
Don't say it anymore.

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,559
I was thinking

46
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,400
why I didn't hug you back then.

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
Stop it!

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
I was also thinking

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
if I survive this,

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,559
I'll definitely hug you tightly.

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,720
Look.

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Shen Lan,

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,520
what do you really want?

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,199
I want to be with you,

55
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,600
as a proper husband and wife.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
Please, I beg you.

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,199
Stop this, okay?

58
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,119
Liu Su.

59
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,440
Master.

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,759
What's this?

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,199
Letters from General.

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,240
So many.

63
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,720
What's General been busy with lately?

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
She doesn't allow me to say.

65
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,910
(Wang Long. Guo Yun. Du Haochuan.)

66
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,199
By the names, they should
all be from the Yun Family Army.

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,919
They're brothers

68
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,469
who've been through
thick and thin together.

69
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,960
It's only natural for her to miss them.

70
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,360
But,

71
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
for several days in a row,

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,039
she hasn't come to eat.

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
Are there so many injured soldiers?

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,216
And if there are injured soldiers,
she should visit them.

75
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,096
Why is she communicating
through letters?

76
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,240
Well,

77
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,919
why are you here?

78
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,600
What?

79
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,759
Not welcome?

80
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,119
No.

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,829
I'm just not feeling well,

82
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,832
so I want to rest early.

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,456
You don't like being kept in the dark,

84
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:52,912
but you're keeping secrets from me.

85
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,080
That's not fair, is it?

86
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,919
No.

87
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,320
Can I tell you about it later?

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,520
Okay.

89
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,559
Then you...

90
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,720
Can you explain this?

91
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,160
You read it?

92
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,960
No, I didn't read it.

93
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,160
I told you,

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,760
you're still you.

95
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,359
If you want to
visit the Yun Family Army,

96
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,200
you should go.

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,519
Why do you communicate like this?

98
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,200
I won't restrict you.

99
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,279
I know.

100
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,320
Then why do you still...

101
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,200
I just wanted to...

102
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:34,880
I just wanted to give you a gift!

103
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,399
That you're alive

104
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,160
is already the greatest gift
heaven has given me.

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
I don't want anything else.

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
Why not?

107
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,600
I don't need it.

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,239
You!

109
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:58,880
I want to use the armor plates
of the soldiers

110
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
to make you a suit of armor.

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,200
You said that you regretted

112
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
not protecting me.

113
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,880
You felt guilty.

114
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,799
But I just want to tell you

115
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,799
that I've been doing well these years.

116
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,760
The soldiers ate, slept,
and fought alongside me.

117
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,279
When you weren't here,

118
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,720
they fought by my side.

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
I wasn't alone.

120
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,320
You don't need
to feel guilty about the past.

121
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,519
Now I can protect myself.

122
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,799
And I can protect you too.

123
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,079
So...

124
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,079
But you don't want it.

125
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,079
Forget about it!

126
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,600
Who let you in?

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,959
I was wrong.

128
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,399
It's my fault.

129
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,752
I shouldn't have been
so presumptuous with the gift.

130
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,880
That's not true.

131
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,720
You made this?

133
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,239
It's a pity.

134
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,264
My sewing skills
aren't as good as yours.

135
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,959
Teach me, please.

136
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,784
Didn't you say you didn't want it?

137
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,920
Who said that?

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,480
I want it.

139
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,128
If you don't give it to me,
I won't leave.

140
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,160
Thank you.

141
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,640
I like this gift

142
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,440
a lot.

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Your Highness, it's confirmed.

144
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,119
Song Huanbei
is the deposed Crown Prince, Shen Mo.

145
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,839
Now it all makes sense.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's hard for him to gain my trust

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,000
by giving such a big gift
to the Yun Family Army.

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,040
Before, he wanted to join you,

149
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,799
probably to find out some secrets.

150
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,359
Should we eliminate him?

151
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:58,760
No.

152
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:00,679
He has a big use for us.

153
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,440
But if his identity...

154
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,679
I want it to be known!

155
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,359
Let the entire court hear

156
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,920
that the deposed Crown Prince
has returned.

157
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,480
Yes.

158
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
There's a needle sewn into this belt.

159
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,359
In case of need,

160
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,832
it can defend against enemies.

161
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,399
Don't worry.

162
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,959
When entering the court,

163
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,640
they'll search everyone,
so it's useless.

164
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,040
But what if?

165
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,640
Recently, rumors have been spreading
that you're the Crown Prince.

166
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
The deposed Crown Prince.

167
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,200
Is that the point?

168
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,519
These rumors
are obviously Shen Lan's doing.

169
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,000
He's always been determined
to ascend the throne.

170
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,279
And now, suddenly, there's another you.

171
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm worried he might take action.

172
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm not completely unprepared.

173
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,119
You have a plan?

174
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,279
Yes.

175
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,279
What plan?

176
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,399
You.

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,679
If anything happens to me,

178
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,070
you'll lead the Army to rescue me.

179
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:53,880
Stop joking.

180
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,079
Don't worry.

181
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm going.

182
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,069
His Highness was delayed,

183
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,952
so you may proceed
to see His Majesty first.

184
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,070
Do I need to remove my armor?

185
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,839
No need.

186
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,679
(Wait a little longer.)

187
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,599
(In a few days,)

188
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,640
(you'll be my rightful wife.)

189
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,320
His Majesty...
