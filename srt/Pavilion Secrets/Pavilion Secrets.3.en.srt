00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,350
(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 3=

4
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,920
Master Song has arranged everything.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,159
General, please follow me.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,120
The Hongxiu Pavilion is
conveniently located.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,760
There are many guests coming and going.
If discovered, it's easy to escape.

8
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:33,319
Wang Kui's private room

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,080
is in the courtyard at the back.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,279
He's urging me for new girls right now.

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,720
Sir, your new girl has arrived.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,680
Search her.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,520
(Trying to tie me up?
Fortunately, I had a plan.)

14
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,360
She's clean.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Come in.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,680
You're new here?

17
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:19,440
Yes.

18
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:23,824
(Wang Kui, Commander
of the Imperial Guard of Xi)

19
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,400
Raise your head.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,199
You...

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,400
Your face...

22
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,000
What's wrong?

23
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,720
Looks like a devil I know.

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,519
Someone asked me
to deliver a message to you.

25
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,400
It's not good to let others hear.

26
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,319
Guards!

27
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,559
Yes.

28
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,480
Get her out.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,959
Yes.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,639
(Such a nice young lady.)

31
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,960
(Why endure this humiliation?)

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,199
Why not hear the message first, Sir?

33
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,399
Have a drink.

34
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,880
Then I'll listen.

35
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,240
Love-Inducing Incense!

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,279
The antidote is in the wine.

37
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,520
But you don't drink it.

38
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,240
Deliver the message?

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,279
You're here to bring me bad news!

40
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,080
Speak!

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,839
Did Yun Shu send you?

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,520
I'll torture

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,440
you first before I die.

44
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,160
(Not using your secret technique yet?)

45
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,399
(This birthmark is similar
to my junior sister's.)

46
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,639
(Could it be...)

47
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,839
- Hurry and chase him!
- Yes.

48
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,400

(When she wakes up,)

55
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,320

Don't worry.

61
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,399
(If my junior sister were still alive,
she would be around this age too.)

62
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,079
I slept with him?

63
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:07,160
You're awake.

64
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,840
Are you thirsty?

65
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,880
Do you feel dizzy?
Is there anything else bothering you?

66
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,760
Well...

67
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,600
Don't worry.
I'll take responsibility for you.

68
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,880
But don't try to scam me.

69
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,399
The sedative is harmful.

70
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,839
General, take the medicine first.

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
You changed my clothes?

72
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,200
Madam Meng, the madam
of the Hongxiu Pavilion,

73
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
is a member
of Thousand Machines Pavilion.

74
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,800
She helped you change.

75
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,399
Thank you.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,720

81
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Where's our general?

82
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,440
I don't know.

83
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,880
What?

84
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,959
Our general went out with you.

85
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,399
Now you're back alone.

86
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,399
Where's the general?

87
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,279
I'm just a groom.

88
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
Where he goes is his freedom.

89
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,480
He doesn't take you wherever he goes.
How could he take me?

90
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,519
That's true.

91
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,880
Look for him somewhere else.

92
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,839
He's gone?

93
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,720
Where did the general
take you yesterday?

94
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,799
