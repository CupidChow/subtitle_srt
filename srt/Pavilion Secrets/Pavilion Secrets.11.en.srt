00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,350
(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 11=

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,680
Know what?

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:18,959
What secret are you hiding from me?

6
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,239
Where is Su Shan?

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,799
Physician Su is dead.

8
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:33,240
He tried to retrieve Mother's diary

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,200
but unfortunately fell victim
to the Mo's traps.

10
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:44,976
(Daily Life Record of Yun Yin)

11
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:03,720
Yes.

12
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,040
Yes!

13
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,720
This is my sister's handwriting.

14
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,720
So,

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,919
I am indeed Yun Yin's daughter.

16
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,160
And you are truly my auntie.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,239
I have a family, and I'm not an orphan.

18
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,839
Years ago, His Majesty

19
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,120
ordered the execution
of the Mo's nine clans.

20
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,440
But before the edict arrived,

21
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,950
a massive fire broke out
in the Mo's Arsenal Valley.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,239
How did you manage to rescue me?

23
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:42,160
(Twelve Years Ago)

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,000
Years ago,

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,919
the border was overrun by the enemy.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,279
Countless civilians died.

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,239
Some speculated

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,519
that the Mo family
had leaked the city's defenses.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,680
Worried about my sister,

30
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,888
I immediately led a team
to the Arsenal Valley.

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,480
But the fire had already
engulfed everything.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,279
Sister!

33
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,279
Sister!

34
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,080
Sister!

35
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,919
Sister!

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,839
Sister!

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,720
Sister!

38
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,088
I'll take you away.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,600
I...

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,039
I'm dying.

41
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,119
I can't go now.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Save Shu'er.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,839
Save her!

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,960
I promise you.

45
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,240
Sister,

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,440
let's leave here, okay?

47
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,679
Don't seek revenge.

48
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,160
To

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,360
be safe.

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,240
Okay. I promise you!

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,279
I promise you, sister!

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,320
Sister!

53
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,839
Sister!

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Return to the palace.

55
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,399
His Majesty has issued an order

56
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,800
to investigate the Mo's treason.

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,680
No one will be spared.

58
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,240
Taking her back to the palace now

59
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,576
would be like walking into a trap.

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
Move aside!

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,880
That private soldier was a farmer's son.

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,072
He brought you back
to his village for treatment.

63
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,320
After the Mo's matter settled,

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,919
I, under the guise of a private visit,

65
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,240
brought you back,

66
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,759
now memoryless.

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,039
Shu'er.

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,728
Offer an incense stick

69
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,240
for your mother.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,119
All these years,

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,296
you've been secretly
offering prayers to my mother.

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,880
His Majesty forbids all things
related to the Mo family.

73
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,079
I could only secretly

74
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,000
set up an altar in my chambers.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,288
Did the Mo family
really betray the country?

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,519
Shu'er,

77
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,079
your mother's last words

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,336
were for you not to care about the past

79
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,640
and not to seek revenge.

80
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,600
I have Mo's blood in me.

81
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,519
How can I not ask?

82
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,040
I've reviewed the Mo's archives,

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,904
and there are many inconsistencies.

84
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,760
The Mo family was
indeed wrongfully accused.

85
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,320
But this matter is already settled.

86
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,399
We can't change it now.

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,872
This case involves
many powerful factions.

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,239
Shu'er,

89
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,040
promise me.

90
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,279
Stop investigating, okay?

91
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:05,559
Shu'er,

92
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,000
I have some matters to attend to.

93
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,559
You should go back now.

94
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,239
Okay.

95
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,519
Wait.

96
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,000
What did you hear?

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,399
Hey,

98
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,959
what are you doing?

99
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,176
My foster father is gone.

100
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,600
And you need someone

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
to take care of you.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,239
What's wrong?

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,559
Are you troubled?

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,679
I want to do something

105
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,239
that no one understands

106
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:07,359
and no one supports.

107
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,640
This matter,

108
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,920
if successful, might not
bring me any benefits,

109
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,559
but if it fails, I might lose my life.

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,200
I support you,

111
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,600
and I will be with you.

112
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,640
You...

113
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,464
Are you trying to clear
the name of the Mo family?

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,176
I don't believe the Mo family
would betray the country.

115
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,119
Neither do I.

116
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,519
I'll be with you

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,359
to clear

118
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,799
the Mo family's name.

119
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,519
Greetings, Your Highness.

120
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,279
I've said it before.

121
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,160
The deposed Crown Prince is dead.
Don't mention it again.

122
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,760
Yes.

123
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,560
(Deposed Crown Prince?)

124
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,239
In the 127th year of the Xi,

125
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,119
the deposed Crown Prince Shen Mo

126
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,200
died in the fire at the Arsenal Valley
of the Mo family.

127
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,640
Shen Mo...

128
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,279
It's late.

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,832
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

130
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,320
I can't sleep.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,959
Waiting for news.

132
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,399
What news?

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,799
Nothing.

134
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,600
Let's play a game of chess.

135
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,119
Let's use

136
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,239
this jar of wine as the stake.

137
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:46,959
Okay.

138
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,760
The Thousand Machines Pavilion
is free and easy in the world.

139
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,239
Why did you come back to the Xi

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,792
and get involved in court?

141
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
I have no interest in politics.

142
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,760
I came back

143
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,399
for the Mo family.

144
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a pity
that your talents are wasted.

145
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,799
And you?

146
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,679
Why do you dress as a man?

147
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,359
I wish I could dress as a woman,

148
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,760
but unfortunately,

149
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:22,272
the Xi doesn't allow ladies
to hold official positions.

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,320
Let alone lead troops into battle.

151
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,079
If I were the emperor of the Xi,

152
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,160
the first thing

153
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,880
I would do is abolish the law

154
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,000
that ladies can't be officials.

155
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,359
Your move.

156
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,239
Why would you make such an assumption?

157
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,320
Just a casual remark.

158
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,520
Don't take it seriously.

159
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,920
You are Shen Mo,
the deposed Crown Prince of the Xi?

160
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,479
I've been waiting for you all night.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Finally, you said it.

162
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,719
So, are you?

163
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,559
That's right.

164
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,359
I am the deposed Crown Prince of Xi,

165
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,440
Shen Mo.
