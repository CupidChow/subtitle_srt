4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,079
It can't be Shu'er.

5
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,319
Auntie.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,840
Shu'er,

7
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:32,240
it's really you!

8
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:34,599
Auntie,

9
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:36,240
what's wrong with your head...?

10
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:38,479
I'm fine.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
Are you okay?

12
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,040
Does Song Huanbei

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,959
treat you well?

14
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:52,720
Well,

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,400
he treats me extremely well.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,720
Has Shen Lan caused you any trouble?

17
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,759
No.

18
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,319
After all, I'm his mother.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,872
He wouldn't dare do anything to me.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,599
Auntie...

21
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,000
You pleaded for me in the throne room.

22
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:21,639
I...

23
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:23,480
Silly girl.

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,599
Family members shouldn't be
so formal with each other.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,720
My sister's death was because of me.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,919
You're not wrong about that.

27
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,000
Back then,

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,199
when I learned
that Eunuch Zhang and Wang Kui

29
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,680
were coming to capture the Mo family,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,040
I secretly met with them.

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,112
No need to care
about the rest of the Mo family.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,599
Just rescue Yun Yin and Yun Shu for me.

33
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,319
I'll ensure you live a comfortable life

34
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,639
for the rest of your days.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,519
Your Highness,

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,199
Yun Yin and Yun Shu

37
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,040
are both on our wanted list.

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,800
If we're missing two people...

39
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,080
Well...

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,759
We can't report back without them.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,000
I've already considered that for you.

42
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,472
First, bring them
to the entrance of the valley.

43
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,199
I'll meet you there.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,639
Then set fire to the mountain.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,600
Destroy the evidence.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,039
Naturally, no one will suspect you.

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,080
These deeds to the city properties
are just a down payment.

48
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,800
After the job is done,

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440
there will be a generous reward.

50
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,479
But what I didn't expect was...

51
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,919
They took the money

52
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,919
but didn't do the job.

53
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,080
I waited and waited
at the entrance of the valley,

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,559
but neither you nor my sister showed up.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,839
So I led my troops in.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,399
Shu'er,

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
you know

58
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,320
what happened next.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,679
(I'm guilty.)

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,240
(If I hadn't been so "clever",)

61
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,800
(my sister might still be alive.)

62
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,600
(Auntie,)

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
(don't be too hard on yourself.)

64
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,039
(It was a death trap that the Mo family)

65
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,160
(was framed back then.)

66
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,600
(No one could have saved my mother.)

67
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:56,976
(General's Mansion)

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,080
What?

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,688
You want to behave like a lady?

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,839
Aren't you already a lady?

71
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,520
Look at me.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,720
Do I look like one?

73
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,039
When Huanbei and I are together,

74
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,600
we're look like homosexuality.

75
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,000
Did he really say that?

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,559
No.

77
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,759
I said it myself.

78
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,168
You don't look much like one.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
Just teach me the basics
of walking, sitting

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,559
and standing.

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,839
(Getting married)

82
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,640
(can really change
a person's personality?)

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,679
Walk a few steps.

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,920
No lady walks like that.

85
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:43,200
Let me show you.

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,799
Walk a few steps

87
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,679
with this vase.

88
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,040
Walk.

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,959
If you drop this again,

90
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,640
you won't get dinner tonight.

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
Although my father
released Song Huanbei,

92
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,160
he's recently been intending
to let me oversee the country.

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Right now,

94
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,959
the imperial edict is on its way.

95
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,279
Your Highness, you should be cautious.

96
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,559
I think,

97
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,519
His Majesty's move is somewhat unusual.

98
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,000
The throne

99
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,320
will be mine sooner or later.

100
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,239
Song Huanbei,

101
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,359
