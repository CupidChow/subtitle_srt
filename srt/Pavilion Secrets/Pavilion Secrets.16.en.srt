(Adapted from "Pavilion Secrets"
by Huang Fanfan and Ji Wuyun)

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 16=

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,984
Isn't it good to be
a leisurely prince consort?

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,920
At least you won't have
to endure the hardships

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,079
of fighting battles anymore.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,920
Our general is ambitious and invincible.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,079
He's not like your master.

9
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,479
Stop arguing.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,799
What about your hand?

11
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,680
Madam Meng had me
chopping wood all night yesterday.

12
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,479
She only let me come back this morning.

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,080
I thought

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,279
you could do something...

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,959
What?

16
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,279
Liu Su. Qian Yan.
Go outside and guard the door.

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,720
Yes.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,472
I've been waiting for you.

19
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:52,599
Help me think of a way.

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
Are you preparing

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,439
to submit a petition?

22
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:58,880
According to the laws,

23
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:00,944
prince consorts cannot hold real power.

24
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,000
The arranged marriage

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,280
is a way to curry favor,

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,640
but also a way to seize power.

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,680
Since the edict hasn't been issued,

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,160
there's still room for maneuvering.

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,120
So, how do you plan to write it?

30
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,160
How about saying

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,279
I'm still young,

32
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,856
and not yet considering marriage.

33
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,440
I want to fight
for another twenty years.

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,400
Not bad.

35
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,239
What?

36
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:22,879
This clearly sounds fake.

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,959
How about this?

38
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:27,319
Listen to me.

39
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,816
I'll dictate, and you write.

40
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,160
Listen to Madam Meng.

41
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,392
She has many clever ideas.

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,559
Your Majesty, I dare not
marry the princess.

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,839
Because I have a difficult secret.

44
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:42,040
In the 136th year of Xi,

45
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,919
I led my troops on a western campaign.

46
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
But I fell from my horse

47
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,352
and injured a certain part.

48
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,760
Make sure to clarify which part.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,728
You need to write
those two words clearly.

50
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,480
Which part?

51
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,400
Well,

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,760
the thing people think you have,

53
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,239
but you actually don't.

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,400
Continue writing.

55
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,479
I'm not fortunate enough

56
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,600
to make princess happy.

57
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,679
Please revoke the order, Your Majesty.

58
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:20,919
This...

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,440
Will it work?

60
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,039
I'm worried...

61
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,440
When you had all those toy boys before,

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,119
I didn't see you hesitate like this.

63
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,279
I heard

64
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,839
once a lady has a loved one,

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
she becomes especially timid.

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,440
Qian Yan.

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,880
Send the petition to the palace.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,479
General...

69
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:54,919
Go.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
This trick might work on His Majesty,

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,392
but Shen Lan wanted the military power.

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,000
He won't let it go so easily.

73
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,528
We need to prepare ourselves.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,360
Understood?

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,960
Don't move.

76
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,199
His Majesty sent it to replenish
the General's yang energy.

77
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:15,479
He said to treat a dead horse
like a live one.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,640
That's all you say?

79
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,320
Aren't you upset?

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,040
Why be upset about a gift?

81
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,880
Because the General
is a man of great integrity.

82
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:31,839
This kind of gift

83
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,440
hurts one's pride.

84
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,239
I've been with the General
for so many years,

85
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,399
and I never knew the General was...

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,200
He was...

87
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,440
During that western expedition,

88
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,880
it's all my fault
for not being by his side.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
Have you ever thought

90
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
that Madam Meng's petition
might be a ruse?

91
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:57,359
That's impossible.

92
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,440
That would be treason.

93
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
If the General committed treason,

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,119
he would be torn apart by five horses.

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
(This idiot)

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,359
(still can't tell)

97
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,359
(that General is a lady.)

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,040
Yun Shu.

99
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,679
Yun Shu!

100
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,040
Yun Shu.

101
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,799
Why are you avoiding me today?

102
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,440
Mo,

103
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,799
you crossed the line.

104
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,399
What's wrong?

105
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
We can't be like this.

106
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,640
What?

107
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,880
No kissing, hugging,
or lulling to sleep.

108
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,839
None of that is allowed.

109
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,720
What do you really think of me?

110
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,040
Your junior sister?

111
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:31,880
Ally?

112
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,160
Or something else?

113
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,920
Leading troops into battle?

114
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,839
Accidentally fell from the horse?

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,760
She's really gone to such lengths

116
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,920
just for this military power.

117
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,904
His Majesty feels sorry
for the princess.

118
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,000
He's rescinded the order

119
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,959
and comforted Yun Shu thoroughly.

120
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,239
My father was on the fence

121
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,000
about this marriage.

122
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,760
If she can send a petition
to the palace,

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,320
then why can't I?

124
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,160
Your Highness, there's another matter.

125
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,368
A new person named Madam Meng
is in the Yun mansion.

126
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,239
It's said she's the widow
of a personal guard

127
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:16,040
of the deposed Crown Prince Shen Mo.

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,320
Shen Mo?

129
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,079
Truly a haunting specter.

130
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Keep a close eye on her.

131
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,239
Yes.

132
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,559
Who's cursing me?

133
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,399
I think

134
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,000
someone must be thinking of you.

135
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,239
Please stop teasing me.

136
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,359
With your affections reciprocated,

137
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,000
what are you hesitating about?

138
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,239
We both carry

139
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,399
too much burden.

140
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,480
I once had someone I admired.

141
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,559
He was one

142
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,359
of the personal guards of Master before.

143
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,399
I had the chance to marry him,

144
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,839
but at the time, I thought

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,160
I wanted to wait

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,559
until he resigned from his position

147
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,959
and became an ordinary man.

148
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,000
Then I would marry him.

149
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,320
But that wait

150
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,079
was a lifetime.

151
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,720
He died in that great fire.

152
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,600
Tea leaves in water

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,039
are but two states:
floating and sinking.

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
The tea drinker

155
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,960
is but two actions: picking up

156
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,320
and putting down.

157
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,679
Since you can't let go,

158
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,799
why do you leave regrets for yourself?

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,039
His Majesty has rescinded
the order of marriage.

160
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,159
In the short term, Crown Prince Shen Lan

161
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,520
should also not take any action.

162
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,520
Give me your hand.

163
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,479
Tonight is the Double Seventh Festival.

164
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,599
Don't waste this precious time.

165
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,792
(Moon shining on the west tower
is our first meeting.)

166
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,000
(Moon shining on the west tower)

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,904
(is our first meeting.)

168
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,239
Mo.

169
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,599
Mo.

170
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Mo.

171
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,239
Mo.

172
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,736
I gave the servants
in the mansion a holiday.

173
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,359
So it'll be convenient for you
to wear lady's clothes.

174
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,080
Yesterday, you asked me

175
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,320
what I considered you to be.

176
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,799
I can tell you now.

177
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,544
I don't want you to be my junior sister.

178
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
I don't want to be friends with you.

179
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
I want to be your husband,

180
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,512
and grow old together.

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,039
You...

182
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,760
How do you feel about me?

183
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,280
I...

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,159
I don't know.

185
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,799
This is too sudden.

186
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,440
You know it.

187
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,919
I thought you were kind to me

188
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,359
just because
of our fellow disciple bond.

189
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,119
At first, it was indeed that.

190
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,000
