=Episode 20=

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,920
Congratulations, Master Song.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,760
Happy wedding day!

6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,040
General,

7
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:28,832
His Majesty has secretly
arranged your marriage to him.

8
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:30,280
Arranged marriage?

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
From now on,

10
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,599
you are my fiancée.

11
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,279
Master,

12
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:51,759
even though it's a new marriage,

13
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,080
you just got out of prison,

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,799
don't overindulge.

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,199
Are you tired?

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,496
Someone's there.

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,839
Why are you afraid?

18
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,000
We're truly married.

19
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,239
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,279
If they want to watch, let them watch.

21
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,120
Are you exhausted?

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
I prepared some appetizers for you.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,080
Eat some too.

24
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,600
I need to hurry up,

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,856
and practice my swordplay.

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
It's almost evening.

27
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,639
It's time to rest.

28
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,839
I'm just an ordinary civilian now.

29
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,000
I need to find a way to make a living.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Or else,

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,199
I can't just sit here,

32
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,080
spending all my money.

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,048
As the head of the Thousand
Machines Pavilion, I can't support you?

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,759
Madam Meng said,

35
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:57,919
men can't be relied on.

36
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,199
That's right, but as your

37
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,544
senior brother, I'm your family.

38
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,759
My shoulder will always
be there for you to lean on.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,479
Sometimes,

40
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,880
I also want to be your support.

41
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,199
General,

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,360
Imperial Consort Yun
sent something over.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,960
What is it?

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,919
Send it back!

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,056
Tell her I don't want it.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,399
Imperial Consort Yun said
you could refuse everything else,

47
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,160
but there's one thing you must accept.

48
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,670
(General's Mansion)

49
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,440
To celebrate General's new marriage,

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,936
Imperial Consort Yun has sent a gift.

51
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,440
I'm no longer a general.

52
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,639
Take it back.

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,839
She already anticipated
that you would say so.

54
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,199
Her Highness said

55
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,720
please accept this sachet.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,119
She said,

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,880
she doesn't want you to hurt yourself

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,800
because you hate her.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,720
(I don't need it anymore.)

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,799
Mo...

61
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,359
It hurts.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,959
Let me go!

63
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,839
If you get rid of it,
you can live peacefully.

64
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,079
Let me go!

65
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,640
Yun Shu, behave yourself.

66
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,679
Actually, the reason you
were pardoned this time

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,920
was because Imperial Consort Yun knelt

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,480
before His Majesty for days and nights.

69
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,119
Imperial Consort Yun
didn't let them tell you.

70
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,600
Tomorrow,

71
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,600
go visit her.

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,760
(The Ancestral Tablet
of the Eldest Sister Yun Yin)

73
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,119
Auntie.

74
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,880
It can't be Shu'er.

75
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,160
Auntie.

76
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,440
Shu'er,

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,839
