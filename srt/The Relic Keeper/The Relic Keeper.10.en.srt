2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,070
Dear friends

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,280
and customers,

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm Zhou.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,120
(Pastry Zhou)
I'm the shopkeeper of Pastry Zhou.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,830
So, what do you sell pastries or zhou?
[*zhou: the same meaning as congee]

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,710
Of course pastries.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,410
These are all top-notch pastries
in my shop.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,120
But just the day before yesterday,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,300
unfortunately,

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,750
my pastries were stolen.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,920
So, there's only congee left then?

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,110
Help me take care of them.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,320
Take it easy.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,470
Although this case may not be very big,

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,790
the constables who took it

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,670
all marveled at it.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,470
Why?

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,430
Well, let me tell you the story.

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,200
My shop is quite big, right?

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,030
The money flows in and out
like water every day.

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,000
Apart from large amounts of money,

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,470
there are piles of gold and silver.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,200
Why on earth did the thief

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,200
steal my pastries?

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,430
Come on, just go ahead.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,920
There's only one reason,

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,790
and that is,

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,760
they're just too yummy.

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,480
Oh, come on.

31
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,200
People will stop
for the smell of pastries

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,870
and start smacking their lips
when they see them.

33
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,350
Compared to pastries of other shops,

34
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,950
mine are much better.

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,590
But words alone are not enough,

36
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,850
let the pastries speak for themselves.

37
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,500
For just today!

38
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,730
- (Yummy Stolen Pastries: Jail Worth It)
- The similar ones

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,840
are on sale at a 20% discount.

40
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,640
I'm not buying it.

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,430
What kind of fool
would only steal pastries

42
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,480
and not take the money?

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,790
It's not up to me.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,150
And it's even less up to you.

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,760
It's up to the county magistrate.

46
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,430
Shopkeeper Zhou,
it seems you're busy for your business.

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,400
You can't even go to identify the criminal.

48
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,680
I have to bring the person here myself.

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,590
Sir, I'm sorry for that.

50
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,870
But the reason why I invite you here

51
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,640
is to let everyone see

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
your hard work.
You're like a second father to us.

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,770
What's this?

54
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,510
(Bringing Peace to the World,
Benefiting the Locals)

55
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,280
This is a token of my gratitude for you.

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
You must accept it.

57
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,400
As an official in this place,

58
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,840
this is all part of my duty.

59
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,960
Oh, I really can't accept this.

60
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
In such a short time

61
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,630
you caught the thief,

62
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,400
and thus you've ensured the safety
of us merchants.

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,590
If you can't accept it, who can?

64
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,400
Well, I'm really ashamed.

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
You deserve it.

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,190
Hello? What are you guys celebrating?

67
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,430
Shouldn't you identify the criminal first?

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
Right, right.

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,360
There should be a proper procedure.

70
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,550
Shopkeeper Zhou,

71
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,920
is it her?

72
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,430
Yes, it's her.

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm really ashamed to accept it,

74
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,840
- really ashamed.
- No, no,

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,750
- you deserve it.
- I'm ashamed.

76
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,630
Hey!

77
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,560
Didn't you say you only saw a back view?

78
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,870
Turn around.

79
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,030
You, turn around.

80
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,360
Shopkeeper Zhou,

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,400
is it her?

82
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,280
Yes, it is.

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
Well, I really don't deserve it.

84
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,470
Surely you do.

85
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,630
Hey!

86
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,000
You'd better take a close look at me.

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,630
I just arrived yesterday.

88
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,240
How could I have stolen your things?

89
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,030
Well,

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,910
Shopkeeper Zhou has been so sincere

91
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,430
that you should admit it, right?

92
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,400
What?

93
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
You're just playing with my life!

94
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,400
Yeah, she's right!

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
Take her away.

96
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,430
Go!

97
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,630
Go!

98
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,590
It's her.

99
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
It's her.

100
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
- Stop shouting!
- Here, here.

101
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,310
What a coincidence, Manager Zhang.

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,870
There was a poisoner in the mansion.

103
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm here to catch the guy.

104
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,910
How could such a thing happen?

105
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,360
Where is the poisoner?

106
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
It's her.

107
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,800
That is to say,

108
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,590
it's the lady who has already
been captured by me.

109
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,630
What nonsense are you talking, madam?

110
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,030
I don't know you at all.

111
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,910
Sir,

112
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,190
here is the thing.

113
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,120
Yesterday on the street,

114
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,120
I met this lady

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
and bought some expensive pastries
form her.

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,430
After I returned to the mansion,

117
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,190
I fed them to the wild geese for a try,

118
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,520
and they all died.

119
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,590
Clearly, her pastries are poisonous.

120
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,270
Yaoyao,

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,710
what kind of pastries did you buy?

122
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,590
- Lotus cakes.
- Right.

123
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,590
Cakes of lotus seeds.

124
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Right.

125
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
And honey cakes.

126
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,310
Yes, that's right.

127
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,310
Shopkeeper Zhou, these are clearly

128
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,710
the pastries from your shop.

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,190
Congratulations,
you've solved two cases in a row.

130
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,750
Now the case is clear.

131
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,510
First, the lady who claims to be Xiaoyue

132
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,310
stole the pastries
from Shopkeeper Zhou's shop,

133
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,390
and then the stingy Yaoyao

134
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,720
bumped into her.

135
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,600
What goes around

136
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,750
comes around.

137
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,190
The pastries were poisonous.

138
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,560
And the evidence is solid enough.

139
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,510
What else do you...

140
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,160
Qin, something's not right here.

141
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
It makes sense!

142
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,270
The wild geese died

143
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
because they had the pastries.

144
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,270
The pastries are hers.

145
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,720
And she stole them
from Shopkeeper Zhou's shop.

146
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
I think you're a hardened criminal.

147
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
If it weren't for the poison
in Zhou's pastries,

148
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,160
it would really be hard for me
to convict you.

149
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,120
No, no,

150
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,190
her pastries have nothing to do with me.

151
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
How can it have nothing to do with you?

152
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,160
It is you who had something stolen.

153
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,310
No, I just remember that

154
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,120
nothing was stolen from my shop.

155
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,630
I haven't lost anything.

156
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,720
I haven't!

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,750
Shopkeeper Zhou,

158
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,560
you reported the case yourself.

159
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,190
This can't be a joke.

160
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,270
Sir, look at my memory,

161
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,630
what I lost... well,

162
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,310
I already found it.

163
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
I was so excited that

164
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,920
I forgot to go to cancel the case.

165
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm really confounded,

166
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,390
really.

167
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,310
What about this lady?

168
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,190
I've never seen her, for sure.

169
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,000
There's no connection at all.

170
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,750
Dear friends,

171
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,270
this lady

172
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,630
has nothing to do with me.

173
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,120
If you still want to buy something,

174
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,160
I have even better ones in my shop.

175
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,390
You can go inside and choose some.

176
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,960
Withdraw it.

177
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,160
The gift will be sent to you later.

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,390
Come on, I don't deserve it.

179
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,270
You do, you do.

180
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,640
The case has been dropped.

181
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,600
Let me go.

182
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,030
Let you go?

183
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,510
Answer my question,

184
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,600
why did you poison people?

185
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Qin,

186
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,440
put another pair of shackles on her.

187
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,950
The case has escalated.

188
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,360
I didn't sell them to her.

189
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,480
It was she who stole them.

190
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,680
What's going on with you two?

191
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
Why do you become the victim?

192
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,830
What?

193
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,630
Stop talking nonsense.

194
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Who, who took your pastries?

195
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,190
Do you think this reason is okay?

196
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
You just said it yourself.

197
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Now you won't admit it.

198
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,870
What did I say?

199
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,750
It's you who always lose stuff.
How can you blame it on me?

200
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,800
Me?

201
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,430
It must be you who took it
without asking me!

202
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,870
You're always moving my stuff around.

203
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,120
You're always forgetful.

204
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,630
- Why can't I tide it up?
- Fine, fine.

205
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,920
If you didn't always follow me around,

206
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,310
how would you know I lost something?

207
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,270
In such a big world,

208
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,530
I can go wherever I want.

209
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,040
If it weren't for you
deciding on your own,

210
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,430
would you have gone to
look for me that day?

211
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,820
If you didn't look for me,
would you be here?

212
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,070
If you weren't here, would I be here?

213
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,040
If I weren't here,
would such a big thing happen to us?

214
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,310
Stop, stop.

215
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,240
Calm down, you two.

216
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,040
There must be some misunderstanding.

217
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Yes,

218
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,120
it must be because
the pastries were too dry

219
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,270
and the wild geese choked to death.

220
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,160
They choked to death.

221
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,230
Yes!

222
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
How wise you are!

223
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,560
They choked to death.

224
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
Yes.

225
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,870
Well, it's over.

226
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,390
You can sort it out by yourselves.

227
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,300
Somebody, let the lady go.

228
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
Let's go back to the government office.

229
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
- Be quick.
- OK.

230
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,040
You guys can go home now.

231
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,230
Let's go.

232
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,870
Anyway,

233
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,310
the wild geese in the mansion

234
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,720
died after having your pastries.

235
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,950
- You have to compensate.
- I...

236
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,950
She definitely has no money.

237
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,120
Then what should we do?

238
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Manager Zhang,

239
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,160
why not let her work
as a maid in the mansion

240
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,390
until she pays off the debt?

241
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,390
That's a good idea.

242
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,190
We're just short of people.

243
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,390
Especially for your position,

244
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,800
the turnover is too high.

245
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,110
Me...

246
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,000
me?

247
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
Hey,

248
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,000
he is just a cranky old guy.

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,910
What are you talking about?

250
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
Xiaoyue,

251
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,270
- Let me take a look.
- Mom.

252
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,120
I miss you so much,

253
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,160
- my dear Xiaoyue.
- Fine.

254
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,920
Let me take a close look.

255
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,640
Are you okay?

256
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,560
Yeah.

257
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,830
Mom, have you suffered?

258
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,600
I'm good.

259
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,160
You're also good, right?

260
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,270
I slept in a prison cell last night.

261
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,390
My poor dear,

262
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,030
but tonight you can sleep with me.

263
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,120
Are you happy?

264
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,630
That must be a bit better
than the prison cell.

265
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,240
How did you get here?

266
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,320
I came over from this wall.

267
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,320
I also came from here.

268
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,910
It seems the wall is the key.

269
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,670
It should be that painting.

270
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,390
I have an identical one in my office.

271
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,080
It's very likely the same one.

272
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,510
This painting looks quite ordinary.

273
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,670
There are several in this mansion.

274
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,960
For the one in the maid's room,

275
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,270
what's so special about it?

276
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,000
But this is our only clue now.

277
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,550
Where's my body?

278
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
You mean Yaoyao?

279
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,600
She didn't make it.

280
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Well, after we go back,

281
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,670
I'll figure out a way
to swap you two back.

282
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,670
I don't really mind.

283
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,840
If we can't swap back,

284
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,000
it's okay for me.

285
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,240
It's just that Yaoyao,

286
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,480
an eighteen or nineteen-year-old girl,

287
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,320
all of a sudden,

288
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,030
becomes an old lady
in her fifties or sixties.

289
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,360
She may get much trauma.

290
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,150
Don't you have any trauma?

291
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,510
I'm an old lady in my fifties or sixties.

292
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,030
Suddenly, I become eighteen.

293
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,550
Speaking of trauma,

294
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,440
it would be the one in the hearts of boys.

295
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,750
Well, think about it.

296
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,000
At an age when you do nothing

297
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,510
but have fun all day,

298
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,910
suddenly you have to
start all over again:

299
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,840
going to school, looking for a job,
finding a partner,

300
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,550
and again looking for a job,
finding a partner,

301
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,500
getting married, having children,
and educating them.

302
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,270
You have to do them again.

303
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,840
Mom, you should work hard for that.

304
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
Oh dear, help me swap back!

305
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,660
That's for sure.

306
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,240
You're essentially
from the Western Han Dynasty.

307
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,550
How can you stay in the modern world?

308
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,120
Why?

309
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,670
We've time-traveled.

310
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,670
We have to avoid leaving traces
in history.

311
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,240
Otherwise, everything would be in a mess.

312
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,870
You didn't leave any, right?

313
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,550
No,

314
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,960
I just brought a bag

315
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
and hid it well.

316
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,150
Besides your stuff,
words are not allowed either.

317
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,630
I can't even write with a brush.

318
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,630
That's good.

319
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,320
(Then write something about me.)

320
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,390
I have a daughter,

321
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,240
Xiaoyue.

322
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,550
She thinks I talk too much,
give her too little space,

323
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,080
type too much, and even meddle too much.

324
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,750
She never cracks a smile.

325
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,750
Unfilial?

326
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,550
For this kind of act that
angers both gods and men,

327
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,770
I will definitely write it down.

328
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,870
Mom,

329
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,710
mom,

330
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,440
can you hear me?

331
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,320
It's time for me

332
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,360
to start work.

333
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,870
Young man, it's me.

334
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,910
Do you remember
what I told you last time?

335
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,750
Don't worry, miss.

336
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,510
When I go back, I'll write vividly

337
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,270
about the deeds of
the lady named Xiaoyue

338
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,630
without missing a single word on silk.

339
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,240
No, no, I regret it.

340
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,750
Can you give it back to me?

341
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Unfortunately,

342
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,790
I've already presented it to my master.

343
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,750
All these will be preserved
as important materials.
