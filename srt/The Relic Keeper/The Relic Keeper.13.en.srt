=Episode 13=

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,440
Madam, do you know me?

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
Manager Zhang is

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,830
capable at running a household
and managing affairs.

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,670
Everyone knows that!

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,640
I see.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,960
You're well acquainted with Lady Xin Zhui.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,470
That's true.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,350
When I was a teenager,

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,560
I got to know her.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,390
I remember now.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,240
Our Lady mentioned you.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,150
She mentioned me?

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,990
Yes.

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,110
She said that

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,000
she had a cousin, Ms Chen,
when she was at her parents' home.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,350
They were very close.

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,880
After she got married,
it's been over thirty years

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,520
and she hasn't seen Chen since.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
You must be Ms Chen.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,040
I'm flattered.

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,760
But when I came to see the Lady...

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,040
She isn't at home.

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,430
She went to Lord Li's mansion
to offer congratulations.

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,200
Please stay at our mansion
for a few more days.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,480
I'll do my best to serve you.

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
Has the Lady gone on a long journey?

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,240
Yes.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,560
I'll be going back
in a couple of days too.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,070
Maybe before she comes back,

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,310
I'll be gone.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,760
Even serving you for one day

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,870
is a great blessing for me.

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,480
Excuse me!

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,520
Manager!

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,710
Manager!

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
The missing scrolls were found in a room.

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,710
Manager Zhang,

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,920
what's going on here?

40
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,480
Someone stole the scrolls
from the Marquis's study.

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,230
Who would do that?

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,520
After investigation,

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,200
it was found that
the maids, Yaoyao and Xiaoyue did it.

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
Who did it?

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,710
Don't panic, Lady Chen.

46
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm here.

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,590
I will surely...

48
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,470
Stop talking that.

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,000
Who did you just say?

50
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,400
The maids Yaoyao and Xiaoyue.

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,910
Did you see them
steal the scrolls with your own eyes?

52
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,360
No, I didn't.

53
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,750
But the stolen goods
were found in their room.

54
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,030
The evidence is conclusive.

55
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,870
I will surely...

56
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,910
Hold on, hold on.

57
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,470
Stop.

58
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,630
The scrolls

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,800
weren't stolen by them.

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
I took them.

61
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,910
That's impossible.

62
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,800
When I was in the capital,

63
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,470
I heard people say that
silk scrolls are precious.

64
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,910
They need to be taken out
and dried regularly.

65
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,430
So when I passed by the master's study,

66
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,360
I saw them

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,080
and took them out

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,120
for some sunlight.

69
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,960
Lady Chen, you really have wide knowledge.

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,630
Well, here is my own home.

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,150
The two maids...

72
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,590
They're Yaoyao and Xiaoyue.

73
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,590
Where are they?

74
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,990
Right,

75
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
where are they?

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Where are they?

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,710
Is there no law?

78
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,960
What on earth do you want?

79
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Qin,

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,310
let us out now!

81
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,310
I knew they are not good people.

82
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,080
They even come to the prison
earlier than me.

83
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
For hardened criminals like them,

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,190
they should be tortured.

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,400
Wait, wait, come on.

86
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
They're locked up. They can't escape.

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,590
- Come on, have another drink.
- Fine.

88
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,520
- Let me serve you.
- No, you don't have to...

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You don't have to do that.

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,560
I haven't congratulated Qin,
the Head Constable, on...

91
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,520
"Head Constable", say it clearly.

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Head Constable.

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,240
Congratulations on
solving such a big case.

94
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,240
We're brothers.

95
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,310
Just call me Qin.

96
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,080
Head Constable Qin,

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,150
look at you,

98
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,400
you're so approachable.

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,430
For solving this case,

100
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,000
the magistrate will
heavily use you for sure.

101
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
In the future,

102
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,870
you have to take care of us two.

103
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,150
Yeah!

104
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,960
- Come on.
- Cheers.

105
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
Head Constable Qin.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,960
Just call me Qin.

107
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,030
Okay, Qin.

108
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,950
So what should we do now?

109
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,480
Nothing.

110
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,120
The scrolls aren't lost.

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,190
They're still there.

112
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,830
We only need to behave well

113
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,310
and get a beating at most.

114
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,430
We can't hurt the innocent.

115
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,390
Are you innocent?

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,630
Yaoyao is innocent.

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm in her body right now.

118
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,680
Look at me,

119
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,670
that thin and weak frame

120
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,390
can hardly handle it.

121
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,270
I never thought that

122
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,000
after traveling through
more than 2,200 years

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,070
the world has changed completely,

124
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,830
and I'm still inseparable from you.

125
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Darling,

126
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,720
you're my daughter.

127
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,830
All mothers and daughters are like us.

128
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,160
No matter how many times
we travel through time

129
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,480
or when we travel to,

130
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,360
the result will be the same.

131
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,480
But there may not be
such a chance in the future.

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
If we can't go back this time,

133
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,600
we have to think about what we can do.

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,680
I'll support you.

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,950
I'm an adult with a higher education.

136
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,070
Why do I need parents to support me?

137
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Well,

138
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,480
what can you do?

139
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,230
I...

140
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,950
I can be a maid.

141
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,160
As a modern person,

142
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,450
with my wisdom, I can

143
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,270
be a forewoman in one year
and a manager in three years.

144
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,750
And I can retire at the age of 35.

145
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,190
But right now,

146
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,240
we've been fired for stealing.

147
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,190
The managers of those rich families

148
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,120
all have their social circles.

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,630
And we've been blacklisted
in this industry.

150
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,390
Then I'll pursue a political career.

151
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,360
I'll get the number one in exams
and get a government job.

152
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,000
So at least I can have a stable job.

153
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,390
Have you ever studied history?

154
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,390
Get the number one in exams?

155
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,800
If you're dressed as a man now

156
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
and go to be a conscript,

157
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,830
they might just turn a blind eye.

158
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,650
How can you dream of
taking the imperial examination?

159
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,680
And you also have a criminal record,

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,300
so you can't get a government job.

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,070
Then we can only take the last resort.

162
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,630
I'll find a prince to marry.

163
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,040
Although I won't have to
worry about money,

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,750
I really don't like
dealing with those consorts.

165
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,120
Why do you keep silent?

166
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
Well...

167
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,630
Come on, say something.

168
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,600
We're discussing our future now.

169
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,230
You?

170
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,920
Marry a prince?

171
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,190
What? Can't I?

172
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,680
Look at how old you are.

173
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,750
When Consort Hua was your age,

174
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,000
the emperor had thrown her
into the Cold Palace.

175
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,720
You're having age discrimination.

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm just stating the facts.

177
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,830
That's how it's shown on TV dramas.

178
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,680
But I'm about the right age.

179
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,160
I'm a perfect fit.

180
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
You?

181
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,680
You are right.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
Alright, you go to marry a prince.

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,430
Just pay attention to
a guy named Liu Heng.

184
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,950
Sure.

185
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,070
Then when I become the dowager empress,

186
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,950
I'll let you take
the imperial examination.

187
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,640
Since you've already become...

188
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,120
- You can leave now.
- Wait wait,

189
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,040
if we leave,

190
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,600
how can you handle the county magistrate?

191
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,740
It's okay.

192
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,950
He told me to arrest you.

193
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,160
And I did.

194
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,360
Besides, they forced me
to drink with them.

195
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,600
They all wake up but I don't,

196
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,990
the magistrate won't say anything.
Hurry up.

197
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,720
My savior!

198
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,830
Hope to see you again!

199
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,750
Thank you, Constable Qin.

200
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,240
It's Head Constable.

201
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,390
We finally ran out of prison

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,240
but got caught again.

203
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,800
Being locked in a room

204
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,550
should be better than
being locked in a woodshed.

205
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,080
Here it is.

206
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Lady Chen has arrived.

207
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,000
Lady Chen?

208
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,120
Yaoyao, how did you come?

209
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,630
The passage in your office
opened up again.

210
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,910
How did you get into such big trouble?

211
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,440
It's hard to explain.

212
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
To put it simply, it's all my mom's fault.

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
You,

214
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,840
you're right.

215
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,030
It seems you've had a self-reflection.

216
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,910
There's nothing embarrassing about that.

217
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,670
Why do they all call you Lady Chen?

218
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
Manager Zhang mistook me for the cousin

219
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,670
of Lady Xin Zhui
whom she hadn't seen for years.

220
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,910
Fortunately, she isn't in the mansion
these days.

221
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,910
The Marquis is also busy
with official business

222
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,030
and is out all day.

223
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,960
But if Lady Xin Zhui comes back,

224
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,200
we'll be exposed.

225
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,600
We have to leave here ASAP.

226
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
Madam,

227
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,910
why do you keep looking at me?

228
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,960
Well, your outfit,

229
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,030
look at that,

230
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,240
how elegant and dignified
the appearance is.

231
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,910
Sure enough, even in ancient times,

232
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,360
I'd be a high-ranking noble.

233
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
What's the use?

234
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,320
How can it be useless?

235
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,510
If Yaoyao swapped soul with you,

236
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,320
we'd already be lynched.

237
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,510
Who said that?

238
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,670
The doctor said that

239
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,600
you're just born to be a mill donkey.

240
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,910
He was talking nonsense.

241
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,750
Anyway,

242
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,550
your mom came here
as the cousin of Lady Xin Zhui,

243
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,720
with extraordinary charm.

244
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,150
And you came here as a thief

245
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,240
and got into big trouble.

246
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,670
Why are you acting more childish

247
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,720
in Yaoyao's body?

248
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,240
You're joking.

249
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm more sensible than both of you.

250
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,840
Why are you so eager
to find my bracelet?

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,960
That bracelet is the key to
swapping your souls back.

252
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
Yaoyao also has one.

253
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,230
The same style?

254
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
Not the same style. It's the same one.

255
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,200
What do you mean?

256
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
To put it simply, because of time travel,

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,990
the bracelet from the past
met the one from the present.

258
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,910
Can you make it simpler?

259
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,510
That is, in the same time and space,

260
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,150
different states of
the same item appeared,

261
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,120
causing a disorder.

262
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,150
So you two swapped souls.

263
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,670
If you swap the bracelets and wear them,

264
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,630
maybe it'll work.

265
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,480
Why didn't you say so earlier?

266
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,670
I've been talking about it all along.

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Where are you taking me in such a hurry?

268
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
Did you lose the bracelet?

269
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,080
When have you ever
seen me lose something?

270
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
I didn't lose it. I gave it away.

271
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,750
Douzi, let's make a deal.

272
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,990
We shall just stay in the courtyard.

273
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,480
After I turn three circles, we'll start.

274
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,750
Are you ready?

275
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,390
You're ready, right?

276
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
Here I come!

277
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,390
Here I come!

278
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,510
Where am I?

279
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,510
- Douzi?
- Head Constable Qin?

280
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,350
I hear the wind...

281
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,360
- Why are you here?
- Aren't you on duty today?

282
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,840
The magistrate thought
I've been working too hard,

283
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,790
so he specifically told me to rest.

284
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Where did you come from?

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
From the government office.

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,080
I heard you got suspended.

287
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,600
That's the jargon of us constables.

288
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,630
Argot.

289
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,200
He told me to rest for a few days.

290
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,600
Is it because you let us go?

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,150
Didn't Manager Zhang
explain it clearly to him?

292
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,910
Well, that's quite another matter.

293
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,720
Releasing prisoners privately

294
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,510
is different. Let's not talk about it.

295
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,030
So what's your plan for the future?

296
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm a grown man.

297
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,900
I have hands, right?

298
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,540
Or I'll just wait for the magistrate
to calm down

299
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,080
and beg him.

300
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
But you've lost your position
as Head Constable.

301
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,910
Being able to accompany Douzi
to grow up well

302
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,750
is better than anything.

303
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,080
What are you doing here?

304
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,510
We're here for Douzi.

305
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,790
Do you want to play with him too?

306
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,390
Qin, remember
when Douzi had a fever last time,

307
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,440
I gave him a bracelet?

308
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,830
Yeah, Douzi really likes that bracelet.

309
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,720
That's good.

310
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,960
It's really useful to crack chestnuts,

311
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,550
one crack after another.

312
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,030
Thank goodness it's okay.

313
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,990
Mom?
