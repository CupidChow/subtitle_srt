2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,510
This female tomb figure has a hairpin
on top of her head.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,310
Her hands hang clasped in her sleeves.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,350
She has a slender figure and a thin face.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,780
First, use a wooden block

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,170
to carve out the outline
of the figure and clothing.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,620
Then, apply white powder on it as a base,

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,940
paint the eyes with ink,
and the lips with vermilion,

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,060
and paint the patterns in red and black.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,540
The painted tomb figures
are small in size

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,780
but the greatest in number.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,460
They're the lowest-ranking maids,

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,380
and do various manual labor
in Marquis Dai's Mansion.

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,900
In "Records of the Historian:
Biographies of Merchants",

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,820
they're regarded on a par with
cattle, sheep, and horses.

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,780
Me?

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,740
Xiaoyue, shall we have dinner together
after work?

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,900
You guys go, I won't.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,780
I'll work overtime.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,940
There is reason to speculate that

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,420
the gorgeous patterns of
tomb figure should be

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,340
the artistic processing
of funerary handicrafts.

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,140
In the early Western Han Dynasty,

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,620
this dressing style

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,250
among the costumes of low-ranking maids

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,060
was actually not common.

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,900
It's here!

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,300
- Hello?
- Hello, hello?

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,180
You don't need to say hello
once the call is answered.

30
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,700
It's here! It appears again!

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,780
What?

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,900
The time-travel passage.

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,460
It's in my office. Come here quickly.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,260
Wait for me, I'll be there right away.

35
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,140
Okay.

36
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,620
This is the
"Physical and Breathing Exercises Picture".

37
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,700
How vicious feudalism is.

38
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,540
The maid's room is even bigger than mine.

39
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,620
Why is it so tidy?

40
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,460
My mom must have stayed here.

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,940
Whose room would be like this?

42
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,420
Oh, god.

43
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,100
Steamed cakes!

44
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,620
Steamed cakes for sale!

45
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,380
Miss,

46
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,500
the steamed cakes are very fresh.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,910
Please have a taste
while they're still hot.

48
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,140
Sir, may I ask how to get to
the county government?

49
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,220
The county government?

50
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,180
My steamed cakes

51
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,300
are the best in Linxiang County.

52
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,900
The county magistrate
often comes to buy them.

53
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,900
Please have a taste.

54
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,300
It tastes so good.

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,540
That's for sure.

56
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,460
5 qian each. How many would you like?

57
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,180
I don't have money.

58
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,100
You must be kidding.

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Judging from your clothes,

60
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,460
you're clearly from a wealthy family.

61
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,500
How could you not have any money?

62
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,100
My clothes are replicas,

63
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,940
imitations.

64
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,900
I planned to bring some money,

65
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,300
but making qian by myself is quite hard.

66
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,820
I really don't have any money.

67
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,540
What?

68
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,140
Fine, I'll show you the way
to the county government.

69
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,300
Miss,

70
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,980
are you short of money recently?

71
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,940
Having some difficulties?

72
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,540
Not just recently.

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,780
I've always been short of money.

74
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,100
Then you should have told me.

75
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,620
Our money store is charitable.

76
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,020
How much money do you need?

77
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,870
We can lend it to you.

78
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,500
It can't be for free, right?

79
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,020
Just to earn some money for drinks.

80
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,260
Three-tenths interest.

81
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,300
When you get rich,
you won't care about this little money.

82
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
Usury, huh?

83
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,740
The business really has a long history.

84
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,660
Thanks for your kind words.

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,940
Get out of here as far as you can.

86
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,220
Wait a minute.

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,020
If I...

88
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,140
I mean if,

89
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,260
if I borrow money and don't pay it back,

90
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,140
what will you do?

91
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,340
Well, you must have a home here, right?

92
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,100
Here, you have a house
and a piece of land.

93
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,380
These can all be used
to pay off the debt.

94
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,700
In addition,

95
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,660
you must have friends, right?

96
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,660
If I can't get the money from you,
I'll go to them.

97
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,140
And you're always here.

98
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,440
You can't just disappear for no reason.

99
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,940
Then how much can you lend at most?

100
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,780
Saving my mom

101
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,140
will probably cost a lot of money.

102
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,380
You guys are unlucky.

103
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,420
Let you see how tough society can be.

104
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,220
Shopkeeper Zhou said

105
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,020
the one who stole the pastries
from his shop is a woman.

106
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,500
But he only saw the back of her
running away.

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,100
Where are we supposed to find her?

108
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,100
Stop.

109
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,580
The thief

110
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,220
could have stolen the money,
but she didn't.

111
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,900
Instead, she stole the pastries
for no reason.

112
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,020
Are they that yummy?

113
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,100
Different thieves

114
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,380
have different tendencies.

115
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,860
For example,

116
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,220
some specifically steal woman's honour.

117
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,740
They're called rapist thieves.

118
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,100
Some steal antiques, calligraphy
or paintings.

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,460
They're called refined thieves.

120
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,020
Then there are those
who specifically steal pastries.

121
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,060
They...

122
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,500
They're just terrible thieves.

123
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,220
Stop! I'm talking to you,

124
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,300
the woman in front of me.

125
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,420
Me?

126
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,460
What do you do?

127
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,780
I'm looking for someone.

128
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Looking for someone?

129
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,420
For whom?

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,820
You're constables, right?

131
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,340
Do you know a girl named Yaoyao?

132
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,220
What does she look like?

133
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,940
About this tall, quite thin,

134
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,940
- heart-shaped face.
- How old is she?

135
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,180
About eighteen or nineteen.

136
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm not asking you.

137
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,340
Besides, don't you know how old you are?

138
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,860
Mr. Chen, see?

139
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,060
She doesn't have a single word of truth.

140
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,580
What's your name?

141
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,980
Xiaoyue.

142
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,820
Where do you live?

143
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,620
It's not too far geographically,

144
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,500
but you wouldn't know even if I told you.

145
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,420
What do you do for a living?

146
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,620
It's hard to say.

147
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,380
You're hiding something, right?

148
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,300
Arrest her!

149
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,020
- What?
- How dare you draw your weapon?

150
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,860
Take her back!

151
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,940
- Go!
- Go!

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,180
Throughout the entire county government,

153
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,580
I envy you the most.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,380
You guard the gate every day.

155
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,660
Neither wind nor rain can reach you.

156
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,780
You can enjoy the quietness here.

157
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,900
Come on, you always get the good jobs.

158
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,740
Have a drink.

159
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,860
Qin,

160
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,140
you've been working here
for ten years, right?

161
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,340
It should be your turn
to be the constable head.

162
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,000
Well,

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,580
I'm actually not very suitable
to be a constable.

164
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,700
But I really don't know
how to do anything else.

165
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,250
Qin.

166
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,180
Go on.

167
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,820
The biggest obstacle
to your official career

168
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,220
- is...
- Stupidity.

169
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,940
Kindness.

170
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,300
Isn't that the same thing?

171
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,100
The worst person in this room

172
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,980
is me, then?

173
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,020
Couldn't it be me?

174
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,580
I'm also having much fun.

175
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm even drinking with you.

176
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,380
- Come here.
- Hurry up.

177
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,980
Get in.

178
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,940
Behave yourself.

179
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,380
Liu,

180
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,340
put her in prison.

181
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,060
What? Why do you arrest me?

182
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,180
Because you stole the pastries
from Shopkeeper Zhou's.

183
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,300
What pastries did I steal?

184
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,660
Am I crazy to steal pastries?

185
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,860
I have such delicious cakes.

186
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,900
Don't break my cakes.

187
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,780
Behave yourself!

188
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,540
It's an embedded case, huh?

189
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,540
- Where did you get the cakes?
- I bought them.

190
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,040
- Where did you get the money?
- I borrowed it.

191
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,940
From whom?

192
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,900
From the money store,

193
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,620
at three-tenths interest,
with a written agreement.

194
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,940
You hear that?

195
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,660
She borrowed money to buy cakes.

196
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,620
This woman doesn't tell a single truth.

197
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,460
- What are you doing?
- We seem to have met somewhere before.

198
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,820
Qin,

199
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,180
aren't you supposed to
be on duty in the front yard?

200
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,260
What are you doing here?

201
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,140
The front... front yard...

202
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,980
the front...

203
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,740
Once the magistrate isn't here,
you always have a drink.

204
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
You've got some nerve.

205
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,540
No, no. Please sit down.

206
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,180
The alcohol was especially prepared
for you two.

207
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,380
- Really?
- I also prepared some side dishes

208
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,940
as my respect to you.
Come on, have a drink.

209
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,620
Well,

210
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,740
as for the thief,

211
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,100
let me take her to the prison.

212
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
I'll do it.

213
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,620
Qin,

214
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,940
I've never seen you so considerate before.

215
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,540
I have to get maturer, right?

216
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,380
By the way,

217
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,220
can you not tell this drinking thing

218
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,660
to the magistrate?

219
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,300
My salary this month really isn't enough
if deducted.

220
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,430
- Just go.
- Got it.

221
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,660
Hey, Qin.

222
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,500
Go and take care of them.

223
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,420
This is all about your official career.
Go quickly.

224
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,860
Go!

225
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,340
- Are you locking me up for sure?
- Of course.

226
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,420
- Can I see a lawyer?
- Don't try to explain. Hurry.

227
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,460
Will you release me a day later?

228
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,340
Be quiet.

229
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,020
How long are you going to lock me up for?

230
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Three to ten years.

231
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
Xiaoyue,

232
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
Xiaoyue?

233
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,140
Yaoyao, I'm afraid of missing this chance,

234
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,020
so I'll go first.

235
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,900
I will definitely find a way
to come back.

236
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,060
Just cut the price a bit more, okay?

237
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,780
I'll come here often.

238
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
Sorry,

239
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,380
but it's a small business, only 5 qian.

240
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,380
5 qian?

241
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,060
Forget it.

242
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
I won't buy it.

243
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,300
5 qian...

244
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,660
Miss!

245
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,860
This is mine.

246
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,180
Did you drop this?

247
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,260
Yours?

248
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Yeah, it's mine.

249
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,980
You have to keep this thing well.

250
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,420
It shouldn't be here.

251
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,380
Yes, you're right.

252
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,540
Thank you very much.

253
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,010
May I ask your surname?

254
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,260
My surname is Wang.

255
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,020
What a coincidence.

256
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,420
My surname is also Wang.

257
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,660
My name is Wang Xiao.

258
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,940
I'm Wang Mang.

259
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,900
Nice to meet you.

260
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,460
My name is Wang Mang.

261
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,260
Fine, nice to meet you.

262
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,460
It seems I'm early again...

263
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,420
Wang Mang?

264
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,860
Why does this name sound so familiar?

265
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,940
Why don't you give me a hand?

266
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,300
Over there!

267
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,220
It's her, Xiaoyue!

268
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,860
Hurry! Qin, you must save her.

269
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,260
You have to keep your voice down.

270
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,380
I have to climb over the wall
when I take you to see her.

271
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,340
How can I save her?

272
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,620
Xiaoyue... will she be okay?

273
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,500
On such a dark night,

274
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,340
will your fellows
do something terrible to her?

275
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,740
Don't worry about that.

276
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,500
We follow principles when handling cases.

277
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,900
The first one is not to work overtime.

278
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,180
Then why did they arrest Xiaoyue?

279
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,740
Do you remember a few days ago

280
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
Shopkeeper Zhou's pastry shop
was burglarized?

281
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
Yeah, I know.

282
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,060
I heard the thief is a woman.

283
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,980
The constables have been
patrolling the streets.

284
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,820
Xiaoyue was very suspicious,

285
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
so they arrested her.

286
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,340
It definitely wasn't her.

287
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,940
How can you handle cases like this?

288
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,580
Although this kind of case is not big,

289
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,860
it's still important

290
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,460
as Shopkeeper Zhou is close
to our magistrate.

291
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,460
The magistrate ordered to
close the case quickly.

292
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,300
What can we do?

293
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,020
Is it common to force a confession
by torture?

294
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,860
You can't do that.

295
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,620
Is there any reason in it?

296
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,500
I'll go to the county magistrate.

297
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,180
I'll tell him she's my daughter.

298
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,020
I'll prove she didn't steal the pastries.

299
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,460
Do you want a gong to bang

300
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,660
so that you can wake them all up?

301
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,900
Now you're Yaoyao.

302
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,100
You're only eighteen.

303
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
How come you have a daughter?

304
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,060
Fine, fine.

305
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,340
What's more, if you were really her mother,

306
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,260
you'd have to go to prison, too.

307
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,900
Our laws have the practice
of collective punishment.

308
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,060
So what should we do, Qin?

309
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,140
She's my daughter.
You have to find ways to help her.

310
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,700
I know, I have kids too.

311
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,380
There are two ways.

312
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
The first is

313
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,260
to let her stay in prison

314
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,860
until the real criminal is found.

315
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,980
The second is that Shopkeeper Zhou...

316
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,460
What if we can't find the criminal?

317
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,380
Then she'll be the scapegoat.

318
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,220
Who said that?

319
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,500
That's what my master taught.

320
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,260
The second is to get Shopkeeper Zhou

321
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,400
to voluntarily withdraw the case.

322
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,460
Once the case is withdrawn,

323
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,860
Xiaoyue can be released.

324
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,860
But this is quite hard.

325
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,180
And it's not what a real man will do.

326
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,500
Shopkeeper Zhou of the pastry shop, right?

327
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,780
Get him!
