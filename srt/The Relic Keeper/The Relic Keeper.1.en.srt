2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,670
History always remembers the great figures.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,800
As for the tears and sweat of ordinary people,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,480
it's up to history.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,160
Brothers and sisters,

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,000
I wanted to say all the suffering was worth it,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,320
but it's not what we deserved.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,390
We weren't born to live like this.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,550
Now,

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,230
the tissue that can change our destinies

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,880
is done!

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
Great! It's done!

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,510
Bravo!

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
You worked so hard

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,070
just to make tissue paper?

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,840
It's so important.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,430
How would you live without it?

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,520
You've had a time travel,

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,920
with great power in your hands,

20
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,320
can't you do something bigger?

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,520
What counts as something big?

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,520
Like, giving everyone a day off.

23
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,980
Clearly, you've never been a leader.

24
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,070
With all that power,

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,880
you'd make people work overtime.

26
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,030
Thankfully, you can't boss me around.

27
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,640
Well, someone who can is here.

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,560
No overtime today,

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,500
you don't have to run away.

30
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,510
I have to go back to
the warehouse and move stuff.

31
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,920
When will this life end?

32
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,280
When you become the boss,

33
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,430
it'll end.

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,420
(A Faraway Journey -
the State of Chu Leads the Way)

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,760
Mom,

36
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,640
why are you here?

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,280
This is a museum.

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,480
Can't I come?

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,870
If you have so much energy,

40
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,870
can you stop bothering me all the time?

41
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,560
Read ten thousand books,
travel ten thousand miles.

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,040
I beg you to go out and have a look.

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,070
The senior study tour
I told you about last time,

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,040
did you go in the end?

45
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
I did.

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,700
Otherwise, how could I be here?

47
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,780
Attention, everyone!

48
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,680
Today, the senior study tour

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,510
"Bring the Classroom into the Museum"

50
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,560
series officially begins.

51
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
Great!

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,150
Thank you for your hard work.

53
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,040
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

54
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,300
- Thank you!
- Thank you for everything!

55
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,350
Are you here every day?

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,760
I can manage on my own.

57
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,400
You don't need to help me.

58
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,710
If you have something to do, just go.

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,150
I won't bother you.

60
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
What time do you get off work?

61
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,900
What time do you finish class?

62
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,030
The time you get off work

63
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,360
is the time I finish my class.

64
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,870
I have to work overtime.

65
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,360
The time you get off work
is the time I finish my class.

66
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
The time you get off work...

67
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Basement Level 1 has arrived.

68
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,700
(Exhibition of Han Tomb at Mawangdui)
Closing time has arrived.

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,470
Class dismissed.

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
- Thank you, teacher.
- Thank you.

71
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,430
Mrs Wang, let's go.

72
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,560
We can go home together.

73
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,240
You go ahead.

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,870
My daughter is about to get off work.

75
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,430
She's waiting for me.

76
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,120
I'm so envious of you.

77
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,960
Earthquake!

78
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Who are you? How did you get in here?

79
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm Yaoyao,

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,380
a maid from the Mansion of Marquis Dai.

81
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,910
Who are you bowing to?

82
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,150
I'm right here.

83
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,360
Someone is chasing me!

84
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Please help me!

85
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,870
Thank you, you're such an angel!

86
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,240
Pull it.

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Turn it.

88
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,590
Twist it.

89
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,150
Thank you!

90
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,560
Cosplay?

91
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,310
How did she get in here?

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
Who are you?

93
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,160
- Sir?
- Where am I?

94
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,560
Robbery!

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,430
Well, take it easy.

96
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830
Wait, wait a second.

97
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,590
Look,

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,950
if you grab this row,
you'll get ten years in prison.

99
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,040
And this row, twenty years.

100
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
That row at least gets you life imprisonment.

101
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,240
I want the maid.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,870
Three to ten years.

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,310
Why don't you watch out when walking?

104
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,390
People these days…

105
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,580
Put the knife down first,

106
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,310
or let me make a call.

107
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,630
If you have any problems,

108
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,950
I'll help you figure it out.

109
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,480
Let's call the police first, okay?

110
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,750
Who has time to drink tea with you?

111
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,000
Give me the maid!

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,070
Xiaoyue...

113
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
Yaoyao!

114
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,870
Who are you?

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,750
You're not with him?

116
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,600
What are you doing?

117
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,830
Don't you dare touch her!

118
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,560
Why would I touch her? I'm after you.

119
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,710
Come here!

120
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,310
- Go!
- Let me go!

121
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,360
I don't care what you two are up to,

122
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,270
let her go first.

123
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,270
What are you holding?

124
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,430
Put that jade bottle down!

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,390
Save me, Xiaoyue!

126
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,680
Wait, where did you get that bag?

127
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,070
The Officer of Linxiang County is on duty.

128
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,150
Step aside, you're not involved.

129
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,190
Let me go!

130
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,950
Linxiang County...

131
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,070
The first vassal state in the history of Hunan

132
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,360
appeared during the Western Han Dynasty.

133
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
It was called the Changsha State.

134
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,390
Its capital was Linxiang County.

135
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,380
(Two-tiered painted rectangular cosmetic case)

136
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,510
Auntie, you've come to see Xiaoyue again?

137
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,000
We're closed.

138
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,070
Auntie, auntie?

139
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,720
Auntie?

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,520
Xiaoyue,

141
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,680
I found her while on patrol.

142
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,480
She doesn't seem to be in a good state.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
Thank you.

144
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Are you all right?

145
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
I told you not to wait for me.

146
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,830
Alright, let's go home.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
Mom.

148
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,130
Mom?
