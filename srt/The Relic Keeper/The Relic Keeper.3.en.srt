1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,750
I don't know why

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,030
I swapped the soul with your mother.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,030
I was afraid you'd take me away.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,880
So I didn't dare to tell you.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,350
Mom.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,840
Yaoyao,

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,030
how come you get so into a TV drama?

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,510
Please stop packing things up.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,870
I'm really good.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,650
Then what about this plot?

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,450
It doesn't seem like something
you haven't seen before.

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,080
Generally, it's either time travel

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,430
or soul swapping,

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,750
what kind of weird show

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,900
would combine both?

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,860
=The Relic Keeper=
=Episode 3=

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,640
I don't know.

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,170
Don't your time-travel dramas

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,670
have the plot of swapping souls?

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,360
No.

21
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,760
Then you should
watch a couple more episodes with me.

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,850
Don't interrupt me.

23
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,840
How do I know
if you really had time travel

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,960
or if it's just Alzheimer's?

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,560
Didn't you see Constable Qin take me...

26
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,200
that is, your mother away?

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,790
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

28
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,130
Then how do you expect me to accept

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,120
that my mother is only eighteen?

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,280
Miss, please look at me.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,040
Mom, don't call me that.

32
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,560
Thank you, you're such an angel.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
Where's my mom?

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
She's had time travel!

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
The Han Dynasty?

36
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,400
The Han Dynasty over 2,200 years ago.

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,000
Miss,

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,360
what should I do next?

39
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,470
Girl,

40
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,030
have a seat.

41
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,190
You're the only one involved now.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
You must tell me everything clearly.

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
How did you travel across time?

44
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,430
Yesterday I was working at the mansion.

45
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,750
Constable Qin suddenly grabbed me,

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,690
saying Lady Xinzhui's cat was lost.

47
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,870
And he saw it enter my room.

48
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,840
I said it wasn't me, it wasn't me.

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,360
He said it was you, it was you.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I said no, no.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,710
I ran as fast as I could.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,430
And he chased me like a devil.

53
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,800
I ran into my room,

54
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,000
and found something strange on the wall.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,080
I crashed into it,

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
then I saw you.

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,960
That's no use.

58
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,310
Hold on,

59
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,520
so in the Western Han Dynasty,

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,910
you're guilty.

61
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,750
I'm innocent!

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,960
Stop kneeling, I can't take it.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
I forgot it.

64
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,150
I'm now Mrs Wang.

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,190
I mean my knees can't take it.

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
Help me up.

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Okay, okay.

68
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,910
Sorry, Manager Zhang,

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,560
I woke up late.

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,710
You all woke up too early.

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
It's fine.

72
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,750
Yaoyao,

73
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,190
there's a vacancy in the kitchen now.

74
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,400
I think you can handle it.

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,910
Cooking?

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
Sure, I'm good at it.

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,310
My daugh...

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,030
dear friend...

79
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,000
eats my cooking every day.

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
Here's the thing.

81
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,430
Our old lady loves delicious food,

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,720
especially rare ones.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,750
But some foods

84
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,870
may not suit her health.

85
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,240
So,

86
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,310
I want you to taste them first.

87
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,430
It's a great job to enjoy good food.

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,190
I save it just for you.

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,200
Manager Zhang,

90
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,880
in other words,
you want me to test for poison.

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Test the dishes.

92
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
Spit it out if it's poisonous.

93
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,630
Otherwise, I'll feel sorry.

94
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,310
Feels like you're brainwashing me.

95
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,800
I'm doing this for your own good.

96
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,000
What if I refuse your kindness?

97
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,270
Someone, call Constable Qin.

98
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,190
Tell him there's a lead in his case.

99
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,320
OK.

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,480
Wait, wait, wait!

101
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
I...

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,240
I didn't say I wouldn't do it.

103
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,240
There you are.

104
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,270
I'll wait for your good news,

105
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,560
all kinds of news.

106
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,360
You need to work hard.

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,630
It turns out that I'm wrong about you.

108
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,160
Why does he suddenly
come up with poison testing?

109
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,510
This position has always been filled.

110
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,390
So, where are the previous people?

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
They're all here.

112
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,830
My mom is in great danger now.

113
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,950
I must go to save her ASAP.

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,070
Do you know how to go back?

115
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,120
No.

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,830
But I have a lot of experience
by watching dramas.

117
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,000
You came from my office.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,120
There must exist some clues.

119
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,750
- I have one more thing.
- Go ahead.

120
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,390
I lost my pouch.

121
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,680
I want to find it back.

122
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,540
Come on!
It's not the time to look for the pouch!

123
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
My bracelet is in it.

124
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,960
I'll buy you another one, okay?

125
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,510
It was given by my mother.

126
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,840
You said you didn't have parents.

127
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,980
When I was eight,

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,350
my mother went on a trip
and never came back.

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,120
I pestered her
when she was about to leave,

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,560
so she took the bracelet off
and let me play it.

131
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,110
Where did you lose it?

132
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,480
I lost it before I saw you yesterday.

133
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,070
I didn't dare to tell you.

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,800
It must be in the exhibition hall.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,630
I'll go with you later to look for it.

136
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
Thanks, Miss.

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
Don't call me Miss.

138
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,630
Thanks, sis.

139
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,600
You're my mom.

140
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
Fine, just call me Xiaoyue.

141
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,040
Then you call me Mrs Wang.

142
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,480
I'll just call you mom.

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,840
Let's go.

144
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,760
Manager Zhang,

145
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,350
Manager Zhang,

146
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,310
what do you need?

147
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,870
The King of Dian State
sent some rare ingredients.

148
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,630
I picked some to offer to the Lady.

149
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,480
You need to taste them first.

150
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,640
Dian?

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Oh, it's Yunnan.

152
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,240
The chef is cooking.

153
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,510
He'll cook for you soon.

154
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,510
Just wait a moment.

155
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Is there any need to taste?

156
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,120
Clearly, it's even more poisonous than you.

157
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,830
You little girl,

158
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,510
do not say something like this.

159
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,600
I always go by evidence.

160
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,120
You should eat them first,

161
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,500
then I'll believe you.

162
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,680
If I eat them,
I won't be able to talk anymore.

163
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,930
Girl,

164
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,510
where can you find such a good job?

165
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,750
Look at me,
I've got a ton of things to do.

166
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,030
You're so lucky.

167
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,270
All you have to do is eat.

168
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,800
I'm jealous of you.

169
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,800
Then you can have them.

170
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,910
Somebody get in here.

171
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Go and call Constable Qin.

172
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,270
On it!

173
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,310
No, wait!

174
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,510
I didn't say I wouldn't eat.

175
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,750
That's right.

176
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,240
You guys, get the mushrooms

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,720
washed several times for Yaoyao.

178
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,240
Don't let her get a bad stomach from it.

179
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,510
Otherwise, I'll be sorry.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,840
Yes.

181
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,120
Let's split up.

182
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,390
I'll go to the office first,

183
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,920
to look for some clues to save my mom.

184
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
You go and look on your own first.

185
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,100
I remember that
yesterday the security guard said

186
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,270
he found you here
in the Mawangdui Exhibition Hall.

187
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Mawangdui?

188
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,570
You must be familiar with it.

189
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,440
It's the place
where Lady Xin Zhui was buried.

190
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,360
She, she...

191
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,600
Alright, it's been over two thousand years.

192
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,790
Yeah, that's true.

193
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,750
If you're not sure,

194
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,390
go and take a look
at the coffin yourself.

195
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,390
I'm not inside, right?

196
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,870
I don't know...

197
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,600
if this is any comfort to you.

198
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,800
You don't deserve it.

199
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,230
Yeah.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,240
I want to go to the Western Han Dynasty!

201
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,270
To the Marquis Dai's Mansion
in Linxiang County!

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,220
Hi, Western Han Dynasty?

203
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,260
Dear West?

204
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,110
West, west?

205
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,200
Could it be that
we need to recreate the scene?

206
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,750
I'm hiding. You guys can come out.

207
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,870
I don't think I can go back.

208
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,600
I wonder how my Xiaoyue

209
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,080
is doing now.

210
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,390
You,

211
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,270
were not born at the right time.

212
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
If you were in my world,

213
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,910
you'd be protected.

214
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,160
But now,

215
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,000
you're just waiting to be eaten.

216
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
But don't worry,

217
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,910
I will let you have a good meal today.

218
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,960
This is a mushroom from Yunnan.

219
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,870
It's very precious.

220
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,320
I've never eaten it before.

221
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,390
Just do me a favor.

222
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,510
Don't worry, it won't kill you.

223
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,790
Even if it does,

224
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,000
it's still worth it due to the good taste.

225
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,230
Come and take a look.

226
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,480
Just tell me

227
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,000
if you had the mushroom or not.

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,720
You'll see.

229
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,160
Where's the wild goose?

230
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Yaoyao,

231
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,120
we're having wild goose soup.

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
Did you have some?

233
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Wild goose soup?

234
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,270
So, what do you want me to see?

235
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,990
Gold!

236
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,270
It's all mine.

237
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
Do not steal from me!

238
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
What?

239
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,200
- What?
- Son, you're back.

240
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,510
Oh no!

241
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,750
Someone poisoned the mansion staff!

242
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,870
Come on!

243
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,110
Help!

244
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,320
Now,

245
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,480
guard the main gate for me.

246
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,050
No access for unauthorized people.

247
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,240
Whoever is fine must be the poisoner.

248
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
Okay, hurry up!

249
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,710
Yaoyao!

250
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,150
- Yao...
- Gold...

251
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,680
Yaoyao...

252
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,560
What?

253
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,320
What's wrong with her?

254
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,200
I don't know.

255
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,040
Yaoyao!

256
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Yaoyao?

257
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,120
Don't, don't scare us.

258
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,390
Yaoyao?

259
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,510
Don't, don't scare us.

260
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
Manager Zhang!

261
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,160
Yaoyao!

262
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,360
Go to Wanmu Hall to get the doctor!

263
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,390
Yaoyao is not well.

264
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,000
- Let the doctor see her first.
- All right.

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,400
Be quick!

266
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,320
Yaoyao!

267
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,240
I'm not feeling well either.

268
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,270
This one

269
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,150
is a cotton robe with printed and painted silk.

270
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,510
It was worn by women of the noble class
at that time.

271
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,390
According to historical records,

272
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,870
in the pre-Qin period,

273
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,990
there was a garment
called huayi which had embroidery.

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
But its authenticity
was highly controversial.

275
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,480
It wasn't
until the excavation of the cotton robe

276
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,150
that the reliability of huayi was proven.

277
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,240
The patterns on it

278
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,630
were first printed with vines

279
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,630
and then hand-painted.

280
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
It's the first piece of clothing

281
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,030
that combines printing and painting.

282
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,480
That's wrong.

283
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,990
Please,

284
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,270
tell us your opinion.

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,360
This was indeed worn by rich people,

286
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,910
but it was usually worn by young masters.

287
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,530
They wore women's clothing?

288
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,520
Maybe it was a custom.

289
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,930
Look at the plants on it.

290
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,030
What do they look like to you?

291
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Like what?

292
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,560
Like plants.

293
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,670
Noble young masters like hunting.

294
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,360
Wearing this,
it's not easy for prey to spot them.

295
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,000
You mean,

296
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,000
this is a camouflage uniform?

297
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,870
Anyway, I saw it.

298
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,670
She has thought seriously and actively.

299
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,750
That's great. Everyone, give some applause.

300
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,710
Teacher,

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,030
which one of you two is right?

302
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,200
Everyone has their own understanding.

303
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,670
But when it comes to exams,
go by what I say.

304
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,920
That's it.

305
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,740
Look, the bracelet is already out.

306
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
You said...

307
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,960
the bracelet was given by your mom.?

308
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,470
Yeah.

309
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,550
You also have one.

310
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,800
This

311
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,030
is the one I gave to my mom.

312
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,840
It's a replica
from the Western Han Dynasty.

313
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,920
At that time,

314
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,480
the style should have been quite common.

315
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,920
It's not strange that they're the same.

316
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,960
That's not true.

317
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,730
The bracelet was made
by my mother herself.

318
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,160
She strung it together for me.

319
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,750
The white bead on it is a chicken bone.

320
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,870
I pestered her

321
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,550
to put it on for me.

322
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,550
Could it really be the same one?

323
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,630
Where are you going?

324
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,960
The pouch has been found.

325
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,270
I'll find someone to take it out.

326
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,750
It's robbery.

327
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,790
Even if it's yours,

328
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,790
it'll be hard to explain.

329
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,670
But I think,

330
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,080
this bracelet may be the key
to your time travel.

331
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,600
We have to come up with a safe way.

332
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,670
What way?

333
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,710
I haven't got any idea.

334
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,270
Anyway, we have to secretly

335
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
get it.

336
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,150
Do you mean stealing?

337
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,030
No.

338
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,080
That's different.

339
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
Taking other's things is called stealing.

340
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,840
For example,
if the manager of the mansion

341
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,670
takes your stuff and you want it back,

342
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,510
what's that called?

343
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,960
Prisoner.

344
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,080
Mom,

345
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,670
I must save you back.
