=The Relic Keeper=
=Episode 12=

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,720
The daughter of Mrs. Wang?

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
Xiaoyue, who manages the exhibits
in a museum?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,480
So who is she?

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,120
There are five thousand years of history.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,350
Anyone is possible.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,710
She is greedy and lazy,

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,670
unable to take care of herself
without her mother.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,870
And she doesn't know how good her life is.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,550
Instead, she often complains a lot
to her mother.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,000
Mrs. Wang,

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,560
give me another example if you can.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,880
Yeah.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,640
You can't find a second one in history.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,590
Auntie,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,430
auntie, this is Xiaoyue's office.

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,520
Auntie, is Xiaoyue
feeling better recently?

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,790
She suddenly felt unwell,

19
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,640
and now needs to have a rest
for a few days.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,150
What's wrong with her?

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,640
It's hard to say.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,960
Sounds so serious.

23
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,640
It's because she's been working overtime

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,590
and staying up late.

25
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,430
She wouldn't do it
when I told her to rest,

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,640
look at her.

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,280
Auntie, when I get off work later,

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,640
I'll go and visit her with my colleagues.

29
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,400
No, she's not at home.

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,430
Is she in the hospital? Which hospital?

31
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,070
She's not in the hospital either.

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,680
Then where is she?

33
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,280
Xiaoyue has gone where she should go.

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,710
So sudden?

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,510
I also thought it was very sudden.

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,310
But at that time

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,480
I didn't get myself prepared at all.

38
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,280
How I wish I could go with her.

39
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,120
Auntie, auntie, don't...

40
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,920
don't think like that, please.

41
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,320
You know,

42
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,920
Xiaoyue is such a good girl.

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,350
Although she works a bit slower
than others,

44
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,000
she's really careful.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,350
I'm always happy to give any tasks to...

46
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,070
I think this is a test for her.

47
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,510
She will definitely come back.

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,150
That means

49
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,680
there's still hope for her, right?

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,520
Of course.

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,590
As long as the belief
in her heart doesn't die,

52
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,040
there must be hope.

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,710
I think she will definitely come back.

54
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,920
Great, great.

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,430
Auntie, I'll wait with you.

56
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,680
No no, you should go outside and wait.

57
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,870
Okay, then I'll go outside.

58
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,030
You stay here.

59
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,000
Auntie, this is Xiaoyue's office.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,430
Look, all her personal items are here.

61
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,520
Just pick whatever you like.

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,200
Remember to tell our security guard
when you leave

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
to lock the door.

64
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,270
Auntie,

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,870
be strong.

66
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,240
There's no hurdle that can't be overcome.

67
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,030
That's what happened.

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,030
I didn't expect that young man

69
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,360
would really write you into
historical records.

70
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,360
Mom, what can I say about you?

71
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,360
Now we're in this position.

72
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,280
And you still have the energy for that.

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,960
I didn't know at that time.

74
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,960
I thought I couldn't go back.

75
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
And then I...

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,630
Well, at least I found it back.

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Is that what I'm talking about?

78
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,680
You always can't tell
what's important and what's not.

79
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,030
What do you need this stupid picture for?

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,860
You almost lost
the most important Picture.

81
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,630
I was afraid that if you knew

82
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,360
I spoke ill of you behind your back

83
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,680
you'd be angry.

84
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,540
Look at

85
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,260
the words on it.

86
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,420
Which one haven't you nagged me about?

87
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,740
Did I take it to heart?

88
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,660
Some of the words are quite to the point.

89
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,060
I've thought about it.

90
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,340
If I didn't get it back for you,

91
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,740
when it's put in the museum in the future

92
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,220
it would have a bad influence on you.

93
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,020
That would be even better.

94
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,500
I'll be famous in history.

95
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,700
By then in the museum

96
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,340
there will be all my portraits.

97
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,780
Hundreds of years later, someone will write

98
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,060
"Modern people can't see ancient Yue,

99
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,180
but modern Yue once
shone on the ancients."

100
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,740
It seems you're still affected
by this thing.

101
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,180
So what should we do
with this picture now?

102
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,580
Of course we need to burn it.

103
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,540
We'd better not cause trouble
for future generations.

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,500
Go and search the backyard!

105
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,500
Don't let the thief get away!

106
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,620
Yes!

107
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,260
I forgot that

108
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,180
I stole these scrolls from Li Xi's room.

109
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,860
Now we'll be caught red-handed.

110
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,540
No way.

111
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,340
I'll admit that I stole them.

112
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,190
I'll turn myself in.

113
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,860
Xiaoyue, take the Picture and leave.

114
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,900
You have to go back.

115
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,780
No,

116
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,940
you don't have to do that.
There's a way to solve it.

117
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,780
Well,

118
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,260
we can run out,

119
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,580
leaving the stolen goods in the room.

120
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,140
Oh right, we can say

121
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,420
it's the thief who has left it
in the room.

122
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,660
We don't know anything.

123
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,900
What about
"Physical and Breathing Exercises Picture"?

124
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,180
It can't be noticeable like this, right?

125
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,460
Let's go.

126
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,860
Stop!

127
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,700
(Medical Clinic)
Go ahead!

128
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,620
Yes, sir!

129
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,180
This way!

130
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,180
- Come this way!
- Go!

131
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,860
Ladies,

132
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,340
there's only me in the medical clinic.

133
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,300
Today's patients are full.

134
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,780
(Quick Fix)
If not urgent, could you come tomorrow?

135
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,620
No,

136
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,420
we can't go outside.

137
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,060
Why?

138
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,340
I'm not well. I can't walk.

139
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,700
How did it come all of a sudden?

140
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,780
Seems so serious.

141
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,860
What's the problem?

142
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,380
What are you good at treating?

143
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,980
Muscle and tendon pain.

144
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,380
That's it.

145
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,900
We finally found you.

146
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,820
I just feel uncomfortable all over.

147
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,300
Hurry up, please help my daughter.

148
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,180
All right, come with me.

149
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,140
The eyes are badly bloodshot.

150
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,580
This is due to overwork.

151
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,820
That's right.

152
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,900
I told her to go to bed early,

153
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,380
but she didn't listen to me.

154
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,740
The right thumb has already deformed.

155
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,140
It should also be due to overwork.

156
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,980
Yes, you're right.

157
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,140
All she knows is to
play with her phone all day.

158
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,220
For this kind of illness,

159
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,620
I've never seen it before.

160
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,780
She has symptoms
of both heavy manual labor

161
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,660
and sitting still for a long time.

162
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,620
That's true.

163
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,660
I told her to do some exercise,

164
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,140
but she just won't do it.

165
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,980
So strange,

166
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,820
especially the cervical spine,

167
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,440
it has become curved
in the opposite direction.

168
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,540
Doctor,

169
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,980
is there still a cure?

170
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,060
It's very tricky.

171
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,420
Bowed head and heavy manual labor,

172
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,100
I've only seen this
on donkeys pulling mills before.

173
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,700
You're so right, doctor.

174
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,100
Compared to my colleagues,
I'm even well enough.

175
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,340
Miss,

176
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,460
when it's convenient for you,

177
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,780
please come here more often.

178
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,800
That's right, she needs more treatment.

179
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,940
and should adhere to treatment.

180
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,180
That's secondary.

181
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,140
It's because as a case,

182
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,740
you're really rare.

183
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,780
You can help me
improve my medical skills.

184
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,660
Please.

185
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,420
So you're using me as a sample?

186
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,620
Why do I feel like

187
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,380
you're not willing to cure me?

188
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,540
You're kidding, Miss.

189
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,140
As the saying goes,
a doctor always has a parental heart.

190
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Yes, yes.

191
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,220
These bad diseases
need to be treated well.

192
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,700
You're kidding too.

193
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,420
As the saying goes,
a doctor always has a parental heart.

194
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,540
(Wanmu Hall)

195
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,500
The doctor is not bad.

196
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,700
The massage is quite good.

197
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,340
There are too many people today.

198
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,260
Otherwise, I'd also ask him
to give me a massage.

199
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,100
Well,

200
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,220
it's really much better than
the ones back home.

201
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
After the massage,

202
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,020
I feel so relaxed.

203
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,460
I've forgotten all my troubles.

204
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,660
The troubles are back again.

205
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,820
The magistrate has assigned me
another big case.

206
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,140
This time I must make up for my mistakes.

207
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,100
Sir!

208
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,000
We've found two suspects

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
and already had someone to chase them.

210
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,500
Manager Zhang,

211
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,500
how have you been recently?

212
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,220
Who are you?

213
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,620
How did you get in?

214
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,180
Manager Zhang,

215
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,940
you're really busy enough.

216
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,740
There is a stranger
in the Marquis Dai's Mansion,

217
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,020
and you didn't even know that.

218
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,500
Don't be rude.

219
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,500
This madam has extraordinary charm

220
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,940
and takes good care of her skin.

221
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,660
And her clothes are made of
precious fabrics.

222
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,420
She must have a great background.
