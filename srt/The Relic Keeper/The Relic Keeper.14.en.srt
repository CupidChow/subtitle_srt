00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,820
(Mansion of Marquis Dai)

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,720
Manager Zhang,

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,830
thanks for your service.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
My pleasure.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,000
When Lady Xin Zhui comes back,

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,670
I will surely tell her
that Manager Zhang

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,710
is extremely loyal.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,280
With your words,

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,640
I...

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,110
No,

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,000
don't stop.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,560
Your massage is really good.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm back.

15
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,600
I'm back?

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm back!

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,670
I'm back, I'm back!

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,790
What?

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,630
Mom!

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
- Xiaoyue!
- Is that you, mom?

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,150
- Xiaoyue!
- Mom.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Xiaoyue!

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
- Xiaoyue.
- Shame on you.

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,230
To climb up the social ladder,

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,510
you even call her mom casually.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,150
Godmother,

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,790
let me massage your Yangming Meridian.

28
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,560
Manager Zhang, you can leave now.

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,430
With Xiaoyue and Yaoyao serving me here,

30
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,310
it's enough.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
What's more,

32
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,430
with so many male servants here,

33
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,120
it's a bit inconvenient.

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,590
When Lady Chen is getting a massage,

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,380
she feels inconvenient
with male servants around.

36
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,000
When the Marquis used to get a massage,

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,870
he also felt the same way.

38
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,350
Well...

39
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,790
Go away.

40
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,680
Why did I swap back?

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,940
Tell me,

42
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,350
why did I swap back?

43
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,920
Why?

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,150
What's the reason?

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
How could it happen?

46
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,310
I think this might be the case.

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,840
Your two bracelets

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,280
are exactly the same one.

49
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,510
They can't appear at the same time.

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,710
When you two met that day,

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,760
it caused a time-space disorder,

52
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,710
which also affected you.

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,590
Now that my mom's bracelet is destroyed,

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
you've returned to normal.

55
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,030
Xiaoyue, you're really amazing.

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,440
You can even figure this out.

57
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,410
I don't know the theory.

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,870
But I know the problem-solving skills.

59
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,980
Once you know the result,
you work backwards.

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,730
As long as the logic is consistent,

61
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,730
you can always get some points.

62
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,150
So does that mean
my Western-Han bracelet is destroyed?

63
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,860
No, wait.

64
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,150
Didn't you go group-buying
with someone online?

65
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,400
That's because I was afraid
you wouldn't accept it.

66
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,220
You lied to me again.

67
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,280
How much did this cost?

68
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,540
Look at you,

69
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,580
every time I buy you something,

70
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,300
you think it's either too expensive
or useless.

71
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,900
Why are you unhappy
when I'm saving you money?

72
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,060
Then next time I buy you something,

73
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,220
just accept it nicely.

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,420
I did accept the bracelet,

75
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,460
but something happened as a result.

76
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,180
Mrs Wang,

77
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,180
the bracelet can be passed on to you.

78
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,940
I'm quite happy for that.

79
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,660
You passed it to me?

80
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,220
Right,

81
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,060
I'm kind of your future generation.

82
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,540
Yaoyao,

83
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,420
here's your bracelet.

84
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,180
This was left to you by your mom.

85
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,020
Keep it well.

86
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,180
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

87
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,700
My mom said

88
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,420
this bracelet can keep you safe.

89
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,700
So I hope Xiaoyue and you

90
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,540
will both be safe and sound.

91
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,180
Definitely.

92
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,740
Lady Chen! Lady Chen!

93
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,580
- Manager Zhang, what's going on?
- Lady Chen!

94
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
Don't shout like that,

95
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,820
you almost scared us to death.

96
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,940
I'm sorry for that.

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,300
I have extremely good news for you.

98
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,620
What good news?

99
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,340
Lady Xin Zhui has returned early.

100
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
She heard that you're here,

101
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,940
so she's very delighted

102
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,460
and has ordered the servants
to prepare a banquet.

103
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,620
She wants to hold a welcome dinner
for you tonight.

104
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,020
Lady,

105
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,700
Lady Chen has arrived.

106
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,260
Is that you, my cousin?

107
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,700
Thirty years have passed.

108
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,620
You're still so beautiful.

109
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,280
Come on,

110
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,060
we haven't seen each other
for thirty years.

111
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,140
Let's get drunk tonight.

112
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,260
Sure.

113
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,100
Have a drink.

114
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
What's all this about?

115
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,620
Lady Xin Zhui and her cousin
have a deep bond.

116
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,820
But they haven't seen each other
for thirty years,

117
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,700
it's normal to make a mistake.

118
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,820
How deep can their bond be?

119
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,100
It's thirty years.

120
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,180
After thirty years of separation,

121
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,580
it's already a blessing
to see each other again.

122
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,220
Do not whisper.

123
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,460
You shall serve the ladies well.

124
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,260
Sis,

125
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,300
how have you been these years?

126
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,700
Well,

127
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm fine.

128
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,180
At our age,

129
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,660
there's not much to worry about,

130
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,500
but for one thing,

131
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,460
and that is my daughter.

132
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,180
You're also worried about your child?

133
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,900
Is there any mother in the world

134
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,420
who doesn't worry about her children?

135
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,060
What I'm most worried about is my son.

136
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,620
Your son is Li Xi,

137
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,180
a marquis.

138
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,460
What else are you not satisfied with?

139
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,660
You don't know.

140
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,860
He's obsessed with medical books.

141
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,140
He studies meridians and bones
all day long.

142
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,140
As a hereditary Marquis of Dai,

143
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,460
he engages in these unorthodox things

144
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,660
and neglects his duties.

145
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,260
This is simply unacceptable!

146
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,140
How can he live up to
his deceased father?

147
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,980
Sis, sis,

148
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,140
don't cry.

149
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,580
You have to discipline your son.

150
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,780
I've done that.

151
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,460
But every time I do, we end up arguing.

152
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,060
For such a large family,

153
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,540
if this gets out,
it'll be a laughingstock.

154
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,140
I'm really at my wit's end.

155
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,220
Pay my respects to the Marquis.

156
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,220
You may all rise.

157
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,780
Mom.

158
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,260
My son,

159
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,780
what's so urgent?

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,780
Where's the
"Physical and Breathing Exercises Picture"?

161
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,320
It was in my study before.
Why is it gone?

162
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,820
What picture?

163
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,700
A medical picture.

164
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,860
Son,

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,500
you have something
more important to do.

166
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,060
You shouldn't be distracted by trifles.

167
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,100
It's just as well
that the picture is lost.

168
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,940
Mom,

169
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,020
you shouldn't touch my stuff
without permission.

170
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,940
Nephew,

171
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,460
how can you talk to your mother
like that?

172
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,220
Your mom is doing this
for your own good.

173
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,820
Since there are guests here,

174
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,540
I'll take my leave now.

175
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,820
Did you see that?
He's throwing a tantrum.

176
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,180
It's always like this.

177
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,260
Sis,

178
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,860
I have experience in this thing.

179
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,580
My daughter

180
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,340
is much more stubborn than him.

181
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,860
Your son has to be disciplined.

182
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,220
Sis,

183
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,460
I'm so glad you're here.

184
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,620
Normally, there's no one

185
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,140
to talk to me like this.

186
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,980
Sis,

187
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,340
since you call me sister,

188
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,660
I can't disappoint you.

189
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
Today, we must have a good talk

190
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,540
and say something
from the bottom of our hearts.

191
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,220
All of you shall wait outside.

192
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
You two can go back.

193
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,340
Go back to sleep.

194
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,460
I'll talk to my sister
for a while longer.

195
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,300
Go back.

196
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,700
- Come on, have a drink.
- Sure.

197
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
Cheers.

198
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,940
If your son is rebellious,
you have to discipline him.

199
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,860
You definitely have to.

200
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,420
Okay, okay.

201
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,340
- But how?
- For the sake of your son,

202
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,100
what can't you sacrifice?

203
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,940
Right?

204
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,980
But how do I discipline him?

205
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,860
If he likes reading
extracurricular books,

206
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,340
you should confiscate them

207
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,340
without hesitation.

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,580
Confiscate them?

209
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,860
Search under the bed,

210
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,060
and behind the radiator

211
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,740
and the TV.

212
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,780
It's simple and effective.

213
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,420
By this way,
you can discipline him easily.

214
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,540
You're right.

215
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,580
(Mansion of Marquis Dai)

216
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,620
Did you catch a cold?

217
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,940
Possibly.

218
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,220
You need a heating pad.

219
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,100
- What's a heating pad?
- Search this room

220
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,700
and that room carefully.

221
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,540
Don't miss anything.

222
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,540
There are two pictures.

223
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
Take them all away.

224
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,700
What are you doing?

225
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,660
Hold on.

226
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
Stop them.

227
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,380
Manager Zhang, what's going on?

228
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,460
What's going on?

229
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
By the order of the Lady,

230
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,000
to help the Marquis
get rid of distractions

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,060
and focus on political affairs,

232
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,940
in this mansion

233
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,860
all books and scrolls
related to medicine

234
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,100
shall be burned.

235
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,060
Burned?

236
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,060
You can't burn them.
Those two are mine.

237
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,380
What do you mean by yours?

238
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,220
Even you belong to
the Mansion of Marquis Dai.

239
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,700
Have you checked
everything carefully?

240
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,540
There's nothing left.

241
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,060
Burn them now.

242
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,340
- No, you can't!
- No!
