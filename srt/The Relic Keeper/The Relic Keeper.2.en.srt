=Episode 2=

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,110
Let me go!

3
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,400
If you keep doing this, I'll call for help!

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,860
Where do you think you can run to, you thief!

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,870
Who do you think looks more like a thief here?

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,870
You do.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,670
Yaoyao, the maid
from the Mansion of Marquis Dai,

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,870
you're the one I'm looking for.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,550
Yaoyao? I got it.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,240
You've got the wrong person.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,190
My name is Wang Xiao.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,030
The criminal Yaoyao's full name
is Wang Xiao. Go!

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,670
Are you crazy?

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,240
How can I look like

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,630
a maid.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,040
What are you doing?

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,470
Don't move! My, my knife is very sharp!

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,720
What are you trying to do?

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,030
You just mentioned
the Mansion of Marquis Dai,

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,630
maid, and constable.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,350
Everything is clear now.

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,310
Are you trying to deny it?

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,430
You said I stole Lady Xin Zhui's stuff?

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,470
Yes, and I caught you red-handed.

25
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,430
Come with me!

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going back to my room first.

27
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,840
What's wrong?

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,760
I saw your room was a bit messy,

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,310
so I tidied it up.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,030
A bit messy?

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
You don't have to be so sarcastic.

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,710
I've told you so many times.

33
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,870
Don't touch my stuff.

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,330
Otherwise, I won't be able to find it.

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,830
Why is the trash can here?

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
Why are all my snacks in there?

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,500
They haven't been eaten yet.

38
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,280
Isn't this your food container?

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
Are you swearing?

40
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,120
Where's the trash?

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,190
Trash, waste.

42
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,310
This is for waste?

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,560
Did you throw the trash out?

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,080
I didn't see it.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
When do we have dinner?

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Miss,

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
at your service.

48
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,150
Mom, you don't have to be like this.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,960
If you don't want to cook,

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,250
we can just order takeout.

51
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,000
Can I ask

52
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,950
where exactly we are?

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,150
You want to order it yourself?

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,470
You forgot the address?

55
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,870
Room 701, Unit 3, Xiyou Neighborhood.

56
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,430
Who is in charge here?

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You, it's you.

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,430
You can order whatever you want.

59
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,630
Am I the queen?

60
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,520
Not just that.

61
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,470
You're the queen dowager,
the grand queen dowager.

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,960
Really?

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Really.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
My dear,

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,730
our imperial palace

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,670
is a bit too simple.

67
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,120
How come just one day
at the study tour

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,650
can make you so addicted
to behaving like this?

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,560
But, to be honest,

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,360
if you were born a thousand years earlier,

71
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,910
you might have really become
a consort or something.

72
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,520
So when is it now?

73
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,270
Six-thirty.

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,150
You mean the time of day, right?

75
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,310
I'm asking about the year.

76
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
2024.

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
What's wrong?

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,590
Do you know about the Han Dynasty?

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,710
You just went on the study tour
for one day,

80
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,800
and I've been working
at the museum for five years.

81
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,530
How can I not know about the Han Dynasty?

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm asking about the third year
of Empress Lu Zhi's reign.

83
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,840
How long ago was that?

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Mom,

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,080
I studied history in school,

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,630
and I work with history now.

87
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,560
Now you're asking me how long ago
Empress Lu's reign was?

88
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,990
I...

89
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,190
Let me look it up.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,830
It should be around 2,200 years ago.

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,560
I feel a bit dizzy.

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
I need to sit down for a while.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
What did your teacher talk about today?

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,560
You seem quite interested
in the Western Han Dynasty.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,430
What's the Western Han Dynasty?

96
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,560
Isn't it just the Han Dynasty?

97
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,000
You haven't gotten to that part, right?

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,950
Someone usurped the throne.

99
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,830
I won't spoil it for you.

100
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,000
Miss, have a rest.

101
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,430
I'll go cook for you.

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
No takeout then?

103
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,270
I told you,

104
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,430
I'm not Yaoyao.

105
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,920
How could you arrest the wrong person?

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,930
Lady Xin Zhui's beloved cat is missing.

107
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,480
Someone said he saw it in your room.

108
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
Now, give me the cat!

109
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,970
You've already searched the room.

110
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,120
There's no cat.

111
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,240
I don't care. I'm taking
either you or the cat away.

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Stop!

113
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,720
What will happen after you take me?

114
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
Then it's up to the master to decide.

115
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,560
You know theft is a serious crime.

116
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
Stop scaring me, I know the law.

117
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,720
What isn't a serious crime here?

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
It's good that you know.

119
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,490
Flogging is the light one,
and execution the worst.

120
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,390
Just for a cat?

121
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,510
It's Lady Xin Zhui's cat.

122
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,360
It's still just a cat.

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,950
It's Lady Xin Zhui's beloved cat!

124
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,800
It's still just a cat!

125
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,500
You. Why are you talking
so much nonsense?

126
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,840
Let me jump over there.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,430
Isn't this Manager Zhang of the Mansion?

128
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,360
How are you?

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,900
This is the Mansion of Marquis Dai.

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
What's all this about knives and arrests?

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
It's unbecoming.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,040
I'm investigating

133
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,680
the case of Lady Xin Zhui's missing cat.

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,520
I've already caught the suspect.

135
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,600
Any evidence?

136
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,600
I heard someone saw...

137
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,630
So there's none.

138
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,030
Lady Xin Zhui

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
asked you to find her cat, that's true.

140
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,950
But, the Mansion

141
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,680
has 176 servants.

142
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,590
All of them were carefully selected by me.

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,270
If there's a thief among them,

144
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,120
how can I face the Lady?

145
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,160
You're right, Manager Zhang.

146
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,310
But her...

147
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,150
But...

148
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,510
If Constable Qin does have evidence that

149
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,920
it was my servant who did this,

150
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,040
I won't cover for her.

151
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,560
All right.

152
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,830
I'll surely live up to

153
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,600
the expectations of the Lady
and Manager Zhang.

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
I'll take my leave now.

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,720
Zhang, Manager Zhang,

156
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,870
thank you for saving my life.

157
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
Yaoyao,

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
we're very short-handed right now.

159
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't let me down.

160
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,790
Don't let you down?

161
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,000
Sure, sure!

162
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,430
Come to the kitchen to
see me first thing in the morning.

163
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,720
First thing in the morning...

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
What am I thinking about?

165
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
Run!

166
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,190
Let me give you a hand.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,310
This place looks quite nice.

168
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,560
But why don't I see even a single leaf?

169
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,920
This cabinet is quite cold.

170
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,830
Not as cold as my heart...

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Oh, my dear mom,

172
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,190
it's already eight o'clock.

173
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,510
You haven't washed any vegetables.

174
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,160
Speaking of washing vegetables, this...

175
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,800
Is this dish soap about to expire?

176
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,040
Let me do it.

177
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,230
By the way,

178
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,480
did you see

179
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,830
a young woman today?

180
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,270
What does she look like?

181
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,000
About this tall.

182
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,560
She's quite good-looking.

183
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,870
The clothes she wore
are different from ours.

184
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,870
How do you know that?

185
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,080
You're not spying on me, are you?

186
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,080
I saw her come out of your room.

187
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,790
And then she bumped into me.

188
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,390
Really?

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
So, where did she go?

190
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Why are you asking it?

191
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,750
Just tell me, OK?

192
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,150
Even if I tell you, you won't believe it.

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:10,630
Rent a yard and think you're
in the Western Han Dynasty?

194
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,750
I'm not buying it.

195
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,510
This must be a gang.

196
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,800
It's either a pyramid scheme or a fraud.

197
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,790
I have to run quickly.

198
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,630
Are you blind?

199
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,860
(Linxiang County)

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,750
Just for my little pension?

201
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,120
They really went all out.

202
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,630
I'm making a simple cold dish.

203
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,630
Since when did you become
so good at cutting?

204
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,510
Help me start the fire,

205
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,150
my cooking skills will be even better.

206
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,920
By the way,

207
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,700
the time travel you said just now,

208
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,870
what's that all about?

209
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,270
You watch dramas every day.

210
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,270
Don't you know about it?

211
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,920
Watch dramas?

212
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,390
How does it actually happen?

213
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,750
How can I go back?

214
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,480
Testing me again?

215
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,030
You just tested me on history
and now on time travel.

216
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,790
You may want to recommend
some new drama to me.

217
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,030
I have no interest.

218
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,080
Can Lin Miaomiao go back?

219
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,920
Who?

220
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,080
I don't know. I haven't watched it either.

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,790
As for people who have traveled through time,

222
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,630
what will happen if they are discovered?

223
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,790
People will think you're crazy,

224
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,870
and send you to the hospital.

225
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,550
Miss,

226
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,150
it's dawn.

227
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,390
Time to start work.

228
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,510
Ten past five?

229
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,870
Didn't you say you'd get up
when it's dawn?

230
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,670
Oh my dear mom...

231
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,600
When have I ever gotten up at dawn?

232
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,120
I'm still good to you.

233
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,630
Can you feel it?

234
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,720
Missy,

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,550
just give the order if you have something,

236
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,630
I'll take my leave.

237
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,030
Hello, is that Taozi?

238
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,680
It's me.

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
I want to ask you something.

240
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,510
Have you heard about

241
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,200
the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?

242
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,030
Yes.

243
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,510
Is there any way to test for it?

244
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,960
Fine, please send it to me.

245
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,510
Okay.

246
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,390
Mom,

247
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,200
let's do a little test.

248
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,750
Test me?

249
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,630
It's very easy.

250
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,840
Just tell me what it is.

251
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Big bird.

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,630
This can be eaten.

253
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,350
This one...

254
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,870
shall be a group of donkeys
turning a millstone.

255
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,560
I have no idea.

256
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,870
Mom...

257
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,630
Xiaoyue, are you OK?

258
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,360
Did I say something wrong?

259
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,710
I'm fine.

260
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,960
It's okay.

261
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,080
Surely it's okay.

262
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,440
It's no big deal.

263
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,910
Hello, Taozi.

264
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,510
It's confirmed.

265
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,870
We'll go to the hospital right away.

266
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,110
Don't catch me.

267
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,440
- Don't catch me.
- It's okay, mom.

268
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm not sick.

269
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,480
- Just do a little check-up.
- I'm good, I'm good!

270
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,870
- Don't catch me!
- Come on, let's go.

271
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,600
- I'm not sick!
- Just go.

272
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,900
How do you know
if you don't get checked?

273
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,960
I'm really not sick.

274
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,360
How do you know you're...

275
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,200
You have to go...

276
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Why don't you listen...

277
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,030
I deserve to die a thousand deaths!

278
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,960
What are you doing?
Get up quickly.

279
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,910
I'll confess everything.

280
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm not who I seem.

281
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,960
Last night,

282
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,720
the thing you told me is true.

283
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,310
What?

284
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
I'm Yaoyao.
