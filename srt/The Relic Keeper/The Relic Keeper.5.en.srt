2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,940
Your resume is quite impressive.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,160
It quite meets the requirements
of our company.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,350
Thank you.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,670
Your major is also suitable.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,480
The whole place is our museum.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,800
It's quite big.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,870
Xiaoyue,

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,830
what's up?

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,800
Sir, may I go to the restroom, please?

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,800
Sure.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
Thank you.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,880
I only go for five minutes.
I'll be back soon.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,430
I'll make up the time
during my lunch break.

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,920
I'll definitely finish my work in time.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,830
Alright, let's stop here for today.

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,920
As for some follow-ups,

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,110
you can go for our HR colleagues

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,950
and contact them.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,350
You should wait for my notice.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,030
You were having an interview, right?

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,790
Yes, for an intern.

23
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,590
But I'm not resigning.

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,150
Do you want to fire me now?

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Xiaoyue, what are you thinking about?

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,510
How could I fire someone casually?

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
I really don't want to
leave this position.

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Here.

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
my families are here.

30
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,400
You put it so nicely.

31
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,230
Actually,
I've already regarded the museum

32
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,510
as my home.

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,920
You work here steadily.

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,790
This will always be your warmest home.

35
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,150
Thank you, supervisor.

36
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,990
You're welcome.

37
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,950
Sir, the next interview is about to start.

38
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,590
About once a month,

39
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,280
it's normal to interview one or two people.

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,870
Do we interview these seven together
or separately?

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Xiaoyue, just focus on your work.

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,350
Don't think too much.

43
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,790
I'll go take a look.

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
Didn't the supervisor already say

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,430
that you're not being transferred?

46
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,760
You really have no idea

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,200
how treacherous the workplace can be.

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
I guess I don't have much time left.

49
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Xiaoyu,

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,350
when will that vermilion silk-cotton robe

51
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,760
be taken down for maintenance?

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,630
It was just put up a couple of days ago.

53
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,280
It may be a month
before the exhibition is changed.

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,920
What's wrong?

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,630
Well, I'm doing digital scanning.

56
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,710
I want to scan that one.

57
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,190
Then you'll have to ask the supervisor.

58
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,520
But he's quite busy today.

59
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,360
I know.
He interviewed eight people this morning.

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,800
Yeah, what about the eight
in the afternoon?

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,190
Sorry.

62
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,590
I didn't expect that either.

63
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,560
After Manager Zhang
found out about the procurement,

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,630
he directly gave it to his nephew.

65
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,960
Then where is his nephew?

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,030
I can go to find him.

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
He ran away.

68
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,430
He didn't even open his pouch,

69
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,280
just took 5 qian and ran away.

70
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,080
There aren't many customers in the store.

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,470
We thought we could
benefit from the Mansion.

72
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,710
You know, in your tavern,

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
apart from drinking,

74
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,360
there aren't
any entertainment activities.

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,750
So boring.

76
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,190
This is the place
for drinking and chatting.

77
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,190
I mean you don't even have mahjong.

78
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,630
How dull.

79
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,470
Mahjong?

80
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,150
You guys haven't played it before?

81
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,120
There are Characters, Dots, and Bamboos.

82
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,750
And each has four.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,120
What's this?

84
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,430
This is "Yaoji".
[*Yaoji: another name of One Bamboo]

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
I can't draw the Yaoji well.

86
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,120
Just make do with it.

87
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Okay, I'll ask the clerk
to make it right away.

88
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,470
Hello?

89
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,980
Hello, this is Hemei Photo Studio.

90
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,470
Ms. Wang Xiao has an appointment tomorrow.

91
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,590
But we haven't been able to
reach her these days.

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,190
I'm looking for her too.

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
Should we cancel tomorrow's photo shoot?

94
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,150
Yes.

95
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,710
Wait,

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
can you postpone it?

97
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,840
My mom...

98
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,710
hasn't come back yet.

99
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,960
Sure.

100
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,520
Contact us in advance when it's OK.

101
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,710
Fine, thank you.

102
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
What's up?

103
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,750
My mom had an appointment
for a photo shoot tomorrow,

104
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,150
but she's not here.

105
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,710
Forget it.

106
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,190
I'll wait until she comes back.

107
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,830
Otherwise, she'll blame me
if the photos aren't good.

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,560
Miss, the mahjong is ready.

109
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,830
This is mahjong?

110
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,480
Yes, they're made
according to the design.

111
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,270
First, shuffle the tiles.

112
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,420
(Shuffling)

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
Stack the tiles.

114
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,540
(Stacking)

115
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,680
This is our ancestral craft

116
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,120
of building the Great Wall.

117
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,360
Draw the tiles.

118
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,140
(Drawing)

119
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,510
Play tiles.

120
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,190
(Playing)
One Bamboo.

121
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,350
Two Bamboos.

122
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,270
Five Characters.

123
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,750
Keep the Red Dragon,
and everything will go smoothly.

124
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,000
(Red Dragon)

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,950
A couple of days ago, archaeologists

126
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,950
discovered a stoneware.

127
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,950
We're really not sure what it is.

128
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,120
So we've invited experts here to identify

129
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,870
what exactly this stoneware is.

130
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,140
(Chinese character "Zhong")

131
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,790
It looks familiar, but...

132
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Mr. Li, have you got any ideas?

133
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,720
I found it.

134
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,800
My guess has finally been confirmed.

135
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,830
The official language of the Han Dynasty

136
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,160
is the dialect of Henan Province.

137
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,800
It's very likely

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
the seal used by the emperor
to approve memorials.

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,390
Just one character,

140
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,350
Zhong.

141
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,630
This is it.

142
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,720
Be careful when packing.

143
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,930
Make sure nothing gets broken.

144
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,270
- Keep it safe. Sir.
- All right.

145
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,160
Go ahead.

146
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,510
- I wanted to ask...
- Xiaoyue, I want to talk something with you.

147
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,680
CCTV is going to do a program
about cultural relics.

148
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,430
Our museum needs to
provide several exhibits.

149
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,950
Organize staff to pack the exhibits
and register them.

150
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,590
They'll be transported away
in tomorrow morning.

151
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,320
I just wanted to ask...

152
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Stop.

153
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,210
I know.

154
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,070
Just work hard here.

155
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,240
Our team can't do without you.

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
No, I wanted to ask about
the vermilion silk-cotton robe.

157
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,040
You already know about this, right?
Yes, that's right.

158
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,510
This exhibit also needs to be taken down

159
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,600
and transported away tomorrow.

160
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,190
What? Tomorrow?

161
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,030
Yes.

162
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,070
Let me go take it down.

163
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,950
No, you're in charge of
lacquerware and silk paintings.

164
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,160
Xiaoyu is in charge of textiles.

165
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,920
Sir,

166
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,070
I found
an unregistered Western Han pouch.

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,310
I can go to help Xiaoyu.

168
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,950
She's packing in the warehouse right now.

169
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,950
But she is really a bit slow.

170
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,390
After you finish your work,

171
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,310
you can go and help her.

172
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,560
Really?

173
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,920
Yes, when you're done.

174
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,510
Hey, go after you finish.

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,480
Young people these days
have such high work passion.

176
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,510
All of a sudden she is gone...

177
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,240
Self-drawn win!

178
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,270
Bingo!

179
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,300
(Unexpected reboot and update)

180
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,940
(Rebooting)

181
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,780
(Rebooting)

182
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,180
(Rebooting)

183
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,670
Nine Bamboos.

184
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,510
- Bingo!
- Bingo!

185
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,790
Bingo!

186
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,950
- Yeah!
- Bingo!

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
Xiaoyue,

188
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,030
I'm done over there.

189
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,500
The supervisor
asked me to come and help you.

190
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,390
Great.

191
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,670
What's in your pocket?

192
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,670
I just heard you sneeze.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,390
You've saved my life.

194
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,590
Xiaoyue,

195
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,510
you haven't left yet?

196
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,720
In a minute.

197
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,440
Well,

198
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,630
it's already been an hour.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
Still not leaving?

200
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,550
One hour already?

201
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,350
Right.

202
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,790
Fine, you go ahead.

203
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,790
How about we go back?

204
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,390
No, we can't go.

205
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Forget it.

206
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,390
Let's go back and think it over.

207
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,840
My legs are numb. I can't move.
