00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,060
(Unveiling National Treasures)

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,240
Hello everyone,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,910
I'm the guardian of national treasures.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,640
The national treasure
I'm presenting to you

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,550
is a silk painting
from the Western Han Dynasty,

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,620
(Picture of Unfiliality,
unknown age)

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,030
The silk painting is of great value.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,960
Because it very rarely
takes an unfilial daughter

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,600
(Picture of Unfiliality)
- as the protagonist

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,800
and records all her misdeeds

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,470
one by one.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,070
Its vivid descriptions

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,280
and rich details

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,710
make us feel the author's

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,750
indignation that
has spanned thousands of years.

17
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,000
Next, I'll tell you the story behind

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,030
the Picture of Unfiliality.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,470
A talented lady named Wang
had a daughter

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,750
called Xiaoyue,

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,840
born in 1996.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,110
Xiaoyue was in charge of
the storeroom of a museum.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,110
But to sum her up in one word,
it's "ordinary".

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,920
Her daily life completely

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,960
relied on her good mom, Mrs. Wang,
to take care of.

26
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,200
She not only failed to be grateful

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,560
but also had a perfunctory attitude
towards her mom.

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,480
She often made sarcastic remarks
to Mrs. Wang,

29
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,040
acting fake friendly.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,400
Acting fake friendly?

31
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,200
Little did she know
that without Mrs. Wang,

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,570
Xiaoyue's life would be in utter chaos.

33
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,070
In utter chaos?

34
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,570
She thought she could
take care of herself

35
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,620
only by not having vegetables

36
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,570
and staying up late every day.

37
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,620
She didn't dare to say it out loud.

38
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,940
But, she clearly thought I was annoying

39
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,000
and that I was invading her space.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,880
Her room is so messy that

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,480
even cockroaches have nowhere
to set their feet.

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,000
What?

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,640
Yet she still felt extremely wronged.

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
She schemed against me all day long

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,070
and wanted to drive me out of home.

46
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,640
So, I must write this down

47
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,430
to warn future generations.

48
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,590
- (Western Han Artifact - Silk Painting)
- Warn, warn, warn.

49
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,200
Wang Xiao!

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,300
Where did you put the painting?

51
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,190
I've already presented it to the master.

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,120
Who is your master?

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,300
Lord Li Xi.

54
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,200
Now you can be this quick.

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
You should put that quickness
to good use.

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,870
You're always slow when playing mahjong.

57
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,020
(The Mansion of Marquis Dai)

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,000
Darling,

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,470
darling,

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,270
darling,

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,870
I have a question for you.

62
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,000
You're good at history.

63
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,840
Do you know who Li Xi is?

64
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,680
Why are you asking about Li Xi?

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,030
Just wondering.

66
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,750
Do you think this person is easy to find?

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,840
You don't know Li Xi?

68
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,590
No.

69
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,030
Li Xi's father is Li Cang.

70
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,680
Li Cang was the prime minister
of Changsha State.

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,870
He had a wife named Lady Xin Zhui.

72
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,470
After Li Cang died,

73
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,840
Li Xi inherited his father's title

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
and became the second Marquis Dai.

75
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,470
His house is called

76
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,910
the Mansion of Marquis Dai.

77
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,750
So the young master is Li Xi.

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,310
Why haven't I heard
the servants mention it?

79
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,750
Which servant will call the master
by his full name?

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,470
No wonder,

81
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,150
they always say things like master,

82
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,520
marquis, marquis.

83
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,630
I even thought the master
is named "marquis".

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,430
Why don't you think
he is named "monkeys"?

85
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,080
That's why I don't like chatting with you.

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,400
What can I talk to you?

87
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,870
Why are you asking about Li Xi?

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm just wondering.

89
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,800
You should get up now.

90
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,680
You also didn't get tucked in.

91
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,750
Why are you here?

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Yanzi,

93
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,960
thanks to your care these days.

94
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Well,

95
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,390
I've always wanted to
find a chance to repay you.

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,630
How about this?

97
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll do your work today.

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
Let me do it.

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
That's so kind of you,

100
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,040
but your job is quite dangerous.

101
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,430
It's okay.

102
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,720
Just let me show

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,800
my gratitude.

104
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,920
Then thanks a lot.

105
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,120
I'll stay here. You can leave now.

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
No.

107
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,920
If I go out

108
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,390
and Manager Zhang sees me,

109
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
he'll assign me more work.

110
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
I'll stay here and do it with you.

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,720
Good morning, Manager Zhang.

112
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,360
It's almost lunchtime.

113
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
It's still early.

114
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
The maid Xiaoyue,

115
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,750
is late by 1 two-hour.

116
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,420
(Xiaoyue, late by 1 two-hour)

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,430
What's this?

118
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,560
The record book of work attendance.

119
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,510
How come there's still
attendance management?

120
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,040
What are you still dawdling for?

121
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,070
You're already late.

122
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,310
Go and clean the front yard,

123
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,750
and wash three basins of clothes
in the back yard.

124
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Got it.

125
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,630
You don't have to go over there.

126
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
The master won't go there
for a year or so.

127
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,070
For the scrolls,

128
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
you can clean up here.

129
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,120
These five scrolls are new.

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
He hasn't had time to read them yet.

131
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Okay.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,040
How can you read his scrolls?

133
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,070
Just wipe the dust on the surface.

134
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Okay, okay.

135
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,630
I'm so tired.

136
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,920
Why is being a maid more tiring
than being in prison?

137
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,120
The only hope of going back

138
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,390
cannot be lost.

139
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,080
I need to put it away.

140
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,080
Where are you going?

141
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,470
To the latrine.

142
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,360
Testing poison is really dangerous.

143
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,160
What should I do...

144
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,950
Hey, Xiaoyue

145
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,560
doesn't even make her bed,

146
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,830
look at her.

147
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,190
The treatment and repair of hemorrhoids?

148
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm so tired.

149
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,190
What are you doing?

150
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,160
I've told you so many times

151
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,950
don't touch
"Physical and Breathing Exercises Picture".

152
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,750
It's the key for us to go back.

153
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,190
This... this is the Picture?

154
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,550
I'll go to work.

155
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,720
As long as you don't touch it randomly,

156
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
it won't get lost.

157
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,390
The master said last time that

158
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,920
the study needs some green plants.

159
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,870
Let's go and carry two pots of flowers.

160
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,120
When will I finish my work?

161
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,560
I can never lose the Picture,

162
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,570
or my mom will nag me about this
for the rest of my life.

163
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,960
Where could it be?

164
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,510
The painting is gone!

165
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,710
What should we do?

166
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,630
If the master finds out, we're doomed.

167
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,110
Yaoyao,

168
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
don't you have one in your room?

169
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,870
The one in my room is also gone.

170
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,920
Yanzi,

171
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
it's really not here.

172
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,360
Yaoyao, isn't it right here?

173
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,270
I'll take it.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm so exhausted.

175
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,840
Mom, where's my Picture?

176
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,200
I have put it away for you.

177
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,000
Here it comes.

178
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,390
It seems you have put it away
in several parts.

179
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,240
No, it's one of them.

180
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
Hurry up, help me find it.

181
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,870
What's this?

182
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Hemorrhoids again.

183
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,600
I've found it!

184
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,840
Why are there two paintings?

185
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,120
One is from the master's room.

186
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,600
Which one is ours?

187
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,000
It's okay.

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,630
Let's keep both of them.

189
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,470
Calm down.

190
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,160
What's this?

191
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,240
I can't explain too much.

192
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,630
Before Yanzi notices,

193
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,200
I should quickly
return back the left scrolls.

194
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,000
I mean the "Picture of Unfiliality".

195
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,510
Yes! It's here! I've been looking for...

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,910
I've never seen it.

197
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,600
The daughter of Mrs. Wang?

198
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,320
Xiaoyue, who manages the exhibits
in a museum?

199
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,510
So who is she?
