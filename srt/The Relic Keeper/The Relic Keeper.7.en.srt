(Extend love for the aged & young

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,640
Doctor,

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,770
is it possible that their massage

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,670
hurt my mom?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,720
How serious is it?

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,560
They didn't even look professional to me.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,550
I got a massage too.
Add me to the appointment list?

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,160
I always feel my heart pounding.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,550
Stop talking and it'll stop pounding.

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,390
According to the report,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,350
your mother has high blood pressure.

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,590
What medicine does she usually take?

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,440
High blood pressure?

14
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,400
My mom didn't tell me that.

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,000
Judging from the condition,
it's been a long time.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
- She must be taking medicine.
- When did she get that?

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,540
You should communicate more
with your mom.

18
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,390
It's still very dangerous.

19
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,840
Why didn't she tell me earlier?

20
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,600
She's stable now.
She can go home and have a rest.

21
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,670
Why did she hide this from me?

22
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,520
- I'll prescribe some medicine.
- What if something happens?

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,910
- Here's the prescription.
- Thank you.

24
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,400
Please, go ahead.

25
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
You still wanna get added
to the appointment list?

26
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,440
I think
your blood pressure is a bit high.

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,980
It's from anger.

29
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,430
Do you think this is my fault?

30
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,200
She always meddles in everything.

31
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,240
Now she has high blood pressure,

32
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,660
and I didn't know that.

33
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,470
She doesn't want to make you worry about her.

34
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,520
But does it make me feel good
that she hid it from me?

35
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,920
- I think...
- I think it's clear.

36
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,600
She is just irresponsible as a mom.

37
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,560
Actually, I want to say that...

38
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,400
You're right.

39
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,310
It's me, the daughter, who is irresponsible.

40
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,710
Xiaoyue, don't be too sad.

41
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,510
She must not want to
make me sad and worried.

42
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,870
She didn't tell me
because she didn't want to trouble me.

43
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,150
She's always nagging.

44
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,280
But when something's wrong,

45
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,150
she doesn't even say a word.

46
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,480
It's like she's a stranger to me.

47
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
But even if we bickered before,

48
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,760
we're family, after all.

49
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
How much more do I owe her?

50
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,230
Xiaoyue, don't blame yourself too much.

51
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,780
Family members don't have to
bare their souls,

52
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,280
but they should
share their medical records.

53
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,920
I think your mom is in good health.

54
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Can you do me a favor?

55
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840
You do me a favor.

56
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,710
Go for
a full physical examination tomorrow.

57
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,760
Fine, can you...

58
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,310
Sure, I can do anything.

59
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,230
Can you get the medicine for me?

60
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,920
It's already past the time.

61
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,070
I'm really a terrible daughter.

62
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm really a terrible constable.

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,870
As a grown man,

64
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,710
what are you crying for?

65
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,950
The county magistrate asked me
to search for the cat.

66
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,790
Such a big case!

67
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Do you know why I haven't solved it yet?

68
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,360
Why?

69
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,240
Because you won't admit it.

70
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,310
I've already said I'm not Yaoyao.

71
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,710
I'm Wang Xiao.

72
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,310
I traveled through time.

73
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,120
Who would even believe that?

74
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,590
Believe it or not.

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,310
I told you to help me travel back.

76
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,710
But you won't help me.

77
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,750
What can I do?

78
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,870
Give me a seat.

79
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,150
I've already said it was just a dream.

80
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,190
Ever since I had that dream,

81
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,960
I've been having bad luck every day.

82
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,680
I can't solve the case,

83
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
so the master scolds me.

84
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,360
And he deducted my salary.

85
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,000
I can hardly afford to eat.

86
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,400
And finally, my child is sick.

87
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,840
I'm begging you, please.

88
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,630
Just confess to the crime.

89
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,120
Get up, get up first.

90
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,910
You just said the child is sick.

91
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,400
What's wrong?

92
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,680
My son Douzi is seven years old
this year.

93
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,560
I don't know what's wrong recently.

94
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,910
His whole body is burning hot.

95
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,800
I gave him some doses of medicine
but they didn't work.

96
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,120
Could it be a fever?

97
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,430
Fever?

98
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,000
What does that mean?

99
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
Douzi is lucky.

100
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,630
Take this and he'll be fine.

101
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
What is this?

102
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,680
Medicine, to bring down the fever.

103
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,360
Something of unknown origin.

104
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,590
I won't give it to Douzi.

105
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,680
Are you worried about Douzi or not?

106
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,430
Did Manager Zhang

107
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,630
ask you to test the poison on Douzi?

108
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,240
You're so vicious.
The most vicious one is a woman's heart...

109
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,470
not a little girl's.

110
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,630
Then he'll keep burning hot.

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,310
Are you sure it works?

112
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,960
It's the medical technology
over two thousand years.

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,870
You ancient people...

114
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,430
Well, I'm not against ancient people.

115
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,360
I just can't explain it to you.

116
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
I'll trust you this time.

117
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,470
What are you doing?

118
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,800
Testing for poison with a silver needle.

119
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,150
Don't worry.

120
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,430
I think your mom is in very good health.

121
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,960
But health is hard to predict.

122
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
Take me for example.

123
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,310
Although I usually look...

124
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,120
It really doesn't seem very good.

125
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,840
It's already so obvious?

126
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,190
What?

127
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,240
I've been losing a lot of hair recently.

128
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,430
Am I going bald?

129
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,390
Don't scare me.

130
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,630
Don't worry. It's okay.

131
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,480
You and your mom are both good people.

132
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
Good people will live a long life.

133
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,310
It's limited.

134
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,720
If I can't save her,

135
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,830
she has to live another 2,200 years

136
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,070
before we can get reunited.

137
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,270
So, we have to find my mom quickly.

138
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,430
My mom is the only hope for us.

139
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,830
You can't let yourself
be massaged casually anymore.

140
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,630
We have to think of other ways.

141
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,950
Where do you think
your mom could have gone?

142
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,070
My mom is very family-oriented.

143
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,800
She once told me that

144
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,630
no matter how far she goes,

145
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,870
she can always find her way home.

146
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,950
Where is your home?

147
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,480
This is our museum's

148
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,510
map of Changsha State.

149
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,630
Is your home location on it?

150
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,030
Here.

151
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,070
My home is at the bend of this river.

152
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,390
Here is...

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,300
(Blind Date: Meeting True Love)

154
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,800
(Marriage-seeking)

155
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Xiaoyue,

156
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,360
what place is this?

157
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
The blind date corner.

158
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,760
Blind date?

159
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,920
This place is the old site of your home.

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,630
If what you said is true,

161
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,270
your mom will definitely find here.

162
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,350
Remember,

163
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,120
to get out of here without interruption,

164
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,000
you should never nod casually.

165
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,590
Okay.

166
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,800
Come here and take a look.

167
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
We're looking for someone.

168
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,510
For these snacks,

169
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,510
Douzi can get excessive internal heat
if he has some.

170
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,870
So what if he wakes up

171
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,310
and wants to eat them?

172
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,630
It's not hot anymore.

173
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,040
Yaoyao, you're really my savior.

174
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,720
So the fever has gone down.

175
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,120
Take this medicine.

176
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,510
If the fever comes back,

177
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,120
take it once every six hours.

178
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,560
What?

179
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
Well, 3 two-hour.

180
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,750
- Okay.
- Take it once.

181
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,040
Don't take more.

182
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
Thank you very much.

183
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,360
What are you doing?

184
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
You've saved Douzi's life.

185
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,630
It's like you saved my life.

186
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,920
From now on, you're like his real mom.

187
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,270
Hey, are you taking advantage of me?

188
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,430
I didn't mean that.

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,950
Fine, get up now.

190
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,800
Now that I've helped you with one thing,

191
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,920
should you also help me?

192
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
- At your command.
- Why did you kneel down again?

193
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,270
I really traveled through time.

194
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
You should help me travel back.

195
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,110
I don't get you.

196
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,670
I...

197
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm Wang Xiao.

198
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,870
Yaoyao and I

199
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,950
have swapped souls.

200
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,510
I want to swap back.

201
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,720
I really don't understand.

202
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,710
Forget it.

203
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,360
Douzi has just recovered.

204
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,390
Go buy some vitamins
to replenish electrolytes,

205
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,270
and to boost immunity.

206
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,590
It's on me.

207
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,720
All right, I know a really good store.

208
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,470
Now you can get me?

209
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,390
I told you not to nod.

210
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,630
How would I know?

211
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,560
Have you found her?

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,190
No, they don't look like your mom.
What about you?

213
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,390
I was running as fast as I could.

214
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,800
Even if your mom
can find the original place,

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,190
she'll just come and take a look, right?

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
She probably won't come to a blind date.

217
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,400
You'd better think it over.

218
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,360
Is there anything special about your mom?

219
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,190
When I was a kid,

220
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,070
my mom often sang a nursery rhyme
to lull me to sleep.

221
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,070
She wrote it for me.

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,800
If she hears the song,

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,870
she should remember you.

224
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,590
Definitely.

225
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,790
Wait for me.

226
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,950
Let's welcome the lady
to give us a performance!

227
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,510
Sing with this, so that everyone can hear.

228
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,870
Welcome!

229
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,600
- Come on.
- Great!

what's going on?

Why can they all sing it?

239
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,560
Well,

240
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,120
did you say
this song was written by your mom?

241
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,650
Of course.

242
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,840
This song, called "Jiangnan",

243
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,910
is representative of
the Han-Dynasty Yuefu Poetry.

What do you mean?

246
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,390
It means that

247
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,390
everyone learned it when they were kids.

248
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,600
You sang really well.

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,030
You can sing it again if you want.

250
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,840
Bravo!

252
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,120
- Great!
- One more, please.

253
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,710
- Beautiful! Please go on.
- It's OK, let's go.

254
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
I didn't expect that

255
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,270
the song my mom sang to me

256
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,120
is liked by everyone.

257
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,390
I'll sing it again.
