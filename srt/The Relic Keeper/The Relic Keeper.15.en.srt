1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,060
(Wanmu Hall)

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,070
The back wall of the medical clinic

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,120
is right next to
the Marquis Dai's Mansion.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,710
It's convenient for you to work here.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,710
This mustn't be known by Lady Xin Zhui.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,870
That's for sure.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,510
But if you, the Marquis,
work here in person,

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,800
within half a day

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,070
the whole Linxiang County
will know about it.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,200
I've already made preparations.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,040
The clinic is open!

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,180
=The Relic Keeper=
=Episode 15=

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,110
The Marquis is indeed
obsessed with medicine,

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,200
and he even opens a medical clinic.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,560
This is the first time I've heard of it.

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,560
Then why is Lady Xin Zhui
so determined this time?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,200
You should confiscate his stuff.

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,040
By this way,
you can discipline him easily.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
You're right.

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,040
Burn them away and he'll get disciplined.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,760
The Lady burnt all the medical books
and scrolls away,

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,150
and that's the reason.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,790
Do you think this can be
put back together?

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
Xiaoyue,

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,840
I know you don't blame Lady Wang.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,150
She didn't expect this either.

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,310
Lady Wang, don't blame yourself too much.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
I understand you.

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,950
It's terrible to feel
there's nothing more you can do.

30
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,510
You always feel useless, right?

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,350
I understand that.

32
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,760
You're feeling sorry, right?

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Wish you had
had a big fight earlier, right?

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
That's okay. There's still a way.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,680
You can stay here.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,120
At worst, Lady Wang,

37
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,790
sorry, Lady Chen,
you can try to support Xiaoyue.

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,870
Then I can have one more sister here.

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,360
What a great idea!

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
I, Yaoyao, am really kind and smart.

41
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,430
So great.

42
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,520
Where should this little character be?

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,150
Over here.

44
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,030
Why does this look a bit like my uncle?

45
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,150
Your uncle?

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,710
I know where there's one.

47
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,030
How did you get hurt?

48
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,120
I sprained myself
while working in the fields.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,960
What about you?

50
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,520
I hurt my waist
while delivering rice to a grain store.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
Where is the doctor?

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,400
He usually comes in the afternoon.

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,470
It should be soon.

54
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,470
The painting seller
didn't set up his stall today.

55
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,620
(The Benevolent and Skilled)

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
The clinic is open!

57
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,590
Come here and line up.

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,430
The clinic is open.

59
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,860
(The Benevolent and Skilled)

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,050
What can connect to the future

61
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,850
is not the
"Physical and Breathing Exercises Picture",

62
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,150
but the one in the clinic.

63
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,960
The clinic is built
along the outer wall of the Mansion,

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,680
right next to it.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,150
The other side of the clinic wall
is the one in our room.

66
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,240
It seems this wall is the key.

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,000
Every time the passage opens up,

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,280
it doesn't appear
on the side of the clinic.

69
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,800
Instead, it appears in Yaoyao's room.

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,480
This made us think that

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,510
the Picture in Yaoyao's room was the key.

72
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,190
Is that a coincidence?

73
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,190
Not really.

74
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,560
I came here at the end of the workday.

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,120
- Yaoyao, what about you?
- Me, too.

76
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
When Qin brought me here,

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
it was also the end of your workday.

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,750
Li Xi has official duties during the day.

79
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,870
Every time he sees patients,
it's in the afternoon,

80
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,830
nearing dusk.

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,800
This is also the time
when the passage opens up.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,720
Time is important.

83
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,000
It's the key to healing everything.

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
Something's not right...

85
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,390
He sees patients almost every day.

86
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,830
So does that passage appear every day?

87
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,480
Are there some other factors?

88
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,430
The door of temptation
is opened on the other side.

89
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,950
The passage opens up from the other side...

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,950
It's the frequency, the frequency of sound.

91
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,310
Every time the passage opened up,

92
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,950
I felt an abnormal frequency vibration.

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,830
I also felt it in the clinic today.

94
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,750
The frequency...

95
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,040
What kind of strange sound would it make?

96
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,920
This sound isn't strange at all.

97
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,120
It's the sound you make
when you're in pain

98
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,800
or when you're happy.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
It's the sound of ordinary people's lives.

100
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,560
It's also the sound
that brings them hope.

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
The clinic is open!

102
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,750
That means

103
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,000
if enough people go to the clinic,

104
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,680
we'll be able to go back soon.

105
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,920
Let's go and see tomorrow, and we'll know.

106
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,510
(Linxiang County)

107
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,350
Give me a hand.

108
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,750
(Wanmu Hall)
At least get the kid checked out first.

109
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
Stop, stop, stop arguing!

110
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,120
By order of Lady Xin Zhui,

111
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,680
the clinic is closed.

112
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,390
- Closed?
- But what about my leg?

113
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,430
The doctor said
I only need two more treatments.

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,190
I can't even lift my arms.

115
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,750
I have to deliver goods tomorrow.

116
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,360
My granddaughter has a stomachache.

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,830
I really can't wait.

118
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,360
Let us in, please.

119
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,430
Yeah, let us in.

120
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,510
Let us in.

121
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,190
Please let us in.

122
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,390
Come on.

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,430
Just let us in.

124
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,360
Open the clinic.

125
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,000
How long has it been?

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,870
Please open the clinic.

127
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,120
These are all patients.

128
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,040
They live in Linxiang County.

129
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,430
The one pushing the cart is Li Er.

130
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,600
He has mouths to feed and diapers to change.

131
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,430
The whole family depends on him
to work for a living.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,070
That's Uncle Zhuang.

133
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,800
He hasn't slept lying down
for more than ten years.

134
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,720
And Aunt Liu

135
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,920
has been a worker all her life.

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,120
In the end, she couldn't even

137
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,310
pick up her own grandson.

138
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,920
Then why don't they go to a doctor?

139
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,680
Li Xi is their best hope.

140
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,470
Li Xi?

141
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,630
Yes, Lady.

142
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,430
That night, I drank too much
and caused trouble.

143
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,190
I'm afraid I gave you some wrong advice.

144
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,390
Li Xi is very lucky

145
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,000
to be born in the Marquis Dai's Mansion.

146
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,560
But no matter how much
you've done for him,

147
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,000
he can only be a good son.

148
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,160
Only if you give him freedom

149
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,340
can he become himself.

150
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,560
But after all, he is the Marquis

151
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,950
and has to
take on heavy responsibilities.

152
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,480
How can he just do whatever he wants?

153
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,510
But the Marquis is an adult too.

154
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,950
Look,

155
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,040
these patients

156
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,750
may not know who the Marquis Dai is,

157
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,560
but they will surely be grateful to

158
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,630
the doctor sitting in the clinic.

159
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Are you okay?

160
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm fine, Madam.

161
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,510
Thank you.

162
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,320
Well...

163
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,000
What are you just standing there for?

164
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,510
The doctor is here.

165
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,480
If it's any later,
you won't be able to see the doctor.

166
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,560
- The doctor is here!
- The doctor is here!

167
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,120
Let him examine the kid first.

168
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,140
(Saving Lives)
(The Benevolent and Skilled)

169
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
Don't cry, dear.

170
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,440
Mom is hitting it.

171
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,550
It's not good at all.

172
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Just give me some medicine
to relieve the pain for work.

173
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,150
Are you cold wearing so little?

174
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,200
Please,

175
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
just let the doctor take a look, okay?

176
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
We've already come here.

177
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,640
Do you have to wait
until you're seriously ill?

178
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,680
Come here.

179
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,400
Don't always hunch your back.

180
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Straighten your back up.

181
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,790
Why not drink some warm water?

182
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,390
Sorry, my bad.

183
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,360
Let's go and take a rest.

184
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,910
It's a pity that
I burned away the medical Picture.

185
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,270
It's glued back together.

186
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,840
(Wanmu Hall)

187
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,790
Good.

188
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,630
That's good.

189
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,390
The clinic is open!

190
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,380
(The Benevolent and Skilled)

191
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,470
We can go back.

192
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,230
Yaoyao...

193
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,480
Xiaoyue,

194
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,480
go ahead.

195
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,670
There isn't much time left.

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,000
I really hope we can meet again.

197
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,960
Better not.

198
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,270
We've caused a lot of trouble this time.

199
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,360
After you leave,

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,910
I'll take care of the Picture.

201
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,150
You will surely find your mother.

202
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,270
Thank you, Xiaoyue.

203
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,630
Thank you, Auntie Wang.

204
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,510
See you.

♪It's a good time in Jiangnan
for lotus plucking♪

206
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,240

208
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
My dear.

209
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,280
Grandma,

210
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,120
excuse me, as for the folk song,

211
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,390
where did you hear it?

212
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,670
Do you like it too?

213
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,320
I can teach it to you.

214
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,980
(Mawangdui,
Ordinary People Beyond the Spotlight)

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
Xiaoyue,

216
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,750
you've done really well
in this exhibition.

217
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,440
Thank you, Supervisor.

218
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,390
Xiaoyue, I have a question.

219
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,550
Where did you find so many

220
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,510
stories of ordinary people
in the Western Han Dynasty?

221
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,600
I went to the Mawangdui site.

222
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,350
No way.

223
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,360
There are no ordinary people down there.

224
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,960
But the ones up there
are all ordinary people.

225
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,600
Why do I feel so creepy?

226
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,080
Actually they were very happy.

227
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,080
It sounds much creepier.

228
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,920
By the way, Xiaoyue,

229
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,550
there's a promotion opportunity
coming up.

230
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,750
I plan to recommend you.

231
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,670
You've always been

232
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,750
working hard.

233
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,390
(Planning Proposal)
And the exhibition is a big success.

234
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,360
I think you're fully qualified now.

235
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,480
Thank you, Supervisor.

236
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,240
But could you give me some time

237
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
to finish the work at hand?

238
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,600
After going through
some things recently,

239
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,440
I found that

240
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,720
I still prefer to be
with cultural relics.

241
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,720
There's not only value

242
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,360
but also many stories of
ordinary people behind them.

243
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,960
Sometimes I feel like

244
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,600
I can hear their voices.

245
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,630
Supervisor,

246
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,200
- I'll go back to work.
- Go ahead.

247
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,720
According to what she said,

248
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,270
the next project will be postponed again.

249
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,750
Her treatment for the illness
has also been postponed.

250
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,340
(Records of the Historian)

251
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,670
Mom, what's going on?

252
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,000
You're actually reading books.

253
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,720
Is it strange that I'm reading books?

254
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,270
"Comprehensive Mirror
for Aid in Government"

255
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,360
"Book of Later Han"

256
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,560
"Records of the Historian"

257
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,840
And this one is an ancient version.

258
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,270
It's more accurate to read the original.

259
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,510
Do you know it starts flipping
from the other side?

260
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,550
No wonder it's so difficult to read.

261
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,120
What happened to you?

262
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,240
I miss my friends.

263
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,870
You have friends
in the Western Han Dynasty?

264
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,150
Aren't they just mahjong friends?

265
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,440
You're wrong.

266
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,120
The bond among mahjong friends
is the strongest.

267
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,200
I have my brother Qin,

268
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,270
my sister, Lady Xin Zhui,

269
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,720
Yaoyao, Manager Zhang,

270
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,390
Yanzi,

271
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,510
and the cook.

272
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,480
I wonder how they've been.

273
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,840
And you can't find that in these books.

274
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,240
How would history books
focus on ordinary people?

275
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,910
A porcelain shard
from over two thousand years ago

276
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,440
can even be dug out.

277
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,150
But for a person,

278
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,480
why can't there be a single trace left?

279
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,790
There is.

280
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,870
Mom,

281
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,240
why are you here again?

282
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,110
Is your study tour re-starting?

283
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,030
I'm not here for you.

284
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,640
Well, I happen to
have something to ask you.

285
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,880
As for these artifacts,

286
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,590
if the owner comes to claim them,

287
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,830
will you give them back?

288
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,240
When I went to the Western Han Dynasty,

289
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,350
although my phone had no signal,

290
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
I could still take pictures.

291
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,030
You're not going to tell me

292
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,350
you have precious videos
of ordinary people

293
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,110
leading happy lives
in the Western Han Dynasty, right?

294
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,950
Look.

295
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,110
I owe Wang Xiao 30 qian.

296
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,830
I'll pay off the debt with a wooden chime.

297
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
This is hereby recorded.

298
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,920
I owe Wang Xiao 15 qian
for playing mahjong today.

299
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,480
I'll pay off the debt
with the clothes I'm wearing.

300
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,320
This is hereby recorded.

301
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,350
While playing mahjong,

302
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,920
I lost two wooden figurines to Wang Xiao.

303
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,000
This is hereby recorded.

304
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,110
Later my phone ran out of power.

305
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,550
Otherwise, you could be the curator.

306
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,640
I won't thank you for that.

307
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,640
I mean, with the videos,

308
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,240
can you give these things back to me?

309
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,590
I'm not doing it for money.

310
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,110
I just want to keep mementos
of my friends.

311
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,720
Come on, don't go.

312
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,400
I have another video.

313
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,350
Do you know Squire Zhang?

314
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,000
He also lost at mahjong.

315
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,510
His son is single now.

316
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,070
And he's quite good-looking.

317
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,830
Do you want to have a look?

318
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
Xiaoyue!

319
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,950
Come next time, please.

320
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,310
My kid is at school,

321
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,480
but he's not serious-minded.

322
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,510
I owe Wang Xiao 30.

323
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,400
- Qian.
- Qian.

324
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,630
I'll use a wooden...

325
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,920
Chime.

326
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
Well...

327
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,510
How can it be expensive?
Go and ask around.

328
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm selling them at the cheapest price.

329
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,070
Lots of people come to buy my stuff

330
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,590
within almost dozens of miles.

331
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,640
And even our county magistrate

332
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
comes to eat them every day.

333
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,800
Come on,

334
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,310
take some lotus roots.

335
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,510
He always wants to have fun

336
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
and doesn't do his homework.

337
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,900
It's just that
the magistrate buys on credit.

338
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,590
Maybe he'll pay once
in ten days or half a month.

339
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,400
After peeling, there's only
the cabbage core left.

340
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,720
Who am I supposed to sell it to?

341
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,270
I owe Wang Xiao 30 qian.

342
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,110
I'll use a wooden chime...

343
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,310
Look at other kids,

344
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,110
they do their homework
so carefully at home.

345
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,550
My meat is all fresh.

346
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,750
He has to correct his bad habit.

347
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,880
This is hereby recorded.

348
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,000
I've been doing this
for over twenty years.

349
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,310
It's kind of a family tradition.

350
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
The kid's performance isn't good,

351
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,400
but he has a good heart,
which is still very nice.

352
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,590
I like him.

353
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,040
I'll be right there.

354
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,950
That's all.
