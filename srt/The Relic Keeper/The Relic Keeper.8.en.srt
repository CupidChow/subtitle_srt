2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,030
One Character.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,320
Bingo!

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,030
Sorry, guys.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,600
I've been so lucky these days.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,870
There's nothing I can do about it.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,670
I'm out.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,280
You've been winning all afternoon.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,410
Don't be mad.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,800
See you tomorrow.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,640
No way.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,510
Look at him...

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,360
What's the matter?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,960
I'm out of money.

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,030
Fine, put it on the tab first.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,790
You young man,

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,840
you play so badly.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,960
You've been giving others winning hands
all afternoon.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,520
I just can't get used to

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,240
this kind of game full of intrigue.

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,520
Cut it out.

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,000
You come here every day.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,110
Now that you've lost,
you start slandering us?

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,070
Sorry about that.

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,040
What do you do?

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,510
A man of letters.

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,280
I'm sorry for that.

28
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,710
I know,

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,680
you guys

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,590
just love to

31
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,780
come to this kind of
unregulated entertainment spot.

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,430
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,000
That's all you can say?

34
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,590
What do you write about?

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,790
Customs and cultures,

36
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,280
and people here.

37
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,920
Then write about me.

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,640
If you do so,

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
your debt will be cleared.

40
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,990
Really?

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
Yes.

42
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,760
I don't think I can go back.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,230
And my life is definitely a legend,

44
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,710
especially these days.

45
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,230
I need to record my heroic deeds.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,400
Okay.

47
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,150
I'm all ears.

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
Let me tell you.

49
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,870
My name is Wang Xiao.

50
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,560
Speaking of me,

51
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,400
well,

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,870
I have a daughter named Xiaoyue.

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,360
She works in a museum.

54
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,310
And she looks like me.

55
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,680
She's really beautiful.

56
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,840
You have no idea that
when she was little,

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,560
she clung to me every day,

58
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,080
kissing and hugging.

59
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,840
When she grew up,

60
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
she didn't want to cling to me anymore.

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,120
What's the big deal if she's not a kid?

62
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,630
You have no idea that

63
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,800
her room is in a complete mess.

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,470
She always stays up late at night

65
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,600
and doesn't get up in the morning.

66
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,560
She's kind of a slob.

67
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
She seems to be polite to me.

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
But actually...

69
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,910
Well, I'm even mad at talking about this.

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,470
What kind of attitude does she have?

71
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,860
So perfunctory!

72
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,120
She thinks I talk too much,
give her too little space,

73
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,630
type too much, and even meddle too much.

74
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,750
You don't even know
what she calls me outside,

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
"madam".

76
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,360
Several times when she saw me
in the museum,

77
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,030
she pretended not to know me.

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,590
"Madam, may I help you?"

79
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,430
Oh, jesus.

80
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,120
Every time she sees me,

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
she never cracks a smile.

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
Never act filial?

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,800
This really pisses me off.

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
Here, filial piety is highly respected.

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,700
Girl, don't worry.

86
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,500
For this kind of act that
angers both gods and men,

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,660
I will definitely write it down

88
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,120
to warn future generations.

89
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,430
Yes, you're right.

90
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,190
Give them a warning.

91
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,430
You should ask your kids
to learn from it.

92
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,400
My second uncle has never
had a proper job in his life.

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,560
If it weren't for family gatherings,

94
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,280
you'd hardly see him.

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,470
My mom said he's obsessed with
studying time travel.

96
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,310
From myths, aliens to conspiracy theories,

97
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,680
there's nothing he's not crazy about.

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,520
He still believes the Earth is flat.

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
The Earth?

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,600
That is, round sky and square earth.

101
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,520
Well, isn't it?

102
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,870
You'd better stay away from him.

103
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,190
Anyway, as for time travel,

104
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,660
I think he might
know something about that.

105
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,710
Your family really has a lot of talents.

106
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,570
When we go in, I'll look for him,
and you keep watch.

107
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,710
Once we find him, we'll take him out.

108
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,630
We cannot linger too much.

109
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,680
Sounds so dangerous.

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,720
Who are those people over there?

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,520
Relatives.

112
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,390
The second sister is here.

113
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,750
I was just saying

114
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,190
you've been lucky since you were a kid.

115
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,390
What's the use of us coming early?

116
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,580
Look, all the dishes are here
as soon as you arrive.

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,260
You must get stuck in traffic, right?

118
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,020
It's even worse on weekends.

119
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,340
Last weekend,
our family went out for dinner.

120
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,500
We left home at six o'clock.

121
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,620
Guess what?

122
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,020
Already six twenty.

123
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,820
And my grandson suddenly said,
"Grandma."

124
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
Let me show you a video.

125
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,940
Now that everyone's here,

126
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,580
I want to say something.

127
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,980
Uncle, come out with me.
I need to talk to you.

128
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,460
Xiaoyue,

129
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,380
I'm talking now.

130
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,220
Me?

131
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,260
I...

132
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,220
We'd better go outside.

133
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,260
I'm tied up.

134
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,900
It's almost time to
grab the appointment number.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,860
What appointment number?

136
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,260
For the psychiatry department
at Central Hospital.

137
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,340
There used to be few people.

138
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,980
Suddenly, there are a lot more.

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,180
As soon as the numbers are released,

140
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,940
they're all gone.

141
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,340
I have something urgent.

142
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,580
My mom will help you get it.

143
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
Sure.

144
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,060
Sis,

145
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,540
you must keep an eye on it for me.

146
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,980
Every month I have to...

147
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,020
- Don't worry.
- You have to...

148
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Just do as I said.

149
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,860
But...

150
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,060
Otherwise, something bad may happen.

151
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,780
(Psychiatry Department, Central Hospital)

152
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,820
Then let me propose a toast.

153
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,660
Sis,

154
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,880
I heard you were sick a few days ago.

155
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,100
You should exercise more.

156
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,580
My son is filial.

157
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,020
Now I have a grandson.

158
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,180
So I'm busy from morning till night.

159
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,020
Hypertension, high blood sugar,
and high blood fats

160
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,100
are all gone.

161
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,540
Xiaoyue is also a considerate girl.

162
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,340
She can't just watch you

163
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,460
getting worse day by day.

164
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,020
Sis,

165
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,580
you did wrong on this point.

166
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,660
We can't just let young people
do whatever they want,

167
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,140
- (A few minutes left)
- especially girls.

168
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,700
Even if they're successful
in their careers,

169
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,580
they can't ignore their families.

170
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,940
You may have a small family,

171
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,300
but we're here for you.

172
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
After I had my grandson,

173
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,260
my house with four bedrooms
and two living rooms

174
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
isn't enough for him to mess around in.

175
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,140
But I like quietness.

176
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,820
So I still envy you,

177
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,860
as you only need to book a room
with one large bed

178
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,660
for the whole family.

179
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,700
What's going on with you?
So mysterious.

180
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,980
Do you know about time travel?

181
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,100
Time travel?

182
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,220
Sure.

183
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,860
Do you mean wormholes,

184
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,980
or the folding of space?

185
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,340
No.

186
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,980
I mean traveling
from ancient times to modern times,

187
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,700
just like whoosh.

188
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,740
Are you kidding me?

189
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
I'm serious.

190
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,820
My mom said you've studied this.

191
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,980
It was such a long time ago.

192
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,660
I'm cured now.

193
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,740
Look,

194
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,020
am I much more normal now?

195
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,100
How can you

196
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,660
suddenly become normal?

197
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,060
Uncle, don't scare me.

198
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,980
I used to go astray.

199
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,820
But now,

200
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,620
I've totally freed myself.

201
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,100
I'm just like an ordinary person.

202
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,380
I work hard and live actively.

203
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,220
I even go to the psychiatry department
on time.

204
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,620
I feel happy.

205
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,540
No, it's my mom.

206
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,220
She time-traveled.

207
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,300
Don't joke around.

208
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,140
It's true.

209
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,620
Otherwise, why would I come to you?

210
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,940
Uncle?

211
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,340
Where?

212
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,660
In my office.

213
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,620
A passage suddenly opened up.

214
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,580
But I've tried many ways,

215
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,820
and it didn't appear.

216
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,540
Doctor Xu of the psychiatry department
is right.

217
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,580
Sometimes it's not my problem.

218
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
It's the door of temptation
opened on the other side.

219
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,300
You mean,

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,820
the passage was opened up
from the other side?

221
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,860
Doctor Xu said,

222
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,300
there are things that can't be rushed.

223
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,580
Time is important.

224
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,740
It is

225
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,820
the key to curing everything.

226
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,980
Time...

227
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,020
Doctor Xu said...

228
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,580
Why did Doctor Xu talk so much?

229
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,220
No wonder he can't see
many patients a day.

230
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,860
And you should even
grab the appointment number.

231
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,740
Uncle,

232
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,140
what exactly do you know?

233
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,420
Your mom really...

234
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,140
traveled across time?

235
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,220
I knew it.

236
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,260
I've worked on it for so many years.

237
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,220
Uncle?

238
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,780
Why didn't I work it out?

239
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,660
Calm down.

240
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,140
I have to embrace the real world.

241
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,620
You... me... her...

242
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,260
Where did she time-travel to?

243
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,500
The Western Han Dynasty.

244
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,820
You mean the one in there?

245
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,660
She's a girl from the Western Han Dynasty.

246
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,500
Her name is Yaoyao.

247
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,100
It was a troubled time
two thousand years ago.

248
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,820
The war had been raging on.

249
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,060
What's meant to be will be.

250
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,780
Where there's a result,

251
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,260
there must be a solution.

252
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,580
What's the solution?

253
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,540
Doctor Xu said, "Believe in yourself."

254
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,380
Yes!

255
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,940
I'm sure I can find a way.

256
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,500
Is he reliable?

257
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,180
He is not as reliable as you.

258
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,980
♪Good luck, wish you good luck♪

259
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,820
♪Good luck, give you great joy♪

260
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,620
What are you doing?

261
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,140
Watch out.

262
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
Somebody, catch the thief!

263
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,820
My pastries have been stolen.

264
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,900
Mom, I'm hungry.

265
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,580
Be quick.

266
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,460
Run as fast as you can.

267
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,380
Run!

268
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
Where did she go?

269
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,740
It's her! Go ahead!

270
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,580
Is it her?

271
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,780
- Me?
- Stop!

272
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,060
- Are they going to catch me?
- Stop!

273
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,900
Xiaoyue,

274
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,660
why do you always go to the toilet?

275
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,140
Xiaoyue is just being thrifty,

276
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,700
saving water for the family.

277
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,020
Even if you used to be a commissioner,

278
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,670
you're retired now.

279
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,460
Don't always treat your family
like subordinates.

280
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,300
What?

281
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,420
If you sit in the main seat
without hosting a banquet,

282
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,700
and even talk nonsense,

283
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,900
you'll get beaten up in ancient times.

284
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,180
There's nothing to be proud
of having a big family.

285
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,820
We're human beings, not cockroaches.

286
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,020
You have so many people in your house,

287
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,620
but I also have my family.

288
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,140
I have Xiaoyue. What about you?

289
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,980
No one wants to watch

290
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,940
a video of a naked baby crying.

291
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
If so,

292
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,660
be careful, it might be a trafficker.

293
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,380
It's normal for babies
to shout and scream.

294
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,780
But if you adults also do that,

295
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,340
it's not normal.

296
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,540
Sis, I suggest you see a doctor.

297
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,380
What?

298
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,700
Uncle, what others think of you
doesn't matter.

299
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,420
It's your happiness that matters.

300
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,780
Such a bunch of gossip.

301
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,140
I didn't get any useful information.

302
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,460
Thankfully,

303
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,780
I helped your uncle
get the appointment number.

304
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,460
Thanks.

305
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,580
The meaning of relatives you talk about

306
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,180
seems a bit different
from what it used to be in my time,

307
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,260
right?

308
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,750
Happiness is all about comparison.

309
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,210
They need to find a sense of happiness
from our family.

310
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,980
Are they happy?

311
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,900
Have you ever seen a family gathering

312
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,520
where there's only one person
from each family?

313
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,020
They're just putting on an act for others.

314
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,460
Then why do you still
keep in touch with them?

315
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,540
When my grandma was alive,

316
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,140
my mom was afraid she'd worry.

317
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,420
So she maintained relationships
with each family.

318
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,460
Last year, after my grandma passed away,

319
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
my mom reduced her interactions
with them,

320
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,260
but she didn't want to
break off completely.

321
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,220
My mom...

322
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,780
Actually,

323
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,340
the only real family she's had all along

324
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,580
is just me.

325
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,860
So her life has always
revolved around me.

326
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,020
I don't think I've ever seen

327
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,380
her have her own life,

328
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,540
and her own hobbies.

329
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,620
So I've always thought

330
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,140
that she should go and make some friends,

331
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,620
and see the world.

332
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,140
I really hope she can have her own life.

333
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,100
After all, I can't always be by her side.

334
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,540
I don't want her to miss out on a lot
because of me.

335
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,180
I don't want the time to pass too fast.

336
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,140
So these days, looking at you,

337
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,140
I feel like my mom has become younger.

338
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,740
I'm quite...

339
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,820
Happy?

340
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,220
Sad.

341
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,460
I feel like

342
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,300
my mom doesn't seem to be here.

343
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,020
Why?

344
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,660
I've figured it out.

345
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,220
I thought my mom was here,

346
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,900
but it was actually me lying to myself.

347
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,620
It's not true.

348
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,340
I just don't want to believe

349
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,540
that my mom and I are in the same world

350
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,220
and she hasn't come to look for me.

351
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,940
Maybe your mom has her own reasons.

352
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,500
Do you have any uncle you can ask?

353
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,460
When I was ten years old,

354
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,380
my uncle said,

355
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,820
"The Han revolves around the sun,

356
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,140
burned to death."

357
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,340
Oh, stop it.
