2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,510
It's clearly written in the ledger.

3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,350
The kitchen procurement expense
is 100 qian.

4
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,760
- And you only get this?
- Right.

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,920
This is what in the ledger.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,520
But we can't eat the ledger, right?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,240
You don't have to worry about this.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,670
I will eat it if it comes to that.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,710
How can I buy groceries
with just 5 qian?

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,920
Let's make this clear first.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,350
I've already gave you 20.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,120
Yeah,

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,030
but I did this for everyone's sake.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,640
Moreover,

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
where did the other 80 go?

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,240
Promotion is somehow
bound up with embezzlement.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,470
I'm doing this
for the good of our Marquis.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,070
We're all honest people.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,280
It's just that sometimes,

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,430
those above
may not understand our difficulties.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,150
So, do you think
this task can be further divided?

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,560
With just this little money

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
to buy one-day groceries
for Marquis Dai's Mansion,

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,790
even a fool wouldn't take this job.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,040
Yaoyao,

26
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,230
come here.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,240
Hurry up.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,040
Here are 5 qian.

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,960
You go and buy some food.

30
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,550
Sure.

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,430
I've been here for so many days

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
and haven't even been out of the mansion.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,480
Then put away the money.

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,920
So much money.

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,430
Do we have to spend it all?

36
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,430
What food do we need to buy?

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,270
Whatever you like.

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
You're in full charge.

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,480
We won't get involved.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Fine.

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,230
I surely won't let you down.

42
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm out.

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,120
Do you know how many poisonous mushrooms

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,510
she has had?

45
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,560
The more the better.

46
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,840
If she can really...

47
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,350
then the accounts will match.

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,470
And I'll be in the clear.

49
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,310
I won't have to eat the ledger either.

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,910
What? How much does one jin of pork cost?
(one jin=0.5 kg)

51
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,750
10 qian.

52
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,750
Do people in Marquis Dai's Mansion
know this?

53
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,190
Marquis Dai can control you,

54
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,430
but he can't control the pigs.

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,840
Fine, I won't argue with you.

56
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,620
(Scallion, 30 qian one jin;
Cabbage, 20 one jin, 9 for two jin)

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,030
What can I buy with these five coins?

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,560
Come in
and taste our newly brewed alcohol.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,680
Do you drink the alcohol
right after it's brewed?

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,870
Yeah, it's very fresh.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
It just came out of the vat this morning.

62
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,870
How much is it?

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,400
- 6 qian.
- Bye-bye.

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,710
Tasting is free.

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
Just have a taste.

66
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,310
Free?

67
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Take a step,

68
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,310
another a step,

69
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,310
right.

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
Apart from the pouch,

71
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,400
there's one more thing
we need to prepare in advance.

72
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,380
What?

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
We can't go to the Western Han Dynasty
in these clothes.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,910
But I'm not very good at making clothes.

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
That's OK.

76
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,430
There are plenty of people who can.

77
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,150
Take a step.

78
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,000
What kind of strange clothes are these?

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,340
Hello, auntie.

80
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,710
These aren't strange clothes.

81
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,860
They're Hanfu.

82
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,560
I think everyone should learn about it,

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,750
instead of slandering it.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,800
It has been passed down
for thousands of years

85
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,980
and preserves
the traditional Chinese culture.

86
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,480
This is called Hanfu.

87
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,950
I've seen Hanfu before.

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,680
These are just strange clothes.

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,310
Why did you apologize to her?

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,430
She made the clothes like that.

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,680
She'd get beaten for that
if she was in the mansion.

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,220
We just buy two pieces
and go back in them.

93
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,270
Don't be so serious.

94
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,720
Why do you want to buy clothes
to wear back?

95
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,950
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

96
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,160
When you put on that dress, it's like...

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
put this on.

98
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
This is ice cream.

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,720
I know.

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
You do have a point.

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,270
We can't be too obtrusive.

102
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Yaoyao,

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,360
didn't you just say

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,900
that you're not very good at
making clothes?

105
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,560
Yeah.

106
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,900
So that means you can do a little.

107
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,920
It depends on who you're comparing with.

108
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,680
What if
I compare you with that store just now?

109
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,430
Don't make fun of me.

110
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,750
Then the clothes will be no problem.

111
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,830
Come on, everyone, come and take a look.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm Yaoyao from Marquis Dai's Mansion.

113
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
The Mansion has decided

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,190
to recruit regular suppliers
for procurement.

115
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,310
Once selected,

116
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,850
you won't have to sell food here anymore.

117
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,620
We will buy all your stuff.

118
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,470
What a great deal.

119
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,000
Is this for real?

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,830
I'm telling you, there are only a few places.

121
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,720
Those who sign up
need to send two jin of vegetables

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,920
for our selection.

123
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,510
Well, we still have to pick two jin?

124
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,950
Be quick,
this isn't considered a large amount.

125
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,750
(Haoyu Tavern)
Just two jin.

126
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,160
Then we won't have to
be exposed to the wind and sun

127
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,600
to sell vegetables outdoors every day.

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,040
Nor will we have to worry about
the rotting thing

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,720
and not being able to sell them.

130
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,430
This is great.

131
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
Really a good thing.

132
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,950
Yeah, great.

133
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,720
- Then I'll be the first.
- I'll go first!

134
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,750
No, it's me!

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,340
Mine is definitely fresh.

136
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
One by one, please.

137
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,360
I was here first!

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't, don't push!

139
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,430
One by one!

140
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,350
You, please.

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,920
Miss,
my cabbages are all planted by myself.

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,870
I'll give you five jin

143
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,720
so that your master can taste more.

144
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,920
Two is enough.

145
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,510
Thank you, just put them here.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,750
Get out of the way, let me go first.

147
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,590
Miss,

148
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,000
I acted as blind as a bat before.

149
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,200
Please don't hold it against me.

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,720
This is a pig's foot for you.

151
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,170
It's over.

152
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,000
Fine, put it here.

153
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,680
Miss, please take a closer look.

154
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,390
This, this is a new variety.

155
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,680
You can't buy it anywhere else.

156
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,120
Rouge?

157
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,670
Look at his pig's foot.

158
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,590
It's so fresh and nice.

159
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
It looks so great.

160
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,870
Miss, you're smart enough.

161
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,480
When the rouge is put next to a pig's leg,

162
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,460
it already has a good looking.

163
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
What if it is put on your face?

164
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,800
I can't imagine how nice you are.

165
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,030
Get out of here.

166
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,000
Bring me another one.

167
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,510
Otherwise, I'll cancel your qualification.

168
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,720
- But...
- Get out of here.

169
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,590
Go, go away.

170
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,070
These are my lotus roots.

171
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,270
They have top quality.

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,600
Only a rich family
like Marquis Dai's Mansion

173
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,560
can afford them.

174
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,190
Fine, fine, I like lotus roots.

175
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,560
My lotus roots are different from others'.

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Others have holes.

177
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,490
Of course.

178
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,040
Mine are top-notch.

179
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,430
The holes are all filled.

180
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,570
Take a look.

181
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,680
You lotus root sellers

182
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,190
always have so many tricks
up your "holes".

183
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
You

184
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
have a great chance.

185
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,070
Thank you very much. That's great!

186
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,790
Miss,

187
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,430
please look at my vegetables.

188
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,930
Here, look at me.

189
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,860
Later, I'll ask the clerk to push a cart

190
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,070
and send them to your mansion.

191
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,390
Thank you.

192
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm really lucky to have you today.

193
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,710
It's my pleasure.

194
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,320
But...

195
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,910
What?

196
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,150
Don't you drink alcohol?

197
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,780
I got you.

198
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,700
You locals are so enthusiastic.

199
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,360
There was extra money
added to the vegetables,

200
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,670
rouge put with the meat,

201
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,060
and now even alcohol
added to water for me.

202
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,060
You're too kind.

203
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,860
What I gave you is my best alcohol.

204
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,140
Yeah, the best.

205
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,300
Why do I feel so awkward?

206
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,300
It feels like we're not a family.

207
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,820
I think it's good.

208
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,980
Xiaoyue,

209
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,580
don't just look at the fabric.

210
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,860
You have to look at the tailoring
and the stitches.

211
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,660
So you made it like this on purpose.

212
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,820
I told you already.

213
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,660
I'm not very good at making clothes.

214
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,180
Make it more specific.

215
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,940
I can only make rough-cloth ones for me,

216
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,460
and luxurious ones for the old lady.

217
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,540
So which do you like?

218
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,020
I...

219
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,300
I like the one suitable for work.

220
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,060
You've had a tough life.

221
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,420
Yaoyao,

222
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,140
what's our purpose this time?

223
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,060
- To save Mrs Wang.
- Right.

224
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,860
We're going to the Western Han Dynasty
to save her,

225
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,740
not to work in the north.

226
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,860
We need to not only
dress for convenience

227
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,940
but also show some status.

228
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,020
Got it.

229
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:42,060
It doesn't have to be this professional.

230
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,060
And why can you
make such nightwalker clothes?

231
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,220
To rob the rich and help the poor.

232
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,260
You're a chivalrous thief?

233
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,340
No.

234
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,260
I think people in this kind of clothes

235
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,340
are all rich.

236
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,940
I was going to make and sell them
at a high price.

237
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,060
I just haven't found a market.

238
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,740
You're really a business genius.

239
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,780
Who told you to make it like this?

240
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Didn't you say last night

241
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,420
to make something that I like the most?

242
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,420
This is what you like?

243
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,700
I've always wanted to wear a dress

244
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,700
made of silk.

245
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,380
Yellow is my favorite color.

246
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,260
What about that one in the middle?

247
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,020
It's something very sacred.

248
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,700
I think embroidering it on the chest

249
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,140
will bring good luck.

250
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,980
What about the shawl on the shoulder?

251
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,980
I often do manual work
and my shoulders get sore easily.

252
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,300
So it's for warmth.

253
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,420
It really has a retro-futuristic feel.

254
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,340
What did you buy all these for?

255
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,660
We'll need them when we get back.

256
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,380
Imperial seals, a full set of imperial seals.

257
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,180
The imperial seals of the Han Dynasty
are all here.

258
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,060
This is a capital crime.

259
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,100
We can never do that.

260
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I'm not stupid.

261
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,780
Of course I will not use it alone.

262
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,660
(Imperial edict)
I also have this.

263
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,540
I'm afraid my mom's been arrested
by the county officer.

264
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,460
So, I'll write an imperial edict

265
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,620
and order them to release her.

266
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,420
The imperial seal
will come in very handy.

267
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,020
Issuing a fake imperial edict?

268
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,660
Sis,

269
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,980
why do you always have ideas
that can get you beheaded?

270
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,940
Well, if these two don't work,

271
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,260
we can only use this.

272
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,620
What's this?

273
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,780
The imperial sword.
