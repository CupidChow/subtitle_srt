Good girl, Yaoyao.

00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,670
I have something to do outside.

My bracelet is just fine.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,350
Maybe it's your feng shui that's not good.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,240
Could be.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,430
It's an office after all.

15
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,350
There's a lot of resentment.

Well, you can go back and have a rest.

17

I still have to go to work.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,120
Didn't you work overtime last night?

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,310
And you stayed up all night.

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,840
Can you take it?

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm used to it.

22

We can't compete with you.

27
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,590
It seems that

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,640
the bracelet won't work now.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,120
We have to think of something else.

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,400
We'll definitely figure it out.

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,030
it's me, Yaoyao.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
Yaoyao?

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,430
I don't know you.

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,750
But you look exactly like my mom.

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,870
How could it be?

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,000
Your mother must be in her eighties.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,870
No, no.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Actually, I'm eighteen.

43
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,750
Look at you,

44
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,000
who isn't eighteen?

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
You're eighteen too?

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,030
Could it be that like me,

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,750
you also have an eighteen-year-old soul?

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,190
You get me.

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Where are you from?

50
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,590
I...

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,710
I just finished working overtime
at the company.

52
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,310
Me too.

53
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm from the Western Han.

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,680
Is it also an internet company?

55
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,970
I've heard of it.

56
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,280
We can have a meeting someday.

57
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,190
Are you really not my mom?

58
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,280
I've already said,
I just finished working overtime.

59
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,560
And I didn't put on makeup.

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Where are your family members?

61
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Even if you put on makeup,

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,870
you still look like my mom.

63
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,750
It's so fun.

64
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,560
But I really can't play anymore.

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,030
Just let us go.

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,150
My back is sore and my legs are numb.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
I can't play anymore.

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,710
I've already said you need to warm up
before playing.

69
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,750
Pay attention next time.

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,470

For me,

73
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,520
my shoulders will also hurt
if playing all night.

74
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,150
Gentlemen,

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,840
your shoulders hurt, right?

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,680
Come on,

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,560
try this
“Physical and Breathing Exercises Picture”.

78
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,250
It can help treat all kinds of back pain.

79
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,310
It's very effective.

80
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,710
I'll give it a try.

81
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Let me try.

82
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,080
One, two, three, four.

83
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,470
Two, two, three, four.

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000

Four, two, three, four.

86

Five, two, three, four.

87
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,830
Stop.

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,710
- How do you feel?
- Much better.

89
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,920
My back is fine,

90
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,400
and my shoulders don't hurt either.

91
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,710
I cure the illness just by the diagrams.

92
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
How many do you want?

93

His painting stand is really good.

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,520
Let's come back tomorrow.

95
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Sure.

96
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
I think my mom is right here.

97
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,870
Don't scare me.

98
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
This morning I saw someone

99
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,150
who looked exactly like my mom.

100
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,630
You almost scared me to death.

101
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,000
It makes sense.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
Maybe she's a descendant of your family.

103
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,510
But since I came here,

104
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,390
why can't my mom come?

105
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,040
She's just like me.

106
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,480
She also disappeared suddenly.

107
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,390
It does make sense.

108
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,310
But,

109
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,270
I think,

110
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,190
since I can travel through time,

111
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,190
my mom must be able to too.

112
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,310
Our family may be old and well-known.

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,190
What you said is a bit far-fetched.

114
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,720
Now the clue of the bracelet is broken.

115
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,310
There are two things
that have traveled through time.

116
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,000
One is my body,

117
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,750
which has already gone back.

118
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,560
The other is very likely my mom.

119
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,430
If we find my mom,

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,510
maybe we can go back.

121
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,480
When did you become so smart?

122
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,630
Ancient people aren't fools.

123
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,070
How are you going to find her?

124
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,390
My mom is proficient in
massage and acupuncture.

125
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,830
If she's here,

126
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,750
she must be making a living from this.

127
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,600
When you were queuing this morning,

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
I asked around.

129
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,310
There's a best traditional massage shop.

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,310
I recorded it.

131
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,360
You can go and take a look with me.

132
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,070
It's easy if there's a recording.

133
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,430
I'll accompany you to look for her.

140
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,830
Then you must go. This is a big deal.

141

Go ahead.

Wait a minute, Xiaoyue.

145
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
your mother...

146
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,510
isn't Xiaoyue's grandmother?

147
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
Yeah.

148
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,720
But, you did take bereavement leave
last year, right?

149
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,920
She did pass away.

150
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,630
- But...
- The missing is true.

151
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,680
You say that...

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,310
Is this missing?

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,510
How did this happen?

154
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,390
How could you lose it?

Mom,

189
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,630
I'm here.

190
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,390
Mom, I'm Yaoyao.

191
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,480
- Mom.
- Don't come over!

192
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
Mom, mom!

193
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Stop!

194
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,310
Mom!

195
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,240
What are you doing?

196
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
Manager,

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,510
she is not normal.

198
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,690
Xiaoqin, how could you
talk to the customer like that?

199
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,240
All of your bonus this month
will be deducted.

200
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,950
You better watch your attitude.

201
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,630
How dare you bully my mom!

202
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,240
Don't be angry, I...

203
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,600
- Your mom?
- She is my mom!

204
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,630
Whoever tries to bully her,

205
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,830
I'll fight them to death.

206
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,230
Sorry,

207
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm a bit confused.

208
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,120
I just came to find my mom today.

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
I want to be filial to her.

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,040
Whoever scolds her

211
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,630
is like scolding me.

212
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,270
The purpose of our center

213
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,630
is to treat customers like moms.

214
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,830
And being a real mom to customers,

215
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,670
Xiaoqin,

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
you are the first one.

217
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,070
I will double your bonus this month.

218
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,900
You shall give training
to all technicians after work.

219
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,270
Well, you...

220
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,240
you can go on.

221
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
Did I scare you?

222
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,390
Thank you, auntie.

223
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,240
Mom, why are you being so polite to me?

224
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,390
Please sit down.

225
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,720
You're my "mom", you sit.

226
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm not what I seem. I'm Yaoyao.

227
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm your daughter.

228
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
That's enough.

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,510
I won't be your mom anymore.

230
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,870
Mom?

231
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,280
Mom!

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
My neck is not feeling well.

233
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,160
Sir,

234
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,150
what's going on?

235
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,390
For purchase only.

236
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,320
I've lost twice already.

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,750
I'm out of money.

238
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,240
I am for the sake of customers.

239
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,550
You don't have to buy the whole thing.

240
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,960
You can buy a piece of cloth.

241
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,080
One qian each.

242
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,390
Just lift it up and you'll know.

243
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,710
This is cheap.

244
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,030
How do I know
what's under this piece of cloth?

245
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,390
It depends on your luck.

246
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
Which one?

247
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,910
The second one in the second row.

248
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,000
- The second one in the second row.
- Third one.

249
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,120
My neck hurts. This is for the back.

250
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Change one.

251
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
Let me try.

252
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,630
Which one?

253
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,790
The sixth one in the first row.

254
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,720
One, two, three.

255
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
The fifth one, the fifth.

256
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,490
Yes, this one.

257
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,280
I'll have a try.

258
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,270
- Okay.
- I want that.

259
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,320
Pay first.

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,160
Sure.

261
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,740
Which one?

262
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,080
Right, right, this one.

263
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
This one.

264
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,630
- That one.
- Which one?

265
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
That one.

266
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,330
The fourth one on the right
in the third row.

267
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,160
This one?

268
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,870
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

269
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,270
No change?

270
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,600
Yeah, go ahead!

271
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,240
Do it!

272
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,390
- Sure?
- Change one.

273
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,030
Open it!

274
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,510
Open it!

275
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,150
Young people really have good health.

276
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
I even forgot

277
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,150
that I used to be sick.

278
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,790
(Liuxi Foot Massage Center)
I'll never come again.

279
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,110
Don't worry.

280
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,320
If your mom doesn't work here,
we'll think of other ways.

281
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,670
She just refuses to recognize me.

282
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,750
How can she admit it
if she isn't your mom?

283
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,030
And you,

284
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,270
you didn't help me at all.

285
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,910
You were just sleeping next door.

286
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,320
I stayed up late last night.

287
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,790
I don't understand what she said.

288
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,870
She doesn't understand what I said either.

289
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
Let me do it again.

290
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,240
Don't go around
calling others moms anymore.

291
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,750
How many moms have you had these days?

292
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Let me count for you.

293
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,030
You had one when you went out
this morning,

294
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,150
and another one on the bus.

295
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,510
When you entered this center,

296
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
you thought of three front-desk clerks
as your moms,

297
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,320
and one more during the massage.

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,510
Look, that's six already.

299
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,750
Fine, the next one may be your mom.

300
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,510
Yaoyao, don't be discouraged.

301
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,960
I'll be with you.

302
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,470
Yaoyao,

303
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,510
Yaoyao?

304
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,750
Mom!
