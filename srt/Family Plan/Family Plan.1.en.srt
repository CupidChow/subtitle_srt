1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:42,167
"Family Plan"

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,220
Yoonsung, are you there yet?

3
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:55,990
Yeah.

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,724
I just got here.

5
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,101
Already?

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,185
Why?

7
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,106
Are you almost here?

8
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:04,105
I'm still at my cafe.

9
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,024
Still?

10
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,694
There are still so many customers,
so I can't leave yet.

11
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,615
Well, it's okay.

12
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,016
Sorry.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,398
No, it's okay.

14
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,001
Jungmin!

15
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,711
Hello.

16
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,838
We just met last week.

17
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,714
Aren't you busy?

18
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,257
I came to see you.

19
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,550
Really?

20
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,594
Yoonsung is there.

21
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:36,031
I know.

22
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,973
Sorry, I can't make it that day
because of my cafe.

23
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,934
It's okay, we've already talked.

24
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,394
- I heard you are selling your cafe.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,468
It is too far from our new home.

26
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,191
Your cafe is finally doing well.

27
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,567
Do you want coffee?

28
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,611
It's okay, I should get going.

29
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:54,656
Shall we?

30
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,200
What are you staring at?

31
00:01:57,882 --> 00:01:59,008
Nothing.

32
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,578
Those kids?

33
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,539
Yeah.

34
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,291
Are they fighting?

35
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,418
I can see you smiling.

36
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,337
- Did that girl want to break up first?
- Shut up.

37
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:56,676
Why did you pretend
as if you didn't know it?

38
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,803
I mean, I forgot about her.

39
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,014
She used to have a unique hair color.

40
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,308
Do you know
what she has been up to recently?

41
00:03:04,112 --> 00:03:05,072
Not sure.

42
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:09,085
But I heard she got married last year.

43
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:11,281
To a girl?

44
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,443
No,

45
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,611
a guy.

46
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,572
Wow.

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,273
Is she okay with that?

48
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,085
Can you please lower your voice?

49
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,416
No one is here.

50
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,695
How's work?

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,181
So far so good.

52
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,850
I feel so...

53
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,435
good.

54
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,191
Jungmin.

55
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,151
Are you sure...

56
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,156
about shutting down your cafe?

57
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,581
Well, there's no choice.

58
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,630
Where will I go after work now?

59
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,179
This cafe will be one of our memories.

60
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,564
Hold on.

61
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,515
Yeah Mrs. Cho, I am on my way.

62
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,827
I haven't decided yet,
but I have something on my mind.

63
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,398
It is pretty chilly today
so please stay warm at home.

64
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,851
We will go see you this weekend.

65
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,424
Bye, Mrs. Cho, See you soon.

66
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,222
My fiance's mom is very nice.

67
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,515
She calls me quite a bit too.

68
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:09,071
I see.

69
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:12,723
Did you get your hair done?

70
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:15,390
You just saw it now?

71
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,983
How pretty!

72
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,784
Do you remember?

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,705
I was on my way home
and you were waiting for me.

74
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:32,453
So I asked you,

75
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,334
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,726
and you said,

77
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,794
Hey,

78
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,077
I need some help with my math homework.

79
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,499
OK.

80
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,762
Then,

81
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,765
don't call me “Hey”.

82
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,727
The roots of the equation is

83
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,396
X equals negative b

84
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,327
plus minus

85
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:01,366
root b square minus 4ac all divided by 2a.

86
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,278
Done!

87
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,491
Are you also going to sing
while taking the test too?

88
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,285
I can't remember unless I sing.

89
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,573
Okay, Well done.

90
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,874
Let's do this.

91
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,381
It will be divided
by two times four, right?

92
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:27,720
Twelve plus minus root
one hundred forty four minus...

93
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,140
sixteen and five..

94
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,308
minus eighty...

95
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,353
Do you follow?

96
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,382
Why do you keep looking at me during class?

97
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,070
I did not.

98
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,019
What's next?

99
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,247
Hmm, and then..

100
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,965
five minus eighty.

101
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:00,878
Let me try.

102
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:39,125
Umm, Hold on.

103
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,336
My boss might stop by.

104
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,168
You said your boss was off today.

105
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,761
No, actually.

106
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,183
It is a bit awkward.

107
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,853
Why? What?

108
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,713
How can a girl touch another girl's boobs?

109
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:10,881
I've done it.

110
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,414
I am not a lesbian.

111
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,550
How can you control if you're lesbian or not?

112
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:47,385
Bye.

113
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:50,193
Bye.

114
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:20,676
Yoonsung!

115
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,398
Can I ride with you?

116
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,998
Remember we had tofu for lunch right?

117
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,541
Right.

118
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,126
How was it?

119
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,171
It was just tofu.

120
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:53,229
I thought it was yummy.

121
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,353
But when we were kissing earlier
at the cafe,

122
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,017
your lips felt like tofu.

123
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,491
What are you talking about?

124
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,690
You are laughing right?

125
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:08,983
No, I am not.

126
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,443
- Uh?
- Not laughing.

127
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,834
- Know you are.
- I am not laughing.

128
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,029
- Uh?
- I am not laughing.

129
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,905
Stop! Please, stop!

130
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,657
Stop Jungmin!

131
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:20,162
Dangerous!
It is so dangerous. I'm serious.

132
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:21,996
Get off.

133
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,372
Just get off!

134
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:39,366
You are too naughty.

135
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,766
Sorry.

136
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:50,958
Ouch! It hurts!

137
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,235
I thought you were dead.

138
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,200
Sleeping?

139
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,369
Not yet.

140
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,998
It is kind of uncomfortable down here,
I'm coming up.

141
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,014
What am I going to do about the midterm?

142
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,051
Don't worry.
I will help you with the notes.

143
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:37,331
You are ranked last in your class.

144
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,569
No, I am not

145
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,409
There is one more person behind me.

146
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:44,245
Oh, that girl,

147
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,871
the volley ball player.

148
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:52,440
I want to open my cafe when I get older.

149
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:55,051
Wow, like a Barista?

150
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,426
No, not that, someone who makes coffee.

151
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,183
Good luck.

152
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,439
What do you want to be in the future?

153
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,064
Just a mother.

154
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,533
Isn't that too boring?

155
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:39,216
My mom cried a lot when I was little.

156
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,510
Why?

157
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:43,416
I don't know.

158
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,862
The atmosphere at home was a bit scary
because of my dad.

159
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,185
We once did a play at my church.

160
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,424
You know the story
Adam and Eve from the Bible?

161
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,338
Yes.

162
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:03,135
I was the snake.

163
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:08,143
So I practiced being a snake at home

164
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,752
and my mom laughed so hard.

165
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:16,712
So I acted like a snake everyday
for my mom.

166
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:21,787
Funny right?

167
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,182
My mom is so pretty when she smiles.

168
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,775
How nice.

169
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:44,899
What the...

170
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,044
Want to go outside?

171
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,056
How can you? You are injured!

172
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,176
I can ride with you.

173
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:38,477
Hey.

174
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,783
I think I know why guys
like touching girls' boobs.

175
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,104
What? You didn't go to see the nurse?

176
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:21,025
No.

177
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,596
I came to see you because I was worried.

178
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,903
You know I don't normally have cramps.

179
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,114
What did you do by yourself?

180
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,658
Nothing.

181
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,880
What are you looking at?

182
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,986
You have a pretty nice body.

183
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,080
Shut up. Don't look.

184
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:51,499
Nice.

185
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,705
Maybe my boobs are better.

186
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,327
What are you doing?

187
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,908
Mine = 75C

188
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,072
Bull shit.

189
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,711
Your fingers are prettier than mine,
so yours...

190
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:26,971
What is this?

191
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,221
My lips and my hair...

192
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,803
maybe your eyes and nose.

193
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,141
and a birthmark.

194
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,697
You are not paying attention to me again!

195
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:50,032
Are you really a B cup?

196
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,369
Hey!

197
00:18:04,145 --> 00:18:05,900
I want to have a baby who looks like you.

198
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:09,922
Wow.

199
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,650
My mom said,
if you fall in love with someone,

200
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,179
you want to have a baby that looks them.

201
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,682
It's an instinct.

202
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,179
Hmm...

203
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,122
maybe.

204
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,359
I love that you are good at math,

205
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,866
and I love your eyes.

206
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,368
I wish I was tall and athletic like you.

207
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,079
So I've been thinking.

208
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:43,436
Thinking what?

209
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:44,873
A baby.

210
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,668
Okay, look.

211
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,588
You and I both get married
with a guy in the future.

212
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,384
No! I don't want to marry a guy.

213
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,678
You have to.

214
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:03,100
And I will have a baby girl
and you will have a baby boy.

215
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,645
Yeah, right.
Just like that, like it is so easy.

216
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,921
Yes, It has to happen.

217
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,236
So this guy is my husband?

218
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,421
Focus! You are getting married now!

219
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:33,854
Think about it.

220
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,426
We go on a family trip together with kids,
eat delicious food,

221
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,136
wouldn't it be fun?

222
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,598
I'd rather spend time with you.
Just the two of us.

223
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:48,020
I would just hold your hands
and walk along the beach.

224
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,814
Listen to me.

225
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,442
You have always wanted to be a mother.

226
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,781
I want my baby to look like you.

227
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,364
Yeah. So?

228
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,866
Well, we will have our children
go to the same school

229
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,811
and spend their childhood together
all the time,

230
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,812
have them fall in love with each other.

231
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:13,253
What if they don't love each other?

232
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,225
Look at us.

233
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,884
I guarantee they will fall in love.

234
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:59,687
Imagine babies who look like us.

235
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:03,132
Can't quite imagine,

236
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,015
but it would be amazing.

237
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,685
Her eyes will sparkle like yours,

238
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,147
and she'll be good at math, just like you.

239
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,945
I hope that she'll look
more like you than me.

240
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:24,696
Yeah, we are almost here.

241
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:27,045
What?

242
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,413
Oh, didn't I tell you?

243
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,635
I am with Yoonsung.

244
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,878
I see you. Here!

245
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,025
Hello, you must be the bride,
Ms. Jungmin Lee?

246
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,180
Yes.

247
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,235
If the groom and the friend could wait
in the waiting room,

248
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,738
then I can take the bride
to the make-up room.

249
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,044
These are a couple of reminders
before the photo shoot.

250
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:21,631
Please wear an outfit that has buttons,
so it is easy to change into your dress.

251
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,017
Would you please convince the Landlord?

252
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:40,621
Because we don't want to take out a loan
for this apartment.

253
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,260
Yes, we can pay the deposit on that day.

254
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,782
The bank account is under Jungmin Lee.

255
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,553
Oh, remember I mentioned
about the wallpaper?

256
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:55,457
We want to have a different wallpaper
for the master bedroom.

257
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,543
I want to have the pattern
that I talked about before.

258
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:02,561
Jungmin really loves that pattern.

259
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,300
So please make sure we have that.

260
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:08,047
The bride is looking for you.

261
00:23:13,245 --> 00:23:14,371
I am still here.

262
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,732
Yes, I will.

263
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,570
Okay, so Jungmin and I
will stop by next week.

264
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,017
Beautiful.

265
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:47,374
Good luck.

266
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:57,758
Yoon! No running!

267
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,875
She fell and her knee
is completely scratched.

268
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,835
The teacher at daycare
didn't even give me a call.

269
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,462
It's ridiculous.

270
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,705
It is so difficult to trust
anybody these days.

271
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,603
Don't forget to put on your seatbelt!

272
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:18,853
She's so naughty just like her mom.

273
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:23,830
Isn't she lovely?

274
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,205
Yes. Just like you.

275
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:56,281
"Family Plan"
