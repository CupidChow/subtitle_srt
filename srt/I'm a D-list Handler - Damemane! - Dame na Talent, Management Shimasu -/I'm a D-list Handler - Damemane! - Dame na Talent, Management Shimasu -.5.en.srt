1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,216
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.
I've been assigned to Dept. 4.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,429
I'll change from child star Miwa Kandagawa
to Manager Michiko Sumidagawa.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,972
Because I'm interested in you.

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,306
I thought your time was over.

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,935
I'm not done as a comedian yet.

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,064
What?! Santa?

7
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:23,149
You didn't know?

8
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,609
He probably hid it
because he was embarrassed.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,613
Despite his looks, he's really proud.
But not as much as me.

10
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,616
Huh? Are you all trying to trick me?

11
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,659
-No.
-No way.

12
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:36,454
Santa Kimura?
Of our Dept. 4?

13
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,164
He's one of the talents here?

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,792
I wouldn't spread this around,
but out of Dept. 4, he is...

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,421
second-tier.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,757
Second-tier of Dept. 4?

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,593
If you think of the bottom of a pyramid,

18
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,138
there's actually a lower rung.

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,849
-He's at the very bottom.
-You're too much!

20
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,434
That's pretty harsh.

21
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,686
He's acting like a manager now.

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,147
But what gives him the right
to order us around?

23
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,317
But you know, he does have a cute face.

24
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,278
So he could be pretty popular
as a talent, right?

25
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,364
-No.
-No.

26
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:15,242
He is... an entertainer.

27
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,328
As in, a comedian.

28
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,788
He is?

29
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,081
Yeah, even though
he's not usually funny.

30
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:25,169
The fact that he is a comedian
is what's funny, right?

31
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,962
Hey, your dark side is showing.

32
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:27,922
-Foul!
-Sorry.

33
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,757
Anyway, he's part of a duo.

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,841
The name?

35
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,135
Who's gonna say it?

36
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,762
She should, she's from Osaka.

37
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,305
"Village Maus."

38
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,890
-Seriously?
-Right?

39
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,099
"Village mouse."

40
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,185
-So dumb!
-Dumb mouse.

41
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:44,021
-Hi everyone.
-Hello.

42
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,815
-Hi.
-Morning.

43
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:46,899
You guys!

44
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,862
We're gonna meet the TV station staff,
so let's bring lots of business cards.

45
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:52,822
Sure.

46
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,615
What's so funny?

47
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,158
-Nothing.
-Squeak.

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,869
-Hey!
-Good morning.

49
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,537
Can I introduce our newbie?

50
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,038
You got someone new?

51
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,290
So you're out of a job?

52
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,458
Yeah, I'll go back home
on the night bus--

53
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,835
Of course not!

54
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,545
Your comeback is so old-school.

55
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,797
-You know you like it.
-I don't hate it.

56
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,846
This vibe is painful, but at least
he's showing his comedic skills.

57
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,806
-I can hear you.
-Sorry.

58
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,724
Now say hello.

59
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,226
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.
Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,645
You must live on the banks
of the Sumida River.

61
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,938
Of course not!

62
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,648
But maybe it was true in the past.

63
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,485
-That's your comeback?
-Enough with the critique.

64
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,446
Have you finally given up on comedy?

65
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,740
Hey!

66
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,575
We need to meet people,
so get lost!

67
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,746
Mr. Ishihara loves to make jokes
while criticizing people.

68
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,247
The worst combo.

69
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,877
But he also reaches out to us a lot,
so we get more work.

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,836
I see.

71
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,549
What?

72
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,512
How am I supposed to reply to,
"You must live along the Sumida River"?

73
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,014
That was crazy.

74
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,057
Seriously.

75
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,185
"It might have been true in the past."
What was that about?

76
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,686
That was...

77
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:52,191
"Of course not," wasn't enough.

78
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,528
So I meant to say that perhaps
it was true for your ancestors.

79
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,030
Ah, I understand now.

80
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,657
That reaction hurts the most.

81
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,953
So you're a comedian, are you?

82
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,581
-You knew?
-Hold on.

83
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,959
I was trying to act natural.

84
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,045
"So you're a comedian, are you?"

85
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,797
But I said it in a weird way.

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,714
That's true.

87
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,091
No one cares.

88
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:21,387
I wasn't getting work,
so I couldn't make a living.

89
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,557
I started off as a manager part-time,
then realized this was a good fit.

90
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,519
So what does your partner do for work?

91
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,604
He has several different part-time jobs.

92
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,982
Why are you continuing like this?

93
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,236
I don't really know either.

94
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,991
But... I can't be the one
to suggest we split up.

95
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,910
But isn't that just a waste
of time for both of you?

96
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,665
I agree with that opinion
as a manager...

97
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,251
But as a comedian...

98
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,587
what's the point in using logic?

99
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,260
There was a time we did well.

100
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,263
Have you heard of us?
Village Maus.

101
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,059
-Villamau.
-No clue.

102
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,227
What's with that face?

103
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,396
-I hate when people shorten names.
-Shush.

104
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,941
We debuted in high school.

105
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,151
KINGDOM OF LAUGHS

106
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,653
In first place is Village Maus!

107
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,701
They're also high school classmates.

108
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,827
How does it feel?

109
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,455
Everyone else was older than us,

110
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,956
so it feels amazing!

111
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,878
I want to hurry home
to tell my best friend.

112
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,548
What about me?
I'm your best friend, aren't I?

113
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,675
Sorry, he was standing right here.

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,634
This guy.

115
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,261
They're so cute!

116
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,139
They already have fans.
I'm excited to see where they go.

117
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,974
I know Villamau will do well.

118
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:56,815
Then we were scouted by Toyo Production
and sold as their first ever comedy duo.

119
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,192
But we flopped.

120
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,322
After age 30, although we were known
from our younger days,

121
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,826
comedy lovers thought that
we had become pathetic.

122
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,830
Our jokes should've
gotten better over time.

123
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,043
But instead we were being
completely ignored.

124
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,004
It sucks.

125
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,096
That was somber.

126
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,348
-Do something funny.
-Why?

127
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,519
Hurry and eat.
We're going to Akasaka.

128
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,436
Okay.

129
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,441
For your next mission...

130
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,442
What now?

131
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,985
Dept. 4's comedy duo--

132
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,028
Villamau!

133
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,197
Yes, Village Maus.

134
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,742
They haven't been very active lately.

135
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,452
I want you to--

136
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,662
No way.

137
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,372
Santa's mostly a manager anyway.

138
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,289
Please.

139
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,458
I need you to break them up.

140
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,127
I said, no way.

141
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,297
They're already so inactive,
it's like they're on break...

142
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,758
Did you say, "break them up"?

143
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,718
-Yes.
-But it'll happen naturally.

144
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:07,928
They're second-tier.

145
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,179
Nice way to put it.

146
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,597
Oh, I heard that from--

147
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:14,977
Anyway, you need to break up
Village Maus this month.

148
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,353
That's your mission.

149
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,272
How could I?

150
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,774
I don't like to bully weaklings.

151
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,276
Don't think you can do it?

152
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,444
It seems I overestimated you.

153
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,196
Shut up, it's pointless to taunt me.

154
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,906
If you can't do this...

155
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,908
I'll just have to fire you.

156
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,579
Ready, and...

157
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,330
action.

158
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,626
Trash River!

159
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:46,383
Why do I have to become
some kind of grim reaper...

160
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,052
when I'm this cute?

161
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,433
-Good work.
-Good work.

162
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,518
Excuse me.

163
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,812
Excuse...

164
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,939
I'm trying to--

165
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,322
"V" ACT

166
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,073
"Circle 'V' Act"?

167
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,868
A Village Maus performance?

168
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,287
Yokoi behind you,
doing a search online.

169
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,123
There's a comedy show
at a club in Shimokitazawa.

170
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,667
"Bring Your Smiles."
It must be this.

171
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,795
There's some interesting guests,
like Buckingham House!

172
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,464
"Buckingham House"?

173
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,216
Mr. I'm Not Fooling Around, too!

174
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,301
"I'm not fooling around!"
That guy!

175
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,552
Shall we go together?

176
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,262
I'll go. Villamau should be there.

177
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,931
Right? I'll go with you.

178
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,099
Yokoi wants to go too!

179
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,445
"Villamau!"

180
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,073
I'm so nervous!

181
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,909
VILLAGE MAUS
MACHO BOY

182
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,001
Kanon!

183
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,463
Hello!

184
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,091
We're Kanon. Great to be here.

185
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,842
A patisserie! Let's go!

186
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,262
Whoa! What's happening?

187
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,471
What's he doing?

188
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,098
I messed up!

189
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,434
-A Twinkie!
-You could get this anywhere!

190
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,562
The culprit is definitely here.

191
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,647
The culprit...

192
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,607
Shing!

193
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,110
There's blank spaces.

194
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,988
Why are there so many?
They could've filled those in.

195
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,698
Hawaiian tour!

196
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,491
Hawaiian tour!

197
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,909
-We're here!
-Really?!

198
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,077
Isn't this Akabane?

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,161
There's no way.

200
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,663
Room tour.

201
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,581
"Room tour?!"

202
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,293
Did we come to see apartments?

203
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,877
Village Maus!

204
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,385
Working overtime is so hard.

205
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,886
Time to go home.

206
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,930
It hurts...

207
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,890
Huh?! Did you hear something?

208
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,434
Painful...

209
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,436
I heard "painful..."

210
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,023
I've heard someone died
in this locker room.

211
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,900
Maybe his ghost is really here!

212
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,696
It hurts...

213
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,574
It's so painful...
to work overtime, right?

214
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,492
Oh, the delivery guy.

215
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,911
-You were sympathizing with me?
-Yeah.

216
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,371
I thought you were a ghost.

217
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,289
I am a ghost.

218
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,707
You're a ghost, too?!

219
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,459
I used to be a serial killer.

220
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,005
He's like the serial killer
from The Silence of the Lambs!

221
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,592
Lecter, right?
He was... based on me.

222
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,635
Sorry, I'm glad you're dead.

223
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,222
If you're afraid that I'm a killer,
just be glad that I'm a ghost.

224
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,475
Then when you're scared
that I'm a ghost,

225
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,144
just think it's better than
a live serial killer.

226
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,146
Think of it like steering a bike.

227
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,106
You'll start to see a no-fear point.

228
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,900
-Okay...
-Try it out.

229
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:57,908
Huh?

230
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,745
You were great.
I had so much fun!

231
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,330
-Thanks.
-I'll see you again.

232
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,374
That'd be great, thank you.

233
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,001
You were so funny!

234
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,087
Thank... oh, it's you.

235
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,546
Sorry I wasn't a fan.

236
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,298
Why didn't you tell me?

237
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,344
Why don't we go for a drink?
We can invite your partner, Mizoguchi.

238
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,223
It's fine, he probably wouldn't want to.

239
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,474
Really?

240
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,434
Then I'll just say hello.

241
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,896
-Great job!
-Thanks.

242
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,648
She's a new manager.

243
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,109
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.
Nice to meet you.

244
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,238
We bumped into each other
at the office.

245
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,241
Oh.

246
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,411
I went to pick up some props after work.

247
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,665
Would you like to go out
for a drink with us?

248
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,708
Sorry, I'm a bit tired.

249
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,127
I'm going home.

250
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,711
Right, excuse me.

251
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,381
-Okay, see you.
-See ya.

252
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,007
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

253
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,011
See?

254
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,848
TODAY'S SPECIALS

255
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,184
We've been doing this
for over 15 years.

256
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,145
Amazing.

257
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,105
Like a fully-qualified craftsman.

258
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,650
It's normal for comedians
to be broke after 15 years.

259
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,694
-I didn't say anything.
-Sorry.

260
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,156
Do you have a bad relationship
with Mizoguchi?

261
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,492
It's not great.

262
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,119
But not bad?

263
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,329
Maybe it is.

264
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,290
Well, not that bad.

265
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,584
It's normal, for a comedy duo.

266
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,878
I don't really get it.

267
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,629
You wouldn't.

268
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,591
It's a mysterious thing.

269
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,551
For example...

270
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,098
there are lots of senior comedians
I'd love to be recognized by.

271
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,853
But I'm happiest when my partner
laughs at my jokes.

272
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,730
Aw, that's nice.

273
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,066
I made it sound too good.

274
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,074
Have you ever thought of...
breaking up?

275
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,997
Mizoguchi seems unmotivated lately.

276
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,791
I get nervous when he calls.

277
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,379
I think that maybe he'll bring it up.

278
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,466
We were classmates in high school.

279
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,595
We had the same dream
and became partners.

280
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,181
It's like, as long as we're partners,

281
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,059
we can keep living out our youth.

282
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,480
But I know that the agency...

283
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,899
just thinks of us as deadweights.

284
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,944
I wonder about that.

285
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,367
The fact that Village Maus
is still going means...

286
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,621
At least... he and I...

287
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,750
still have hope in ourselves.

288
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,922
So we gotta try harder.

289
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,968
So, what is "Village Maus" anyway?

290
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,219
Village mice?

291
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,929
No!

292
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:06,846
Oh.

293
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,642
It's really embarrassing...

294
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,522
The "Mura" in Kimura
means "village" in English.

295
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,983
And Mizoguchi's "Guchi"
means "mouth."

296
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,859
So "Village Maus."

297
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,821
-Isn't that dumb?
-It's cool!

298
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,448
So, Kimura of Village Maus?

299
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,076
Right, and you're
Village Maus's Mizoguchi.

300
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,746
Hello.

301
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,999
-We are Village Maus's Mizoguchi--
-and Kimura.

302
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,584
Thanks for having us.

303
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,544
-See?
-It feels good.

304
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,545
It's awesome!

305
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,423
Duo names are like that.

306
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,012
It's too cute.

307
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:53,852
What's wrong?

308
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,687
Somehow...

309
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,232
Those two high schoolers who
came up with a dumb name,

310
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,192
are still using it now.

311
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,653
They're getting a bit old now but say,

312
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,448
"We'll always be young comedians!"

313
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,491
It's so emotional...

314
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,327
I could cry.

315
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,371
Can you pick one emotion?

316
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,915
Are you praising, mocking,
or actually moved?

317
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,916
Everything.

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,628
Everything just hit me in the feels.

319
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,385
Why do we need to break them up?

320
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,721
I'm not a monster.

321
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,105
Hello?

322
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,233
Are you calling to confirm
they've broken up?

323
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,402
You're too impatient.
Not yet.

324
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,238
I hate this mission.

325
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,699
That's why it's a mission, isn't it?

326
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,452
Don't try to use logic on a drunk.

327
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,288
Don't drunk dial me.

328
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:00,960
"Villamau"?

329
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,462
Heard of them?

330
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,964
I thought you liked young comedians.

331
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:05,924
How old are they?

332
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,427
Their age? I think around 35?

333
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,553
That's old!

334
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,514
Biologically.

335
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,559
But it's normal for comedians
to not make a living after 15 years.

336
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,686
They're still young.

337
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,479
They'll be old from here on.

338
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,438
Scary.

339
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,315
-It's not.
-Yes it is.

340
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,235
It's not scary at all!
These are old guys with a future.

341
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,486
Don't say that.

342
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,956
Santa, this is your chance!

343
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,165
No way!

344
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,584
Go for it, your last chance!

345
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,169
Why is it my "last"?

346
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,379
I was being serious.

347
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,505
Seriously?!

348
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,674
How incredibly impudent!

349
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,176
What is it?

350
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,553
What are you all doing?

351
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,013
The contest that Village Maus
won in high school,

352
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,517
Kingdom of Laughs is back!

353
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,768
For just one night.

354
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,188
If they win this, they might get invited
onto Ariyoshi's Wall.

355
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,440
I guess so.

356
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,234
Santa will be able to fly over it easily.

357
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,028
Yeah, I'll soar over that thing!

358
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,864
They might even get onto Shoten.

359
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,615
I can totally see it.

360
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,660
History will be split into
Before Kimura and After Kimura.

361
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:16,995
You think so?

362
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,789
"Villamau" will be one of
this year's trending words.

363
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,625
I don't think they've ever had
duo names on that list.

364
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,586
How about Kohaku's Kendama Challenge?

365
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,964
You're getting ahead of yourselves.

366
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,800
But you know,

367
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,220
maybe I should start practicing?

368
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,767
It feels a bit wrong when you say it.

369
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,394
Yeah, it's fine for us to get you pumped,

370
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,147
but if you get carried away,
it's not fun anymore.

371
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,648
You should know your place.

372
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,568
You're too fast with carrots and sticks.
I can't keep up.

373
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,236
That was a good one!

374
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,404
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

375
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,115
Not "whoo." Stop with the weird teasing.

376
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,618
"Teasing" is such a comedian word.

377
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,536
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

378
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,247
Dept. 4 vibes are really off today!

379
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,042
Anyway, everyone in Dept. 4
is getting pumped today!

380
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,668
Villamau!

381
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,463
-Villamau!
-Squeak!

382
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,215
-Villamau!
-Squeak!

383
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,342
Village mice!

384
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,302
No, it's not for "mouse."

385
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,596
You'll do it, right?
Kingdom of Laughs.

386
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,723
This is your chance to make it big.

387
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,392
Depends on Mizoguchi.

388
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,853
It'd be great if he agrees.

389
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,939
You should call him.

390
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,607
Yeah.

391
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,194
The gears that had stopped
for Villamau...

392
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,487
Okay.

393
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,197
Let's try it.

394
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,908
had once again begun to turn.

395
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,537
I know this is selfish of me, but..

396
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,247
please give me time off.

397
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,628
I'll take on his work for him.

398
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:49,879
Please.

399
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,006
Please.

400
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,056
Understood.

401
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,017
You may have two weeks off.

402
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,477
Thank you.

403
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,688
I'll be sure to win.

404
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,565
-I have faith in you.
-I'll do well.

405
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,067
Excuse me.

406
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,075
Of course, we're getting close...

407
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,494
to their breakup, right?

408
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,298
They wrote down ideas in restaurants

409
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,342
and practiced in the park.

410
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,679
They ran through material
before and after shows

411
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,764
and reflected again and again.

412
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,808
-Should we change it?
-Let's do it.

413
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,020
Yeah, should we say that
at the beginning?

414
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:00,325
I did my part to pick up Santa's work.

415
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,872
Hi, I've brought you the pair who'd
be great for the married couple role.

416
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,583
-Think of Alain Delon...
-What are you mumbling about?

417
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,294
-See? They're like comedians.
-You're being gross.

418
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,630
And... action!

419
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,006
Freeze!

420
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,927
Don't get strangers involved
in your pathetic life!

421
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,386
Okay!

422
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,263
Could I have a word?

423
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,223
I'd like to introduce
one of our talents.

424
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,726
"If you're gonna use it...
now's the time!"

425
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,062
Hey! You stole that line, didn't you?

426
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,828
When we first got to Tokyo,
we practiced here a lot, huh?

427
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,791
We smoked back then too.

428
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,796
We should've made it big by now.

429
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:55,713
Right?

430
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,801
D-list comedians practicing
in a park at night.

431
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,010
It's so cliche!

432
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,722
We're like the guys who show up
in those karaoke videos.

433
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,771
I don't like coming here at night...

434
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,399
But just like this...

435
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,777
we need to take comedy seriously.

436
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,657
"Look who's talking"?

437
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,326
Kinda.

438
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,336
Mizoguchi.

439
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:39,590
I...

440
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,638
I think this is our last chance.

441
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,936
If this doesn't work, I...

442
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,775
I'll work as a manager at Toyo.

443
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:07,785
I see.

444
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,622
Yeah... I need to
draw the line somewhere.

445
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,381
What I mean is...

446
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,885
What I wanna say is,
let's definitely pass the audition!

447
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,638
Obviously!

448
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,016
Misters Villamau, great work.

449
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,726
-Thanks.
-You came?

450
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,144
These are for you.

451
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,772
-Wow, thanks!
-Thank you very much.

452
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,981
Don't be so formal.

453
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:38,816
Thanks, Michiko.

454
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,276
That was fast.

455
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,736
How's it going?

456
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,655
Well, the skit is coming along fine.

457
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,658
But it'll be a public audition
with an audience.

458
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,161
Only eight pairs will get to the finals.

459
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,039
So only eight pairs will be on TV?

460
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,500
There are about 200 pairs in the running,

461
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,461
and they're all pros,
so it'll be tough.

462
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,924
Well, that just means
it'll be huge if we pass.

463
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,217
-Right!
-Yeah.

464
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,176
That's the spirit!

465
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,929
What you said got me thinking.

466
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,307
If this doesn't work,
I'll focus on being a manager.

467
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,603
We'll do our best to not break up.

468
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,691
But... is that something
that you both decided?

469
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:23,778
We will pass.

470
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,865
-I see.
-Oh.

471
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,408
Can you take a video?

472
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,285
Oh, yeah. Could you?

473
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,245
Of course!

474
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,457
I heard someone died in this locker room.

475
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,210
Maybe his ghost is really here!

476
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,255
It hurts. It's painful...

477
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:46,259
Villamau's skit was
even funnier than before.

478
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,554
If they could improve
this much in a week,

479
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,640
you'd think they would
get serious sooner.

480
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,397
It hurts... It's so painful
to work overtime, isn't it?

481
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,232
Don't back away here.

482
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,901
Stand tall and stare at me.

483
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,821
-Oh.
-I'll be coming at you too.

484
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,905
-So freeze?
-Yeah.

485
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,365
-Let's keep it close.
-Okay.

486
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,534
You were just sympathizing with me?

487
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,119
This part's too slow.

488
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,621
Give a little more punch.

489
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,624
The pause from waiting here is scary.

490
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,918
I get it, so that's why...

491
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,670
So you're a ghost, too?!

492
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,715
It's good that I'm dead...

493
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,049
Hey! You scared me.

494
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,176
What?

495
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,596
I'm a star, so I appear like a comet.

496
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,973
You're cringey today as usual.

497
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,433
You're welcome.

498
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,685
You're here, so why don't we chat?

499
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,604
Were you worrying again?

500
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:44,650
Okay.

501
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,194
Now I'll say...

502
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,739
"It's okay. It will work out somehow."

503
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,409
Record that and listen to it on repeat.

504
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,204
That's my prescription...
just for you.

505
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,290
The cringe overflows
like from a fountain. You okay?

506
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,292
"Let it flow! My charm!"

507
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,544
So spoke Sanada.

508
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,379
I said let's chat.

509
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,800
Is that Villamau's skit?

510
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:10,968
You know them?

511
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:15,056
When I first joined this agency,
I used to study their shows.

512
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,559
They're active again recently.

513
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,520
But they might break up.

514
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,066
I don't want them to.

515
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:32,865
Right.

516
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,494
It's sad when someone quits.

517
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,749
I was lonely for a long time too.

518
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,339
Don't disappear on me.

519
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,971
Are those more cringey
words of encouragement from a star?

520
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:55,888
No.

521
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,599
I'm talking to you.

522
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,688
Miss Sumidagawa-- no.

523
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,277
Miwa Kandagawa.

524
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,034
I've been searching for you.

525
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,296
Yuji.

526
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,048
-What're you doing?
-Sorry.

527
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:33,509
I was just watching Villamau.

528
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,720
Oh, the deadweight duo.

529
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,055
-They haven't broken up yet?
-No!

530
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,433
They're still together,
and they'll get more--

531
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,184
Let's go, Yuji.
Everyone's waiting.

532
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,062
Their barbecue's delish.

533
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,315
-Can't wait.
-I'll call a cab.

534
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,232
Okay.

535
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,253
You made it!

536
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,755
What's going on?

537
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,507
We brought our costumes as you said.

538
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,593
Come on in.

539
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,972
Hey! What're you all doing?

540
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,101
Well, it's time for you
to show us your stuff.

541
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,102
-Whoot!
-Huh?

542
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,772
Michiko told us.

543
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,941
I watched your videos and became a fan.

544
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm glad, but...

545
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,112
I wanna brag to my friends,
so please nab first place.

546
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,615
With Villamau's skits,

547
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,034
the better the acting,
the funnier you'd be.

548
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,160
I always thought so.

549
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,745
-Really?
-Yeah.

550
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,831
I'll be watching the TV
as an Osaka Auntie.

551
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,792
If I laugh, you're safe!

552
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,293
The pressure!

553
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,628
After all,

554
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,672
comedy is one of the hardest
genres of expression.

555
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:56,133
Shut up.
We're more or less pros!

556
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,134
"More or less."

557
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,845
Just take in the useful opinions.

558
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,430
Leave it to your sense.

559
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,225
Shall we go with your sense?

560
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,351
Villamau!

561
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,269
Villamau!

562
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,152
Working overtime is so hard.

563
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,821
Time to go home.

564
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,115
It hurts...

565
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,200
Huh? Did you hear something?

566
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,868
It's so painful...

567
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,495
Huh? "Painful"?

568
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,374
I heard that someone died
in this locker room.

569
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,793
Maybe his ghost really exists!

570
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,507
It hurts. It's painful, isn't it?
Working overtime.

571
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,969
Compared to the first show,
they were clearly shining.

572
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,557
If a duo was a living creature,
you could tell this one was healthy.

573
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,018
Was it from practice?
Or because they got along again?

574
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,690
No, I'm sure it's because
they each thought the other was funny.

575
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,901
They could see each other properly,

576
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,987
creating a genuine moment.

577
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,321
I'm not scared at all!

578
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,783
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

579
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,830
Honestly, I was trying not to laugh,
but you were hilarious.

580
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,290
Why would you do that?

581
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,042
I tried pinching myself to hold back,
but I laughed too.

582
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:13,377
You too? Do that at home.

583
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,838
To think I'd be laughing at you.

584
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,090
Let's make it big, together.
Counting on you.

585
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,092
-Help me out.
-You're fast.

586
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,511
I'm glad I was your first fan.

587
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,929
Is that how you felt?

588
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,932
If his star senses are tingling,

589
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,559
you might really make it big!

590
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,561
-So we should be happy?
-That's right.

591
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,774
-Villamau!
-Yeah!

592
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,234
-Villamau!
-Villamau!

593
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,486
Villamau!

594
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,780
I'm going to ask.
How's your mission going?

595
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,575
Th-there's still more time.

596
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,785
You'll break them up this month.

597
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,997
With two weeks left,
I thought I'd remind you.

598
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,627
Do you need... lines?

599
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,838
No. Shoo!

600
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:00,799
This is my office.

601
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,269
I don't know much about comedy,

602
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,105
but I can tell that you're feeling good.

603
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,567
Just like last time, make it happen!
The big laughs!

604
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:20,736
What was that?

605
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,571
You're funny.

606
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,406
Hey, hey! Kimura!

607
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,575
-Hey!
-Hi.

608
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:33,290
I have nothing to do with this show,
but good luck!

609
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,583
Thank you.

610
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,919
Do you remember me?

611
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,629
Ah, Shimanto River!

612
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,964
Who's Shimanto River?

613
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,635
With a name like Michiko Shimanto River,
I'd have to be an enka singer!

614
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,470
It's Sumidagawa.

615
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,013
Oh, yeah.

616
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,182
Sorry, Miss Ganges River!

617
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,435
-Tamagawa River?
-See you later!

618
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,230
-Focus.
-Thanks.

619
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,439
We gotta do this.

620
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,194
KINGDOM OF LAUGHS
RECORDING SCHEDULE

621
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,662
Our next duo is from Toyo Production.

622
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,205
Village Maus!

623
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,796
Working overtime is so hard.

624
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:22,798
Time to go home.

625
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,259
It hurts...

626
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,094
Did you hear something?

627
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,804
"It's painful..."

628
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,807
Maybe his ghost is really here!

629
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:34,977
It hurts....

630
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,980
It's painful, isn't it?
Working overtime.

631
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,858
You were just sympathizing with me?

632
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:41,817
Yeah.

633
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,819
I thought you were a ghost!

634
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:44,737
I am a ghost.

635
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,280
You're a ghost, too?!

636
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,199
But it's good that I'm dead.

637
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,452
Why would you say that?

638
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,287
I used to be a serial killer.

639
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,750
He's like the killer
from Silence of the Lambs!

640
00:31:59,043 --> 00:31:59,960
Lecter, right?

641
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,962
He was based off of me.

642
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,716
I am glad you're dead.
It'd be too scary if you were alive!

643
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,384
I ate them starting with the head.

644
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,510
I'm scared!

645
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,679
Thank goodness he's a ghost!

646
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,514
But I'm scared of ghosts too!

647
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,891
It's okay.

648
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,392
Look at me carefully.

649
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:19,855
If you're afraid that I'm a killer,
just be glad that I'm a ghost.

650
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,733
Then when you're scared
that I'm a ghost,

651
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,110
just think it's better than
a live serial killer.

652
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:28,572
Turn the handles of fear
like the handles on a bike.

653
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,200
If you can control them well,

654
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,328
you can go straight
toward the point of no fear.

655
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,871
Now you try it.

656
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,789
Okay...

657
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,798
What was that?

658
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,886
I don't get it!

659
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,183
What?!

660
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,066
Wow! I'm not scared at all!

661
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,526
Very good!

662
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,486
You're not scary at all!

663
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,072
If you count on two hands,
you'd have fingers left.

664
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,158
Count what?!

665
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,493
It's better not to know.

666
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,453
I don't want to know!

667
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:20,582
Hey, I heard that a ghost
often comes out here.

668
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,834
Is that you?

669
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,420
Oh... that guy.

670
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,714
I helped him get to heaven.

671
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:31,260
I did a lot of bad things
when I was alive.

672
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:35,013
So now I go around finding ghosts
and helping them get to heaven.

673
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,226
I'm enjoying my second life.

674
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,436
See ya.

675
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,859
I wish he'd repent.

676
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,447
There's still a chance you'll fail?

677
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,241
There were plenty of other funny acts.

678
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,035
It depends on if the judges liked us.

679
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,121
-But we got a great response.
-Yeah.

680
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,123
I'm sure you'll be okay.

681
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:03,834
Michiko.

682
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,004
You really helped us out.

683
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,756
Thanks.

684
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,008
-Thanks.
-It's okay.

685
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:17,222
I just hope we pass,
so you can be proud.

686
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,724
Seriously.

687
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,226
I know you'll pass.

688
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,811
I know you'll pass.

689
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,397
I know you'll pass!

690
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,623
FINALISTS

691
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,585
It's over.
Our name isn't there.

692
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,424
We failed?

693
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,176
This sucks.

694
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,517
Sorry. I'm really sorry, Michiko.

695
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,976
Sorry.

696
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,020
Even though you supported us.

697
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,231
Why are you apologizing?

698
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,191
You did your best.

699
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,155
In this field, it's not enough
to do your best.

700
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,119
Mizoguchi.

701
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,375
Thanks for everything.

702
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,339
Thanks.

703
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,383
Don't.

704
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,009
It's already decided.

705
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:41,557
Mizoguchi.

706
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,227
Let's go see Mr. Saigawa.

707
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,744
Mission accomplished.

708
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:03,704
Congratulations.

709
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,957
They really loved Villamau.

710
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,543
I see.

711
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,714
But Kimura is very talented as a manager.

712
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,759
Guiding him will be worthwhile.

713
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,263
Do you even have a heart?

714
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,980
Hold off on
"mission accomplished."

715
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,649
Lines?

716
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,734
I don't need any!

717
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,705
He's here, living out his youth.

718
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,710
Hold onto that youth!

719
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,966
Please don't break up Villamau.

720
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,385
It's already decided.

721
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,514
You just decided on your own,
didn't you?

722
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,224
What about Mizoguchi?

723
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,644
Villamau doesn't only belong to you.

724
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,145
I know.

725
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,105
You were having so much fun.

726
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,274
How could you quit?

727
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,569
-It's over.
-No, it's not.

728
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,405
"Sorry, I was trying to act cool."

729
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,741
"I don't have the guts to quit comedy."

730
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,370
"I want to keep doing comedy with you."
Say that and apologize.

731
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,416
Mizoguchi said it.

732
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,296
After we said goodbye to you yesterday.

733
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,132
Can I take back what I said before?

734
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,053
Regardless of whether we pass or not,

735
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,514
I want to keep going.

736
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll quit being a manager...
and focus on comedy.

737
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,026
I just realized...

738
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,904
how much I love it.

739
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:03,907
So...

740
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,121
I'll dedicate my life
to Village Maus again.

741
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,460
I want...

742
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,422
to draw the line here.

743
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,595
This time,

744
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,432
if we don't make it...

745
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:33,812
Sorry... let's end it.

746
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,316
But why?

747
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:40,944
Stop joking around.

748
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,196
No!

749
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,742
We can still do it!

750
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,161
We're more than this.

751
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:51,955
Okay, fine.

752
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,166
Let's give it one more year.

753
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,838
Please.

754
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,132
Come on, Mizoguchi.

755
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,803
We're friends, right?

756
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,932
We're partners, right?

757
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:20,817
I'm sorry.

758
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,489
No way.

759
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,201
Don't say that.

760
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,413
This was so much fun, right?

761
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,750
Mizoguchi!

762
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,043
It was fun.

763
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,549
And that's why I want to stop here.

764
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,388
I loved comedy,
so I entered the industry.

765
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,559
And became partners with my friend.

766
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,106
But things didn't go well.

767
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,567
Over time...

768
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,446
I couldn't even tell
whether I liked comedy anymore.

769
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,368
And we...

770
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,913
didn't get along anymore.

771
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:20,210
It was so hard.

772
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:25,924
But now...

773
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,639
I think I can quit now
on a high note, so...

774
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:37,894
If we don't make it,

775
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,523
let's be friends again.

776
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,993
That's the kind of talk
that makes you lose, idiot!

777
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,202
-Huh?
-Idiot!

778
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,997
Santa, you're a great person.

779
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,874
But you're too cruel to your partner.

780
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,751
Why did you become a manager, anyway?

781
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,420
You know, to survive.

782
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:06,173
I'm sure you've done
other selfish things too.

783
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,842
Those bad deeds accumulated
and led to this.

784
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,011
I feel so bad for Mizoguchi.

785
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:14,681
Don't be so hard on him!

786
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:15,932
Mizoguchi?

787
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,895
Thought I'd see out
the end of my youth.

788
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,771
Seriously?

789
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,650
Mizoguchi, I want to ask you too.

790
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,737
Please pair up with him again.

791
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:33,366
Sometimes it's fine to get frustrated
and have a punch-off, right?

792
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,286
That is...

793
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,080
our problem.

794
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,916
Don't butt in.

795
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,213
Ah, sorry.

796
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,383
Despite his looks, he's really stubborn.
No changing his mind.

797
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:55,013
Well, I think that this was
a happy end fitting for us.

798
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:58,808
So what will you do next?

799
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,144
Comics?

800
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,979
-Are you being serious?
-Yes.

801
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,564
You're a dreamer, huh?

802
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:08,526
It's fine.

803
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,403
My partner is brilliant.

804
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,949
Oh... "former partner."

805
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,160
Oof. That felt sad.

806
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,500
Mizoguchi.

807
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,752
Please entrust that skit to me.

808
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,964
He and I will use it
at drinking parties.

809
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:29,965
Seriously?

810
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,051
That's my way of making amends.

811
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,427
With whom?!

812
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:35,929
Villamau.

813
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,139
The sad comedy duo...

814
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,308
that I couldn't save.

815
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,481
Hey... you better do it properly.

816
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,276
-You're okay with this?
-If she's gonna do it,

817
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,194
I should rewrite it for her.

818
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:52,404
Wait, what?

819
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:55,907
-You don't have get serious.
-You'll do it, right?

820
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,409
I'm going to the bathroom.

821
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,160
Make it hilarious, okay?

822
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,078
I already have.

823
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:22,767
Miss Miwa.

824
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,112
Don't forget about them.

825
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:38,825
Don't cry.

826
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:41,995
Take a good look...

827
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,414
at them now.

828
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,600
As a manager, the break up
of Villamau felt like a failure.

829
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:08,271
But the fact that I could watch
as they became friends again...

830
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,399
was definitely a happy thing.

831
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,696
VILLAMAU DISBANDS:
THE PAIR RETIRES FROM COMEDY

832
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,283
You okay?

833
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:26,956
Pathetic.

834
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,459
I couldn't do anything for them.

835
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,757
Santa told me.

836
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,344
At the start of his new life,

837
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,639
he was able to laugh until his sides hurt
thanks to you.

838
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:49,479
The two of them probably had it.

839
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,981
The right time to open up.

840
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,568
But they missed it.

841
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,407
While they kept thinking "someday,"

842
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:04,411
time changed their circumstances,
and they never got it back.

843
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,332
Villamau, right?

844
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,001
You need to say how you feel.

845
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,548
Or else you'll regret it.

846
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:18,842
Right.

847
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,474
I don't want any more regrets.

848
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,273
I...

849
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:39,988
like you.

850
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:44,826
I always have...

851
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:47,328
and always will.

852
