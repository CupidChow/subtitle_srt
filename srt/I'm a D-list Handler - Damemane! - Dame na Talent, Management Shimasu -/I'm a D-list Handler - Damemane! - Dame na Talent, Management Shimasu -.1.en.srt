1
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,233
Look! A rabbit!

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:43,878
You're kidding.

3
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:45,921
You're gonna die now?

4
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,216
Read the room!

5
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,639
This is the worst.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,433
The worst of the worst.

7
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,174
TOYO PRODUCTION

8
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,596
Okay.

9
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,774
I’m Michiko Sumidagawa. From today,
I've been assigned to Department 4.

10
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,568
Uh, no!

11
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,028
I'm still new to things,

12
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,533
but I hope I can be a valuable asset
to Toyo Production as a manager.

13
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,659
You can't.

14
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,661
I'll be joining Department 4--

15
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,079
Right? "Four," right?

16
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,039
This is Department 1.

17
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:03,457
ENTERTAINMENT DEPT. 1

18
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,375
Excuse us.

19
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,460
Come on, this way.

20
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,635
Excellent!

21
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,889
You look great, Mr. Rabbit.

22
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,360
Hi.

23
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,323
Thank you for earlier.

24
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,492
-No problem.
-It's great.

25
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,202
Let's go with this
for the event.

26
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,204
With a surprise appearance.

27
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,540
Oh, these are for everyone.

28
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,208
Thank you!

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,794
Everyone, we've received some treats.

30
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,754
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

31
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,134
This way.

32
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,307
Here.

33
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,771
Welcome to "Dept. 4."

34
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,357
-Hi.
-Good afternoon!

35
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,567
DEPT. 4
TOYO

36
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:15,571
Are you okay?!

37
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,532
I've snatched up some of
the matcha financiers!

38
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,409
Oh, Masae.

39
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,162
Wherefore art thou, Masae?

40
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,830
Quit nagging. Just eat!

41
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,791
And you expect me to eat stolen goods?

42
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,377
-You're eating them!
-Of course.

43
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,587
They're financiers.

44
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,424
If my deductions are correct,
the provider of the pastries is...

45
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,052
Yuji Sanada.

46
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,679
And if my deductions are correct,
the provider is...

47
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,681
Yuji Sanada.

48
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,977
He keeps posting about them on
social media, so there's no doubt.

49
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,812
That's all. Excuse me.

50
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,606
-Hey!
-What?

51
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,066
-That's too many!
-Really?

52
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,567
What's that?

53
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,486
He's here? Yuji.

54
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,571
Sure is. Everyone's so excited.

55
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,116
If you could all pause for a moment,
let me introduce her.

56
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,327
But before that, excuse me.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,913
Miss Whoever... you're stepping on it.

58
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,666
My precious belonging,
with your dirty shoes!

59
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,501
-I thought it was trash.
-It's not.

60
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,877
This isn't Trash Island.

61
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,588
Smells like a weird old man.

62
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,881
Now why'd you smell it?

63
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,467
He's the Smelly Man who Sleeps Here.

64
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,178
You know, I'm in charge of the DIY.

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,555
I'm turning this into
a more fashionable space.

66
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,767
More like renovating it into
a cheap love hotel against our will.

67
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,603
More like an illegal cheap hotel--
hey!

68
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,105
Please listen.

69
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:34,191
And the feng shui's
all figured out too.

70
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,401
Listen up!

71
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,444
-Sorry.
-That's nonsense!

72
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,446
Nobody cares about your DIY now!

73
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,447
Sorry.

74
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,615
Go on.

75
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,452
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.

76
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,787
Nice to meet you.

77
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,372
Welcome!

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,625
Is Mr. Sanada in Dept. 4?

79
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,545
He's in Dept. 1.

80
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,296
He's their star.

81
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,798
The star of Toyo.

82
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,633
Can I take this off now?

83
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,469
Shouldn't we be doing 4's work?

84
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,556
We can't, even if we want to.

85
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,766
-Why not?
-Why not, you ask?

86
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,851
We're not popular!

87
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,645
Michiko, these people aren’t staff.

88
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,815
They're the talents of Dept 4.

89
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,236
Can't wait to hear my sales pitch.

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,322
No, if we're going in age order,
this person should go first.

91
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,532
Ah, but everyone...

92
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,825
Yes, please!

93
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,202
Please consider my health and lifespan!

94
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,505
Hey!

95
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,340
Calm down!

96
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,676
Sorry.

97
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,513
It's okay. I'll do my best.

98
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,308
I’ll do everything in my power

99
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,685
to turn you all into sparkling stars!

100
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:52,895
Really?

101
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,688
Thank you!

102
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,815
Thank you so much!

103
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,860
-Good afternoon!
-Good afternoon.

104
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,531
Don't be mistaken.

105
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,077
Your job isn’t to produce stars.

106
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,580
It's to make Dept. 4 profitable.

107
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,881
That was a great act you put on there.

108
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:09,263
The pure and innocent new employee,
somewhat popular in work dramas.

109
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,306
It wasn’t an act.

110
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,809
Anyone can put on
a different face, y'know.

111
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,561
Why are you speaking casually?

112
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,438
-Is that bad?
-Am I your subordinate?

113
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,152
Oh, you've always had
that roundabout way of speaking.

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,154
Did you leave your manners at home?

115
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,866
That's it! Just like that!

116
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,787
I see.

117
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,038
Then you’re fired.

118
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,748
-Huh?!
-Good work.

119
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,958
Maybe next time.

120
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,960
Wait a minute!

121
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,463
"Wait a minute!"
Is that what you call polite?

122
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,925
You're still in a trial period.

123
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:52,097
If I decide you're not cut out for this,
I will not hire you.

124
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,807
And of course...

125
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,977
I'll immediately have you return

126
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,146
the borrowed five million yen.

127
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,154
Now, about the job.

128
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,492
An entertainer from our department
will star in a smartphone commercial.

129
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,494
I want you...

130
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,789
to make this job a success.

131
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,044
If you do that, I'll hire you
as a full-time employee.

132
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,172
Hire? Just from that?

133
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,131
But...

134
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,634
Read this.

135
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,804
"I've been a fan of your acting--"

136
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:33,889
Put feeling into it.

137
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,642
These are lines.

138
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,068
"I've been a fan of your acting
for a long time."

139
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,364
"I used to replay your scenes even if
you were on TV for a second."

140
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,201
"To think that I can see you
in this commercial"

141
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,536
"makes me want to jump for joy!"

142
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,959
Amazing.

143
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,293
As expected of a child star.

144
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,297
Sorry, a "former" child star.

145
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:08,882
And?

146
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,885
When I give the signal, say these lines.

147
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,054
-What?
-Also,

148
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,849
no one should ever learn
that I wrote these lines.

149
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,354
They were words spoken
by Michiko Sumidagawa, age 29.

150
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,731
You're kidding. What's the deal, here?

151
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,400
-That is all.
-That's all?

152
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,986
Hey, hold on--!

153
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,780
Also, this part is obvious, but..

154
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,073
There's more?

155
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,909
If your past ever gets out to the others,

156
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,745
our talk of you being hired
will be scrapped.

157
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,956
I get it, already.

158
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,419
I understand.

159
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,587
Now, go earn some money.

160
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,678
MICHIKO SUMIDAGAWA

161
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,721
Well then,

162
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,556
Miss Miwa Kandagawa.

163
00:09:59,099 --> 00:09:59,850
Rolling!

164
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,477
And...

165
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,439
action!

166
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,324
Whoa!

167
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,789
It's all floppy... who did--

168
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,958
Santa, this isn't good.

169
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,127
It wasn't me, I just touched it!

170
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,463
They say criminals return
to the crime scene.

171
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,505
-What?!
-Oh!

172
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,590
Maybe it was a boar?

173
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,009
So that boar must be my fan.

174
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,136
Yuji, hello there.

175
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,898
-Huh?
-Huh?

176
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,191
-Huh?
-What is it?

177
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,818
Are those glasses working?

178
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,236
You can see my face, right?

179
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,488
Yes.

180
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,365
There are better reactions!

181
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,491
Like "yay" or "wow!"

182
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:58,909
Oh...

183
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,077
This is a first.

184
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,536
Huh?

185
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,790
I've never met a woman
who wasn't moved by my face.

186
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,335
You do realize you're being
really cringe now, right?

187
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,127
Hold on.

188
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,004
I'm "cringe?"

189
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,339
"Cringe?"

190
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,510
Oh, but if I look closer,
you're pretty cool!

191
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,677
That’s it!

192
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,678
That's it there.

193
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,097
All women love him!

194
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,059
No, he's the man who makes
women across America cry!

195
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,185
-What?
-Yeah!

196
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,353
-Whoo!
-Huh?

197
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,354
Are you mocking me?

198
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,232
You're mocking me. I can't believe it.

199
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,441
We're not mocking you.

200
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,526
So what's your name?

201
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,529
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa from Dept. 4.

202
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,364
"Sumidagawa?"

203
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,490
Sumidagawa.

204
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,576
-Sumidagawa?
-Sumidagawa.

205
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,371
Sumidagawa?

206
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,831
Sumiiidagawa.

207
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,625
Sorry, please excuse us.

208
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,890
Yes, this is Reiko Kawashima.

209
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,438
Thank you so much. Take care.

210
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,899
It's all set.

211
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,734
The husband in the morning drama.

212
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,820
-You've got the part!
-Seriously?

213
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,947
-Well done.
-Thank you.

214
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,199
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

215
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,327
Yuji has been cast in the morning drama!

216
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,704
I'll do my best.

217
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,122
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

218
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,055
And the gap widens once again...

219
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,765
between our departments.

220
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,394
I never planned to
compete with you, anyway.

221
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,105
Eek, they're at it again.

222
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,398
The Cold War.

223
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,233
What’s with them?

224
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,529
Executive Manager of Dept. 1 and 2
versus Executive Manager of Dept. 3 and 4.

225
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,407
They're of the same generation
and always fighting.

226
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,451
God help them.

227
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,954
By the way, I heard you got
a smartphone commercial.

228
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,122
You've already heard?

229
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,166
You’d make a good detective.

230
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,876
Though I doubt it would go well.

231
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,835
Back in the day,

232
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,338
you were in charge of Mr. Gomi, right?

233
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,297
That's right.

234
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,884
And since then, I've always...

235
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,220
straight up...

236
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:25,805
hated him.

237
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,098
GOMI

238
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:31,311
Wow, so we do have our own star
in Dept. 4, a big star!

239
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,522
I used to work with him when I was young--

240
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,314
"With him?"

241
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,150
This is a great house!

242
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,610
As you'd expect of a star.

243
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,071
More like, a former star.

244
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,531
Hardly see him, right?

245
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,868
For today, just watch my back.

246
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,036
Your back...?

247
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,080
Yeah, with my wide shoulders.

248
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,333
For this job, time is crucial.

249
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,876
Right. Shall we go?

250
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,961
Oh, no.

251
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,963
Still two minutes to go.

252
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,214
That's fine, right?

253
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,132
Wait! It's best to be right on time.

254
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,509
Move!

255
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,974
We're still a minute and 45 seconds early!

256
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,017
I told you to come exactly at 2:00!

257
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,227
I'm so sorry.

258
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,354
That's the worst thing a manager can do.

259
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,355
I'm very sorry.

260
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,024
How long do you plan on
making me yell here!

261
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:18,900
Yes, sir.

262
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,736
Time really is important, after all.

263
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,654
I get it now.

264
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,989
What are you mumbling?!

265
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:24,864
Sorry!

266
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,658
You should've said so.

267
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,076
You should've listened.

268
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,790
Who picked out these sweets?

269
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,292
Oh, I did.

270
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,294
No good.

271
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,422
You're really no good, Kimura.

272
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,883
Wagashi are Japan's
four seasons themselves.

273
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,138
You're absolutely clueless about
pairing the sweet and the season.

274
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,432
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,143
Your back's getting smaller and smaller.

276
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,561
What are you mumbling?

277
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,730
-Hey.
-Ow!

278
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,897
-Hey!
-Sorry.

279
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,024
-What're you doing?
-Sorry.

280
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,735
Let her introduce herself.
She just joined our agency.

281
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,903
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.
Nice to meet you.

282
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,030
Miss Newbie.

283
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,574
Could you make some tea?

284
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,492
Okay.

285
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,246
Do you even know where to go?

286
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,831
I think over here.

287
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,249
You made that up. It's there.

288
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,252
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

289
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:20,754
What's her deal?

290
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,260
The client for this job
is a big fan of yours.

291
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,847
We think you could attract
more senior citizens...

292
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:33,933
It's bad.

293
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:34,809
"Bad...?"

294
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,102
Bad, bad, bad, bad,

295
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,354
bad, bad, bad!

296
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,315
This production plan is terrible.

297
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,734
So more specifically--

298
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,902
You're really asking?

299
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:46,821
Um...

300
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,573
Yes, Miss Newbie?

301
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,408
In my opinion, this commercial

302
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,621
would be a great way
to convey your power.

303
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,332
No good.

304
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,250
What isn't?

305
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,710
I am not...

306
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,214
taking opinions on acting
from a newbie.

307
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,717
Hey, hey!

308
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,552
Quit with the kicking.

309
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,643
Oh, no.

310
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,356
You just poured the boiling water?
Without cooling it?

311
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,067
Oh?

312
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,319
Are you annoyed?

313
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,906
Annoyed and while making a frowny face?

314
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,659
That kind of thing gets on my nerves too!

315
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,078
Please give me a break.

316
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,789
I'm already an old fart.

317
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,375
Oh, no, of course you're not--

318
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,001
I know that, already.

319
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,670
I've been thinking lately.

320
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,673
The thing about "harassment."

321
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,844
That's something people higher up
need to be aware of.

322
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,345
They should take a step back.

323
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,347
-Ow!
-Hey!

324
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:55,849
You!

325
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,893
What are you looking at?
I'm talking to you!

326
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,568
Any time now.

327
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,045
I say this to young actors lately.

328
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,506
"You lack resolve."

329
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,675
"Resolve," huh?

330
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,635
Right. Resolve.

331
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,473
What's all that buzzing?

332
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,142
BOSS: SAY THE LINES

333
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,853
So about the commercial,
could you be more specific--

334
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,937
No good.

335
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,440
You're really no good.

336
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:50,069
I'm saying that we're not even
at that stage.

337
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,655
I said to stop it with the buzzing.

338
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:53,907
-Um--
-And Shinichi?

339
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,617
What does he think?

340
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,953
Mr. Saigawa thinks
it's a good direction.

341
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,748
-He does?
-Yes.

342
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,084
One that could bring out your power.

343
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,253
"Power," huh.

344
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,301
Shinichi would know.

345
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,929
He's always had a sharp eye.

346
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,681
And you two, don't be so absent-minded.

347
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,558
-Do your research!
-Excuse me.

348
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,603
I've been a fan of your acting
for a long time.

349
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,066
I used to replay your scenes even if
you were on TV for a second.

350
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,778
To think that I can see you
in this commercial

351
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,364
makes me want to jump for joy!

352
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,914
Okay. Today's meeting ends here.

353
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,251
The next will be tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.

354
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,670
Get your butts here exactly on time!

355
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,508
That's a bit tasteless, isn't it?

356
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,762
But anyway,

357
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,013
what's with this No-No Man?

358
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,771
Next...

359
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,858
is this, please.

360
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,318
"Stop trying to act cool."

361
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,362
"Actually, you're insecure, aren't you?"

362
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,656
"By dismissing others
and talking like a know-it-all..."

363
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,324
There's no way I can say this.

364
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,077
Words like this are nothing
to a mansplainer.

365
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,751
"Mansplaining," or "splaining."

366
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,797
When men try to flaunt their knowledge
to women or people of lower positions

367
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,091
without listening to their opinions.

368
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,844
They're called "mansplainers."

369
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,512
Mansplainers...

370
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,515
Have you heard?
This went viral on social media.

371
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:46,019
When a woman was buying potato salad
at the supermarket, a man said,

372
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,857
"A mother should at least
make her own potato salad!"

373
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,442
That's crazy.

374
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,445
Mansplainer Gomi's work
has gradually decreased.

375
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,323
He's gone from big star to former star.
I'll be careful too.

376
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,199
You're fine since you're not a star.

377
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,701
Oh yeah!

378
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,329
You're just naturally hurtful,
aren't you?

379
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,998
But you know, he gets crazy while filming.

380
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,666
Could be a problem for the staff.

381
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:11,836
He's no good.

382
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,425
The director is a woman.

383
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,468
DIRECTOR: RIN AKAI

384
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,886
This is crazy.

385
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,520
Was he always that bad?

386
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,024
Miwa.

387
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,693
What actors need is...

388
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,071
resolve.

389
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,365
Yes, sir.

390
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:42,992
-Go get it!
-Okay!

391
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,038
It's awful, right?

392
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,207
No.

393
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,875
It's good.

394
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,128
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:56,673
Thanks.

396
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,555
Sakura, did you shower?

397
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,723
Yeah.

398
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,891
Brush your teeth?

399
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:07,767
Not yet.

400
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,727
It's not good to sleep without brushing.

401
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,145
I know, already.

402
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,940
I was going to,
but now I don't feel like it.

403
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,817
That again?

404
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,487
And you're sloppy with money.

405
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,197
They're necessary costs.

406
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,408
Don't borrow money from a guy like him.

407
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,411
He's a good guy, taking on debt for me.

408
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,288
That's how I can go to college.
It's all good.

409
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,416
But my freedom is being sacrificed.

410
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,418
Goodnight.

411
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,419
Hey!

412
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:44,929
I'm really...

413
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,390
I'm really sorry.

414
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,105
Do you plan on taking a break from acting?

415
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,234
A tearful apology alone
isn't very convincing.

416
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,113
We can't exactly believe
a child actor's tears.

417
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,615
About that--

418
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,534
I'm speaking to Miss Miwa Kandagawa.

419
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,453
Please answer.

420
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,999
Let me ask.

421
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,295
Did I really do something that bad?

422
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,300
-Miwa!
-Miwa Kandagawa! Open up!

423
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,969
It's because you never watched her!

424
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:28,931
Why?

425
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,141
Please come out!

426
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,100
Why...

427
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,728
Why...

428
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,154
What for?

429
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,532
Why are you apologizing?

430
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,329
You said we were family.

431
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,665
You said we'd always be together!

432
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,084
She's watching again?

433
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,381
Why do we have to be separated?

434
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:15,853
Don't miss this.

435
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,064
Miss what?

436
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,357
My conduct.

437
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,818
At today's shoot.
You won't have time to blink.

438
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,570
Got it. I'll be watching like a hawk.

439
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,281
I'll go in first,
then you give the snacks.

440
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,699
Okay, got it.

441
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,244
Do you really?

442
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,579
Yes, I do.

443
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,540
You make me anxious.

444
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,875
Hey, Miss Sumidagawa.

445
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,129
-Yes?
-Mr. Gomi is in Zeolus Studio, right?

446
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:45,550
Next door, our Yuji will be doing
a film completion screening event.

447
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,803
Can you buy us some snacks too?

448
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,013
Well, I could get some wagashi.

449
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,141
Of all things, wagashi ?

450
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,726
Even with all the young staff?

451
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,896
Oh, no it's fine.

452
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,065
Traditional sweets
are totally in again.

453
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,527
I'll get chocolate, like Godiva.

454
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:06,863
Oh, that?

455
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,906
Should I not?

456
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,201
Godiva would be great. No, perfect.

457
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,621
Pierre Marcolini, Cacao Sampaka,
Sébastien Boullet...

458
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,833
Of all the chocolate in the world,
Godiva, right?

459
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,127
That's a no, right?

460
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,795
I keep saying it's fine.

461
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,339
Godiva's making a comeback, right?

462
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,302
The taxi's arrived.

463
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,720
Thanks.

464
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:31,721
Counting on you.

465
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,604
Isn't there a single normal person
in this company?

466
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,398
What's her problem!

467
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,903
I'm not Yuji's cardboard cutout, okay?!

468
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,949
Thank you.

469
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:56,579
Where's the film screening?
These are so heavy!

470
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,372
Are you event staff?

471
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,458
Yes, but I'm in a hurry.

472
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,543
I'm a reporter, but running a bit late.

473
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,798
-Where is it?
-I want to know, too.

474
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,675
I shouldn't have asked you.

475
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,052
You're not even personnel.

476
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,138
Uh, I bet I'm way more
personnel than you are.

477
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:15,556
What does that mean?

478
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,101
Let's see who's more "personnel"
by comparing business cards.

479
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:23,481
I said, I don't have time for this,
outsider!

480
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,486
Damn. You think I'm just with a magazine?

481
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,779
Who are you, anyway?

482
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,614
I should be asking you.

483
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,116
-Let's exchange business cards.
-This again?

484
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,661
I don't have time for this loop!

485
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,763
Green room...

486
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,061
Why's it locked?

487
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,107
Everyone, are you ready for this?

488
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,484
You've all been waiting.

489
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,113
Starring in today's new film,
The Fading Man,

490
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,448
is Yuji Sanada.

491
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:15,366
Come on in!

492
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,636
Second floor.

493
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,947
Why aren't you saying anything?

494
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,908
I said this is all wrong.

495
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,745
Fashion's all about
personal preference, huh?

496
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,704
Stupid.

497
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,165
-You're really stupid.
-Sorry.

498
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,625
-This is not about preferences!
-Sorry.

499
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,419
You're always so fashionable--

500
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,962
-Doesn't matter now!
-Sorry.

501
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:12,089
-Just shut up for now.
-Sorry.

502
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,717
Excuse me, what's--

503
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,678
You came at a good time, Miss Newbie.

504
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,597
Get my outfits from the green room.

505
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,474
But your outfit is--

506
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,642
I brought my favorite outfits,
so go get them.

507
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,811
Just go get them.

508
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,146
Hurry up.

509
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,525
All my work. Impressed?

510
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,152
I think this will do well.

511
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,528
The color's too similar.

512
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,529
Who cares?

513
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,239
Earlier you'd agreed on our outfit.

514
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,243
I did, but looking at the set,
I think this one is better.

515
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,162
That happens sometimes, right?

516
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,997
Is Shinichiro coming?

517
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,791
He should be, but--

518
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,667
-What does "should be" mean?
-Sorry.

519
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,380
So I just gotta talk
with this woman director.

520
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,964
Mr. Gomi.

521
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,175
Could you stop with the "woman director?"

522
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,093
But you are one.

523
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,303
My name is Rin Akai.

524
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,180
Akai or whatever,

525
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,100
it's special for a woman
to be a director.

526
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,352
I don't need any "special" treatment.

527
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,687
Sure you do, it is special.

528
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,064
That's a toxic remark.

529
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,857
For a woman to be a director--

530
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:14,568
Have these!

531
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,529
Here you go!

532
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,156
Now's not the time for that!

533
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,574
Would you like some?

534
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,078
Why are you messing around?
Get over here.

535
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,123
Sorry, something suddenly came up today.

536
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,543
You can convince him.

537
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,421
I told you, I can't.

538
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,755
That's not true.

539
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,549
You can, with those lines.

540
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:37,925
No, this is impossible.

541
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,428
Rolling. Ready...

542
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,264
action.

543
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,433
Idiot!

544
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,352
I should break your head and drink soup
out of your skull!

545
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,896
STOP TRYING TO ACT COOL.
YOU'RE JUST INSECURE...

546
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,070
Hey, Miss Newbie.

547
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,322
Buy me some water. Hard water.

548
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,157
I have something--

549
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,575
First, water.

550
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,702
And make sure it's hard water.

551
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,328
-Please do as he--
-No.

552
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,371
First, listen to me.

553
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:08,372
And I said no.

554
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,749
Go to the fancy supermarket
by the station--

555
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,251
First, we have to talk!

556
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:14,795
What's with you?

557
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,088
Mr. Gomi.

558
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,717
At this rate, you’ll lose this job.
Are you okay with that?

559
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,260
To a newbie...

560
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,597
To a newbie...

561
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,517
You may think my preferences
are stupid.

562
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,102
But to me,

563
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,855
they are things that
I could never compromise on.

564
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,233
Even old farts

565
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,112
have their own old fart's way!

566
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,327
Stop trying to act cool.

567
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,915
Actually, you're just insecure,
aren't you?

568
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,750
-Hold on--
-By dismissing others,

569
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,753
talking like a know-it-all,
and looking down on people,

570
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,255
you're trying to protect your ego.
Am I wrong?

571
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,673
Miss Newbie.

572
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,383
-Are you--
-But!

573
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,303
Young people, junior colleagues,
women,

574
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,805
none of them will ever be beneath you.

575
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,975
That's just a false belief.

576
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,977
-Look here--
-My name...

577
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,438
is not Miss Newbie.

578
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,694
You already know, right?

579
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,573
That it's wrong to hold down people
who can't fight back.

580
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,991
You have to change.

581
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,494
But you don't have the courage.

582
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:29,870
Isn't that right?

583
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,166
Mr. Gomi.

584
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,668
I...

585
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,837
I love your acting.

586
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,009
So I want you to change.

587
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,346
Change...

588
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,349
and continue acting.

589
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,188
If you can continue acting...

590
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,858
If you can keep acting...

591
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,118
I'll get some water.

592
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,042
Perfect.

593
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,586
STOP TRYING TO ACT COOL...

594
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,019
Mr. Gomi's back!

595
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,485
This will work.

596
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:45,904
Mr. Gomi.

597
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:47,740
Director Akai.

598
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,241
Let's do it.

599
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:50,868
Okay.

600
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,330
Impressive, Michiko.

601
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,500
And... action.

602
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,586
I thought smartphones were pointless.

603
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,339
-But you know--
-Cut!

604
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,715
Okay.

605
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,592
My granddaughter said this.

606
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,637
"Grampa, I think it's time
to switch to a smartphone."

607
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,221
Cut!

608
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,306
Okay!

609
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,100
This thing suddenly started talking!

610
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,477
It suddenly...

611
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,605
This thing suddenly started talking!

612
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:20,731
It...

613
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,524
No good.

614
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,111
-What's wrong?
-No good.

615
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:27,613
The angle's all wrong.

616
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,490
But it follows the storyboard.

617
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:30,866
I know what you want,

618
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,327
but it still feels wrong.

619
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,789
Vague complaints aren't very helpful.

620
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:38,666
What did you say?

621
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,459
"Complaint?"

622
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,920
-Yes.
-It wasn't a complaint.

623
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,004
It was an idea.

624
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,673
-Excuse me.
-It was a complaint.

625
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,675
Let's calm down.

626
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,134
Yes, let's take a break.

627
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,260
Ideas aren't complaints.

628
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,178
But it was.

629
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,680
How?

630
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,681
It's an opinion!

631
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:54,932
Why'd you push me?

632
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,601
-I wasn't complaining.
-Hi everyone!

633
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,895
Hello, hello!

634
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,524
Mr. Gomi, what an honor to meet you!

635
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,983
-The client?
-Yes.

636
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,568
Yes, I'm the client.

637
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,988
Mr. Ito, hi.

638
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,115
It's Tanaka.

639
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,116
Excuse me.

640
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,410
I've been a fan since I was a kid.

641
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,161
Like in "Shall We Dancing!"

642
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:19,415
Oh, that old thing?

643
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,916
That angle just now.

644
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,835
It was so cool.

645
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,088
I agree. Only that angle
could have such an impact.

646
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,424
I'm so glad to hear that, thank you.

647
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,675
Thank you so much.

648
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,721
What's with that face?
And crossing your arms?

649
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,180
Just do it your way, then.

650
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,225
Hey, give me a break!

651
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,853
Well that's just great.

652
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:43,856
Good job out there.

653
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,613
Sorry about the screening.

654
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,199
Here.

655
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,286
What is it?

656
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,121
Vitalium... Z!

657
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,208
So the director never came back?

658
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:08,756
Then the client heard the story
and said it was Mr. Gomi’s fault.

659
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,300
They dropped him, huh?

660
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,390
Cheer up!

661
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:21,226
It wasn't only your fault.

662
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,356
That was average.

663
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,066
-Huh?
-I mean...

664
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,569
an average way to cheer someone up.

665
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,488
Hey! What do you mean "average?"

666
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,615
Should I dance?

667
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,158
Sing a song?

668
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,409
Call-and-response?

669
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,661
Cheer up, Sumidagawa! You say--

670
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,079
That's enough, please.

671
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,748
It's too much this close.

672
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:43,624
Too much?

673
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,794
Thanks.

674
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,505
I feel a bit better now,

675
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,006
thanks to jokester Yuji.

676
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:51,965
"Jokester?"

677
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,634
I'm a jokester?

678
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,262
You're the only one
who treats me like this, you know.

679
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,306
I'm more energized now.

680
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,265
Seriously?

681
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,434
I'm glad.

682
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,687
-Thanks.
-Sure.

683
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,277
Hey.

684
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,450
This might be a weird question, but...

685
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,288
Are you--

686
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,461
SHINICHIRO SAIGAWA

687
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,755
Sorry, I've got to run.

688
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,632
Thanks again.

689
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,598
Sounds like you failed.

690
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,810
I'll try to negotiate.

691
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,980
I'll ask the agency for another chance--

692
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,022
It's pointless.

693
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,109
They've already chosen someone else.

694
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:54,903
But...

695
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,114
Who do you think it is?

696
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,330
YUJI SANADA

697
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,750
In the event that a talent
causes trouble,

698
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,921
a bigger star at the same agency
is offered for a bargain.

699
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,591
That's a way to avoid
the worst-case scenario.

700
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:20,137
And that way, no one has to pay
the penalty for a contract breach.

701
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:21,847
It's a good thing.

702
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,015
Hey, hold on.

703
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:32,024
Mr. Gomi, who has no work, is able
to continue living a lavish lifestyle.

704
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,234
Ever thought about why?

705
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,361
No.

706
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,280
He has a fixed salary.

707
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:43,619
Mr. Gomi, one of Toyo's founders
and its greatest contributer,

708
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,746
is being paid a huge salary.

709
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,372
But, as you know,

710
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,166
he hardly gets any work.

711
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,460
Simply put, Mr. Gomi,

712
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,422
is the company's biggest liability.

713
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,299
Liability...

714
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,343
Just now I received a call from him.

715
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,054
He'll leave the agency...

716
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,891
and retire from the industry.

717
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,480
You weren't able to turn out profits
from the commercial contract,

718
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,232
but you relieved the agency
from its bad debt.

719
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,652
You did a good job.

720
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,657
Miwa Kandagawa.

721
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,576
You're cut out for this.

722
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,120
Won't you stay on?

723
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,539
Manager?

724
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,380
Nothing's changed.

725
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,840
Not since back then.

726
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,427
I'm different.

727
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,388
I won't abandon these people.

728
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:49,935
Well, then.

729
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,355
How would you manage them?

730
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,234
Write them.

731
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,610
My lines.

732
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:14,960
Who's that?

733
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,962
What, you again?

734
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,506
You can't just barge in here.

735
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,095
Don't touch that.

736
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,054
Don't--

737
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,057
Give it back.

738
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,600
What's with you?

739
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,521
You should just keep acting
if you want to.

740
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,480
It's pointless.

741
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,232
People like me,

742
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:41,153
actors with old ways of thinking,
aren't needed in the industry anymore.

743
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,155
So become someone with new ideas.

744
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,698
There's no way I can do that.

745
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,701
I've always lived like this.

746
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,618
That's not true.

747
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,789
There's no way you can accept that.

748
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,542
Always looking down on women

749
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,502
is a terrible, terrible way to live.

750
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,088
The ones who can live
that terrible way of life

751
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,174
are terrible, terrible people.

752
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,052
What're you saying?

753
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:10,098
Even if I want to change... I can’t.

754
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,726
You know why?

755
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,145
Because I'm an old fart.

756
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,981
A menace to society!

757
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,524
I admit it!

758
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,110
So I'll be an annoying old fart!

759
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,280
Give it back. Give it back!

760
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,157
I said, give it back.

761
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:28,658
Sorry.

762
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:33,872
"Old fart?"

763
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,460
Don't underestimate old farts.

764
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,420
What?

765
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,175
I said don't look down on old farts.

766
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,554
You don't have the right
to call yourself an old fart. Listen.

767
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,556
That idea is just a wall.

768
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:55,143
It's a wall built brick by brick
from stubborn beliefs.

769
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:59,439
A wall that rejects all other values.
That's why you need to overcome it.

770
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,066
That's an old fart.

771
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,361
What are your beliefs?

772
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,155
Spouting nonsense to people below you

773
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,199
just to protect your cheap ego.

774
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,826
Is that conviction?

775
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,161
Is that where your conviction lies?

776
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:15,747
No, right?

777
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,666
That's false, right?

778
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,129
Give it a rest, already.

779
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,338
Get out!

780
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,340
If you feel bad,

781
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,300
then try being an old fart.

782
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,345
Block the way with your
rock-hard convictions

783
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,305
and be an old fart!

784
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,854
What do you know?

785
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,732
You’re still young.

786
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,570
When you get older...

787
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,533
you'll understand the fear of change.

788
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,747
I do understand it.

789
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,709
That's why I couldn't.

790
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,628
I was just living aimlessly.

791
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:08,592
You.

792
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,637
You're the one who told me
that actors need resolve.

793
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,809
Now who's the one lacking
the resolve to change?

794
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,108
Are you...

795
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,819
-Mi--
-No.

796
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,906
I will change.

797
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,747
From child star
Miwa Kandagawa...

798
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:41,750
to Manager.

799
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,668
Michiko Sumidagawa.

800
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,776
Something's up, right?

801
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:08,944
It's heartbreak.

802
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:09,861
Right?

803
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,782
You can tell your auntie anything!

804
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:16,910
Even Kohji must have some stories.

805
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:21,164
In junior high, I tore a button from
my uniform and pretended a girl took it.

806
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,290
Gross!

807
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,292
We don't need a squirmy old man!

808
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,961
You're gross, too.

809
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,545
-What?
-Excuse me.

810
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,881
We have a newcomer today.

811
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,466
Fresh meat!

812
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,550
Let's take 'em in.

813
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,594
Please do.

814
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:35,512
Hi there.

815
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,473
I'm the newcomer, Yoshihiko Gomi.

816
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,643
Mr. Gomi, it's been a while.

817
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,355
Wait, no way.

818
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,482
-Shh...
-Didn't he quit?

819
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,193
He did, and he was rehired.

820
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:54,197
Not on a fixed salary,
but on percentage pay.

821
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:55,448
I've changed.

822
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,534
From No-No Man

823
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,828
to Good-Good Guy.

824
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,247
"Good-Good Guy?"

825
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,626
I take in other people's opinions.
"Good! Good!"

826
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,003
And above all, act.

827
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,713
"Above all, act," huh?

828
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,755
That is...

829
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,340
my conviction.

830
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:14,384
Nice!

831
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:15,552
Nice old fart!

832
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,762
Nice old fart!

833
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,306
Right?

834
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:20,765
Glad you're having fun--

835
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:23,018
-Jeez!
-Sorry to come up from behind.

836
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,186
-Don't scare me.
-I'm Takeru Yokoi.

837
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,271
Why are you over there?

838
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,148
That's my chair.

839
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,859
What? I'll make you move.

840
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,068
Aren't you a newcomer now?

841
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,738
Takeru, can we move this now?

842
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,739
Who?

843
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,367
Three, two, one...

844
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:43,997
-Ouch!
-That's karma.

845
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,249
-My neck!
-You deserved that!

846
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,377
This is really long.

847
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,006
Also, "a wall you must overcome," huh?

848
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,551
I think he'd like this kind of
heated talk.

849
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,178
By the way,

850
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,389
I never said to cut your hair.

851
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:02,724
Well, you know.

852
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,477
In the moment, it just happened.

853
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,439
Truly in character, as always.

854
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,152
I'm not that cool.

855
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,239
What's your motive?

856
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,243
Seriously? You put my sister in debt.

857
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,244
Is that...

858
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:25,872
really all?

859
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,418
What else would there be? Ugh.

860
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,547
How much did you plan?

861
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,758
Who is she, anyway?

862
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,178
You already have Santa for a manager.

863
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:42,430
You don't get any work.

864
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,933
You don't need any new employees.

865
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:49,396
In any case.

866
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,440
She is just...

867
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,071
Michiko Sumidagawa.

868
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:20,593
I wanted to argue with you...

869
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:24,013
and to make up with you, Akane.

870
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,642
I wanted us to be...

871
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,145
happy.

872
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:32,647
Be happy.

873
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,990
