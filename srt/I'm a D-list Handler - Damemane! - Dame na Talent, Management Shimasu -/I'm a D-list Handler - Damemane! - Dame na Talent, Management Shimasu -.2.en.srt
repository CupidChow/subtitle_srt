1
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:07,299
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.
I've been assigned to Department Four.

2
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,969
I'm different.
I won't abandon these people.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,470
Write them. My lines.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,432
I'll change.
From child star Miwa Kandagawa...

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,309
To Manager...
Michiko Sumidagawa.

6
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:22,982
I'm fired? Out of the blue?

7
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,775
How long have you been in Dept. 4?

8
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,569
Less than a month?

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,989
These are the gigs
you landed during that time.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,578
Moe Minami, Customer C in Episode 5
of The Recovering Accountant Yamiko.

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,998
Tsutomu Onodera, Bystander B
in Seishun 48 Ticket Episode 3.

12
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:44,253
Takeru Yokoi, Shaky-kneed Samurai Yotaro
Corpse C in Ep. 2, Corpse A in Ep. 8.

13
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,755
Kohji Wada, none.

14
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,090
Masae Tanabe, none.

15
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,384
Did you come to destroy Dept. 4?

16
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:53,304
Look, I hate to say this, but...

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,722
-Looks delicious.
-Eat up!

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,350
They're not exactly super good-looking

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,103
or the world's prettiest.

20
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,813
Let my cholesterol level soar!

21
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,690
They're quirky characters.

22
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,735
The Osaka lady is greedy.

23
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,695
Bring on tomorrow's heartburn.

24
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,363
They're not exactly "young."

25
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:14,575
To be honest, they don't have
any strengths to promote.

26
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:17,703
Strengths?

27
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,376
Strengths, you say?

28
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,505
If that's what you think,
we're done here.

29
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,590
Hold on, I didn't mean it that way--

30
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,550
Go scout new talent.

31
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,844
-Scout?
-Yes.

32
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:37,973
Find a newbie full of strength
who can land lots of gigs.

33
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,433
Today.

34
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,976
Today? I can't--

35
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,394
The place shall be...

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,522
Ebisu's America Bridge.

37
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,904
Rolling...

38
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,698
And...action!

39
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:41,370
Um, I've never approached strangers.

40
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,541
Watch and learn my scouting techniques.

41
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,418
I appreciate it.

42
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,464
He's so hot, I fell head over heels.

43
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,216
Seriously? That's fire.

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,384
Excuse me.

45
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,637
I'm from Toyo Production agency.

46
00:02:58,888 --> 00:02:59,722
Ew.

47
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,098
I bet it's you-know-what.

48
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,517
Totally. He does have a dirty look.

49
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,602
He's so sus.

50
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,896
He smiles like a pervert.

51
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,647
-He's like your ex.
-Stop it.

52
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,649
That's why he looks familiar.

53
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,610
Ew. Let's go.

54
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,111
I'm gonna puke.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,905
What a creep.

56
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,326
-See?
-See what?

57
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,871
My technique of being resilient
no matter what comes my way.

58
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,998
I only saw an emotionally bruised scout.

59
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,505
Sir, do you have some time?

60
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:34,924
Do I look like I do?

61
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,676
Sir, she's actually a talent scout--

62
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,054
Nah, out of the question. Next.

63
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,098
Do I look like a pervert to you?

64
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,099
You got it wrong.

65
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,351
Where are your eyes?!

66
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,645
Sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

67
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,026
What's with that cocky attitude?

68
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,611
Finish what you started!

69
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,613
I was admiring your technique.

70
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,658
You've seen enough. Goodbye.

71
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,409
No, wait.

72
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,121
Is he leaving already?

73
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,292
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa
from Toyo Production.

74
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,543
No, thank you.

75
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,130
I'm from Toyo Production.

76
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,090
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm from Toyo Production.

78
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,385
What's Toyo?

79
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,303
This is a scout scam, right?

80
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,514
I already have an agent.

81
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.

82
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:27,559
Get lost.

83
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,072
Have you found
a newbie full of strength?

84
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,993
What are your criteria?

85
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,370
You better not say "good looks"--

86
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,080
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

87
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,248
It's all about looks.

88
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,959
Looks matter, but that's not enough--

89
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,919
Then, who do I approach?

90
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,462
Let's see...

91
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:02,636
Why don't you...
approach that woman?

92
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,348
Huh? That girl? Her?

93
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,683
Here's your line.

94
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,228
"Are you satisfied with your life?"

95
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,230
What am I? A cult recruiter?

96
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,858
Your "strength" will walk away
if you don't hurry.

97
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,984
Really? Her?

98
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,736
Go, go, go.

99
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,113
-Seriously?
-Go, go, go.

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,865
Excuse me.

101
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,617
This is my business card.

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,204
Are you interested
in the entertainment industry?

103
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,459
You've got the look, so.

104
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,588
Maybe an actor, model,
TV personality, or comedian.

105
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,385
You're not interested, are you?

106
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,897
Are you satisfied with your life?

107
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,617
See? All I did was make her angry.

108
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,745
Huh? Hello?

109
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,833
"My dear flower.
Wherefore art thou?"

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,462
"O Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?"

111
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,880
What's going on?

112
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,300
The table read
for the Dept. 4 talent showcase.

113
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,676
Wow, stage acting?

114
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:29,014
Dept. 4 is new, so we want people
to get to know our entertainers.

115
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,519
"Please regard me... as your lover."

116
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,771
A middle-aged Romeo?

117
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,189
Shh. They're serious.

118
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,608
I should play the role of Romeo.

119
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,820
Nah, we need
a seasoned actor like Takeru.

120
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,737
Thanks.

121
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,197
Listen to the director.

122
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,949
You all rock. It's perfect as is.

123
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,035
"OMG Juliet, you're such
an unfortunate gal, ain'tcha?"

124
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,830
Nobody in Romeo and Juliet
talks like that.

125
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,249
It's a foreign play to begin with.

126
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,792
She spiced up her character.

127
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,252
We don't need spice.

128
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,212
Their strengths are shining.

129
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,674
Excuse me. It isn't easy to match
Takeru's over-the-top acting.

130
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,718
You should tailor your acting to Romeo!

131
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,887
Kohji, who's correct?

132
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,806
You're asking me?

133
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,559
Let me organize
your individual skills.

134
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,854
Acting is not about tailoring
but about expressing emotions--

135
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,273
Stay out of this.
You're making it worse.

136
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,399
Please choose.

137
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,567
He must tailor to me.

138
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,402
The heroine should shine.

139
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,404
Make up your mind, Director.

140
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,030
Don't press him.

141
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,575
Emotion-wise, this line doesn't flow.

142
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,160
Say that to Shakespeare!

143
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,078
You should choose another play.

144
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,289
Shush! We're going with this play.

145
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,665
Then what do we do?

146
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,666
What do we do?

147
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,834
What do we do?

148
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,252
I can't do this.

149
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,841
Guys, will you calm down a sec?

150
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,134
Let's be quiet.

151
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,428
Look who's talking!

152
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,471
You caused this chaos.

153
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,849
Stop making a mess
and assist with admin.

154
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,142
Sorry about that.

155
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,436
-Print the fliers.
-OK.

156
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,940
Wow, it's pretty expensive
for a bunch of nameless people.

157
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,609
"Nameless" is rude.

158
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,236
-Due to expenses, it's 2,980 yen.
-Dang.

159
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,614
Do we have a ticket quota?

160
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,533
One person, 20 tickets per stage.

161
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,663
We do four stages,
so that's 80 tickets times 2,980 yen.

162
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,499
That's 238,400 yen!

163
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,543
-Nobody told me.
-I told you now. Sorry.

164
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,546
-I don't have fans.
-You're torturing yourself.

165
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,632
Money beats a man's pride.

166
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,175
What a tacky quote.

167
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,886
-Shed your pride, and all is lost.
-Empty words.

168
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,803
Let's rehearse.

169
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,432
We're doing this for money.
It's a business.

170
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,644
There you go, whining again.

171
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,479
Everyone, go and rehearse!

172
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,481
Just do your job.

173
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,817
Only Mom and Dad would come,
so I won't make the quota.

174
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,154
I'm too scared of the quota
to rehearse. Therefore...

175
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,156
Romeo will make his exit.

176
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,579
Ouch! Can't you knock, dang it?

177
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,748
Oh, Mr. Saigawa, good morning.

178
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,791
Sorry about that.

179
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,835
Let's include a stair fall.

180
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,337
How did it go?

181
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,839
Did you say that line to her?

182
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,217
Yeah, and she got angry.

183
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,261
I don't blame her.

184
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,264
"Are you satisfied with your life?"
is downright rude.

185
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,516
So you've failed once again.

186
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,353
That team scored a win.

187
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:26,191
Unearthing a raw stone out of
tens of millions and persuading them.

188
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,360
As expected from Ms. Kawashima.

189
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,197
You can't keep on losing. Go.

190
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,949
Huh? What?

191
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,034
You still have four hours left today.

192
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,160
Starting now?!

193
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,789
Run. Keep it up just a bit longer.
Keep running until the end.

194
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,875
I've heard those lyrics somewhere.

195
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,304
After all that time,
I couldn't scout a single person.

196
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,642
It's already 12 midnight...

197
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:02,978
Cinderella!

198
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,984
I commend you for your hard work.

199
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,404
Gosh, you really startled me.

200
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,072
Good job.

201
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,492
What's that for?

202
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,161
Huh? What?

203
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,997
You're the only girl who would
brush away my head pat.

204
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,290
Is it that valuable?

205
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,916
It is. Don't make me say it.

206
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,423
Hey, why do you work so hard?

207
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:36,053
It's my job,
so that's how it is, right?

208
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:39,973
Is that really all?

209
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:47,898
You know...

210
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,579
This contract is valid for one year

211
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,998
and will automatically renew every year.

212
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,500
Any questions?

213
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,506
Then please fill this in.

214
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,054
STAGE NAME

215
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,395
Can I use just my first name?

216
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:27,896
That's fine.

217
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,692
SAKI

218
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,986
Saki. Sounds nice.

219
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,824
These days, many stage names
are just a first name.

220
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,493
I'll take that.

221
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,871
She wants to be an actor.

222
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,165
But she's so quiet
I could hardly hear her.

223
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,501
A contract on the spot is unfair.

224
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:54,256
I auditioned three times
and had a three-year training period.

225
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,426
But she's the chosen one
that Saigawa selected, so...

226
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,761
Good morning, Mr. Saigawa.

227
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,388
Good morning, Boss.

228
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,100
Have a nice day.

229
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,184
Good day, sir.

230
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,152
I expected a "Nice to meet you,"
but that's not your thing?

231
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,319
I'm Takeru.

232
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,365
Any siblings? Partner?
What's your blood type?

233
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:24,244
You can regard me
as your second mother.

234
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,455
She's friendly.
Don't take it seriously.

235
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,372
Hello.

236
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,957
Or I can be your sister.

237
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,715
Well, that was rude.

238
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,551
She's not going to land any jobs.

239
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,554
I can do it in two months.

240
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,392
-Do what?
-I'll make her a star in two months.

241
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,771
You're no longer her manager.

242
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,190
I'll take over.

243
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,442
Wait. Why would you do that?

244
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,860
It's obvious.

245
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,612
Because...

246
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,406
you just abandoned that girl.

247
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,911
Why? I didn't do anything wrong.

248
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,747
Why do I have to quit? Why?

249
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,583
Why? Tell me.

250
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,422
Tell me why.

251
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,843
I'm not like you.

252
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,678
I won't abandon her.

253
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,430
I'll make her a star.

254
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,431
In two months?

255
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,600
In two months.

256
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:32,771
Then, in the event you fail
to make her a star in two months...

257
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,609
If there are any vacant seats
at the Dept. 4 talent showcase,

258
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,028
you will cover the ticket costs.

259
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,446
Huh? Why me?

260
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,157
Keep it up.
You're almost at the goal.

261
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,825
Enough with that!

262
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,453
Your words don't motivate me at all.

263
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,042
We'll take your promo photo.

264
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,794
Give me a smile, please.

265
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:00,757
Very nice.

266
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,388
Pardon us.

267
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,431
-Hey!
-Nice to meet you.

268
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,685
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa,
manager of Toyo Production's Dept. 4.

269
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,979
I'm here to introduce our actor--

270
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,438
You can't. Back away.

271
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,609
This is our actor, Saki.
It's a pleasure.

272
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,777
That's enough!

273
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,988
Don't you know when to back away?

274
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,948
I didn't say, "Hang on."

275
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,784
My desk's over there.
Leave it there.

276
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,743
Sorry, ma'am.

277
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,828
Goodbye.

278
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,998
They beat us to it.

279
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,344
I have a plan.

280
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:53,268
Hi, can we still apply for the audition
for the protagonist's older sister?

281
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,437
Oh, it's past the deadline.

282
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,606
Please, I beg you.

283
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,357
You won't regret it.

284
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,319
I'm not asking you to choose her.

285
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,572
I'm just...

286
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,326
asking for one chance.

287
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,039
Please give her a chance.

288
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,959
Huh? Uh... hold on a minute.

289
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,879
Fine. Can I have her one-sheet?

290
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,049
We did it. You got the audition.

291
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,217
I could've done that myself.

292
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,810
Huh? Say that again.

293
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,396
What kind of role is it?

294
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,233
The protagonist is pretty outgoing,

295
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,069
so the sister is the quiet type.

296
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,406
It's in the development stage,
so you'll get your lines the day of.

297
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,241
Okay.

298
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,328
AUDITION WAITING ROOM

299
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,379
Huh? What's wrong?

300
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,590
I'm leaving.

301
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,468
Huh? No, it'll be your turn.

302
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,681
Saki from Toyo Production, please.

303
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,933
Uh... we're coming.

304
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,436
Wait. What are you thinking?

305
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,772
I don't want this role.

306
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,110
Huh?

307
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,322
Is Saki...

308
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,074
Uh, actually...

309
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,956
I'm terribly sorry about this.

310
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:38,832
OLDER SISTER - CHEERFUL, BRISK

311
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,045
I apologized profusely
and said she was feeling ill.

312
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,173
But why did she lose interest?

313
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,134
She's a diva.

314
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,552
Don't be mean.

315
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,097
Well, they did change
the sister's personality drastically.

316
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,474
From "quiet" to "cheerful."

317
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,309
Maybe that's why.

318
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,478
How are ticket sales?

319
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,397
It's staying flat.

320
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,357
Huh?! Just six sales?

321
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,693
Dude, that's not "flat,"
it's stagnant.

322
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,986
Don't call me "dude."

323
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,362
Shut up.

324
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,948
-Hi, everyone.
-Get to work.

325
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,159
Good morning, sir.

326
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,578
I've got great news.

327
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,708
For this performance,
we're calling off the ticket quota.

328
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,336
We will cover all the costs.

329
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,173
I look forward to a superb stage.

330
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,009
Thank you very much.

331
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,635
That's a wonderful call.

332
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,848
Thank you for your time.

333
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,192
On it.

334
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,658
Isn't she...

335
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,873
Please choose the roles
that you want to play.

336
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,877
What's this role?

337
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,546
They'll tell you on the day of.

338
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,215
No, thank you.

339
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,093
Alright then.

340
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,639
This one?

341
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,725
No, thank you.

342
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,645
Alright then.

343
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,065
-This--
-No, thank you.

344
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,693
Listen.

345
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,280
An audition means
that they choose you.

346
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,116
You don't get to choose them.

347
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,834
I want... this one.

348
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,548
VIDEO AUDITION

349
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,383
Dang.

350
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:56,803
It's 200,000.

351
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,100
Do you know
what this number indicates?

352
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,187
-No.
-My fan club members.

353
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:11,317
Meaning, you should be happier
whenever I make an appearance.

354
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,278
Ugh, you're being cringe again.

355
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,823
It's not cringe
because I spoke the truth.

356
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,199
-Nope.
-Why not?

357
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,035
You said "make an appearance"
about yourself.

358
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,372
Darn Sumidagawa,
you're hard to read.

359
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,124
-What's that?
-I dunno.

360
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,252
Is that a video audition?

361
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,461
Yes, it is.

362
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,883
They film themselves
acting the role and submit it.

363
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,302
These auditions are on the rise.

364
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,804
If you feel sorry,
kneel down and apologize.

365
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,056
If you feel sorry,

366
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,183
kneel down and apologize.

367
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,895
She's really good.

368
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,354
Right?

369
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,481
She's overflowing with talent.

370
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,067
I get it. Her talent's overflowing.

371
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,745
-What?
-It's just that...

372
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,373
I'm having so much fun.

373
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,918
I don't get it.

374
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,005
Listen.

375
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,884
Tell me when you need help.

376
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,638
I promise to help you.

377
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,607
Alright then. Good luck.

378
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,906
You're wide open. Head pat!

379
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,711
Saki, I have the results
of your video audition.

380
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,838
You passed!

381
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,632
Congrats.

382
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,010
I'll acknowledge you as my rival now.

383
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,554
If you book it,
let's be a package deal.

384
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,264
No blindsides, please.

385
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,474
Hook me up, too.

386
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,643
Where's your pride, people?

387
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,728
Is the final round
a video audition too?

388
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,563
No, it's in front of the judges.

389
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,900
But it's the same role,
so Saki will do just fine.

390
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,568
Go for it.

391
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,487
I'll decline.

392
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,490
I'll decline...

393
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,034
the final round.

394
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:26,577
Goodbye.

395
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,247
Huh?

396
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,291
No, this isn't good.

397
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,085
What do we do?

398
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,545
She said no, right?

399
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,088
Now what?

400
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,259
Saki, wait.

401
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,386
What do you mean you decline?

402
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,304
What about our package deal?

403
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,347
Not now.

404
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,349
Can you wait a minute?

405
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,851
Excuse me.

406
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,811
At least tell us why.

407
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,188
I feel sorry for Michiko.

408
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,774
Goodbye.

409
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,526
I said...

410
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,195
Are you alright?

411
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,789
You can't even say "Sorry"?

412
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,631
-S...
-You can go home.

413
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,179
We don't need
people like you in Dept. 4.

414
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,933
Everybody here has been
teased by their peers

415
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,061
or shunned by their parents.

416
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:38,107
But they continue to fight
for the chance to pursue their dreams.

417
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,903
But not you.

418
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,492
You say you want to be an actor,
but you're letting opportunities slip by.

419
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,123
I finally understand who you are.

420
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,960
You're mocking us.

421
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,091
Dept. 4 only consists
of serious-minded people.

422
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,971
We don't need someone who
half-jokingly wants to be an actor.

423
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,777
I...

424
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:25,863
I also...

425
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,035
want to act...

426
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,288
But...

427
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,374
I can't...

428
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,212
s... speak well.

429
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,882
Isn't this overkill?

430
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,387
Meaning?

431
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,764
You knew from the beginning.

432
00:23:56,561 --> 00:24:00,398
Stuttering?
You mean stumbling over words?

433
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,984
I had a friend who stuttered.

434
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:07,238
But her acting in the video was normal.

435
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,575
Some people have no symptoms
when they're alone.

436
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,662
Or when they're with
their family or singing.

437
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,747
It depends on the person.

438
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:20,251
She was mumbling
to suppress her symptoms?

439
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,088
I feel bad that I said
she was too quiet.

440
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,341
She should've told us.

441
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,927
It's not easy to talk about it.

442
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:31,804
I bet she...

443
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,981
I rarely attended school.

444
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,989
Wh... Wh...
What are you saying?

445
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,326
They laughed whenever I stuttered.

446
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:57,371
That escalated and led to bullying.

447
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,499
My reaction to that was...

448
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,546
Let's hang out after school.

449
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,550
I used to play make-believe at home.

450
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:15,389
I'd play several roles alone
and reenact school life.

451
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:21,646
Through that, I discovered the joy
of playing a role that's not me.

452
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,482
I dreamt of becoming an actor.

453
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,782
One day, my mother suggested
that I go to an audition.

454
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,000
I especially have difficulty
with words starting with "G."

455
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:48,756
So, unable to even say
my last name, "Goto,"

456
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,967
the audition ended.

457
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:58,516
Thanks to that, I was able to let go
of my dream to become an actor.

458
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:05,731
But that day,
you approached me and asked...

459
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,401
Are you satisfied with your life?

460
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,822
My heart stopped.

461
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:19,412
Maybe I was lying to myself
and pretending to give up on my dream.

462
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,041
So I thought, "Just one last time."

463
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,631
Then, give the final round a try.

464
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,093
I've had enough.

465
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:39,265
I've had enough...

466
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:47,982
My intention...
was not to... mock everyone.

467
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,360
No, wait.

468
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,409
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,456
I'll make Saki a star
no matter what.

470
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:07,418
I'll make Saki a star
no matter what.

471
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,086
You want me to buy one?

472
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,880
I'll make Saki a star.

473
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,132
Don't cast a curse spell on me.

474
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,677
I'll make Saki a star
no matter what.

475
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,513
If you fail, you'll fall into debt.

476
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,224
I can do it.

477
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:28,773
I'll make Saki a star
no matter what...

478
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,320
Let's give the final round a try.

479
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,534
I learned that people who stutter
try various methods to suppress it.

480
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,203
I put this together.

481
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,708
In your case, you whisper.

482
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:51,420
But that won't work
if you want to be an actor.

483
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,381
So, let's try something else.

484
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:58,094
I put together some training methods
that may improve your symptoms.

485
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:01,222
But, symptoms vary
from person to person.

486
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,766
It tends to be a lonely struggle.

487
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,395
So, let me help you--

488
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,063
Thank you very much.

489
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:10,815
But...

490
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,150
it's fine.

491
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,068
Saki.

492
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,239
You're not satisfied
with your life, right?

493
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:22,535
Actually...

494
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,830
I won't go into details...

495
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,208
But I'm the same.

496
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,255
If you're not satisfied with your life,

497
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,716
it's not because
you failed at something.

498
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,471
It's because you didn't
give it your all and see it through.

499
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,767
Saki.

500
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,439
Why don't you see it through
together with me?

501
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:02,950
I-am-Sa-ki-Go-to.

502
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:08,289
I-am-Sa-ki-from-To-yo-Pro-duc-tion.

503
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:13,502
Nice-to-meet-you.

504
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:14,462
Good.

505
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:18,048
By the way,
how many tickets have you sold?

506
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,217
-Nine tickets.
-Ni...?!

507
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:24,263
At this rate, Miss Sumidagawa
will be covering 1.16 million yen.

508
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,057
She's on the road to bankruptcy.

509
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,312
Hmm... What should we do?

510
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,899
Why go through all that?

511
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,160
Inhale.

512
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,704
Exhale.

513
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:52,791
Hold your stomach.

514
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,878
You wouldn't get it.

515
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,838
Yeah, I don't.

516
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,676
Try saying it in one go.

517
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,720
You wouldn't get it.

518
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,180
Yeah, I don't.

519
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,518
Flex your diaphragm.

520
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,311
I don't. Sorry.

521
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,437
AUDITION ROOM

522
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,688
But...

523
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:15,856
Diaphragm.

524
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,987
One person is running late,
but let's start the audition.

525
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,740
Sorry, I'm Karen Ueda
from Toyo Production.

526
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,826
Wow, Saki.

527
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,620
I'm happy that you're here too.

528
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,872
Miss Ueda, please get ready.

529
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,333
I'm sorry. Right away.

530
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,587
Let's begin. You first.

531
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,305
I'm Saki from Toyo Production Dept. 4.

532
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,183
Nice to meet you.

533
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,230
Please start acting.

534
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,732
Ready, start.

535
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,902
You wouldn't get it.

536
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:02,945
Yeah, I don't.

537
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:04,905
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:07,992
I don't get it at all.

539
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,080
But I want to understand.

540
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,583
And share your feeling.

541
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,711
I want to be with you.

542
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,340
I'll be here for you forever.

543
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,051
Even if I don't get it...

544
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,679
Even if we fight...

545
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,557
I'll be here for you forever.

546
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,940
Let's stop for now.

547
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,484
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,571
Watching Saki's acting, I...

549
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,825
That's how good her acting was.

550
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,286
Yes, that too, but...

551
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,289
I realized how hard
she must have worked.

552
00:31:56,457 --> 00:32:01,128
Because I heard that Saki stutters.

553
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,632
Is that true?

554
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,800
Um...

555
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,636
No need to answer.

556
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,056
Only your acting will be evaluated.

557
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,103
You wouldn't get it.

558
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:26,820
Saki?

559
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:28,947
Uh, Saki?

560
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,158
Uh...

561
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,669
LETTER OF REJECTION

562
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,254
Huh? Juliet has the flu?

563
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,881
Moe just called.

564
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,216
We're screwed.

565
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,009
Who'll replace her?

566
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,679
Santa, you...

567
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,014
-Cannot.
-can't. What do we do?

568
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,057
She can do it.

569
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,476
Yeah, I get the vibe that she can.

570
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,435
No way.

571
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,812
We have no choice. Please.

572
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,063
Please.

573
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,691
I'm not comfortable
with crowds, so no.

574
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,193
You're the crowd-loving,
seasoned actor type.

575
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,404
You don't get it. Actually, I...

576
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,530
What is it?

577
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,949
Is there a reason you must refuse?

578
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,534
Let's try just once.

579
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,244
I can't even try once.

580
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,287
-Read your lines.
-Didn't you hear me?

581
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,873
"My Juliet."

582
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,626
"Please regard me as your lover."

583
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,211
Juliet!

584
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,924
I won't allow an amateur
to perform on stage.

585
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,718
But under the circumstances...

586
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,513
Then... what should we do?

587
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:38,517
Saki.

588
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,102
What about Saki?

589
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,061
Huh?!

590
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,062
Good idea.

591
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,155
What?

592
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,240
What the heck?

593
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,910
This will be... your line.

594
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,162
What?

595
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,425
Oh, hi there.

596
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,052
I have two things to say.

597
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:18,932
First of all, here are the results
of the audition's final round.

598
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,771
Sorry, you didn't make it.

599
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,733
Inside, there's a letter
from the producer, Mr. Shigeoka.

600
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:30,486
Alright.

601
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,362
And secondly...

602
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,825
Moe is out sick for today's
Dept. 4 talent showcase performance.

603
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,577
Can you replace her?

604
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,997
I'm leaving the agency.

605
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:45,209
I gave it my all, so I'm satisfied.

606
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,127
No, but wait.

607
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,338
Hold on, Saki.

608
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,050
Be honest.
Is that how you really feel?

609
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,385
Stop pretending like you understand.

610
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,431
People who stutter...

611
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,142
can't find happiness.

612
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,436
We're not like you.

613
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,814
No, I don't agree with you.

614
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,440
What would YOU know?

615
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,776
You're right, but...

616
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,404
You don't stutter.
How would you know?

617
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,031
That's not what this is about.

618
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,200
How miserable I feel stuttering--

619
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,327
How would I know?

620
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,332
But there's one thing I do know.

621
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:31,713
You have no right to determine
that people who stutter are unhappy.

622
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,176
Everybody who stutters is unhappy?

623
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,846
Enough with your prejudice.

624
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,517
The reason you're unhappy
is entirely your fault.

625
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:48,272
You treat stuttering as your insecurity
and claim that you're unhappy.

626
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,357
Then, change your perspective.

627
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,693
Don't treat it as an insecurity.

628
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,362
Turn it into your strength.

629
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,749
In this letter...

630
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,378
Mr. Shigeoka writes
that he used to stutter too.

631
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,008
And because of that...

632
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:16,884
PRODUCER
EIJI SHIGEOKA

633
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,386
...he was able to feel
people's invisible pain.

634
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,347
He put that into his works.

635
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,393
Is Mr. Shigeoka unhappy, too?

636
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,731
Hey, is he unhappy?

637
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,071
"Change your perspective."

638
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,910
"Turn your insecurity
into your strength."

639
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,829
Stuff like that...

640
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,749
I've heard it over five million times.

641
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,252
That's the solution?

642
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:58,300
That's just talk from someone
who has never struggled.

643
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,596
That feeling...
when everybody stares at you.

644
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,516
The pain when they laugh--

645
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,769
You!

646
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:13,231
You... You... You...

647
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,026
You narcissist!

648
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,031
Everybody stared at you?
Laughed at you?

649
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,449
I have news for you.

650
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,410
Nobody is that interested in you!

651
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:29,706
Also, your stuttering
is nothing to laugh about.

652
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,042
If anybody laughed at you,

653
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,295
it means they're lowlives
with the brains of a fourth grader.

654
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,715
You're such a petty existence.

655
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,136
Stop acting like a rising star,
you narcissist!

656
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,517
Go on and keep being a narcissist.

657
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,438
How dare you!

658
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,780
I...

659
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,241
am not a narcissist.

660
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,327
You know nothing about me.

661
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,372
Don't talk like you know me!

662
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,795
You're talking just fine.

663
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,506
Huh?

664
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:33,687
Huh?!

665
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,108
Sorry, we're late.

666
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,652
-You made it in time.
-Saki!

667
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,195
What's that crowd?

668
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,408
About an hour ago,
Yuji posted on his social media.

669
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,702
See? That's our flier.

670
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,037
You're right.

671
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:51,830
His fans saw this

672
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:56,126
and thought he'd be here,
so the tickets sold out.

673
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,804
The cue cards are done.

674
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,806
Wow, good work.

675
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,269
Your diaphragm.

676
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:15,604
Let's do this.

677
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,689
We got this, guys.

678
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,074
Nobody's interested in me.

679
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,327
Nobody's interested in me.

680
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:35,707
In just a moment, Toyo Production's
Dept. 4 talent showcase performance

681
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,377
of "Romeo and Juliet" will begin.

682
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,436
"It begins yet again."

683
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,023
"The story of Verona's
noble Capulet family"

684
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,527
"and the abominable Montague family."

685
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,862
"The fight has continued"

686
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:10,784
"for decades, or rather,
for centuries."

687
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:15,413
"Rather than wield his sword,
he should swirl a glass of wine."

688
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,924
"O Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?"

689
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:32,013
"Deny thy father"

690
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,808
"and refuse thy name."

691
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,312
"Or, if thou wilt not,"

692
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:44,526
"be but sworn, my love."

693
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,111
"I met Juliet"

694
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,780
"and discovered what true love is."

695
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,869
"But Romeo..."

696
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,039
"Is your true love..."
You alright?

697
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:04,004
"Why not choose Count Paris?
He has no flaws."

698
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:08,466
"Yeah, but that girl's mind
is made up, y'all."

699
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,093
"Y'all"?

700
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,138
"What?! In that case..."

701
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,016
"What must I do?"

702
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,852
"I'm scared!"

703
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,479
"Romeo!"

704
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,279
"Here lies a dagger."

705
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,120
"O happy dagger."

706
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,459
"This is thy sheath."

707
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,839
"There rust..."

708
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,055
Hey... Hey!

709
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,643
Excuse me.

710
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,188
I'm seriously gonna beat him up.

711
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,506
YOU NARCISSIST!

712
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,360
"O happy dagger."

713
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,410
"This... is thy sheath."

714
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,291
"There rust..."

715
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:10,463
"and... let me die."

716
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,453
It's not gonna be easy.

717
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,456
An actor who stutters?

718
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:45,749
I agree.

719
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,336
Meaning she has no rivals.

720
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:51,546
Fine.

721
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,298
See you.

722
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,092
Tell Yuji...

723
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,095
"Thank you."

724
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,732
What the heck was this?

725
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,317
YOU NARCISSIST!

726
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,402
When a person who stutters talks,

727
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:18,615
their mind is constantly
thinking about how to not stutter.

728
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:23,828
But that mindset makes them nervous
and can lead to symptoms.

729
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:29,417
If they get emotional enough
that they forget about their stutter,

730
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,169
symptoms can disappear.

731
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:33,338
Meaning?

732
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,466
I had faith that with this one phrase,

733
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,719
you would make her extremely angry.

734
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,513
You call that "faith"?

735
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,307
Your acting was superb.

736
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:48,228
Yuji's fans are talking all about you.

737
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,563
Way to go, Saki.

738
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:51,981
Oh my gosh.

739
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,733
Your acting was wonderful.

740
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,235
It was outstanding.

741
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,320
Truly outstanding. Bravo.

742
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,239
I like what I saw today.

743
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,702
So, is this the moment a star is born?

744
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,165
That... is up to us.

745
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,424
Ugh, I don't get this.

746
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,801
-What is it?
-Sorry.

747
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,970
Saki wants to change her name.

748
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,471
-She does?
-Yes.

749
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:24,389
I'll do that.

750
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,933
From "Saki" to "Saki Goto."

751
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,059
I see.

752
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,150
SAKI GOTO

753
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,821
-Ask me anything.
-Alright.

754
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,834
