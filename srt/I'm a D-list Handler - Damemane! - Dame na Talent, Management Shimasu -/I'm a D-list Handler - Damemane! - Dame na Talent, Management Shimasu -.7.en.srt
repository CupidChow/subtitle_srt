1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,382
I'll keep saying it.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:07,842
I...

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,720
really like you.

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:13,889
I'm flattered.

5
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,152
I just heard something horrible.

6
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,490
This is definitely bad.

7
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,913
Good morning!

8
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,707
Hi.

9
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:40,916
What's wrong?

10
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,085
-You seem kind of down.
-Yeah.

11
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,714
Well, what is it?
You can tell me anything.

12
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:47,715
It's nothing.

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,720
Do you... have something
to say to me?

14
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,972
Huh? I don't think so.

15
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:55,890
You sure?

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,184
What is it?
You're acting weird today.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,603
I'd rather not hear that from you.

18
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:02,897
Santa?

19
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,191
Morning!

20
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,193
Aren't you too happy right now?!

21
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,736
Speak in your usual volume!

22
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,155
What was that?

23
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,450
It's good to be cheerful
when you greet others.

24
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,994
What do entertainers do on dates?

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,121
You're bringing that up?

26
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,915
What's wrong, Santa?

27
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:24,210
Your decibels are swinging
all over the place.

28
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,461
Are you feeling ill?

29
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:26,879
Stomachache.

30
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,422
Are you okay?

31
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,007
-Want some meds?
-Can I?

32
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,300
Here.

33
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,719
For our little hard worker, Santa.

34
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,471
-Good stomach meds.
-Thank you.

35
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,308
Are you really okay
with a guy like that?

36
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,392
What's going on?

37
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:41,602
He's my boyfriend.

38
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,937
Every last one of them.

39
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,146
Huh?

40
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,565
He has 2,300,000 followers.

41
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,525
Wow!

42
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,318
And a few condos in Dubai.

43
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,404
He makes thousands a month
from subscribers alone.

44
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,366
He's called "Reiwa's Startup Guru."

45
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,327
What a superficial title.
Is he legit?

46
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,704
-Where's good for a date?
-Can she hear me?

47
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,873
Of course, you should go for a drive.

48
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:03,916
-Nice!
-Right?

49
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,585
That's overdone and people will see,
so no good.

50
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,713
Reporters know which cars you're driving.

51
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,132
And you have fans, don't you?

52
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,510
-How will you face them?
-There's not that many.

53
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,594
Not the point!

54
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,720
Scary.

55
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,266
If you search "Rikito Takagi,"
these results come up:

56
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,476
"Scam," "shady," "arrested."

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,561
Are you jealous?

58
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,687
Hey!

59
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,689
-He sounds dangerous.
-No way.

60
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,233
Are you not being seduced
by sweet words?!

61
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,151
Why are you looking at me?

62
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,361
Oh, my stomach hurts!

63
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,487
-Why?
-You know,

64
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:37,408
before I got married, we'd go
to Harajuku in the early morning.

65
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,659
What? Harajuku?!

66
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:40,035
That's touching.

67
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,329
We were so nervous
that people would see us.

68
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,164
But no one would care, right?

69
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,376
My wife is more popular.

70
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,795
-The husband of a star!
-Thanks a lot.

71
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,091
But going on a date in disguise
sounds so romantic!

72
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,175
How?

73
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,386
It's too risky, so just stay at home.

74
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,721
Or don't date at all!

75
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,849
If you could date any entertainer,
who would you date?

76
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,685
That's no good.
This topic is no good!

77
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,480
Why are you being such a downer
about everything today?

78
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,399
Just let us talk!

79
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,693
Who would you date?

80
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,945
-Who?
-Me?

81
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,406
-I think...
-No!

82
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,577
Wait, what's going on?

83
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,870
-Sorry.
-That's not it.

84
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,165
You're acting strange,
butting into every sentence.

85
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,291
I know.

86
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,836
Santa...
You like Michiko, don't you?

87
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,755
That must be it!

88
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,215
You're a smooth operator,
aren't you?

89
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,258
Woohoo!

90
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,676
Woohoo!

91
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,845
Why're you doing that too?!

92
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:40,846
Anyway!

93
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,183
Romance between talents
or between talent and manager

94
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,809
is absolutely forbidden.

95
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,605
-Let's go.
-What is it?

96
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,648
Just come on.

97
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,524
-Where are we going?
-Woohoo!

98
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,785
Who's that?

99
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,203
My senior, Santa Kimura.

100
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,331
He wanted to come here
since elsewhere would be bad.

101
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,335
Uh... I'll just say it.

102
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,379
I know everything.

103
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,798
-What?
-Scary!

104
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:16,924
A stalker?

105
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,842
Gross! Kick him out, Sis!

106
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,970
No! How should I say this...

107
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,639
I saw everything.

108
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,224
What, like ghosts?

109
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,393
-I'm scared!
-No!

110
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,478
I'm talking about Yuji.

111
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,647
-Huh?
-What about Yuji?

112
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,983
Yesterday, on the rooftop.

113
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,150
Just the two of you.

114
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,070
We were just doing
an after-work toast.

115
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,279
Don't act so coy.

116
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,906
He confessed, right?

117
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,034
And you seemed
pretty pleased yourself.

118
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,286
What?! You and Yuji?

119
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,163
Yesterday, on the roof.

120
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,290
Witnessed with these eyes,
and these ears.

121
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,668
Were you spying?

122
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,627
I didn't mean to!

123
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,505
I went to take a break,
and you were lovey dovey.

124
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,133
Woohoo! Get him, Sis!

125
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,134
Hush for a sec.

126
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,429
You should've said something
and not acted like a peeping tom.

127
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,724
How could I?
And don't get mad at me.

128
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,975
You could be fired.

129
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,102
-You get that, right?
-Sorry.

130
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,900
Hey. Now's the time!

131
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,861
Aren't you going to say something?

132
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,279
Yes!

133
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,947
-This is it!
-Huh?

134
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,116
Sis,

135
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,617
you could get rich!

136
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,577
What?

137
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,287
-If you marry Yuji--
-"Marry"?!

138
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,457
no more money problems,
and we can pay off our debt.

139
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,042
I can study abroad.

140
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,711
Can I go to Korea?
I can, right?

141
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,838
I don't know, don't ask me!

142
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,048
Happy-go-lucky, huh?

143
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,091
She's more excited than me!

144
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,260
There were flowers blooming
on your head.

145
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,054
I'm here to cut them down!

146
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,934
-Is that him?
-Yeah.

147
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,269
-Show me.
-No!

148
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,937
-What did he say?
-Hey!

149
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,983
"I want to spend more time together."

150
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,444
"Will you go out with me?"

151
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,821
It's a date!

152
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,323
You're moving too fast!

153
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,201
You should wait and see
how things go first!

154
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,452
He's a nagging in-law.

155
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,578
Who's an in-law?

156
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,289
Do not get found out.
I warned you.

157
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,167
The second they find out,
everything will fall apart.

158
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,378
-I understand.
-Jeez.

159
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,798
My stomach hurts.

160
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,425
Hey. Tea.

161
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,343
-Tea, please.
-Okay.

162
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,762
-Get out.
-Think insurance could cover this?

163
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,013
I don't know, get out.

164
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,556
Just one cup!

165
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,102
Go home!

166
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,858
Where are you?

167
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,943
I'm sitting on the steps.

168
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,612
Oh, I see you.

169
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:26,905
Be right there.

170
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,448
Oh, don't come here.

171
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,825
Why not?

172
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,579
It will be bad
if someone sees us together.

173
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,916
My star aura emanates
even when I'm in disguise.

174
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,502
So what should I...?

175
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,504
Keep a short distance
and follow me.

176
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,841
Okay, let's go.

177
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:47,843
Okay.

178
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,346
These flowers are pretty.

179
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,514
Where?

180
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,224
I can't tell if we're apart.

181
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,642
The blue ones.

182
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,189
Oh, these. Beautiful.

183
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,024
Right? They're cute.

184
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,693
This time lag is pretty fun.

185
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,529
Hey. Want some candy?

186
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:08,697
Sure.

187
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,908
They're in the flower pot.

188
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,160
I WUV YOU

189
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,537
I feel like I'm scavenging for food.

190
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,209
But this is kind of exciting.

191
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,212
Here's a question.

192
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,964
What is the name of this sculpture?

193
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,717
"Goddess of Peace."

194
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,885
The answer is...

195
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,930
come here to find out.

196
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,727
"Venus Drowning in Love."

197
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,396
There's no way I could've guessed that.

198
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:42,981
Too bad.

199
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,131
You're everywhere.

200
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,049
A BLUE WE'VE NEVER SEEN

201
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,844
Hey, people will see.
You're too close.

202
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,514
Star power, full throttle!

203
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,768
They were closed today,
so I reserved the place.

204
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,686
Wow.

205
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,522
It's like I'm seeing a star
for the first time.

206
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,439
You're late!

207
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,775
I've been shining this whole time.

208
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,444
This way...

209
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,155
we can relax and be together.

210
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,366
Thanks.

211
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:36,702
Shall we?

212
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,748
Where to first?

213
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,252
-How about the sharks?
-Let's do it.

214
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,464
Oh, right. Here.

215
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,216
That's bad!

216
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,927
Reiko would've thrown a fit.

217
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,805
She gave this to me for my birthday.

218
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,473
A "protective charm."

219
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,767
-I see.
-Thanks.

220
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,528
Oh, there's a ramp here,
so be careful.

221
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,988
There is?

222
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,781
I guess not.

223
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:15,782
-No.
-Right.

224
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,328
But aquariums are dark,
so watch your step.

225
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,704
I'm fine, thanks.

226
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,459
Wanna go up here?
Be careful on the stairs.

227
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,087
What's going on?
I'm totally fine.

228
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,673
Notice, already!

229
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,676
I'm reaching out my hand, naturally.

230
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,428
That's a chance to hold hands.

231
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,556
That's why?

232
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,683
-Sorry.
-So embarrassing.

233
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,519
This is something
I shouldn't have to say out loud.

234
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,104
-Sorry.
-That won't cut it.

235
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,231
-Embarrassing.
-Sorry!

236
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,200
Now I'm embarrassed.

237
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,117
Me too.

238
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,828
Should we?
Hold hands?

239
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,789
I don't know either.

240
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,375
What's the right timing
for holding hands?

241
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,419
Let's try to relax.
Take a deep breath.

242
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,017
When did you realize?

243
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,227
What?

244
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,230
That I wasn't Michiko Sumidagawa,

245
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,731
but Miwa Kandagawa.

246
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,483
The moment we met.

247
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:32,818
So quick!

248
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,363
So it was obvious.

249
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,740
But other people
didn't seem to notice.

250
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,201
I wasn't fooled.

251
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,702
That's because...

252
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,704
you're the one who saved me.

253
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,541
-"Saved you"?
-Yeah.

254
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,293
And... action!

255
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,213
I've already solved the mystery.

256
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,173
Good work.

257
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,967
Quack detective.

258
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,969
-You...!
-Cut!

259
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,053
Okay!

260
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,516
What do you eat to get so fat?

261
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,768
I bet you're eating sweets all day!

262
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,854
-That must be it!
-Hey!

263
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,397
Child Actor A!

264
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,773
Child Actor B!

265
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,525
Stupid extras!

266
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,610
You're too loud!

267
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,487
Kids with no roles, just shut up!

268
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,698
It's Miwa Kandagawa.
Run!

269
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,452
Are you okay?

270
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,163
That was you?

271
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,623
You were so bold.

272
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,667
Was I that rude back then?

273
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,835
Yeah, still are.

274
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:32,878
-Huh?
-Huh?

275
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,713
I mean, no.

276
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,924
Why do you act, Miss Kandagawa?

277
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,801
Because I like it, of course.

278
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,678
Huh? That's it?

279
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,013
Yeah.

280
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,265
It feels good.

281
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,643
"I need to be like this,
or like that..."

282
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,355
Worrying about what others think
is exhausting, right?

283
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,735
Why are you into acting?

284
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,570
Because I like it.

285
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,822
Now I can say it.

286
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,657
Thanks to you.

287
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,619
I didn't do anything.

288
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,832
I tried not to think about you.

289
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,460
But I couldn't stop.

290
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,046
That first love...

291
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,174
wouldn't leave my mind.

292
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:34,022
I don't know if these
are the right words...

293
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,362
but thank you.

294
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,621
Will you get back into acting?

295
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,540
I know you can still do it.

296
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,126
I like acting.

297
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,714
But now, something else
is more important.

298
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,466
What is?

299
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:06,304
There's a person
who inspired me to start acting.

300
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,184
I need to pay them back somehow.

301
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,566
I want... to make them
shine in the spotlight again.

302
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,529
That's why I chose
to became a manager.

303
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,033
I see.

304
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:35,875
I've got your back.

305
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,820
Ouch!

306
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,280
I can see stars.

307
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,240
Stars flying around a star's head.

308
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,784
Just stay awake for today, okay?

309
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,705
I keep falling asleep.

310
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,457
What do you mean?

311
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,208
When I'm with you.

312
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,628
Am I that boring?

313
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,129
That's not it.

314
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,297
I feel at ease.

315
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,427
Usually, before I sleep,

316
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,722
I feel anxiety close in on me.

317
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,974
Anxiety?

318
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,480
Could I be vulnerable?
Even though I'm a star.

319
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,608
Stars are people too.

320
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,153
Actually, I was born
from a human and a diamond.

321
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,238
Ah, the cringe!
It's too cringey.

322
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,824
I...

323
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,453
am always being chased by something.

324
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,455
Not stress...

325
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,457
or pressure.

326
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:03,797
I feel like my heart
is being crushed.

327
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,591
The weight of stardom?

328
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,182
At those times, I always see
the same nightmare.

329
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,353
I'm standing all alone
in a huge space.

330
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,190
No one else around, just me.

331
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,316
Alone.

332
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,570
But...

333
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,032
in the dreams I see next to you,

334
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,245
a full house is giving me
a standing ovation.

335
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,498
So... you are...

336
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,542
a good dream machine.

337
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,086
It sounds like one of
Doraemon's tools.

338
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,884
Alright.

339
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,386
Hm?

340
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:52,721
What?

341
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,097
Ouch! What're you...?

342
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,642
The things chasing after you...

343
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,310
are nothing.

344
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,230
Thanks.

345
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,316
I feel a lot of pain my back, though.

346
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,526
I tried.

347
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,531
Thanks.

348
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:26,087
Isn't it a bit weird
to hold both hands?

349
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,089
I thought so too.

350
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,343
But... this was
the right timing for me.

351
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,930
That works.

352
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,065
Did you enjoy the aquarium?

353
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,275
Of course!

354
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,610
Which part?

355
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,989
-The dolphins could really jump!
-Yeah.

356
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,039
I'll take these.
Thank you for the treat.

357
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,834
Right, like that.

358
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,960
Yes, yes.

359
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,630
A little more... like that.
Good.

360
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,966
Uh, let's try for...
a little more oomph.

361
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:13,885
Give a little more.

362
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,012
Ready and... oomph!

363
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,138
That's enough.

364
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,474
I'm quitting lingerie modeling.

365
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:20,975
What did you say?

366
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,853
My boyfriend doesn't like it,
so I'm done.

367
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,313
What?!

368
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,981
Hold on a second--

369
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,026
I'm so sorry!

370
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,986
Please wait for a moment.

371
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,282
Hello?

372
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,827
What do you plan to do?

373
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,665
-What's this?
-That's my line.

374
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,583
YUJI'S FORBIDDEN DATE
WITH MANAGER

375
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,418
What the heck is this?

376
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,296
This...

377
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,632
Explain.

378
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,262
In a way that will convince me.

379
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:58,930
That's...

380
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:00,932
It's...

381
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,686
It looks like you're having
an intimate conversation.

382
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,146
Like you're in a relationship.

383
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:12,360
Hey, my Yuji doesn't have time
to get involved in these mistakes.

384
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,404
"Mistakes"?

385
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,449
Calling love a mistake is--

386
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,411
Right now, you don't have
the right to speak.

387
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:27,417
It'll be so troublesome
to stop this from getting out.

388
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,211
You're going to stop it?

389
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,713
I'll try.

390
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,340
But if I fail,

391
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,886
Yuji's popularity will plummet
from betraying his fans.

392
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,597
The agency will take a great hit.

393
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,683
We'll face a storm of criticism.

394
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:50,106
Did you come to this company
to stir up storms?

395
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,444
Hey, Cinderella.

396
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,447
The magic wore off
a long time ago.

397
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,284
Now, delete his contact information.

398
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:04,579
Hurry up.

399
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,548
Here.

400
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,299
CONTACT DELETED

401
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,718
Yes, good work.

402
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,973
Yuji is way out of your league.

403
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,559
You've learned something.

404
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,113
I'm sorry this happened.

405
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,285
You've done well.

406
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,162
Bravo!

407
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,457
-What?!
-Go ahead and fall in love.

408
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,875
What are you saying?

409
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,294
Shinichiro Saigawa
endorses this love.

410
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,420
Gross!

411
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,172
What're you thinking?

412
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,633
Here's a mission from your supporter.

413
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,095
-What?
-Bring Yuji to Dept. 4.

414
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,472
I have no clue what you're getting at.

415
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,641
You're talking about work, now?

416
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,979
Do you... really think you can
separate love from work?

417
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,523
Listen.

418
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,942
That's wishful thinking.

419
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,653
A sugar-coated lie.

420
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,572
Ms. Kawashima would never allow it.

421
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,494
Also, break up Moe's relationship.
Ready--

422
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,663
Wait, you just said something weird.

423
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,915
Her relationship won't do us any good.

424
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,668
Make her break up
and keep getting her more jobs.

425
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,004
Information overload.
My brain can't keep up.

426
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,714
-Yeah!
-What?!

427
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,215
Excuse me for a second.

428
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,009
Banzai!

429
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,469
I'm so glad I love you.

430
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,804
Ready!

431
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,472
Action!

432
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,186
I'm getting married.
I'm done with modeling.

433
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,065
Blockhead!
Nincompoop!

434
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,827
I'm losing everything.

435
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,540
Hey, Yuji.

436
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,918
Do you have something to tell me?

437
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,137
"Rents out an aquarium
for a forbidden date."

438
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,806
You must be walking on air, huh?

439
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,059
Where did you...?

440
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,727
Will you praise my effort?

441
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,813
I stopped it before it got out.

442
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,940
Thank goodness, right?

443
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,444
If this got out...

444
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,406
how many commercials
would you have lost?

445
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,658
All for a passing whim.

446
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,578
No, it wasn't on a whim--

447
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,246
Are you allowed to speak now?

448
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,628
Is that what your drive amounts to?

449
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,964
Caught up in a fleeting romance

450
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,968
you so easily betrayed
your fans and me.

451
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,599
So that's what your sense
of professionalism is like.

452
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,062
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,609
Delete her contact info now.

454
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,279
-Huh?
-If you do...

455
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,199
I might be willing
to cut her some slack.

456
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,953
But if you don't...

457
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,809
CONTACT DELETED

458
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,310
This is the right decision.

459
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,817
Um, the meeting is about to start.

460
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:10,825
Um...

461
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,871
Do you have a moment?

462
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,335
Is it true...

463
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,297
you're in love?

464
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,509
You're not mistaken.

465
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:33,890
First...

466
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,852
could I say my opinion...

467
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,604
as your fan?

468
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,397
Sure.

469
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,984
I'm really shocked.

470
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,195
Regardless of who she is.

471
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,535
I'm truly sorry.

472
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:01,876
But...

473
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,882
For all the happiness
we get as fans,

474
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:13,638
we hope...
that you can be happy too.

475
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,682
Please let me say that.

476
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,398
Thanks.

477
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,488
Since I was born a star,

478
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,741
it's my duty to make my fans happy.

479
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,162
There are sights that only I can see.

480
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,624
So I can't afford to stop here.

481
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,461
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

482
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,382
If I can make everyone happy,

483
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,133
I'll throw it all away.

484
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,474
At least, I was prepared to.

485
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,021
It's hard.

486
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,192
Don't throw it all away.

487
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:14,115
I think there's strength...
in those who have.

488
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:19,120
If you aren't happy...

489
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,957
then we won't be happy either.

490
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,299
Thanks.

491
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,051
I'm much better!

492
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,443
Hey, where have you been?

493
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,904
Time for you to join us
in stuffing Yuji's photos.

494
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:55,781
What's wrong?

495
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,617
You always do this so quickly.

496
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,202
It seems that she's ill.

497
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,289
A cold? Try wrapping
a leek around your neck.

498
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,166
She doesn't need
an old man's advice.

499
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,208
Something happen?

500
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,836
As your senior in life,
you can tell me.

501
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,213
-A broken heart?
-Don't bring that up.

502
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:16,719
Ow!

503
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,306
Don't throw my futon!
It's sacred!

504
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,559
If it's a broken heart,
you should move on to the next guy.

505
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,685
That's right!

506
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,937
Zip it, pompous
smarty-pants moron!

507
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,522
"Pompous smarty-pants moron"?

508
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,608
You're going overboard
with the insults.

509
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:34,320
Everyone! She's dangerous right now,
so don't get too close.

510
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,113
She smells like alcohol.

511
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,990
Were you drinking on the job?

512
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,576
Be quiet. Just leave me alone!

513
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,953
Drinking on the job?
What were you thinking?

514
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:46,123
Shut up! What do you like
about these kids' clothes, anyway?

515
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,626
You look like you love toy cars!

516
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,381
She's so much meaner than usual,
my knees are giving out!

517
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,008
Right, she's in a
dangerous condition now.

518
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,302
-Your turn!
-Drinking on the job--

519
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:02,056
Shut up! You rely on
your wife to survive!

520
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,099
Living corpse!

521
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,558
She hits where it hurts.

522
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,061
I'm a zombie!

523
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,479
Why don't you go home?

524
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,234
Was there a reason to cry?

525
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,613
I'm telling on you,
telling on you!

526
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,657
Hey! Everyone, look at this!

527
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,783
Who cares about tattling?

528
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,076
RIKITO'S EIGHT WOMEN!

529
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,411
"Eight"?!

530
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,291
The person you have dialed
is unavailable.

531
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,335
-Pick up.
-After the tone...

532
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,140
SCOOP: HIS GO-TO
FLIRTING TECHNIQUES

533
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,809
Look at this article.

534
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,814
Now, I'll ask you a question.

535
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,024
Why was this story published?

536
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,069
Three, two, one.

537
00:28:59,196 --> 00:28:59,989
I don't know.

538
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,908
Here's another hint.

539
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,369
I'll ask again.

540
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,955
Why was the story about Moe?

541
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,166
Three, two, one.

542
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,128
-Sorry.
-Why don't you think a little harder?

543
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,799
Since it's your fault
that she's become the victim.

544
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,969
-What?
-The story about you and Yuji

545
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,638
was pulled due to
some sort of power.

546
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:25,890
Why?

547
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,642
There must have been some pressure.

548
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,479
Frankly, it's nothing
to be shocked by.

549
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:35,274
Things like this happen a lot
in the entertainment world.

550
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,819
To protect their top star,

551
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,156
the agency covers up with
another talent's scandal.

552
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:43,824
What's with that?

553
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,534
Like a scapegoat?

554
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,038
-That's disgusting.
-That disgusting thing saved you.

555
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,750
Well, Yuji, to be more correct.

556
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,960
What exactly do you want?

557
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,089
Look carefully at your article.

558
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,677
-What?
-Isn't it amazing?

559
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,679
-Huh?
-From the start,

560
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,974
he was positioned as if
he knew you'd be there.

561
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,309
YUJI SANADA!

562
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,856
The name of this
excellent reporter is...

563
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,566
George Mizushima.

564
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:20,778
And this reporter too.

565
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,238
George Mizushima.

566
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,367
That's right.

567
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,577
I like the look in your eyes.

568
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,789
Now for the final question.

569
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,874
Who on earth...

570
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,794
could be responsible?

571
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,384
TODAY'S SPECIALS

572
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,094
That Trash-gawa!

573
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,346
His smirking face is sickening!

574
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,265
-You're drinking faster than usual.
-Huh?

575
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,891
Uh, never mind.

576
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,978
Excuse me.
A water, please.

577
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,229
Coming right up.

578
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,775
I've heard that 90% of scandals
are internal leaks.

579
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,151
Maybe an insider?

580
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,611
An inside job...

581
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,907
Mr. Saigawa's the first person
who'd do something so mean.

582
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,827
But he'd have no way
to know about you two.

583
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,164
Ms. Kawashima?

584
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,874
What?

585
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,294
She's really close to Yuji,

586
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,629
so she may have realized.

587
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:22,923
There's nothing to gain.

588
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,885
Now everyone looks suspicious.

589
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:30,472
I can tell you that it wasn't me!

590
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,224
Here you go.

591
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,018
Thank you.

592
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,646
How're things with Yuji?

593
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,816
We haven't met up at all.

594
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:42,568
I deleted his number.

595
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,903
Do you know where he could be?

596
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,322
I wouldn't...

597
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,451
Oh.

598
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,276
Oh, it's you.
The man child.

599
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,904
Right, the looks of a man
and the brain of a child.

600
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,656
-Crap!
-Did you just say "crap"?

601
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,241
I've done nothing
to receive such verbal abuse.

602
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:34,203
I just came here to get
my nightly cup noodles.

603
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,414
There's no noodles here.
You're not qualified to eat them.

604
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,250
I am! Don't take away
my eating qualifications!

605
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,794
Noodle!

606
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,755
Thick, rich noodles!

607
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:50,094
It's charred tonkotsu ramen
with butter soy sauce. I hid it.

608
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,428
"Hid"?

609
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,680
Yes, hid.

610
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,974
That's it!

611
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,727
Dear Yuji,

612
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:07,903
The one who leaked our relationship
was probably Ms. Kawashima.

613
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,447
Though I'm not sure how.

614
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,158
Yuji,

615
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,661
I want to see you
one last time.

616
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,539
I lied.

617
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,999
I want to keep seeing you.

618
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,769
DEAR YUJI

619
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,459
DEAR YUJI

620
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,777
You haven't seen him yet?

621
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,153
No.

622
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:34,031
That means you haven't been working.

623
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,658
I'm not in love for your sake.

624
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,454
I thought you would've come sooner
to get your lines.

625
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,957
"It's completely worthless."

626
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,125
What is this?

627
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,794
These lines are for Moe.

628
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,629
I have no idea what this means.

629
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:49,922
Now, get pumped!

630
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,507
Ready...

631
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,884
Action!

632
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,055
Can I ask something?

633
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,683
What do you like about him?

634
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,728
Well, everything.

635
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:05,646
Really?

636
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:09,733
Or maybe you fell for the title of
"Reiwa's Startup Guru"?

637
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,735
And what's wrong with that?

638
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,739
What are titles, anyway?

639
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,075
Why do people like them?

640
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,952
They make you feel secure.

641
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,328
Prime real estate.

642
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,121
Then why date?

643
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,998
To brag to everyone else?

644
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,959
To live a rich lifestyle?

645
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,503
Even if you're the eighth woman?

646
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,550
Titles that are too heavy

647
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,510
steal your freedom.

648
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,303
What're you saying?

649
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:41,431
In the end, big titles
are completely worthless.

650
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:45,102
Beyond them are
the realities of every day.

651
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,814
Rather than impressive titles,

652
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,525
it's that person's weak side.

653
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,360
Their pathetic side.

654
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,363
If you don't find
those shortcomings charming,

655
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,242
you'll never be able to overcome
life's harsh realities.

656
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,330
Even if he acts cringey...

657
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,460
and tries too hard to be cool...

658
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,880
and worries a lot too.

659
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:16,967
I love all of that.

660
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,511
So this sucks.

661
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,679
Uh, so...

662
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,765
In short, quit being the eighth woman.

663
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,434
It'll do nothing for your art.

664
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,768
Good talk.

665
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:28,103
What?!

666
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:42,576
MISS KANDAGAWA

667
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,039
Miss Kandagawa.

668
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,416
I think of you always.

669
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:54,087
Tomorrow, I'll be waiting
at the place where you saved me.

670
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,590
Tomorrow...

671
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,301
That place...?

672
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,031
A star appears like a comet.

673
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,075
At an incredible speed.

674
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:33,794
I've missed you.

675
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:39,883
Me too.

676
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,267
This star shines at night

677
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,645
and has been watching over you.

678
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:56,233
I think that's what you say
when people die and go to heaven.

679
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,363
But I like that side of you.

680
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,573
Was...

681
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,076
-that a compliment?
-Of course.

682
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,497
I read your letter.

683
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,042
I was happy.

684
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:18,380
Thanks.

685
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,343
About Reiko...

686
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,681
No matter how you think of it,
that article was too detailed.

687
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,683
There was no one around.

688
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,652
Wait!

689
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,657
What's that?

690
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,911
She had a GPS and mic on me.

691
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,914
Some protective charm.

692
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,584
Are you okay?

693
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,714
I think I've reached my limit.

694
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,219
I'm sorry I got you involved.

695
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,057
Don't apologize.

696
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,734
Hey, Yuji.

697
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,699
I want you...

698
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,035
to shine even more.

699
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,996
So brightly that I have to
close my eyes.

700
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,123
So that I'm eclipsed.

701
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,505
I...

702
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,841
like you.

703
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:50,097
I think about how happy I'd be
if we could date.

704
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:53,600
But...

705
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:58,105
we have things we need to do.

706
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:02,776
That's why...

707
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,070
I...

708
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,823
will have an unfulfilled love.

709
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,535
-"Unfulfilled"?
-Yeah.

710
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,413
I can't more forward or backward, but...

711
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,292
I'll always like you.

712
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,088
Is that bad?

713
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,386
I was thinking the same thing.

714
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,015
Although I can't stop my feelings,

715
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,309
I can stop my actions.

716
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,063
Or something.

717
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,983
I might try to act cool.

718
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,695
Same as always.

719
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,321
Right?

720
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,328
It's a little sad, though.

721
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,497
No.

722
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,796
It's really sad.

723
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,429
Let's stay like this.

724
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:16,725
Okay.

725
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,688
Hey, are you done playing house?

726
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,775
You really love to cause a fuss.

727
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,485
I was worried.

728
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:31,990
You have an early start tomorrow,
so shouldn't you be using time wisely?

729
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,783
Right? Let's go.

730
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,369
Hold on.

731
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,877
Please explain this.

732
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:49,674
Do you remember what I said
when I gave that to you?

733
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,053
It's a protective charm.

734
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,058
It's not like I wanted to peek
into your private life.

735
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:03,688
I was protecting you
from making mistakes.

736
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,192
Cut it out.

737
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,074
Standing before you is one man.

738
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:17,035
Not a robot or a mannequin.
A human being.

739
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,413
It's natural for humans to love.

740
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:23,291
No one can stop it.

741
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,377
That's how it's been for humankind.

742
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,047
You'll go against the laws of nature
to make a star?

743
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,423
Don't make me laugh.

744
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,387
The shiny facade of your android
will eventually fade.

745
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,931
You might as well have AI act.

746
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,766
That's how AI would steal our jobs.

747
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,060
Actors...

748
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,521
They don't act from their heads,

749
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,022
but from their hearts.

750
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,484
They can only express
what they've felt in their hearts.

751
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:52,112
And you...

752
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:56,908
you're trying to steal
all that precious input from the actor.

753
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,871
You don't know a thing.

754
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,624
Stars aren't born.

755
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,459
They're made.

756
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:11,506
Searching desperately for a hidden gem,
pouring in love endlessly,

757
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,550
managing obsessively,

758
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,386
and walking the same path.

759
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,140
Could you possibly understand?

760
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:21,641
That is--

761
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,310
I can't walk with you.

762
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:28,898
I'm really grateful to you.

763
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,483
But...

764
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,739
Without fear, and without doubt.

765
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,533
I want to walk on my own.

766
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,161
I'll...

767
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,581
I will go my own way.

768
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,254
Is that your answer?

769
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,090
Thank you...

770
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,220
for everything.

771
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:06,770
Understood.

772
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:19,866
The parts have come together.

773
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,078
No other manager would go this far.

774
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,455
I'll take that as a compliment.

775
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:30,960
First, regarding the article
about Yuji and our manager.

776
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,505
One of us replaced it.

777
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,548
Seriously?

778
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,051
It was all a setup, huh?

779
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,347
But... what for?

780
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,308
To crush our top star's love
in the bud.

781
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:49,729
As well as to gain a huge favor
by not publishing the story.

782
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,732
So my article about the couple
was just bait.

783
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,404
Who would've known it would
be replaced from the start.

784
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,700
You didn't hold back, did you?

785
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:07,080
But their love isn't over yet.

786
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:11,292
Let's acknowledge
their romantic relationship.

787
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,254
That's bold.

788
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,132
This could go south.

789
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,426
Also.

790
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,262
The manager involved...

791
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,849
is Miwa Kandagawa.

792
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:29,519
What? As in...

793
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:30,937
the former child star?

794
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,939
I want you to expose everything.

795
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,030
Saigawa.

796
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,576
What on earth are you thinking?

797
