1
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,350
I can't walk with you.

2
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,769
I will go my own way.

3
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,030
That's a complex expression.

4
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,910
Well, I spent more time
with her than my parents, so.

5
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,413
You're right.

6
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,665
But...

7
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:42,793
it's over.

8
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,551
Uh-oh, I forgot!

9
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:54,138
You want to transfer
Yuji to Dept. 4?

10
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,432
You wanted him.
Get on with the plan.

11
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,644
Hmm, I'd rather not.

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,146
Huh? Why not?

13
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,106
He doesn't need to transfer.

14
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,400
Huh?
What's gonna happen to Yuji?

15
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,029
Say this line to Yuji.

16
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,989
"We better go to sleep."

17
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,159
"It'll get busy starting tomorrow."

18
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,997
LORD SANADA'S
DATE WITH AGENCY EMPLOYEE

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,582
Which employee is it?

20
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,668
It's hard to tell.

21
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,671
Yeah, you can't tell who she is.

22
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:33,219
Is there a possibility
that it's Michiko?

23
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,554
Nah, never.

24
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,643
Right, Yuji and Michiko
are worlds apart, aren't they?

25
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,521
That's a really bad joke.

26
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,190
Never in a million years.

27
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,275
Huh? It "is" possible!

28
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,193
Patience.

29
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,074
Then, I, Yokoi, will bet
a million yen that it's not Michiko.

30
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,700
Pay me a million yen.

31
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:57,743
Cut it out.

32
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,872
Why are you getting so worked up?

33
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,457
Don't take the bait.

34
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,376
More than that...

35
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,338
This article shocked me more.

36
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,175
"Toxic Manager K's
manipulative management style."

37
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,680
"Is this romance his way
of fleeing from the torture?"

38
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,891
They're obviously talking about Reiko.

39
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,644
Reiko is famous among fans.

40
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,397
Actually, Toyo Production
is coming under fire.

41
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:30,067
This sucks.
My brand is getting tarnished.

42
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,319
It's tarnished to begin with.

43
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,154
Rude! It's not tarnished.

44
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,078
-Calm down!
-You were saying?

45
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,788
It's about our company.

46
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,874
Yes, that's right.

47
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,086
They're saying we turned
a blind eye to Reiko's tactics.

48
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:53,841
Ad agencies and broadcasters
are contacting us about it.

49
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,763
They won't allow the company
to go easy on Reiko after all this.

50
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,488
Uh-oh, suspended from work, huh?

51
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,325
Did you tip them off?

52
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,367
Me?

53
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,870
Why would I do that?

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,915
I'll tip them off, too

55
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,208
that she's "Miwa Kandagawa."

56
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,294
That information is useless.

57
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,764
YUJI SANADA'S GIRLFRIEND
IS MIWA KANDAGAWA

58
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,849
It'll be in the next edition.

59
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,643
What are you thinking?

60
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,271
Don't worry.
I'll minimize the harm to Yuji.

61
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,482
He is, in fact...

62
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,151
"my" precious star.

63
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:55,945
"My"?

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,696
You haven't heard?

65
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,159
As of today, my title
has become a simple one.

66
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,621
DIRECTOR
ENTERTAINMENT DEPT.

67
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,499
In addition to Dept. 3 and 4,

68
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,835
I'm now in charge
of Dept. 1 and 2.

69
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,216
Please excuse me.
I have a meeting with Yuji.

70
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,435
Why don't you go to France
for a month starting tomorrow?

71
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,566
Director Kuroshima.

72
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,695
Yes. He's filming a movie
financed by foreign investors.

73
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,031
It's a huge opportunity.

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,079
You want me to stay overseas
until the dust settles?

75
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,708
Regarding your romance...

76
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,753
this agency will not
give an official statement.

77
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,798
Don't go!

78
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,009
I like you.

79
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,927
Cut! Okay.

80
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,889
We're so sorry for all the trouble.

81
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,850
Not at all.
We're not worried one bit.

82
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,727
Thank you so much.

83
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,563
Please excuse me.

84
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,711
Yuji, you're going to France?

85
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,298
Hold on.
This disguise didn't fool you?

86
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,384
Or perhaps
I was radiating star power?

87
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,638
I knew right away.
That's a costume, not a disguise.

88
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,264
It's not Halloween now.

89
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,808
Ouch, that stings.

90
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,021
So, have you decided?

91
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,529
I want to give it a try.

92
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,744
Sorry, I can't be with you--

93
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:51,870
What a relief.

94
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,083
If you'd turned it down for me,
I'd have cut your nose off.

95
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,923
How do you come up with
such horrifying ancient torture ideas?

96
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:08,971
Good luck.

97
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,431
I'll do my best, too.

98
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,112
Bye.

99
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,709
Hey.

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,801
It's nothing.

101
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,537
Alrighty.

102
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,132
Sorry, I'm late.

103
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,719
-Let's go.
-Okay.

104
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,930
Wait, hold on.

105
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,932
I'll accompany Saki.

106
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,099
Why?

107
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,852
I'm in charge of her now.

108
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,104
Why?

109
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,651
The rules say a manager must quit
when they date an agency star.

110
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,111
But you said to date him.

111
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,114
That was when
I was the Dept. 3 and 4 director.

112
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:55,452
As the head of all four departments,
I can't set a bad example.

113
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,455
Yuji and I aren't a couple
to begin with.

114
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,959
You're not a couple,
but do you have feelings for him?

115
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,586
Well, that's...

116
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,423
Thank you for your work.

117
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,008
See yourself out.

118
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,639
See yourself out.

119
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,975
I refuse to.

120
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,937
There's something I need to do.

121
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,397
I can't quit yet.

122
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,486
Very well.

123
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,239
You did help me get promoted.

124
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,576
So, I'll give you a chance.

125
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,037
Make this gig a success.

126
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,373
AC? The Advertising Council?

127
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,625
Kohji has been cast.

128
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,839
It's to promote the conservation
of special natural monuments

129
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,342
and encourage people
to keep nature clean.

130
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,845
"Special natural monuments"?

131
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,140
The Japanese crested ibis,
ptarmigans, antelopes...

132
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,808
And also...

133
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,188
GIANT SALAMANDER

134
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,566
Giant salamanders.

135
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,953
If you make it a success,
I'll spare you from being fired.

136
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,041
Rolling...

137
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,545
And... action!

138
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,922
Navi Navi Map.

139
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,760
Navi Navi Navi Navi
Map Man

140
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,055
Navi Navi Navi Navi
Map Man

141
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,433
Glide your way
through traffic jams

142
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,853
Your trusty navigator
is by your side

143
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,398
Navi Navi Navi Navi
Map Man

144
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,400
Navi Navi Map
for mobile phones.

145
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,319
Is this Kohji's commercial?

146
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,237
He's so young, it's hilarious.

147
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,450
Even after 20 years,
people call him "Navi Navi Map Man."

148
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,576
That's good.

149
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,995
Actually, it stuck with viewers,

150
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,498
casting him wasn't easy,
so here he is.

151
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,459
Having a major hit
isn't always a blessing, huh?

152
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,755
This commercial can change
his image, so he's really pumped.

153
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,673
Hmm.

154
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:18,428
Only Mr. Saigawa could
land such a gig at a time like this.

155
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,599
A million yen... Have mercy.

156
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,558
Excuse me?

157
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,145
GIANT SALAMANDER

158
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,530
Navi Navi Navi Navi
Map Man

159
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,489
That's the crew.

160
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,951
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

161
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,538
Today, we have Mr. Wada here

162
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:48,083
to help clean this river,
which is designated as a protected area.

163
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,878
We'll film the process and create
a document-style commercial.

164
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,714
Understood.
I'm an eager beaver.

165
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,550
Ready to get sweaty.

166
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:03,974
Members from a conservation group
will join the cleanup today.

167
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,517
Nice to meet you.

168
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,893
Likewise.

169
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,480
Uh, have we met?

170
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,983
Have you been on TV?

171
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,776
You probably mean...

172
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,903
Shotaro's murder case.

173
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,783
Mr. Midoriyama was the handler
of the great salamander that was killed.

174
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,996
I still haven't forgiven
that child actor

175
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,791
and the media who think
anything goes if it's funny.

176
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,252
-Right, the media...
-What's wrong?

177
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,087
-Ouch.
-But not this commercial.

178
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,839
-What was that?
-Be quiet.

179
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,132
Since then,

180
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,511
he has helped preserve giant salamanders
and other animals and plants.

181
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,429
Wonderful.

182
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,683
-Seriously?
-How many animals and plants are there?

183
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,019
A lot?

184
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,770
I've never counted, but...

185
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,148
Before we begin the cleanup,

186
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,193
I'd like to point out some precautions.

187
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,071
As you just heard, this area

188
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,616
is designated as a protected area.

189
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,368
Don't look.
Listen to the explanation.

190
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,454
Sorry, I'm pumped up.

191
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,956
Please be extra cautious when...

192
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,375
Will you listen?

193
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,837
Hey, you better not
do anything to cause problems.

194
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,797
Your outfit is the problem.

195
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,884
Smoothly without any issues.
Stay in the lull.

196
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,136
-In the what?
-Lull.

197
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,679
Be quiet.

198
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,895
Did you know Shotaro's
former handler would be here?

199
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,896
Of course not.

200
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,149
Anyway, how's the shoot going?

201
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,319
Let's pick up trash.

202
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,866
No, Kohji!

203
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,951
Are you alright?

204
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,452
Help me!

205
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,122
Please be more careful.
There are small creatures.

206
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,793
Sorry, I thought a crisis
would add spice to the documentary.

207
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,295
His enthusiasm is backfiring.

208
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,923
If it fails, you're fired.

209
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,758
Don't forget that.

210
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,055
Kohji, what are you doing?

211
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,600
I want the creatures underwater
to enjoy a gourmet meal.

212
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,937
From a popular bakery
in Minami-Aoyama.

213
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,315
Mr. Wada, it's prohibited
to feed the creatures.

214
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,984
But it's from Minami-Aoyama.

215
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,944
Sorry, we'll clean it up right away.

216
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,696
Santa, you go.

217
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,282
-It's quality bread.
-No, you can't.

218
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,410
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

219
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,787
I got one!

220
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,707
Kohji,
what do you think you're doing?

221
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,211
Fishing without a permit
is prohibited!

222
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,797
I'm sorry, we'll release it right away.

223
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,300
-But it's a mountain trout.
-Release it!

224
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,385
But it's a mountain trout.

225
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,511
Bye-bye.

226
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,014
Let's call it a day.

227
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,308
Thank you for your work, everyone.

228
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,642
Thank you.

229
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,480
Thank you.

230
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,399
Was the shoot alright?

231
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,234
Sorry, he got too excited.

232
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,320
Yeah, but it'll work out.

233
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,280
Thank you so much.

234
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,700
I need to go.

235
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,661
We've managed to--

236
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,079
You never change.

237
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,681
YUJI

238
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,437
Hey, things are going crazy.

239
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:45,403
Weekly Gossip Magazine ran
the second story of Yuji Sanada's romance.

240
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,449
Reportedly, his love interest
is the former child star Miwa Kandagawa.

241
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,785
It's a shocking revelation.

242
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,205
There is a resemblance,
isn't there, Dr. Nagoshi?

243
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,083
Yes, I remember her.
The giant salamander...

244
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,712
They're covering it in Shu-ichi?
Oh my gosh.

245
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:07,801
Nobody could have expected her
to return to showbiz as a manager.

246
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,178
YUJI SANADA'S LOVE INTEREST
IS MIWA KANDAGAWA

247
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,930
Oops, I bet a million yen.

248
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,892
It's a shock that Yuji's honey
is Miwa Kandagawa,

249
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,020
but the fact that
Michiko is Miwa Kandagawa...

250
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:19,979
Exactly.

251
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,147
I have a question.

252
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,442
I don't really know Miwa Kandagawa.

253
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,822
Are you kidding?
Miwa Kandagawa was a child prodigy.

254
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,741
It was crazy.
She was in the media every day.

255
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,412
I understand your excitement,
but let's work, guys.

256
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,957
My heart is filled with excitement.

257
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,087
She won numerous awards for movies,
dramas, commercials, and music shows.

258
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,590
I knew there was something
behind her intense presence.

259
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,801
You had no idea, huh?

260
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,219
You owe a million yen.

261
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,350
And at the height of her career,
Shotaro's murder happened.

262
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,019
Wait, Michiko killed someone?

263
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,272
I'll explain.

264
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,735
The shoot was at an aquarium.

265
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:13,408
The plan was for Miwa Kandagawa
to visit Shotaro, the giant salamander.

266
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,412
They had the same green room.

267
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,665
Perhaps Shotaro was nervous.

268
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,043
His tank emitted a bad smell.

269
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,964
The smell disgusted Miwa Kandagawa,

270
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,259
who tried to move the tank
out into the hallway.

271
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,554
She dropped it, Shotaro jumped out,

272
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,681
and had a bad fall.

273
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,100
What's the point of drawing?
It's a mess.

274
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,604
Obviously, it wasn't on purpose

275
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,773
and she was still a kid.

276
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:49,152
We all thought nobody
would point the finger at her, but...

277
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,448
It led to the most intense backlash
in the past 30 years.

278
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,449
Why?

279
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,075
Since this incident,

280
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:01,539
the public found out that Miwa wasn't
the person everyone thought she was.

281
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,833
She ignored greetings,

282
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,587
used her phone during meetings,
talked down to her manager,

283
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,756
and was terrible with money.

284
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,676
Then came the worst public apology
in the past 30 years.

285
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,513
Did I do something THAT bad?

286
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,185
Why are you making a big deal
about a giant salamander dying?

287
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,438
Miwa, why did you say that?

288
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,398
It wasn't on purpose.

289
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,151
You made me share
a green room with an amphibian.

290
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,903
That's messed up.

291
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,489
People are calling me
a "murderer,"

292
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,699
but it was a giant salamander.

293
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,410
Stop treating it like a human.

294
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:44,207
Her agency dropped her,
and she retired from show business.

295
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,962
I think after the incident,
her father went missing,

296
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,967
and her mother fell sick
and passed away.

297
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,222
I wonder how she felt...

298
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,227
She couldn't be "Miwa Kandagawa."

299
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,397
She had to live
as "Michiko Sumidagawa."

300
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,485
MISSED CALL
YUJI

301
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,409
I can't come to the phone right now.

302
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,371
Leave a message after the beep.

303
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,206
Miss Kandagawa!

304
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,292
Miss Kandagawa,
can we talk to you?

305
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,169
Miss Kandagawa.

306
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,589
Can you provide a few comments?

307
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,465
Miss Kandagawa!

308
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,931
Miwa Kandagawa,
please come out.

309
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,683
We want to hear from you.

310
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,352
Why?

311
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,152
Are you alright?

312
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,201
Why don't you take the day off?

313
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,875
SHINICHIRO SAIGAWA

314
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,960
COME TO THE OFFICE ASAP.

315
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,339
Scumgawa.

316
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,969
Miss Kandagawa!

317
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,138
Miwa Kandagawa?
Please comment.

318
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,808
-You seduced Yuji with fake tears?
-Come back. Answer us.

319
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,060
Miwa, right?

320
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,645
Well, say something.

321
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:36,861
Hi, there.

322
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,075
Sorry, it's me.

323
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,161
Are you alright?
Must be tough.

324
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,248
Miss Sumidagawa. I mean...

325
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,959
Miss Kandagawa.

326
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,711
We just received a call.

327
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,423
Unfortunately, Mr. Wada's
AC commercial has been canceled.

328
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,595
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

329
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,765
No, actually... it's my fault.

330
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,770
This is a post by Mr. Midoriyama,
Chairman of the conservation group.

331
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,233
The first picture
shows the river before you went.

332
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:21,114
The second picture was taken
after you went there.

333
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,824
It's cleaner.

334
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,120
It was a bit murky,
so I cleaned it to make it clear.

335
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,126
That grass is called nigorigoke,
and it's a designated protected plant.

336
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,169
You can't remove it.

337
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,630
Huh? But nobody told us that.

338
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,923
Actually, I think...

339
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,801
when he was explaining, I was...

340
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,804
You will see moss growing here.

341
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,142
One is called "nigorigoke,"
and it's a designated protected plant.

342
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,894
Do not remove it by accident.

343
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:59,777
Someone told Mr. Midoriyama
that Mr. Wada had removed the moss,

344
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,529
so he posted it.

345
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,532
It went viral,
and Mr. Wada is getting roasted.

346
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,825
In addition...

347
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,539
Word got out that the famous
Miwa Kandagawa was there, too.

348
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,207
It completely blew up.

349
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,837
"The great salamander killer
conserving nature? Hahaha."

350
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,338
The roasting continues.

351
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,506
Why are you hyped?

352
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,217
So, they canceled the commercial.

353
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,387
Well, I don't blame them.

354
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,518
I'm sorry for lying to you all.

355
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,569
Look who it is. It's the star
of the show, Miwa Kandagawa.

356
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,238
We welcome you!

357
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,573
Thank you very much.

358
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,909
Can we forget
about the one million yen?

359
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,828
-Sure.
-Yippee.

360
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,791
How... are you holding up?

361
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,547
Reporters are swarming outside.

362
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,800
I'll go tell them off.

363
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,677
No, you shouldn't go out.

364
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,889
She should spend the night here.
Right?

365
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,683
Yeah, I don't mind.

366
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,936
It's messy,
but make yourself at home.

367
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,104
It's not your home.

368
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,606
Welcome to my humble abode.

369
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,239
If the commercial fails,
you're fired.

370
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,199
Remember that.

371
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,581
NEW MESSAGE RECEIVED
YUJI

372
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,961
ARE YOU OK?

373
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,342
I'M NOT OK.

374
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,360
Here, I brought you some stuff.

375
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,034
Thank you.

376
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,287
Oh, wait a minute.

377
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,540
If you have trouble sleeping...

378
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,128
A selection of my favorite films.

379
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,546
They're old.

380
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,757
Those define my youth.

381
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:31,345
Dramas are truly fascinating,
aren't they?

382
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,473
Well then, farewell and goodbye.

383
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,142
Ouch.

384
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,819
MY BELOVED CHILD

385
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,699
Mommy...

386
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,702
loves you.

387
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,205
Akane,

388
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,708
you are my everything.

389
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,755
The film you co-starred with her
was pulled from release.

390
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,381
How do you feel?

391
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,508
I'm disappointed.

392
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,928
Any message to Miss Kandagawa?

393
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,347
I knew this would happen.

394
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,976
She's always condescending
toward people she works with.

395
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,979
She always had that attitude.

396
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,689
She deserved it.

397
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,275
She had it coming.

398
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,279
That's what you want to hear, right?

399
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:35,034
Many believe Miss Kandagawa
should retire from showbiz.

400
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:39,205
What happened to Shotaro,
the giant salamander,

401
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,749
was very unfortunate.

402
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,542
However...

403
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,170
she's just a 12-year-old child.

404
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,048
The adults around her
refuse to take responsibility.

405
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,051
Why are you ruining
only her career?

406
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,344
I'm against that.

407
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:58,516
Besides, I want
to continue seeing her act.

408
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,184
Are you defending her?

409
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,310
BIKE HITS SHINO

410
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,478
Can you say that...

411
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,938
STITCHES ON HER FACE

412
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,064
to Shotaro?

413
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,941
IS HER ACTING CAREER OVER?

414
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,109
Shino, wait!

415
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,699
Akane, your happiness...

416
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,039
I'm so sorry.

417
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,210
Be happy.

418
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,129
Then...

419
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,883
Then stay with me forever.

420
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,594
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

421
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,768
You're the type that hands it in?

422
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:47,106
I thought you'd leave without notice
or hire someone else to do it--

423
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,524
Goodbye.

424
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:51,944
What's the reason?

425
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,947
The reason?

426
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,367
Because I screwed up the commercial.

427
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,535
Did you?

428
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:02,330
Huh? You said
they called and canceled it.

429
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,582
From the client, yes.

430
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,666
Then--

431
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,878
But only from "the client."

432
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,504
Huh?

433
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,965
What about you?

434
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,427
But I--

435
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,596
Clients care about "the vibe."

436
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,517
Depending on the vibe,
they may pull a 180.

437
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,645
-Vibe?
-Set the vibe...

438
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,065
in your favor.

439
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,778
Ugh, you always lack words.

440
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,321
What do you want?

441
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,573
Redeem yourself...

442
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,825
after 17 years.

443
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,160
Seventeen...

444
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:48,042
Mr. Wada will apologize
at a press conference.

445
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,505
Take what you learned
from your failure

446
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,925
and handle it well.

447
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,804
Miss Miwa Kandagawa.

448
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,191
I humbly and profoundly

449
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,069
apologize for what I've done.

450
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,028
Too pushy.

451
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,032
Sweating and apologizing
are things of the past.

452
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,118
Update yourself. Again.

453
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,996
I'm terribly sorry.

454
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,250
You cannot cry.
The victims want to cry.

455
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,835
You're a bit harsh.

456
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,128
I'll be careful.

457
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,338
-What do I do?
-Sway.

458
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,967
Sway between wanting to apologize
and the fear of doing so.

459
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,301
Like a human.

460
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,303
Sway?

461
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,849
-Stop fooling around!
-Sorry.

462
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,684
Oops, she snapped.

463
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,354
Be serious and apologize.
If you can't keep up with me, leave!

464
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,899
Come back.
I'm not talking to you.

465
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:54,859
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,945
Convey through your eyes,
breath, sweat, and expression.

467
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,573
Express the sway
through non-swaying things.

468
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,367
Does that cross your mind
when acting?

469
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,994
No, my mind's empty.

470
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,871
That's what made her a prodigy.

471
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,290
You all play the reporters.

472
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,332
-Reporters?
-Yes.

473
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,710
Ask extremely rude questions.

474
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,670
I have a question.

475
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,880
Yes, go ahead.

476
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:20,217
You're a no-name, so can we call you
a "self-proclaimed actor, age 58"?

477
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,011
I sound like a criminal.

478
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,306
-You don't earn enough to be an actor.
-That's irrelevant.

479
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,225
-Why is your sneeze so loud?
-That's irrelevant, too.

480
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,101
Excuse me.

481
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,936
Can you guys be serious?

482
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,273
Hey, this isn't the time
to complain to Kohji.

483
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,859
Yeah, ask me decent questions.

484
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,110
No, it's fine.

485
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,779
You have to get grilled
at a public apology.

486
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,949
Accept all questions and complaints
they hurl at you.

487
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,578
Thus, no talking back,
and do not snap!

488
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,371
You must act.

489
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:53,584
You're truly sorry about removing
the designated protected plant.

490
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,922
You're 58-year-old, self-proclaimed actor,
Kohji Wada, acting this role.

491
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,257
"Acting"?

492
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:03,761
Um...

493
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,596
Yes, go ahead.

494
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,598
Don't you need to first apologize

495
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:11,769
to the conservation group members
that you have betrayed?

496
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,818
We sincerely apologize
for the trouble we've caused.

497
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,658
Let me help.

498
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,117
And kill again?

499
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,706
I knew from the start

500
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,918
that you're that child actor.

501
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,921
But I kept quiet.

502
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,299
Besides, it happened 17 years ago.

503
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:45,844
But...

504
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:49,056
you made the same mistake.

505
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,603
What did you learn
from the incident 17 years ago?

506
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,653
I learned how immature I was.

507
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,739
So, I retired.

508
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,454
I sincerely apologize.

509
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,164
We're truly sorry.

510
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,045
You never change, huh?

511
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,651
Shino?

512
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,906
Everything you do
is still just an act.

513
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,826
What good is that?

514
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,496
How can such a superficial line

515
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,540
reach people's hearts?

516
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,209
Um...

517
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,463
I'm sorry to reveal my identity

518
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,549
after I proposed not to.

519
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:22,274
It was the day after she got backlash
for defending you.

520
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,234
She visited me and said,

521
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,572
she was afraid that
her words may have hurt someone.

522
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,201
Why?

523
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:34,870
She said...

524
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,166
it was to own up
to the mistakes she made.

525
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,630
She has participated
in conservation activities since then.

526
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,682
PRESS CONFERENCE
FOR KOHJI WADA

527
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:57,643
Will reporters even come?

528
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,813
He's facing backlash,
but is a no-name, huh?

529
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,982
We've also invited media
outside the mainstream.

530
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,194
Online media, freelance writers,
and YouTubers.

531
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,987
That's gonna be chaos.

532
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,781
A small crowd is pointless.

533
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,449
I'm nervous...

534
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:14,868
I might cry.

535
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,831
You can cry if it must happen,
but what's the No.1 rule?

536
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,459
Don't snap.

537
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,878
Right. If you snap...

538
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,090
your showbiz career is over.

539
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,681
Own up to your mistakes...

540
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,294
Need your line?

541
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,854
If the need arises.

542
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,703
We will now begin
Kohji Wada's press conference.

543
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,172
Due to my negligence,

544
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:55,219
I destroyed the nigorigoke,
a designated protected plant.

545
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,180
I deeply apologize.

546
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,306
I'm truly sorry.

547
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,729
I participated in the cleanup
of a protected area

548
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,106
with members
of a conservation group.

549
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:13,153
Mr. Midoriyama explained
that the nigorigoke

550
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:17,616
is a designated protected plant
and must not be removed.

551
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,536
He explained to us beforehand.

552
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:22,871
However...

553
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,499
I'm ashamed to say...

554
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,128
I was talking during his explanation.

555
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:35,592
I began the cleanup
without understanding the precautions.

556
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,388
As a result,
I committed a serious mistake.

557
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,934
I deeply apologize for my actions.

558
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:51,900
I'd now like
to open the floor for questions.

559
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,570
Miwa Kandagawa was there, right?

560
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,284
Yes, she accompanied me
as my manager--

561
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:06,081
Was it as atonement for her past
of killing that giant salamander?

562
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,836
I'm sorry, I don't have
the details about Miss Kandagawa--

563
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,506
If it wasn't, it would be disrespectful
for her to be there.

564
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,259
You're absolutely right.

565
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,553
I apologize
for the lack of consideration--

566
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,139
All you say is, "I apologize."

567
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,516
You think you can
get away with that?

568
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,936
That's not my intention.

569
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,188
Is Miwa Kandagawa here today?

570
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,359
I apologize.

571
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,490
If you go now,
Kohji's effort will go to waste.

572
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,576
I deeply apologize.

573
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,995
His acting is superb.

574
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,581
The way he keeps apologizing.

575
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:49,625
I apologize.

576
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:53,754
Acting...

577
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,467
-Excuse me.
-You in the second row.

578
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,555
Mr. Wada, you are being managed
by Miwa Kandagawa.

579
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,432
So, how is it?

580
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,353
What do you mean, "how"?

581
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,813
She snuck around using an alias.

582
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,192
How can she possibly
be a decent manager?

583
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,030
And she even got herself
a celebrity boyfriend.

584
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,575
It proves that she was doing it
as a part-time gig, right?

585
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:24,785
Part-time gig?

586
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,454
You and your colleagues
are being fooled by her.

587
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:32,000
She did have an extraordinary talent
when it came to acting.

588
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,544
-Um...
-I wanna be in showbiz too.

589
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,674
After making a fool of yourself
and causing so much trouble,

590
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:42,511
you can make a comeback
to flirt and mess around.

591
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,517
You're absolutely wrong!

592
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,649
What do you know about her?

593
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,777
Not that I know much...

594
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,195
But still...

595
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:05,701
Working as if it's part-time
and messing around?

596
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,954
That's not
the Miwa Kandagawa I know.

597
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,124
That's not Michiko Sumidagawa!

598
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,209
Please calm down--

599
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,128
She's foul-mouthed and hits people.

600
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,963
She can be a mess.

601
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,214
But we...

602
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,591
well, at least myself.

603
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,554
I have never felt
that she fooled us!

604
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,557
After I told you not to snap.

605
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,477
The press conference will end--

606
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,063
Miss Miwa Kandagawa, talk to us.

607
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,398
You're obligated to.

608
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,483
She's not obligated to!

609
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,195
No, let go.

610
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,282
Running away, Miss Kandagawa?

611
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:46,867
Are you running away?

612
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,244
Come back!

613
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,224
Say something,
Miss Miwa Kandagawa.

614
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,393
Please talk to us.

615
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,479
Can you explain?

616
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,734
I used an alias.

617
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,072
I concealed my real name
and lied to many people.

618
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,660
I have people
who still have faith in me.

619
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,748
I'm truly sorry
for what I've done.

620
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,126
What about what happened
17 years ago?

621
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,961
That's right!

622
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,547
At the time,
you didn't feel remorse at all.

623
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,341
What about now?

624
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,134
Answer him.

625
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:50,388
Are you trying to get away
with another fake-tear apology?

626
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,352
Say something.

627
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,841
How can such a superficial line
reach people's hearts?

628
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:58,832
I hurt the feelings
of everybody who loved Shotaro

629
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:04,671
and everybody who
cared for the nigorigoke.

630
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,799
I hurt them deeply.

631
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,761
I sincerely apologize.

632
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,223
That's the same as 17 years ago.

633
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,269
The thing is,
we can't believe a word you say.

634
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:24,900
Miss Kandagawa, do you really
feel remorse for what you did?

635
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,818
Answer him.

636
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,030
Do I feel remorse?

637
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,244
Not yet.

638
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,665
You haven't changed a bit
since you were a kid.

639
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,294
I bet you wanna say,
"Did I do something THAT bad?"

640
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,338
That's the person you are.

641
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,964
I still don't...

642
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,469
fully understand
the extent of my mistakes.

643
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:58,642
I had been... running away
from owning up to my mistakes.

644
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:00,977
That's why...

645
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,689
If I say "I feel remorse" now,

646
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,983
that would be a lie.

647
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,656
Firstly, I must
own up to my mistakes

648
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,867
and truly understand
what I had done.

649
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:21,039
Please give me the opportunity
to show remorse after that.

650
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,458
You're not making sense.

651
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,211
What do you mean
you don't feel remorse?

652
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,256
She doesn't feel remorse.

653
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,637
You're out of your mind.

654
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,305
Come back!

655
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,766
This isn't over!

656
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,573
Let's call it a day.

657
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:56,825
Okay.

658
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,622
My back's killing me.

659
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,091
How pathetic.

660
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,176
Are you sure you're young?

661
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,597
Do you have a middle-aged body?

662
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,934
What do you expect?
I withdrew from society for 17 years.

663
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:24,686
I see.

664
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,023
Why did you make me a manager?

665
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,864
Because your little sister said,
she couldn't pay off the debt.

666
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,494
Tell me.

667
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,205
How much of this
was part of your plan?

668
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,334
What do you mean?

669
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,086
Was it to...

670
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,089
make me face my past?

671
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:29,876
Why?

672
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,504
I rode a shooting star from France.

673
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,010
That made me happy
and cringe at the same time.

674
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,597
I thought it was this weekend.

675
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:45,558
A star can transcend time.

676
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,603
Let's see if you can
keep up with my speed.

677
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,773
That's more like
the final boss in manga than a star.

678
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,029
I was worried,
but you seem to be alright.

679
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,408
No time to feel down...

680
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:05,954
until I get Shino back into acting.

681
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,632
Did you meet Yuji?

682
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,093
Ms. Kawashima, why...

683
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,887
You better watch out.

684
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,558
You're gonna get blindsided...

685
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:28,518
by Saigawa.

686
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,107
He's annoying, and
I can't understand him at all, but...

687
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,860
he's coming face-to-face with me.

688
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:40,655
He completely brainwashed you.

689
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,157
No, I'm not--

690
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:43,283
Did you know?

691
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,453
The person who leaked your past...

692
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,080
is Saigawa.
