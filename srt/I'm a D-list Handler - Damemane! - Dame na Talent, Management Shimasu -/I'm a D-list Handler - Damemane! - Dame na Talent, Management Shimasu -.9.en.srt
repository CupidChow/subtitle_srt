1
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,590
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,301
No matter how many times
I do it, it's not enough.

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,470
What are you tsk-tsk'ing about?

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,680
You, obviously!

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,099
-Why do you look so nonchalant?
-Me?

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,352
What were you thinking,
telling everyone I'm Miwa Kandagawa?

7
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,105
Did you glitch? Lose your marbles?
You've gone too far!

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,732
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,067
My apologies. Let me explain.

10
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,819
Yeah, it better be good.

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,239
When printing business cards,
it seems I made a mistake.

12
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:33,784
They're not for Michiko Sumidagawa,
but Miwa Kandagawa.

13
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,370
-Huh?
-What to do? What a waste.

14
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,580
Oh, that's right!

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,333
We'll just tell the world that you're
Miwa Kandagawa, no problem.

16
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,461
What are you saying?
Just fix the cards!

17
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,628
-However...
-What?

18
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:49,133
because they learned who you were,
the press conference was a success.

19
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,177
How? It was chaos!

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,220
A storm of criticism and panic!

21
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,599
Anyway, New-Newbie Manager,
Miwa Kandagawa.

22
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,268
-Congratulations.
-Yeah, right. Also,

23
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,103
you don't need to say "new" twice.

24
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,315
It's a fresh start! Are you ready?

25
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,066
And...

26
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,735
action!

27
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,236
Damn it!

28
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:13,032
Everyone, listen to this...

29
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,035
-Saigawa...
-Please listen!

30
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,454
Whoa, what? This is freaky.

31
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,122
Give us work...

32
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,583
Give us something to do...

33
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,668
We can't even stuff envelopes...

34
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,087
Our internal tasks are all gone...

35
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,923
What's going on here?

36
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,801
Because of all the scandals
at Toyo Production,

37
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,762
Dept. 4 has lost all work.

38
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,056
That's why they're like zombies?

39
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,810
Yes, we produced zombies
with nothing to do.

40
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:45,105
I don't care if it's meaningful or not.
Give us something to do...

41
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,982
This is bad. It smells like death.

42
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,275
Save me!

43
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,985
Snap out of it!

44
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,822
Ow, ow!

45
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,699
I still have flesh that feels pain.

46
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,494
I still have flesh!

47
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,871
-Ouch...
-Okay.

48
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,707
I'll get us some work.

49
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,876
Our goddess!

50
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,337
Thank you!

51
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,755
Stop that.

52
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,049
Santa's going to help too!

53
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,760
There's a god over there too!

54
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,554
Hey!

55
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,018
Your savior's over there!
The holy land is there!

56
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,105
What's so funny?!

57
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,233
Someone's pulling off my pants!

58
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,486
Hey!

59
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,988
Wait!

60
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,239
Hey!

61
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,537
Excuse me, what're you doing?

62
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,664
Hey!

63
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,417
This isn't a place for kids.

64
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,879
Suddenly snap-snapping
all those photos!

65
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:55,092
Are you a YouTuber
here to document the tragedies of Toyo?

66
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,677
Why're you here?

67
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,598
-Excuse me.
-Hey, wait right there!

68
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,476
Man, all these shady people
showing up!

69
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,900
Mr. Saigawa, right?

70
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,530
If you want to be a talent,
apply from our homepage.

71
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,407
You know Shino Asakura...

72
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,117
right?

73
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:21,785
Yes.

74
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,996
Nice to meet you, Dad.

75
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,581
I'm Rin Asakura.

76
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,883
We're from Toyo Production--

77
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,803
We're not working
with Toyo right now. Sorry.

78
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,182
Is there something we can do?
We'll do anything.

79
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,350
Do you have auditions?

80
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,726
It's them, Toyo.

81
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,852
"It's them"?

82
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,063
Show yourselves out.

83
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,566
Ugh!

84
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,861
The backlash is worse than I thought.

85
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,697
They won't even listen to us.

86
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,783
It's time.

87
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,205
Time for you to watch my back
once again.

88
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,165
Please!

89
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,585
Time to display the connections
that I've cultivated.

90
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,087
Yes, it has to be now.

91
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,923
Watch my back carefully.

92
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,383
I want to see you sparkle!

93
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,761
With the wings to revive Toyo,
the phoenix!

94
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,221
Fwoosh!

95
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,306
I can see the wings!

96
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,309
The golden wings that will save the day!

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,477
-Flap!
-Wow!

98
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,105
-Flap!
-Amazing!

99
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,815
-See them?
-Yes!

100
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,191
-Alright!
-I see them!

101
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,401
Ready?

102
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,485
Let's do this.

103
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,904
Alright, it's settled!

104
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,614
Let's get stupid drunk again!

105
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,616
Bye!

106
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,410
Mr. Ishihara!

107
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,538
-How're things?
-It's them! The scandalous Toyo!

108
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,749
Toyo here, going up in flames!

109
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't say that yourself!

110
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,586
This is promising.

111
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,713
Oh? Miss Shimantogawa?

112
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,632
No, it's Sumidagawa!
Well, Kandagawa.

113
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,843
-You were working under an alias.
-Sorry.

114
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,928
What's more,
you're Yuji's girl, huh?

115
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:45,888
Well, I wouldn't...

116
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,140
That's fine, isn't it?

117
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,767
That's not something to let slide.

118
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,019
It's hard for me, too!

119
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,480
Since I can't give you any work.

120
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,481
But...?

121
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,524
-I can't.
-Can't wait?

122
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,943
-No, no.
-Our future office chief!

123
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,779
I said, I can't!

124
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,697
Seriously?!

125
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,241
-Can't you tell when I'm serious?
-Sorry.

126
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,744
When you quit comedy,
did that sensor get busted?

127
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,789
Give me a break!

128
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,791
Heyo!

129
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,753
The phoenix's wings
are completely broken.

130
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:18,879
Am I crying?

131
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,714
Just barely okay.

132
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,967
But you look like you'll
burst into tears from one kind word.

133
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,472
Ah... you're crying. Here.

134
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,897
Be nicer.

135
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,482
Are you okay?

136
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,568
Quit laughing!

137
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,740
Hey, well? Am I cute?

138
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,328
Are you feeling real
electricity right now?

139
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,334
Who knew...

140
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,003
that Shino had a daughter.

141
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,633
-She married?
-Single mother.

142
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,263
-How old are you?
-16 this year.

143
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,100
-Date of birth.
-September 1, 2009.

144
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,858
-Blood type?
-A.

145
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,318
How many questions
do I have to answer?

146
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,695
You're my dad.

147
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,413
What a mess!

148
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,583
Is that something to say
when meeting your daughter?

149
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,253
I wanted to see what kind of man
my mom had fallen for.

150
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,340
Was that of...
your own volition?

151
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,509
Can you stop speaking so formally?

152
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,637
-Papa!
-Don't call me that!

153
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,190
Anyway, about you coming to see me.

154
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,735
Does Shino know?

155
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,403
Yup, sure does.

156
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,366
-I see.
-Yup.

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,120
What did she say?

158
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,332
"Why don't you see for yourself?"
Like that.

159
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,342
Yuji Sanada. That's you, right?

160
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,065
No need for such a scary face.

161
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,110
Consider this a chance.

162
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:49,947
"Chance"?

163
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,824
To tell everyone the truth.

164
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,454
If we put your words into the papers,

165
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,540
I'm sure everyone will believe you.

166
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,296
How long have you been seeing
Miss Kandagawa?

167
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,506
Uh, no...

168
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,511
We're not... seeing each other.

169
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,975
It's true that I have feelings for her.
But...

170
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,644
We're not dating.

171
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:22,729
So...

172
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,690
we're not a couple.

173
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,278
So it's... the best
kind of relationship for both of you.

174
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:30,821
I see.

175
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,781
Are we finished?

176
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:36,868
Excuse me.

177
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,634
What the heck is this story?

178
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,929
"Denies relationship, confirms
feelings. A convenient romance"?

179
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,181
Yuji would never
say something like that.

180
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,642
It's just another stupid
weekly gossip article.

181
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:01,643
No way.

182
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,603
There has to be a fire for smoke.

183
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:08,108
Maybe his true feelings
are slipping out?

184
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,861
Ouch! That's hot!

185
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,612
Is there smoke?
Without a fire?

186
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,656
-It burns!
-Let's lighten the mood.

187
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,451
How about some nice
pork cutlet bowls?

188
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,453
-My treat.
-Says the penniless old man.

189
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,287
I have money.

190
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,582
Did you know about this interview?

191
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,876
No, he didn't tell me.

192
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,055
I am so sorry!

193
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,099
Yes, we've already deleted the post.

194
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,434
Yes.

195
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,395
Did something happen?

196
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,317
Well, in a photo we posted
onto social media,

197
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,986
a rival sponsor's logo
was in the back.

198
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,784
This small thing here?

199
00:10:58,909 --> 00:10:59,785
Yeah.

200
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,538
I wasn't paying enough attention.

201
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,585
If... there's anything I can do,
please tell me.

202
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,171
Thanks, as always.

203
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,093
I always left everything to Reiko.

204
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,514
Do you want her to come back?

205
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,521
-I'm sorry, that was a weird question.
-It's fine.

206
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,819
Yuji, it was my carelessness.
I'm terribly sorry.

207
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,155
And I didn't check, either.
Let's be careful next time.

208
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,742
Stars can switch gears
at the speed of light.

209
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,744
They have to keep shining.

210
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,539
-Thank you so much.
-Don't apologize.

211
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,750
Saki, time to change.

212
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,502
-Okay.
-Good luck!

213
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,385
Huh, so you use those
"star" lines on anyone.

214
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,054
-Miss Kandagawa.
-I guess stars are nice to everyone.

215
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,516
Hold on a second.
I feel like I'm being stabbed.

216
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,892
With a star's pointy bit.

217
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,478
If that's how you feel,
then it's probably true.

218
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,605
Ouch! What?
I'm being stabbed with stars.

219
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,524
You could've said something to me.

220
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,278
I guess there's no need
to consult with a convenient woman.

221
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,488
Hold on a second.

222
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,080
MIWA IS A CONVENIENT WOMAN

223
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,248
What the...

224
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,751
This is the biggest crisis
since our founding.

225
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,795
You don't have to tell me that.

226
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,213
Look at this.

227
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,341
My Beloved Child.

228
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,511
Ms. Kawashima worked
to put on this play at Toyo.

229
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,181
-My Beloved Child.
-I know.

230
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,766
I know. I was really
looking forward to it.

231
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,810
We'll aim for a comeback with this.

232
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,688
We can try, but don't we need
Ms. Kawashima back?

233
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,232
You'll be the producer.

234
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,902
What? I've never--

235
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,779
"I've never done it," right?

236
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,325
Hasn't this job been full
of things you've never done?

237
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
Ah, I see!

238
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,954
Are you backing down now?

239
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,082
What?!

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,834
That's it.

241
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,505
Use that anger to put on this play.

242
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,383
If this play doesn't go on,
we'll go bankrupt.

243
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,261
The agency is in your hands.

244
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,180
Congratulations.

245
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,015
This is messed up.

246
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,851
But I'll do it!
If it's My Beloved Child!

247
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,728
And? The lead?

248
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,647
TOMIKO TSURUTA

249
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,274
Not Shino.

250
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:37,692
That's sad.

251
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,819
She retired from acting
a long time ago.

252
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,032
Ms. Tsuruta will bring in
a large crowd.

253
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,451
She's scheduled to transfer
to our agency.

254
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,329
Ms. Kawashima scouted her
from another agency.

255
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,791
You must follow through
with her wishes.

256
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,961
-Any questions?
-Plenty!

257
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,922
But... I'll be the producer.
I'll do anything!

258
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,591
P-P-P...

259
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,051
It's no good!

260
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:10,934
And...

261
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,688
action.

262
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:21,903
What's wrong?

263
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,449
My Beautiful Child
might be able to save us!

264
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,121
We need an explanation!
Your enthusiasm is too much!

265
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,374
Can you stop yelling for a sec?

266
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,044
Don't take it out on me!

267
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,590
I'm nothing more than a decaying,
dried up mummy.

268
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,553
This is the start of our comeback!
My Beloved Child!

269
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,471
Do you mean the drama?

270
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,349
The one from 20 years ago?
How nostalgic!

271
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,727
Gen-Z, here. I don't follow.

272
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,270
You've never seen it?

273
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,689
-Your whole life is a waste!
-For real?

274
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,815
I've seen a clip!

275
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,650
Not good enough!
Watch sitting seiza!

276
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,485
The drama starring Shino Asakura.

277
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,323
A mother and child, not related by blood,
and a tale of transcending love.

278
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,408
Don't explain it so simply!

279
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,704
Y'know, that drama is affection,
pathos, suffering, love...

280
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,122
It has everything!

281
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,916
And the lead actress Shino
is especially fantastic.

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,462
I was so inspired by her performance
that I became a child actor!

283
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,135
You're really packed full of feelings,
aren't you?

284
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,803
They're overflowing!

285
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,847
And how will this turn things around?

286
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,849
If we pull it off
and our image improves,

287
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,143
the tide will turn
for Toyo Production.

288
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,103
Let's do it!

289
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,929
Have you been here
since you retired?

290
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,267
I'm surrounded by nature.

291
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,853
It's a nice, tranquil place.

292
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,034
Everything was my fault.

293
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,206
It was my lack of virtue.

294
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,376
My deepest...

295
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,254
and sincerest apologies.

296
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,097
I'm so glad you're finally here.

297
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,601
I always knew you'd look for me.

298
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,189
Did you think I'd say that?

299
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,609
Stop it.

300
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,488
Could you stop trying to shoulder
someone else's life?

301
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,912
What should we do?

302
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,082
I'll continue living my life.

303
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,337
Don't you want to be
on the stage again?

304
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,423
I haven't considered it once.

305
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,508
Even if there was a role
just for you?

306
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,468
Hey.

307
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,596
Did you come out here
just to ask that?

308
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,811
About the child...

309
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,566
why didn't you say anything
about her?

310
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,280
-Perhaps, because of me--
-Is that...

311
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,658
another Saigawa scenario?

312
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,832
I just chose my own path.

313
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,879
Don't you understand that
more than anyone else?

314
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,933
MIWA KANDAGAWA

315
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,526
Akane...

316
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,487
you are my everything.

317
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,324
So why does it have to be like this?

318
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,743
Why?

319
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,830
Hey.

320
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,498
Can you try wearing earbuds?

321
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,209
Sis!

322
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,129
Why are you ruining
only her career?

323
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,339
I'm against that.

324
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,715
SHINO HIT BY BIKE

325
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,467
I want to continue seeing her act.

326
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,469
STITCHES ON HER FACE
IS HER ACTING CAREER OVER?

327
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,847
If it weren't for that,
she'd be in this play.

328
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,977
Sis, aren't you getting too tense?

329
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,564
Wow! You're too stiff!

330
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,691
I can handle this.

331
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,734
I can handle this.

332
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,575
I'm Miwa Kandagawa.
I'll be working as producer from today.

333
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,868
Nice to meet you.

334
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,331
Isn't there a rehearsal?

335
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,210
Is no one coming today?

336
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,629
The actors are all gone.

337
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,381
The sponsor backed out.

338
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,301
-What?
-They did?

339
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,928
The lead said she resigned
and left too.

340
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,600
Romance within the agency
and brainwashing by the former producer.

341
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,602
It doesn't look good.

342
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,563
But she will be the new producer.

343
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,064
She is the problem.

344
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,234
No way...

345
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,696
The sponsor pulling out
at this stage is bad.

346
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,282
Santa, cheer me up.

347
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,034
Okay.

348
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,203
Go!

349
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,623
Go!

350
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,418
Kandagawa!

351
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,545
No, something's off.

352
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,172
You're the one who told me to.

353
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,341
Can you make it more star-like?

354
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,593
"Star-like"?
What does that even mean?

355
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,554
Never mind.

356
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,986
Yeesh.

357
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,948
Who told you to cut off the sponsor?

358
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,241
I didn't, they did.

359
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,994
Isn't it a producer's job
to do something about it?

360
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,584
How do you plan to
pull off this play?

361
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,920
And the lead stepped down too.

362
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,755
It was the natural outcome.

363
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,632
Here's a new mission.

364
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,219
First, find a new lead
who can start right away.

365
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,680
Huh? With only ten days to go?

366
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,932
No way, no way.
Can't we change the date?

367
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,183
"No way, no way."

368
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,935
The venue was booked a year ago.

369
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,145
-Crap.
-There's no time for foul language.

370
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,315
There's a play for that classic,
My Beloved Child.

371
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,443
The performance is in ten days...

372
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,029
I see. Thank you very much.

373
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,491
I understand. Goodbye.

374
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,077
We don't have a lead anymore?

375
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,871
Yes, and now we're searching
everywhere.

376
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,208
"I will.... raise this child
by my lonesome."

377
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,627
-What are you saying?
-Lines from the drama.

378
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,506
You've gotta lean in and commit.

379
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,717
If you wanna be the lead,
you need to show it.

380
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,593
Fine, I'll be the one to say it.

381
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,430
Make Masae the lead!

382
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,016
Absolutely not! The lead?

383
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,518
She can't draw a crowd
or lose the accent.

384
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,604
If Masae's the lead,
My Beloved Child will become a comedy!

385
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,690
My once-in-a-lifetime chance, gone.

386
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,028
Calm down!

387
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,863
Ripping it up won't solve anything!

388
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,573
My bedding!

389
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,658
That won't fix anything!

390
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,660
I just need to hit something!

391
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,537
Can someone be a punching bag?

392
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,205
Who would agree to that?!

393
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,583
I'll give you a minute.
One hit, 500 yen.

394
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,127
But it doesn't mean
your punches will land.

395
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,714
Stop trying to start
a punching business!

396
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,840
He's all beat up!

397
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,093
Stop!

398
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,678
Stop!

399
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:30,183
We need to talk to someone
who knows what's going on!

400
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,517
Mr. Saigawa?

401
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,644
He's just an arrogant old fart.

402
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,645
How about Ms. Reiko?

403
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:38,399
-Ms. Kawashima?
-You may have the worst relationship,

404
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,152
but I think we need to rely
on her skills.

405
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,862
Right now she and I are--

406
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,364
This is not the time
for personal feelings!

407
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,825
In that case, you go!

408
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,745
-Why me?
-You go!

409
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,333
-Heave, ho!
-What're you talking about?

410
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,418
-Men do the yelling.
-Heave, ho!

411
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,504
-Ow, ow, ow!
-Heave!

412
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,798
My arms will come off!

413
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,855
I have to go to the bathroom.

414
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,278
The sponsor backed out
and the lead stepped down.

415
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,698
What's so funny?

416
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,744
You took away Yuji and this play,

417
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,579
and now you want sympathy?

418
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,332
-What?
-We didn't come here to fight.

419
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,503
This.... this manipulative manager!

420
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,215
That term was plastered
all over the internet.

421
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,593
Can't you speak
using your own words?

422
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,223
Ugh, this jerk! Idiot!

423
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,184
There are customers around.
Calm down--

424
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,102
Oh, my.

425
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,688
Did your vocabulary shrink as well?

426
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,357
-Anyway.
-What?

427
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,900
Do you love My Beloved Child?

428
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:07,321
-What?
-Or did you choose this just for business?

429
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,739
That's enough. Cool it.

430
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,325
Of course I love it!

431
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:16,122
Do you have any idea how many years
I've been planning this for?

432
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:21,127
And for some troublemaking girl
to become the producer?

433
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,712
Don't make me laugh.

434
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,548
Okay, please tell me.

435
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,259
With all that effort,
why isn't Shino the lead?

436
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,137
Of course I want her to be the lead!

437
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,055
-Huh?
-But you know,

438
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:37,185
I can't persuade an actress
who retired a long time ago!

439
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,521
So you've given up?

440
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:45,109
I haven't. I still hope
she'll be the lead.

441
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,156
-That's it.
-Huh?

442
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,825
Let's have her be the lead!

443
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,871
Just try it. Then I'll come watch.

444
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,790
Let's do it! What a great idea!

445
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:03,419
Look at you, thinking this up
at this stage.

446
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,838
You're the one who paved the way!

447
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,174
-You're not so bad!
-No, you!

448
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,635
-You're amazing even at your age!
-You're amazing!

449
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,471
This isn't a fight anymore, right?!

450
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,311
By the way,

451
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:24,273
It seems like Yuji's
having a hard time now.

452
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,651
Probably because you're not there.

453
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,034
Oh, it's the YouTuber again.

454
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,577
I'm not.

455
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,372
Someone who helped my mom
is here.

456
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,082
Your mom?

457
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:42,708
Shino Asakura.

458
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,336
What?!

459
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,174
-"Asakura"?
-Shino Asakura.

460
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,678
No freaking way.

461
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,930
-Shino Asakura.
-Impossible.

462
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,266
I'm Shino's daughter, Rin Asakura.

463
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:00,893
Really?

464
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,270
Really really?

465
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,480
She has a daughter?

466
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,983
She prefers not to make things public.

467
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,072
You're Miwa Kandagawa, right?

468
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,117
Mom's told me all about you.

469
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,576
Huh?

470
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:24,458
It's my fault all that happened to you.

471
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,086
I'm so sorry.

472
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:35,553
I've regretted it for 17 years.

473
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,726
That you quit being an actress
because you defended me.

474
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,856
It's been so long,
I've forgotten all about it.

475
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,274
I'll never forget.

476
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,901
So many times,

477
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,697
your performance in My Beloved Child
lifted my spirits.

478
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,242
You gave me courage.
That's why...

479
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,369
This time, I'll...

480
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,708
You will...?

481
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,211
What can you do for me?

482
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,051
I'll...

483
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,636
-I'll get you on stage.
-No.

484
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,848
Is that all?

485
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,516
It's not just any play.

486
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,185
It's My Beloved Child.

487
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,396
But it's in eight days...

488
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,359
But if we can pull this off
in such a short time,

489
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,235
and get you back into acting--

490
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,445
What a mess.

491
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,574
You never change.

492
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,829
Anyway, I'm not gonna do it.

493
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:44,997
Go home.

494
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,003
I wonder if she still likes acting?

495
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,588
I know she does!

496
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,550
I'll try to persuade her
one more time.

497
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,350
Miss Kandagawa, you're just like
how Mom described you.

498
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,397
Reckless but honest.
Stays true to herself.

499
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,985
It must have seemed too sudden.

500
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,405
But we heard about it before.

501
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,491
Huh? You knew about the play?

502
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,743
-My dad came.
-Dad?

503
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,328
-Mr. Saigawa.
-Saigawa?

504
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,500
What?!

505
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:33,546
Tell me what's going on.

506
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,800
How much do you know?

507
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,803
That you're Rin's father.

508
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,598
17 years ago, when that mess happened.

509
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,809
What happened between you and Shino?

510
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,188
She defended you...

511
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,816
and became emotionally drained.

512
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:56,986
Back then, I...

513
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,574
I wanted to support her.

514
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,536
But as you know,

515
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,997
romance between stars
and managers is forbidden.

516
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,916
What's more, at the time,

517
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,044
backlash was even harsher
than it is today.

518
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,590
So...

519
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,092
just once.

520
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,096
After a while,

521
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,601
her face was injured,
and she retired.

522
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,190
And Rin?

523
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,525
Without a message.

524
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,529
Without a word.

525
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,783
She disappeared.

526
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,036
"Disappeared"?

527
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,540
So she shouldered everything
by herself?

528
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,255
That's how she is.

529
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,680
Cinderella!

530
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,807
I'm not in the mood right now.

531
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,228
Like a star twinkling
in the night sky,

532
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,647
this star has arrived
to shine only on you.

533
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,566
It's not night yet.
I've had enough of that talk.

534
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,569
I'm sorry.

535
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,072
That I did that.

536
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,326
But, words like "convenient,"

537
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,870
and "no romantic feelings..."

538
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,290
-Those were all lies.
-I know that.

539
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:41,257
Now that I think about it,
I don't know a thing about you.

540
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,010
What you like, what you hate,

541
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,137
what makes you laugh,
what makes you cry.

542
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,472
I don't know anything.

543
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,393
Even though you ran your mouth
to that stupid reporter,

544
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,229
you never consult with me.

545
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,692
What are we, anyway?

546
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,278
An unfulfilled love is too hard.

547
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,990
This is so annoying.

548
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,034
And I hate when I'm like this.

549
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,787
-I just want to ugh!
-Don't "ugh!"

550
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,123
Well, you can if you want.

551
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,667
I like that about you, Miwa.

552
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,213
"Miwa"?

553
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,217
Did you just say my name?

554
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,135
Oh...

555
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,804
Is...

556
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:31,515
that bad?

557
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,353
Hmm...

558
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,355
No honorifics, huh?

559
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,482
Think you're above me?

560
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,359
Wait, that part?

561
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,069
Okay, fine. How about,

562
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,070
"my Miwa"?

563
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:46,530
"Lady Miwa"?

564
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:47,990
Which one?

565
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,783
Just "Miwa" is fine.

566
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,744
Okay.

567
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,746
"Miwa" it is.

568
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,256
Same here.

569
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,092
I want to know more about you.

570
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,721
And face lots of things together.

571
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,473
Let's open our hearts.

572
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,393
"Hearts."

573
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,650
But won't we fight
and hurt each other?

574
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,570
Even if we hurt each other
or argue,

575
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,364
I'll be okay.

576
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,452
Okay.

577
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,829
But it'll be hard for you.

578
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,581
You too.

579
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:42,711
A star's heart radiates
dangerous rays of light.

580
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,463
You'll need sunglasses.

581
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,131
The cringe, it hurts!

582
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:49,385
-That's fine too.
-Now you're being too honest.

583
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,099
-Hey, Yuji.
-Hm?

584
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,145
Just because you're a star,
don't disappear on me, okay?

585
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,983
I won't.

586
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,111
What's wrong?

587
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,864
Nothing. It's fine.

588
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,295
Thanks for making this for me.

589
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,296
I'm not.

590
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,134
-Huh?
-These are for me and Shino.

591
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,761
Seriously? What about mine?

592
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,973
I'm pouring my love into
Shino's bento now. Be quiet.

593
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,394
Hey, stop it!

594
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,729
It's a bit salty.

595
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:42,730
It's a sausage!

596
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,565
-Salty.
-Shut up!

597
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,734
I'm busy here! Stop it!

598
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,363
Shino!

599
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,076
You again?

600
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,204
I told you, I won't be in the play.

601
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,832
I came to talk with you.

602
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,625
There's nothing to talk about.

603
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:05,627
I'll help you!

604
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,547
Help?

605
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,468
I've come prepared.

606
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,185
Hey!

607
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,604
You're not getting
all of the weeds!

608
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,022
I've got most of them!

609
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,275
There's still some left here, look!

610
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,738
You need to clear this out perfectly.

611
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,364
Half-done is not an option.

612
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,282
Yes, ma'am.

613
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:38,368
You're a perfectionist, aren't you?

614
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:42,414
Rather than being a perfectionist...
isn't that how work is?

615
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,334
Oof.

616
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,086
It's stuck!

617
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,047
Oof!

618
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:51,590
I got it!

619
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,426
Shino! Look how big it is!

620
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:00,849
Wow!

621
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,851
Thanks for the food.

622
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,230
It's good.

623
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,731
I'm glad.

624
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:15,447
Shino... can I ask you a question?

625
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:16,740
What is it?

626
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,409
Rin is...

627
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,246
Mr. Saigawa's daughter, right?

628
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,837
What will you do with the answer?

629
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,592
Haven't you had enough?

630
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,428
Of putting life on hold
for someone else.

631
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,140
Just live doing
what you want to do.

632
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,602
-What?
-It was for Mr. Saigawa, right?

633
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,564
You didn't want to
damage his career,

634
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,482
so you've held back, right?

635
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,441
Hold on.

636
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,027
What did he tell you?

637
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,907
Er... nothing.

638
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,206
Jeez.

639
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,544
Why do I have to keep
repeating myself?

640
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:15,090
Neither of you had anything to do
with my retirement.

641
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,677
Shinichiro.

642
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,681
Could you please stop fantasizing?

643
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,851
You've always been like this.

644
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:30,564
Dreaming up scenarios
and drowning in them.

645
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,776
Don't push those delusions onto me.

646
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,195
This is my life.

647
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,328
To actors, knowing when to quit
is more important than anything.

648
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,456
To me...

649
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,000
that was the right time.

650
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,794
Nothing more or less to it.

651
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,256
-Got it?
-Please wait.

652
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,299
Wait.

653
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,386
You still love acting, don't you?

654
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,348
Rin told me.

655
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,018
Let's do the play.

656
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,604
Nothing's holding you back, now.

657
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:11,813
Shino.

658
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:13,982
Rin!

659
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,111
Mom always needs to be at 100%.

660
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,992
If she's not at 100%...
she won't accept it.

661
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:30,499
That's right.

662
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,920
It's as she says.

663
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,547
I can no longer...

664
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,177
act in a way that will satisfy me.

665
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,723
No one needs this Shino Asakura.

666
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,227
You haven't changed.

667
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,396
Your perfectionism.

668
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,066
But if you rehearse--

669
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,026
What could I possibly do
in six days?

670
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,571
I don't even know if I
could've done it back then.

671
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:05,784
So I can't believe
that I can do it now.

672
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,080
To put on a terrible performance
in front of people...

673
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,541
I'd never forgive myself.

674
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,796
Are you convinced yet?

675
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:22,426
This... is the reason I don't act.

676
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,807
You don't have to be perfect.

677
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,354
There are many people in the world

678
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:38,608
who've lost time from injuries,
childcare, or caregiving.

679
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,029
Isn't it enough to do your best...

680
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:45,282
while protecting
what's important to you?

681
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,703
After I stopped acting,

682
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,706
I was so far from 100%.

683
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,044
Even now as a manager,
I keep making mistakes.

684
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:05,010
But... I realized that 100% is not
something you have to be,

685
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,345
but something you strive for.

686
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,265
While being supported by others,

687
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,560
you keep aiming upwards
from zero, one, or five percent.

688
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,981
The sight of you striving for 100%

689
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,776
is what will move everyone's hearts.

690
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:23,987
Huh.

691
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,617
You've got some nerve to lecture me.

692
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,996
I understand what you're saying.

693
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,665
But I'm different.

694
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,045
I ran for a long time.

695
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,423
For too long.

696
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:50,972
The world isn't so kind
to let you put out good results forever.

697
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,309
You will eventually fade...

698
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,980
and be forced to step down
from the leading role.

699
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,071
I was always looking for that
moment to quit.

700
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,449
A reason to leave.

701
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,411
Then, I finally found it.

702
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,332
Something dear to me.

703
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:29,678
That's why I have no regrets.

704
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,223
Got it?

705
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,351
You don't have any?

706
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,562
-About acting.
-No.

707
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,773
Don't you want to see all the people

708
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,942
who'd love your performance?

709
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,737
I...

710
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,242
I know that I'm not someone
who could convince you.

711
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,452
So...

712
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,372
Please just...

713
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,958
let me tell you.

714
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,252
From the heart.

715
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,299
I...

716
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,177
Miwa Kandagawa.

717
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,724
I can't count all the times
you gave me courage.

718
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,437
Your presence...

719
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,981
and your acting...

720
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,569
They saved me countless times.

721
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,864
Shino Asakura...

722
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,868
changed my life.

723
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,332
I...

724
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,461
I want to see you act one more time.

725
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:49,466
I hope you can save
other people's lives, too.

726
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:57,182
Honestly, I don't even care
about Toyo or the performance.

727
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,061
If you start acting again,
I'll be happy with anything.

728
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:05,732
Just one more time.

729
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,318
One more time...

730
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:11,655
Please let me see you act again.

731
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,494
Please.

732
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,500
Please.

733
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,965
Not bad.

734
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:33,885
Huh?

735
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:38,390
What you didn't have before...

736
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,308
was that.

737
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:43,728
"That..."?

738
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,481
It's there now.

739
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:49,818
Your heart.

740
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,533
Shino.

741
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,331
You've always...

742
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,711
had a good eye for people.

743
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,089
I'll take that as a compliment.

744
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:15,802
Thanks.

745
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,391
Come on, Rin!

746
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,351
Don't just sit there.
Let's go home.

747
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,894
Already?

748
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,586
One, two, three.

749
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:51,629
Everyone, learn from Saki.

750
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,381
There's only five days left!

751
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:54,591
That's not enough.

752
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,345
The rest of the cast is gone.
You are the chosen ones!

753
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,348
This is your chance!
Don't complain, do!

754
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:03,516
We've come this far.
Just gotta do it!

755
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,268
Masae, great attitude!

756
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,479
We still don't have a lead, right?

757
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,564
But we still have to rehearse.

758
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,815
We'll find one.

759
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,693
Until then we'll do all we can
as best as we can.

760
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:16,154
So strict. I wonder
if I can remember this?

761
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,947
Not "can," you "will!"

762
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,699
I've got the gist down.

763
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,034
Yes! That's the spirit!

764
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,797
-Oh, you?
-What's that reaction?

765
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,382
I went to get refreshments.

766
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,967
Then I found her looking for the
rehearsal room.

767
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:39,886
Bow down!

768
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,724
All hail our queen!

769
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,237
Shino.

770
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:58,822
Shino Asakura?

771
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:00,907
It's you!

772
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,202
Shino.

773
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:06,788
Thank you so much!

774
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,624
There's no time, right?

775
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,044
Let's hurry up and start rehearsal.

776
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:15,922
Yes, ma'am!

777
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,596
