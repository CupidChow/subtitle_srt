1
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,298
I...

2
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,094
like you.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,054
Huh?

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:13,431
I always have...

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:15,933
and always will.

6
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:26,736
Uh, I know saying that stuff
is part of your character, but...

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,363
It's... you know... like...

8
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,448
I...

9
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,411
I want you to know more about me.

10
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,913
And I want to know about you.

11
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,252
Uh, you've got the wrong person.

12
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,672
The other day, you said, "Kandagawa."
I'm "Sumidagawa."

13
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,590
I'm not wrong.

14
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:55,347
I uh... bet this is an urgent matter,
so if you'll excuse me.

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,560
Hello? I'll be right there.
I'm on my way. Bye.

16
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,238
Oh, you're here.

17
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,869
Let's toast to the breakup of Villamau.

18
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,663
Cheers!

19
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,290
Giving a toast is weird.

20
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,875
No, it's not.

21
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,003
Santa can now dedicate
his time to being a manager.

22
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:27,463
Sounds great.

23
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,340
A manager suits you way more.

24
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,509
"Way more?" That much?

25
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,345
Hey, you're too straightforward.

26
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,057
Michiko, drink up.
There's a ton in the office.

27
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,020
Oh, take a look at this.

28
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,024
You get one per six packs of beer.
I'll give you one.

29
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,822
Ah! Darn it!

30
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,617
Atta girl!

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,369
Hey, Princess Chugger.

32
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,497
Question!
Can managers date talents?

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,624
Wait, with me?

34
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,377
Never. It was
in an old movie I saw yesterday.

35
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,545
The heck?

36
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,547
It depends on the agency,
but not here.

37
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,716
Darn it.
Michiko, love has obstacles, huh?

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,510
Shut up, you grinning four-eyes.

39
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,346
Princess, you should
slow down and drink.

40
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,348
I'll drink at my own pace!

41
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,267
I'll snap your overalls.

42
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,103
You'll wear out the elastic.

43
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:28,190
I hate to put it like this,
but our talents are like our products.

44
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,443
An employee mustn't
hook up and depreciate them.

45
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,281
When a talent gets engaged,
the sales of their merch drop sharply.

46
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,951
When you pay, you can't help
imagining their spouse's face.

47
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,828
What if they find out you're dating?

48
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,788
Managers are fired on the spot.

49
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,298
What are you doing?

50
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,675
That's it.
I'm not getting fired.

51
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,093
Huh? You might get fired?

52
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,096
I said I'm fine.
I said I won't get fired.

53
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,472
I won't see him anymore.

54
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:01,849
What is this about?

55
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,018
If I don't see him,
I can brush it away.

56
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,855
So I'll dodge him.
I'll keep dodging him forever.

57
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,106
Are you listening?

58
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,109
There's something
I need to do as a manager.

59
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,112
I must repay my debt.

60
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,710
Sorry, you have
a shoot on Sunday.

61
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,129
-Alright.
-I'll make it up.

62
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,839
OK. If you'll excuse me.

63
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:36,842
Oh...

64
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,843
Dude, don't startle me like that!

65
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,514
Miss Sumidagawa,
there's been backlash.

66
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,684
Huh? Why?
How'd they find out?

67
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,107
"Prejudice against old men."
"Truly unnecessary."

68
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,858
"Apologize, Masae Tanabe."

69
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,528
Huh? Masae?

70
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,530
She hosts a local FM radio show
every other week.

71
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,826
There are a handful of listeners
who support Masae's unfiltered talk.

72
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,705
But her candid talk
has caused a problem.

73
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,671
Welcome to "Masae Tanabe's
Unnecessary Comment."

74
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:43,969
I'm coming to you live
from a chilly studio in Narimasu.

75
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,847
From a listener by the name
"Corn Implant."

76
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,100
"I turn 48 years old this year."

77
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:55,230
"I have a crush on a hot cafe owner,
probably around 30 years old."

78
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,316
"Is this a crime?"

79
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,235
Huh? Why would it be?

80
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,906
Why is it a crime
if women our age loves a young guy?

81
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,742
Besides, my boyfriend's young too.

82
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,330
Didn't I mention I'm 56 and he's 30?

83
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,248
Middle-aged men? Nah.

84
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,793
They smell like old cushions.

85
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,461
So, go for it--

86
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,422
This section has sparked backlash.

87
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,341
For dating a young guy?

88
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:26,011
No, the "middle-aged men
smell like old cushions" part.

89
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,055
Huh? Of course, it's a joke.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,724
As of now,
the backlash is still minor.

91
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,102
-So--
-You want me to contain it?

92
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,061
Contain?

93
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,981
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance
for a no-name talent like Masae.

94
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,733
Take advantage of it.

95
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:47,157
"In your last show,
you said you had a young boyfriend."

96
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,325
"You meant Yu--"

97
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,161
"You meant Yuji, right?"

98
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,374
Hey, I don't wanna say this.

99
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,589
You're on fire, pretty lady

100
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,174
I said I don't want to.

101
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:08,011
You're on fire, pretty lady

102
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:08,929
I said I don't--

103
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,347
Rolling...

104
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,350
And... action!

105
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,358
And... action.

106
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,697
My comment from the last show
was in...

107
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,700
inconsiderate and out of line.

108
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,077
I have offended many of you...

109
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,706
Many? More like 50 listeners.

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,793
No good. Start over.

111
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:43,046
Who cares?
It was laughable and suited Masae.

112
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,675
It's an apology.
It mustn't be laughable. Again.

113
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,053
My comments from the last show--

114
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,640
Hey, Masae, can I ask something?

115
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,351
You're perky and giggly. It's scary.

116
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,189
In your last show,
you mentioned a young boyfriend.

117
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,609
You meant Yuji, right?

118
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,571
Are you crazy? No way.

119
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,323
Come on, stop hiding it.

120
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:13,327
Same agency, same age.
That's what your listeners will think.

121
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,204
Don't you agree?

122
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,330
It's possible.

123
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:19,958
You're kidding.

124
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,711
FM KITA-TOKYO

125
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,049
Welcome to Masae Tanabe's
Unnecessary Comment.

126
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:33,430
Once again, I'm coming to you live
from a chilly studio in Narimasu.

127
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,267
Social media is buzzing.

128
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,312
She's getting a little heat, huh?

129
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,901
My comment from the last show

130
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,946
was inconsiderate and out of line.

131
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,366
I have offended many of you...

132
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,746
I was practicing those lines,
but they didn't feel right.

133
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,749
-All that practice for nothing?
-It made me think.

134
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,127
Why did I make you so angry?

135
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,922
Then I realized.

136
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,551
Maybe it was because
of my wishful thinking.

137
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,473
I knew I'd anger middle-aged men.
But...

138
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,600
it's funny, so go for it.

139
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:24,064
I thought maybe
my wishful thinking made you upset.

140
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:30,654
So, I want to apologize sincerely,
not a cookie-cutter apology.

141
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:36,159
It was a truly offensive comment.

142
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,578
I'm terribly sorry.

143
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,501
Masae...

144
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,254
Masae is so mature, isn't she?

145
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,632
My colleagues at the agency
gave me advice, too.

146
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,883
-Yuji.
-Thank you.

147
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,593
-Yuji?
-That being said...

148
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,890
I'll pull myself together
and make a fresh start.

149
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:04,396
Can I say one more thing
regarding the last show?

150
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,733
Our female manager said this.

151
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,318
"Masae..."

152
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,404
"your young boyfriend
is Yuji, right?"

153
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,198
"That's what your listeners think."

154
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,535
I'll say this just in case
you got the wrong idea.

155
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,412
My boyfriend

156
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,706
is not Yuji Sanada.

157
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:27,919
It'll never happen because
I want to drink with my boyfriend.

158
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,547
Because that boy...

159
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,632
can't drink alcohol.

160
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,804
I don't dislike people who can't drink.

161
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:43,685
But if we're a couple,
I can only be with a guy who can drink.

162
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,647
If it's a friend, I don't mind at all.

163
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,069
This is awesome.

164
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,447
YUJI CAN'T DRINK?!

165
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,741
What were you thinking?

166
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,992
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,994
-Sorry.
-Yuji...

168
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,123
signed a contract with a beer brand
while hiding the fact he can't drink.

169
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:10,670
But now, "#yujicantdrink"
is trending on social media.

170
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,589
What's going on?

171
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,591
We're truly sorry.

172
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,093
Sorry.

173
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,095
Apologize louder.

174
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,180
What's the big deal?

175
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,725
I just received a call
from the client.

176
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,311
-Huh?
-At this rate,

177
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,814
they're going
to terminate the contract.

178
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,565
Now what?!

179
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,401
I'm sorry. You too.

180
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,611
-Stand up.
-Hold on.

181
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:40,242
Um, if apologizing will solve it,
we'd be glad to.

182
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,494
-But--
-Our job now

183
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,913
is not to provoke but to apologize.

184
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,958
Then how are you
taking responsibility?

185
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,293
Responsibility.

186
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,797
Responsibility...

187
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,966
Responsibility!

188
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,643
Don't forget.

189
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:13,108
The livelihoods of Toyo Productions'
employees are on your shoulders.

190
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,780
I won't tolerate further issues.

191
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,911
Especially love-related ones.

192
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,375
But that won't happen.

193
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,169
She'll be so miserable

194
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:37,090
having to suffer serious backlash
for the rest of her life.

195
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,388
Responsibility...

196
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,808
Hats off to your talent.

197
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,190
YUJI SANADA'S BEER COMMERCIAL
TAKEN OFF THE AIR

198
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,526
You caused this much damage
with just a few lines.

199
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,403
What do you want?

200
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,032
The result exceeded my expectations.
You're a genius troublemaker.

201
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,533
So what do you want?

202
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,660
The Director's Award.

203
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,997
A 30,000 yen voucher
for a high-end BBQ restaurant.

204
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,710
Please continue boosting
Masae's recognition.

205
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,089
HOW TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

206
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,216
Responsibility...

207
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,510
They're roasting her.

208
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,721
"Thanks to the old lady,
Yuji's commercial disappeared."

209
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,932
"It was really
an unnecessary comment."

210
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,558
"Get lost, old lady."

211
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:32,812
She only has 50 listeners.
Why are there 5,000 comments?

212
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,106
They want to jump on the bandwagon.

213
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,652
"Old lady, you're too old
to be a nameless actor."

214
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,862
"Old lady, you're too old for love."

215
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,699
"Old lady, you're too old
to wear vivid colors."

216
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,035
It's like an "old lady" improv.

217
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,665
The best thing to do
is apologize in the next show.

218
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,041
Yeah, let's apologize.

219
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,002
It should be legit, unlike last time.

220
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,256
I'm a pro at apologizing,
so I'll teach you--

221
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,341
She's trending.

222
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,260
Huh? #vividoldlady...

223
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,264
Wow, it's my first time trending.
I'm lucky.

224
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,890
Snap out of it!

225
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,186
Santa, take a deep breath.
You're panicking too much.

226
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,605
"You're" not panicking enough!

227
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,816
We share the same fate.

228
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,237
You should be comforted, too.

229
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,201
Hello, Sumidagawa speaking.

230
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,287
Yes, we're looking forward--

231
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,289
What?

232
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,959
Hold on. Out of the blue?

233
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,502
Uh...

234
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,636
Masae, your appearance tomorrow
has been canceled.

235
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,724
Masae...

236
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,685
Um...

237
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,687
Are you OK?

238
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,480
It doesn't bother me.

239
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,649
Besides, I deserve it.

240
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,986
I should think before I speak.

241
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:09,034
I know how it feels...
to face backlash.

242
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:10,827
Huh?

243
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,914
Here. Take your mind off things.

244
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,794
Thanks.

245
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,399
Miss Kandagawa, come out!

246
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,568
Did I do something THAT bad?

247
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,612
Why...?

248
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,007
Um...

249
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,260
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,848
I'm responsible
for your commercial, too.

251
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,895
No, I'm the one
who was hiding it, so.

252
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,443
Okay, bye.

253
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,863
Listen.

254
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,202
Uh...

255
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,750
That "love confession" the other day.

256
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,045
That's...

257
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,090
a line from my next film.

258
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,427
-Huh?
-Like...

259
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,554
Maybe you got the wrong idea.

260
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,600
Oh, no, not at all.

261
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,352
Really? Good to know.

262
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:04,941
Bye.

263
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,603
"High-end BBQ during backlash.
No remorse. #apologize."

264
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,190
"You're too old
to eat quality meat. #apologize."

265
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,902
"Elders should stick
to cheap loin, vivid loin lady."

266
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,070
Hey, this is plain bullying.

267
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,322
Don't say it to me.

268
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,950
I'm so sorry, Masae.
Masae?

269
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,745
Hello?

270
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,914
Sorry to call out of the blue.

271
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,668
I'm sorry, too, for everything.

272
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,964
Today's your rehearsal, right?

273
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,674
Good luck.

274
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,178
I just got a call.

275
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,806
My appearance...

276
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,808
might get canceled.

277
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:22,852
Huh? Why?

278
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,106
Is it...

279
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,276
because of me?

280
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,448
Um, Masae?

281
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,160
Uh...

282
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,580
Oh, right.

283
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,082
I get it.

284
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,376
You're right.

285
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,132
Let's call it quits.

286
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,220
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:12,569
"Miss Masae Tanabe is my senior
and a fellow actor."

288
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,613
"I never felt anything romantic."

289
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,782
Loser.

290
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:22,871
As a result,
#youwishvividoldlady is trending.

291
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:28,459
"Vivid old lady" is being covered
even on terrestrial TV. Amazing job.

292
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,296
If this keeps going,
she'll be reduced to ashes.

293
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,756
Yes, Masae did make a mistake,

294
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:37,176
but why get roasted this much
for one mistake?

295
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,596
Well...

296
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,098
There's nothing more to roast, so,

297
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,976
-Masae's role is over.
-Over?

298
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,981
From hereon, use this gigantic flame
to promote the other Dept. 4 people.

299
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,610
No, Masae comes first.
Make her comment on the next show.

300
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,778
-Next show?
-Next show.

301
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,114
-Next?
-Next!

302
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,533
The next one's the last?

303
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,411
That's what the sponsor wants.
I'm so sorry.

304
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,247
Hold on.
Did she do something "that" bad?

305
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,625
Michiko, it was my mistake.

306
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,169
-But--
-It was too unfiltered.

307
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,754
It's all my fault.

308
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:20,136
I'll apologize from my heart
in the final episode.

309
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:29,020
Actually, the final episode
is going to be a recap of past shows.

310
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,733
I'm sorry.
It's what the sponsor wants.

311
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,783
Where are you going?
Excuse me.

312
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,077
No more trouble, please.

313
00:20:58,883 --> 00:20:59,968
We beg you.

314
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,386
Not possible.

315
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,303
Please.

316
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,680
Sorry, I'm busy.

317
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,350
Tough luck. Let's go.

318
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,603
-You're up.
-Huh?

319
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,524
-Please accept his apology.
-What the heck?

320
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,609
Please, Mr. Major Sponsor.

321
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,404
If you want, I can
make him shave his head.

322
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,405
No heads-up?

323
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,658
You want to save
the show that badly?

324
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,535
Yes, sir.

325
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,206
No can do!

326
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,875
-Why not?
-Duh.

327
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,962
I'm getting tons of nasty emails.

328
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,590
I'm the sponsor spending money.
Why the heck do I--

329
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,676
You're whining over nothing.

330
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,136
No, don't go there.

331
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,264
Who do you think you are?
I quit.

332
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,558
I'm not paying for the final episode.

333
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,352
Your show is canceled.

334
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,729
That darn old--

335
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,896
No, don't do it.

336
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,523
Let go of me.

337
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,527
Your action is predictable.

338
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,573
You're wide open on the top!

339
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,912
Ow...

340
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,708
This sucks.
The final episode will--

341
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,002
It sucks for us more.

342
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,842
Who cares about the final episode
of a show nobody listens to?

343
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,972
Thanks to you, we're begging the client
to continue Yuji's commercial.

344
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,059
We keep bowing and bowing--

345
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,854
Wait. Have you two
bowed in apology?

346
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,651
We're truly sorry.

347
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,236
Keep it down.

348
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,073
You're a bit late. I mean--

349
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,075
We're truly...

350
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,868
-We're truly...
-Please stop it.

351
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:49,994
Santa?

352
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:51,871
Why are you here?

353
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,333
"Why?"
Why are "you" here, Yuji?

354
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:00,838
Yuji came to apologize in person
even after Ms. Kawashima did.

355
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,965
He wanted to properly apologize,

356
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,844
and even made a proposal
that will probably go viral.

357
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,389
Hold on a second.
I'm not following.

358
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,769
Your radio sponsor left, so you can't
air the final episode, right?

359
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:19,440
Yuji proposed to ask the beer brand
to sponsor the radio show.

360
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,735
But they won't accept it
after what happened, will they?

361
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,114
That's where Yuji's brilliant plan
comes into play.

362
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,537
Yes, uh-huh. Alright.

363
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:38,251
I understand. Thank you. Bye.

364
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,047
We officially have a sponsor.

365
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,134
Do you mean Yuji's beer brand?

366
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,051
Yes.

367
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,052
Wow.

368
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,764
The final episode can be
Masae's talking session.

369
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,809
What a relief.

370
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,770
-But we can't do it here.
-Huh?

371
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:02,608
Another show will use the studio
when Masae's show is on the air.

372
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,402
Then we can't air it.

373
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:08,072
Maybe we can search
for another studio?

374
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,661
Good. This would work.

375
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,126
But I have to be in the office that day.
What should we do?

376
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,589
You mean a director?
Don't worry, she'll do it.

377
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,132
No, hold on.

378
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,426
And they'll be the assistants.

379
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:30,845
We know nothing.

380
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,597
Where's Masae?

381
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:36,142
Actually, I've been calling her,
but she's not answering.

382
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:40,271
She won't do anything stupid
because of the backlash, would she?

383
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,618
Masae.

384
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,787
-Open up.
-Masae!

385
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,416
Don't die...

386
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,169
-Masae!
-Hey, Masae.

387
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,171
Don't die, Masae!

388
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:18,100
Sorry, I was cleaning up
and didn't realize it was this late.

389
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,937
I'm really sorry.

390
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,814
That's fine, but what's that?

391
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,817
Oh, they're
my vivid colored clothes.

392
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,198
You know what?
I want to become a new person.

393
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,119
From "vivid old lady"
to "muted old lady."

394
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,872
"Muted old lady"?

395
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,000
Wearing vivid colors at this age,

396
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,712
or dating young guys at this age.

397
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,215
Talking without thinking at this age.

398
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:53,552
They're all causing trouble
for everyone.

399
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,600
I'll become a woman
who blends into the background.

400
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,852
But that'll kill your personality--

401
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,729
That's what I want.

402
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,482
Since deciding that...

403
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:08,859
it's been easy.

404
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,613
Life is so much easier.

405
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,951
That's the truth.

406
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:23,416
Masae, they've decided that
you can talk in the final episode.

407
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,254
Let's do it.
Speak your mind like you always do.

408
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,511
Tell them to make it a recap.

409
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,396
Are you sure about bringing that?

410
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,023
She shouldn't dispose of them.

411
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,110
It's back to a recap, huh?

412
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,322
The final episode...

413
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,159
will be Masae's talk.

414
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,119
But...

415
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,662
I'll bring her.

416
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,248
I'll drag her.

417
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,584
If I have to.

418
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:09,754
Kohji...

419
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:13,966
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,012
I'm terribly sorry!

421
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,264
Why isn't Masae here?

422
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,892
You said you'd drag her here.

423
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,146
She won't answer her phone
or the doorbell.

424
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,732
I can't drag her out.

425
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,776
Ask the caretaker to open the door.

426
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,027
I already did.

427
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:36,113
I called Masae's sister,
and she unlocked the door, but...

428
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,573
it was empty.

429
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:41,118
But the show starts in 30 minutes.

430
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:47,166
Yes, I'll figure it out
before the show starts. Okay, bye.

431
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,377
Hey.

432
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,923
It better work out.

433
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,260
This involves Yuji's client
for his commercial.

434
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,306
Are you sure you can make it work?

435
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,683
Are you sure?

436
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,062
Are you sure?

437
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,481
I... I'm in a hurry.

438
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,316
Oh, no...

439
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,276
Ten more minutes.

440
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,155
As expected from a genius like you.

441
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:21,867
The show hasn't started, but
"Vivid Old Lady" is already trending.

442
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,328
She needs to be there all the more.

443
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,454
You think so?

444
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,541
-I prefer it as is.
-Huh?

445
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,543
Just like in Yuji's case,

446
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,964
we live in a time when
it's tough to keep lying to the public.

447
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:38,259
Let's proceed as planned.

448
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:42,847
It's a golden opportunity
for those in Dept. 4.

449
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,391
Huh?

450
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,312
In five, four, three...

451
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:57,194
Welcome to Masae Tanabe's
Unnecessary Comment.

452
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:00,573
Uh... about Masae.

453
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,701
She's running a little bit late.

454
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,496
So until she arrives,
I, Takeru Yokoi,

455
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,332
will s... speak on her b... behalf.

456
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,836
I was uh, born in N... Nagasaki.

457
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,922
Have you heard
of the Nagasaki Lantern Festival?

458
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,467
It's turning into
a local old-town show.

459
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,720
"Who's this dude?" is trending.

460
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,931
I played in the
te... tennis club.

461
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,016
Who cares?

462
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,852
A stranger's local story is torture.

463
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,063
Isn't this a one-hour show?
Will Masae really come?

464
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,773
Have faith.

465
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,233
I'll look for her.

466
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:47,953
It's time for...

467
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,456
Takeru Yokoi's selection
of Nagasaki's sights.

468
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,916
Number five.

469
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,293
Tada. Dutch Slope.

470
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,754
I went on my first date there.

471
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,048
A stranger's love talk?
No, thank you!

472
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,382
I wanted to hold hands--

473
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,968
It's unbearable to listen to.

474
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,638
A strange man's
strange love in a strange place.

475
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,306
Next, Moe.

476
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,599
Huh? Me?

477
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,392
What do you want?

478
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,605
I'm good at TikTok,
so I'm going to film myself live.

479
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:15,940
Tik what?

480
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,571
Is being cute not enough for you?

481
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,990
This is an audio-based medium!

482
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:27,243
Old man Takeru will save the day.

483
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:28,702
The elastic!

484
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,788
Next. Tsutomu.

485
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,583
I went to the University of Tokyo.
I love math.

486
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,794
I've memorized 50 digits of pi.

487
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,254
It's 3.141592--

488
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,256
Nobody is interested!

489
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,633
And we can't tell if it's correct.

490
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,678
What's taking Masae so long?

491
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,597
Sorry, we're late.

492
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,724
I... brought...

493
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,143
We were waiting, Masae...

494
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,689
...three, seven, five, one...

495
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,023
Hosoi?

496
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,987
Why did you bring her ex?

497
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,322
I thought he could call out to her.

498
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,492
But is Masae even listening to this?

499
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,535
She's listening.

500
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:11,704
I'm positive.

501
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,007
Hello, nice to meet you.

502
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,926
I'm Kenichi Hosoi.

503
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:32,850
I'm Masae Tanabe,
a.k.a. Vivid Old Lady's...

504
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:35,644
ex-boyfriend.

505
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,189
He confessed after
denying it on social media.

506
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,649
Masae, are you listening?

507
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm a nameless actor.

508
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,072
I only get minor roles on stage.

509
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:52,828
My main source of income
is the merch my handful of fans buy.

510
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:54,705
So...

511
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,876
when my relationship
with Masae became public...

512
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,380
I was honestly... terrified.

513
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,551
That my fans may abandon me.

514
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:13,599
So, I asked Masae
to break up with me.

515
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,566
I'm sorry!

516
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:30,115
I'm really sorry...

517
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,245
It's all my fault!

518
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,207
It's me!

519
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,335
Masae.

520
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,755
Please contact us!

521
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,508
Looks like
some politician's press conference.

522
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,803
"Fake crying" is trending.

523
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,681
-What a guy.
-Play music.

524
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,308
Contact us!

525
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,729
I'll show you the door.

526
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,731
-Any final words?
-No.

527
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,650
She hasn't contacted us.

528
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,195
Uh-oh. We're losing listeners.

529
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:10,989
They hate nonstop music.

530
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,077
In that case, play the commercial.

531
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,745
We'll lose more listeners.

532
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,664
No, not this one.

533
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,499
Let's do it.

534
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,971
Good evening, I'm Yuji Sanada.

535
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:38,267
Despite the fact that
I can't drink alcohol,

536
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,644
I had appeared
in an alcohol commercial.

537
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:45,232
I sincerely apologize for the trouble
I caused so many people.

538
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,653
Yuji made an official apology, too.

539
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,655
Where'd this come from?

540
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,825
He made a proposal
to the ad agency

541
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,036
to personally apologize
in a commercial.

542
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:03,500
-He also came up with the next step.
-I'll do my best to win back your trust.

543
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,007
Ah, it's so good.

544
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:14,052
Hey, why are you drinking mine?
This is a non-alcoholic drink.

545
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,430
I can't drink, but you can.

546
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,558
Drink a regular drink,
not a non-alcoholic one.

547
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,727
Hey, that's mine.

548
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,270
The commercial's ending.

549
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,397
Next...

550
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,774
I'll go.

551
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,068
I'll talk until she comes.

552
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:39,453
Hi, everyone. This is Kohji Wada.

553
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:46,335
I bring to you my light-hearted
impressions to cheer you up.

554
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,256
First up, from My Neighbor Totoro,
Totoro's cry.

555
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,722
Is this going on until Masae comes?

556
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,559
It's so cringe-worthy
that I can't keep watching.

557
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,770
The show ends in 15 minutes.

558
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,942
Next, the main character
of the drama "Ie naki ko," Suzu.

559
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,111
If you pity me, give me money.

560
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,864
If you pity me, give me money.

561
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,075
Hey, where's Masae?

562
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,035
I don't know.

563
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,996
Then give me a hint.
Give me something.

564
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,915
You always know everything.

565
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,917
Think for yourself.

566
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,545
I have no clue.
We're running out of--

567
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,588
Instructions and lines.

568
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,716
Are you relying on me forever?

569
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,053
Then you'll stay half-baked forever.

570
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,763
Ah, dang it.

571
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:40,973
By the way...

572
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,269
If you do find Masae,

573
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,355
what line are you going to say?

574
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,899
I don't have time for this!

575
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,401
It's important.

576
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:56,989
If you say the wrong lines,
you'll spoil the story.

577
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,577
Come on. Think about it.

578
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,829
"Think about it"?

579
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:11,879
Next, a chicken.
Kokekokkoo.

580
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:17,217
-I'll say...
-A foreign chicken. Cock-a-doodle-doo!

581
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:23,348
Masae, I'm super relieved
that you didn't come for the radio.

582
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,393
A frog. Ribbit, ribbit.

583
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,563
I'm so glad that you didn't come.

584
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,650
You have no right
to be on the radio now.

585
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,612
You got self-conscious
and chose muted clothes.

586
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,239
You got sick of doing radio
and just ran away.

587
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:43,911
Kohji's radio is a billion times
better than your talks.

588
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,748
Don't be ridiculous.

589
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,214
Keep going.

590
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,550
My high school teacher
during homeroom.

591
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:03,639
Listen. Radio is a medium
for conveying one's true thoughts.

592
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,474
That's why it's still needed.

593
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,268
But you're filled with lies.

594
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,563
A liar like you
has no place on the radio.

595
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:12,856
You little...

596
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,609
Girl, you crossed the line.

597
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,235
Indeed, you're not a star.

598
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,281
But that's because
you stayed true to yourself.

599
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,618
It's not fun to lie your way
to stardom, right?

600
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,955
You were at the bottom,
but life was fun, wasn't it?

601
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,793
But look at you now.

602
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,878
Drenched in lies.

603
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:41,009
Ignore the public's eyes.
Do what you desire--

604
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,762
I'm not that cool, you idiot!

605
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,226
Listen.

606
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:55,983
As we speak, your friends are doing
the cringiest things in Japan.

607
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,654
Having faith that you would come.

608
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,155
It's time for...

609
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,575
an impression of Masae.

610
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:07,411
Ya know?

611
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:12,416
I talk tough,
but actually, I'm a sensitive gal.

612
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,502
You probably think it's okay

613
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,130
to criticize entertainers
all you want.

614
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,925
That's not true.
We're humans, just like you.

615
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:25,554
You think I'm fine
becoming a public punching bag?

616
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,015
I feel pain just like you.

617
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:34,229
We're public figures,
so we don't mind being laughed at.

618
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,982
It's time to let go of your lies.

619
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,165
Hey, why were you hiding her?

620
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,710
Saving the heroine for last.

621
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,129
As a director would do.

622
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,682
Next, more impressions of Masae.

623
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,226
When a young lady
enters the elevator.

624
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,728
Five minutes left.

625
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,230
She won't...

626
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:21,193
Nice bag.
It must be heavy on your shoulders.

627
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,905
You sound half asleep, old man.

628
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,240
That seat's not for you.

629
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,996
Good job. Thanks.

630
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,044
-Play the jingle.
-OK.

631
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:50,722
Welcome to Masae Tanabe's
Unnecessary Comment.

632
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:56,103
I'm coming to you live
from a remote area in Toyo Production.

633
00:39:56,186 --> 00:40:02,609
I deeply apologize for being late
for the final episode.

634
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,405
Actually, I was nearby.

635
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:11,243
But I didn't have
the courage to come.

636
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,620
The reason being...

637
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,708
I thought I'd have to lie.

638
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:22,295
If it means lying
to my beloved listeners,

639
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,633
I may as well not come at all.

640
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:29,970
By the way,

641
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:36,184
until a few minutes ago,
I was wearing muted-colored clothes.

642
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:39,729
I think you all know the reason.

643
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,026
People said, "Don't wear vivid clothes
at your age, vivid old lady."

644
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,238
I thought I'd just brush it away.

645
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:53,326
But in reality,
it stabbed me like a knife.

646
00:40:54,494 --> 00:41:00,041
So, I started wearing muted clothes
to become the "muted old lady."

647
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:04,629
Even though I love vivid clothes,

648
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,425
I let the public get to me
and wore muted clothes.

649
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,135
But I wasn't happy.

650
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:14,681
If you lie to yourself,
you won't be happy.

651
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,770
Someone told me earlier.

652
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,733
"Ignore the public's eyes."

653
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,529
That's right.
I should wear the clothes I love.

654
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,450
It'd be cool if I could
brush off people's opinions.

655
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,701
I get it.

656
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,622
But I couldn't.

657
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,542
I'm not that tough.

658
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,879
Getting roasted opened my eyes.

659
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,550
I feel discouraged
when people criticize my outfit.

660
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,304
I feel down just like you.

661
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,309
So, life's easier with muted tones.

662
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:04,064
It's easy, but I'm not happy
because I'm lying to myself.

663
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:08,485
There's nowhere out, huh?

664
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,616
Therefore, I sort of decided
what I wanted to do.

665
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,701
This may sound crazy.

666
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:19,829
From now on,

667
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,916
I won't lie to myself.

668
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,461
But I want you to praise me.

669
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:33,551
I'm going to live my life
staying true to who I am.

670
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,428
That's it.

671
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:41,059
I know I'm a bit old,
but I'll wear outfits that I love.

672
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,937
Otherwise, I won't be happy.

673
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:50,402
I want to be told,
"That outfit really suits you."

674
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,613
I'll keep doing my best

675
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,783
to hear those words.

676
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,706
Thanks for all these years.

677
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,709
Until the day...

678
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,670
we meet again.

679
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,311
FM KITA-TOKYO

680
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:28,148
Welcome to "The Vivid Old Lady's
Unnecessary Comment."

681
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:31,401
A complete 180, huh?

682
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,697
People loved that episode.
It has to go on.

683
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,994
She's a female icon.

684
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,038
THE VIVID OLD LADY'S
UNNECESSARY COMMENT

685
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,332
Write her name on the cabbage.

686
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,710
Akane, I wanted us to...

687
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,172
be happy.

688
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,348
Now you're the only person

689
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,477
who's still lying.

690
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:06,686
MIWA KANDAGAWA

691
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,937
Miss Sumidagawa.

692
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,482
Cheers.

693
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,487
Congrats on the continuation
of your commercial contract.

694
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,614
I owe it to the radio show.

695
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:21,826
Without your apology commercial,
we wouldn't have had a show.

696
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,578
-Oh, no, no.
-Oh, no, no.

697
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,997
-Cut it out.
-Cut it out.

698
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,711
You shouldn't lie to yourself, huh?

699
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,130
Right.

700
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,385
You know...

701
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:40,929
I was lying.

702
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,390
Huh?

703
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,058
Actually...

704
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,603
I do like you.

705
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:53,149
Huh? Now, of all times?

706
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,234
Is it bad?

707
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,237
It's not bad, but...

708
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,200
I'll keep saying it.

709
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:04,577
I...

710
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,497
