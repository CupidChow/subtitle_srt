1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,216
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa,
assigned to Department Four.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,552
I'll change.
From child star Miwa Kandagawa...

3
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,345
To Manager... Michiko Sumidagawa.

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,930
Anywhere is better than here!

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,641
So you're the one trying to leave.

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,229
Where you and I become one.
Do you have what it takes or not!

7
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:27,236
-How were you back then?
-"Back then?"

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,446
You know...

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,865
when I…

10
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,701
You mean when you killed Shotaro?

11
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,042
-Will you not say "kill"?
-Can you say that...

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,463
to Shotaro, the giant salamander
who rests in heaven?

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,967
I sure can. It was an accident.
I touched the tank, and he jumped out.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,803
I feel sorry for Shotaro.

15
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,348
The issue wasn't the accident itself,
but how you handled it.

16
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:01,187
Do you plan
on taking a break from acting?

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,106
A tearful apology alone
isn't very convincing.

18
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,192
Let me ask.

19
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,069
Did I really do something THAT bad?

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,034
Why are you making a big deal
about a giant salamander dying?

21
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,954
CHILD STAR MIWA KANDAGAWA

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,372
Your statement...

23
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,165
CANCELED

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,000
was disgusting as an actor.

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,376
APOLOGY ENDS IN DISASTER

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,545
An entitled and reckless kid actor.

27
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:27,421
FAMILY FALLS APART

28
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:31,675
You had "I'm the No.1 actress"
written all over your face.

29
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,969
I've learned my lesson.

30
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,138
I hurt so many people.

31
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:43,687
If people found out that the infamous
Miwa Kandagawa has made a comeback

32
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:48,692
working as a manager in the industry,
that would be a huge disaster.

33
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,152
I know that.

34
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,571
That's why I became
"Michiko Sumidagawa."

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,989
Nobody knows yet.

36
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,366
Miss Miwa.

37
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,077
You finally have the look
of a legit manager.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,245
What "look" is that?

39
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,163
Can you stop the nonsense?

40
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,749
What about a child actor next?

41
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,417
What do you mean, "What about"?

42
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,420
Here you go, Miss Former Child Star.

43
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,675
OTOYA MORIGUCHI

44
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,972
Your face is saying
that you understand his feelings.

45
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,683
Will you stop interpreting my face?

46
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:25,062
Otoya Moriguchi belongs to Green Steps,
an agency for child actors.

47
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,689
Not our company?

48
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,275
This time, I need you to poach him.

49
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,028
That's your mission. Rolling...

50
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,073
Poaching? Is that even allowed?

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,032
Yes.

52
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,494
Can't you... show me the ropes...

53
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,413
-Tips--
-Say what?

54
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,666
-Please--
-What?

55
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,085
-Please--
-Please what?

56
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,003
Just tell me!

57
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,255
I'm just a newbie manager.

58
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,465
Very well.

59
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,010
Let's see...

60
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,639
"Otoya, I came to rescue you."

61
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,517
This line is over the top and cheesy.

62
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,977
Have you lost your touch?

63
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,690
Your face says you're ready to go.

64
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,734
Rolling!

65
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,528
And... action!

66
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,282
Dang it, you creepy face stalker.

67
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,118
He's pretty well-known.

68
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,621
He used to be on screen a lot.

69
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,080
Oh, really?

70
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,333
He's the lead actor this time.

71
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,088
The lead of the musical Lion Prince?

72
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,049
-Santa, Santa.
-What? What?

73
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,218
Mr. Saigawa told me
to poach Otoya.

74
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,804
-Santa, Santa, Santa.
-What? What? What?

75
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,391
Don't wear my name out.

76
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,519
Mr. Saigawa appointed "you"
to poach him, not me.

77
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:52,066
But as fellow managers,
you and I should help each other out.

78
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,610
"Fellow"?
Since when did we become a duo?

79
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,487
-We're independent.
-Let's go.

80
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,740
I can't wait to see Otoya act.

81
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,450
Otoya, stop!

82
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:02,826
Move it!

83
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,036
Huh? Otoya?

84
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,121
-Move, ugly lady.
-What did you say?

85
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,790
He's not what I pictured.

86
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,709
Otoya! Someone stop him!

87
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,169
-Move it.
-Huh? Wait...

88
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,174
I said move.

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,761
Ow, that hurt.
Why did you barge into a wall?

90
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,554
I'm not a wall! I'm your superior!

91
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,349
That hurt. Who the heck are you?

92
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,767
Me?

93
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,435
I'm a...

94
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,065
Otoya...

95
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,776
I came to rescue you.

96
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,736
Have you lost your mind?

97
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,532
Miss...

98
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,118
Can I trust you?

99
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,496
Huh? It struck a chord?

100
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:50,666
Can I?

101
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,711
Huh? You can...

102
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,504
Yes, you can trust me.

103
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,880
You'll do something?

104
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,383
I'll do something. Yes.

105
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,594
Don't you have to be on stage?

106
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,639
Whatever.
It's not my business anymore.

107
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,559
-Huh?!
-Huh?!

108
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,102
I think his actions are due to--

109
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,896
Otoya is a difficult kid.

110
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,355
It's due to--

111
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,356
I was shocked too.

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,232
Due to--

113
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,485
-He called me "ugly."
-That's mean.

114
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,197
Let's hear what the old man
has to say. Go on then.

115
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,656
It's due to...

116
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,411
puberty.

117
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,705
That's what we all thought
from the start.

118
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,873
I regret asking.

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,126
Kid actors tend
to hit a wall at puberty.

120
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,047
Even if they make it big,
lots of families fall apart.

121
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,132
Mom's always at the site.

122
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,468
Dad has an affair outside.

123
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,429
That's the classic outcome. Yikes.

124
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,057
Let's not assume.
Not everybody's the same.

125
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,684
But you sure are unlucky.

126
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,978
He's replaced the day you recruit him.

127
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,814
OTOYA IS REPLACED DUE TO ILLNESS

128
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,731
You can laugh.

129
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,361
Replaced on the day?
That's hilarious.

130
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,656
Shut up!

131
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,824
What the heck?

132
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,867
That was more than a laugh.

133
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,910
You said to laugh.

134
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,912
So you're a yes-man actor?

135
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,247
Don't take it out on me.

136
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,458
I don't want you to be an actor
who only does what he's told.

137
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,586
Try encouraging me.
Take a different approach.

138
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,546
And action!

139
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,508
R... Replaced on the same day?

140
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,135
That's not encouraging at all.

141
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,761
-With nuance.
-That's tough.

142
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,805
-What's going on?
-Anybody?

143
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,181
Alright, I'll go.

144
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,307
And action!

145
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,517
He was replaced?

146
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,436
Out of the blue?

147
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,063
Tacky. No need to cry.

148
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,815
-Sorry, Director.
-What is this?

149
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,525
-My turn.
-And action!

150
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,194
Replaced? Out of the blue?

151
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,406
You're overly empathetic,
it's not convincing.

152
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,367
-May I...
-Act before you speak. And action!

153
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,162
Replaced out of...

154
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,538
Nope. Can't hear you.

155
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,914
Do vocal exercises.

156
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,166
I'll start from scratch.

157
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,292
He's in actor mode.

158
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,710
What's this? A rehearsal?

159
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,044
And action!

160
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,798
Replaced out of the blue?!

161
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,675
That was too loud to understand.

162
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,845
-I'll start from scratch.
-How many times are you restarting?

163
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,805
Santa, why don't you cheer me up?

164
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,892
I'm hurt so badly,
but here you are standing still.

165
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,768
Are you playing the role of a tree?

166
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,771
Who are you calling a tree?
I'm an animal. A mammal.

167
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,398
No, I'm a human.

168
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,734
Give me another chance.

169
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,943
I'm not a tree!

170
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,446
Hello? Sumidagawa speaking.

171
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:11,742
I'm Kurata from Green Steps.
I'm Otoya Moriguchi's manager.

172
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,912
I'm sorry for not
introducing myself yesterday.

173
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,540
We're a child talent agency,

174
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,293
so Otoya will have to leave soon.

175
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,464
I think being managed by Toyo Productions
is the best path for him.

176
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,301
Really? That simplifies matters.

177
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,430
Besides, in the past, Mr. Saigawa
helped a child actor rise to fame.

178
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,892
What was her name? That girl...

179
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,520
She got canceled for being a diva.

180
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,899
I remember her.
You mean Miwa Kandagawa?

181
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,859
-Yes.
-That nightmare kid actor.

182
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,903
Ow. What was that for?

183
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,947
Sorry, I crossed my legs and missed.

184
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,865
Are your legs a wild horse?

185
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,451
Tame your legs. Sorry about that.

186
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,329
But he's great at promoting child stars.

187
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,916
-I feel reassured if it's his agency.
-What's that face?

188
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,712
Before we sign a contract,
I'd like to ask about Otoya.

189
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,715
Does he have worries or family issues?

190
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,759
He's going through a lot now.

191
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,302
Like what?

192
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,640
I read online
that he was replaced due to illness.

193
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,185
The reason Otoya was replaced

194
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,146
is because he fought
and punched a cast member.

195
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:24,815
Huh?

196
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,568
Otoya!

197
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,072
I'm so sorry.

198
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,491
Otoya. What were you thinking?

199
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,368
Tell me the reason.

200
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,621
No reason can justify violence.

201
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,872
Right?

202
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,377
As long as Otoya's the lead,
none of us will perform on stage.

203
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,046
I didn't have a choice.

204
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,383
When I told him he's out,
he got angry and left the green room.

205
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,594
Has he always had
a tendency to punch people?

206
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,929
No, not at all.

207
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,225
Some people love to punch others.
Like her. See?

208
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,856
He's still a child,
so he might be unsecure at times.

209
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,776
So please help him grow into
a great actor at Toyo Productions.

210
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,570
Understood. We'll do that.

211
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,572
-I appreciate it.
-Thank you.

212
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,033
Is it good?

213
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,243
It's fine.

214
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,334
You'll do great
at the new agency. OK?

215
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,676
Why did you punch him?

216
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,348
Nobody punches anyone
without a reason.

217
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,934
Because I got mad.

218
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,645
That's not true.

219
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,772
It's true.

220
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,691
Mommy understands you. OK?

221
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,861
You'll never do that
without a reason. OK?

222
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,989
Enough with your "OK"s.
I said I was mad.

223
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,455
So it's going smoothly?

224
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,082
Well, yeah.

225
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,417
As expected of a former child star.

226
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,628
You understood his feelings?

227
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,922
Yeah, I said hi.

228
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:12,964
That's all?

229
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,010
You're such a fool.

230
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,970
Huh? I'm a fool?

231
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,139
Can you really poach him?

232
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,060
The thing is, Otoya's agency
has already confirmed it.

233
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,311
I repeat.

234
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,979
Can you really poach him?

235
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,108
You're such a letdown.

236
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,693
Letdown or not, the result matters.

237
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,155
Exactly. If you can really poach him,
I'll call that a success.

238
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,618
I'm confused.
This conversation isn't making sense.

239
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,287
Sit back and watch the results.

240
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,458
YOHEI KURATA

241
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,961
See? What did I tell you?

242
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,214
Hello?

243
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,467
Huh? He's not transferring?

244
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,885
Wow!

245
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,846
You wannabe American.

246
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,098
Sorry, I'll be there right away.

247
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,226
Run, run, keep on running

248
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,103
I'm sick of your fight songs.

249
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,029
Otoya said...

250
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,909
he wants to leave
the entertainment industry.

251
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,497
He's aware that his popularity...

252
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,668
I mean, his workload is decreasing.

253
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,381
It's taking a mental toll on him.

254
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,471
It's normal for work to slow down
during the teen years.

255
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,847
Right.

256
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,558
But as of now...

257
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,229
we're not in a state
where we can consider transferring.

258
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,816
Neither him nor me.

259
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,277
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,119
I understand your feelings.

261
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,456
Sorry if "understand"
sounds condescending.

262
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:14,252
But I can tell how much
you love and care about Otoya.

263
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,506
So please don't apologize.

264
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,550
Thank you very much.

265
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,597
About the transfer,
for the time being, let's...

266
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,850
I said, "Let's forget about it."

267
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,561
I've failed the mission.

268
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,356
What do I do?

269
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,150
Three... two... one...

270
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,152
Zero!

271
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,072
Gosh, you startled me.
What was that?

272
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,990
A countdown to my appearance.

273
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,409
Who stages their own appearance?

274
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,037
You had a deficiency of me, huh?

275
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,373
What are you? A vitamin?

276
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,959
Nope. I'm an essential amino acid.

277
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,919
Lame and cringe.

278
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,420
Why is it cringe?

279
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,840
Why do you always treat me like that?

280
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,175
How rude.

281
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,761
See? That move.

282
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,305
You cross your legs,
arm like this...

283
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,307
You're jam-packed with cringe.

284
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,392
It's my habit.

285
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,104
I can't move at all
if you keep analyzing my actions.

286
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,564
That'll kill my style.

287
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,690
You're so energetic.

288
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,444
By the way, why do you
always come talk to me?

289
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,572
A star like you.

290
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,619
Because I'm interested in you.

291
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:30,870
Huh?

292
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,748
Uh... Well...

293
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,417
I'm interested in your past.

294
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:36,793
Huh?

295
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,255
Miss Sumidagawa...

296
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,550
-Didn't you--
-Whoa, hold on.

297
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,927
There's nothing interesting
about my past.

298
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,597
I'm like... um, busy as a bee now.

299
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,724
-Got it.
-Wow, I'm so busy.

300
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,434
I need to check this video.

301
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,060
Do you wanna join me?

302
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,020
Sure.

303
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,607
Sorry.

304
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,899
For what?

305
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,818
It's my fault.

306
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,363
Can you at least scold me?

307
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,450
He's young but talented.

308
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,909
-Right?
-Uh-huh.

309
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,203
It's a waste to quit now.

310
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,503
Go for it!

311
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,339
-That was super loud.
-Sorry.

312
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,257
-I thought this was an arena.
-Huh?

313
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,010
-This room is clearly small.
-Right.

314
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,887
-But thank you!
-Gosh, that's loud.

315
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,972
This room is clearly small.

316
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,474
Oh my gosh!

317
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,517
-You were here?
-Keep it down.

318
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,896
Yuji? Is this a dream?

319
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,024
You usually pinch yourself.

320
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,322
Oh!

321
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,492
There you are.

322
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,702
What do you want?

323
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,746
As I said, I came to rescue you.

324
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,042
Your acting is so good.
Why are you quitting?

325
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,002
What's bothering you?

326
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,088
Nothing.

327
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:08,885
You see this guy?
He's my unreliable superior

328
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,303
who spins his wheels.

329
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,348
He's doing his best
while living in despair, and--

330
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,474
That's not true.

331
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,393
My life is pretty fun.

332
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,436
Go on.

333
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,398
Don't waste your talent.

334
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:24,984
Hey, wait.

335
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,448
I don't understand him at all.

336
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,493
Michiko, remember that day?

337
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,288
You said, "I came to rescue you."
What was that about?

338
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,499
That's... you know...

339
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,919
But what I didn't get

340
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:47,674
was why a rebellious boy reacted
and asked, "Can I trust you?"

341
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,218
Exactly. And not only that...

342
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,931
Um...

343
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,143
Otoya didn't work out, but...

344
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,479
Yuki Kaizuka is also
a very talented kid.

345
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,482
Can you consider his transfer?

346
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,444
-Hey.
-I'm Yuki Kaizuka. Nice to meet you.

347
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,695
Nice to meet you.

348
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,072
-He loves magic.
-I can make a dove appear.

349
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,284
This is him.
Something doesn't feel right.

350
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,910
-Wait.
-Huh?

351
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,289
Didn't he take over Otoya's lead role?

352
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,623
LION PRINCE

353
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,875
Wow, you're right.

354
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,462
Something fishy's going on.

355
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,884
We're the ones looking fishy.

356
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,307
Yuki was a pinch hitter,
but his acting was superb.

357
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,893
He just happened to do good.

358
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,898
But with almost no time to practice,
he did do good on stage, didn't he?

359
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,441
He's a future star.

360
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,276
Oh, stop flattering me.

361
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,031
I'm searching for that one mom
in every child agency.

362
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,492
An artistic lone-wolf mom.

363
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:56,993
Does she exist?

364
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,038
There she is!

365
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,123
Excuse me.

366
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,877
I found hope
in the bold line of your bangs,

367
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,462
so I've come to talk to you.

368
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,630
Huh?

369
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:16,429
I want to ask about
the recasting of Otoya Moriguchi.

370
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,228
It's not Otoya's fault.

371
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,021
Huh?

372
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,899
Otoya is always a kind boy.

373
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,986
But Yuki and the other boys tease him.

374
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,446
You're right.

375
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:39,828
I've seen Yuki, who was punched,
and his cronies bully Otoya before.

376
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:48,837
Thank you so much
for taking the time for an interview.

377
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,090
If Toyo Productions would take him in,
we couldn't ask for more.

378
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,258
Right, Yuki?

379
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,343
I want to go catch bugs.

380
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:59,264
You're such a child.
Will you get it together?

381
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,015
That's perfectly fine.

382
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:05,436
Children who can be their natural selves
tend to do well in auditions.

383
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,983
I'm Santa Kimura from Toyo Productions!

384
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,152
They avoid kids like that.

385
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,779
It isn't intentional.

386
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:20,034
Can we have
a private interview with Yuki?

387
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,078
Huh? Uh... sure.

388
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:30,044
Ah, I can't wait to play outside.

389
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,881
What's a private interview?

390
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:33,965
Is it tasty?

391
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,469
Drop the act.

392
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,346
-Huh?
-Uh-huh.

393
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,931
I'm not acting.

394
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,474
I can tell. Drop it.

395
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,518
Okay.

396
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,438
Yuki.

397
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,524
We're actually...

398
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,402
police officers.

399
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,570
Huh?

400
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,406
We were posing as managers.

401
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,491
We investigate bullying.

402
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,494
Bullying is a criminal act.

403
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,497
You'll get arrested.

404
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,543
You'll go viral online,
get severely roasted,

405
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,172
they'll identify your house,
throw rocks, and curse at you.

406
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,423
You understand?

407
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,216
Yes.

408
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,178
I'm glad you're obedient, Yuki.

409
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,889
You are sorry, right?

410
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,058
Yes.

411
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:30,063
That day, why did Otoya punch you?

412
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:35,443
Because... I said something
that made him angry.

413
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:36,778
What did you say?

414
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,907
"You're out of your prime."

415
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,202
Why would you say such a thing?

416
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,537
I wanted to play the lead role.

417
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,414
I see.

418
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,335
You worked hard,
so you wanted the lead role, huh?

419
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:54,796
Yes.

420
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,093
If you fake tears,
I can tell you're not sorry.

421
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,636
Okay. I'm sorry.

422
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,722
Someone said
you'll get to play the lead

423
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,933
if Otoya got into a fight, right?

424
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,477
No.

425
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,646
-Inspector Kimura.
-Yes?

426
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,730
Handcuff him.

427
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,108
Tough luck.

428
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,818
No, wait...

429
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,986
-Hurry.
-Alright.

430
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,073
Wait.

431
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:24,993
My mom...

432
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,412
What about her?

433
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,456
Mom said...

434
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:35,336
Mom said, all I needed to do
was push his buttons a bit.

435
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,006
Mom said so.

436
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,635
I'm terribly sorry.

437
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,138
His mother needs to apologize.

438
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,223
I'm very sorry.

439
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,726
Maybe you pushed yourself too hard.

440
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,728
Huh? You're consulting "her"?

441
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,481
Children are listening,
so I won't say anything, but...

442
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,691
What do you mean?

443
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,652
Don't worry.
It's just my imagination.

444
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,490
Anyway, don't drag children
into a mother's scheme.

445
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,534
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

446
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,579
You've apologized,
so that's enough for us.

447
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:11,956
Right, Otoya?

448
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,004
Otoya.

449
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,089
I want to ask you again.

450
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,633
Do you really want to quit acting?

451
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,767
You want to continue,
don't you, Otoya?

452
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,606
Please let him continue.
I beg you.

453
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,485
Otoya, how do you feel?

454
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,614
I like your acting.

455
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,700
It's very raw.

456
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,037
Good for you.

457
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,540
That's your priority when acting.

458
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,751
You don't have to say that.

459
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:58,836
You love acting, huh?

460
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,714
Let's continue.

461
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,759
We'll make sure that
you can continue acting

462
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,428
in a bully-free environment.

463
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:10,890
Um...

464
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,560
Will a manager
always come to the site?

465
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,229
Yes, of course.

466
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,898
You don't like that?

467
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,275
No, not at all.

468
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,820
It's a deal, then.

469
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,988
Yes. Thank you very much.

470
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,241
Thank you very much!

471
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,617
Be quiet.

472
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,078
Oh, I'm sorry.

473
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,290
As a mother, I know
it must have been tough,

474
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,210
but from now on,
we promise to look after him.

475
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,419
Don't worry.

476
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,088
Thank you very much.

477
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,805
That's messed up.

478
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,557
It's not funny.

479
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,601
They did apologize to Otoya,
but I swear

480
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,146
that manager and mom
are having an affair.

481
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,398
I should leak it to the tabloids.

482
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,859
Kid actors live
in a world full of drama.

483
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,111
But the transfer was a success.

484
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,698
Parents of kid actors
are so absorbed, it's frightening.

485
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,284
Was Mom like that?

486
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:13,661
I wonder...

487
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,539
-Let's say...
-Uh-huh.

488
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,919
Let's say you and your father
are both drowning in the ocean.

489
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,881
What kind of situation is that?

490
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,424
It's just an example.

491
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:31,929
If you're both drowning,
I'd choose to rescue you, Miwa.

492
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:35,808
Okay.

493
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,727
Should I be happy?

494
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,272
That's how I feel.

495
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,274
-Got it?
-Yup.

496
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,155
More than the job,
she cared a lot about me.

497
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,033
She made Dad drown in the ocean.

498
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:53,534
What do you mean?

499
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,244
It's an example.

500
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:01,125
Lucky you.
I don't remember much about Mom.

501
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,462
She's watching over you.

502
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,882
It's her monthly anniversary.
Let's pray.

503
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,519
Hey, Sis?

504
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,104
Yeah?

505
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,608
If you could see Mom,
what would you tell her?

506
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,361
Hmm...

507
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,780
That's tough.

508
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,077
Maybe "Thank you"?

509
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,919
STAGE NAME: OTOYA MORIGUCHI

510
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,882
Otoya and his mother dropped by
to introduce themselves.

511
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,221
These are "delicious cookies"
from a shop near their home.

512
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,015
Simple is best, huh?

513
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,268
Mission accomplished.

514
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,936
I said it's a piece of cake.

515
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,188
Are you sure you poached him?

516
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,606
Absolutely.

517
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,899
What's worrying you?

518
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,693
I'll say it again.

519
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,362
You must poach him properly.

520
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,990
Is this a riddle?
You're making no sense.

521
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,367
Look up "poaching" in the dictionary.

522
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:26,752
Cookies, eh?

523
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,923
Poaching...

524
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:37,430
"To persuade someone talented from
a different organization to join yours."

525
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,016
Yeah, I did poach him.

526
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,689
You won't look cute if you glare.

527
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:47,982
Huh?

528
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,984
Tired? I can backflip.

529
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,944
Out of the blue?

530
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,364
Star backflips.
Sumidagawa happy.

531
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,574
What was that?

532
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,118
Sumidagawa happy.
Me happy.

533
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,038
You sound like a beat-up robot.

534
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,789
My image was a caveman.

535
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:04,915
Oh, really?

536
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,459
Whichever works.

537
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,336
-Beat-up robot it is.
-Thank you.

538
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:13,924
How's the kid actor?

539
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,971
They walk on eggshells around adults
and have to comply with industry rules.

540
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,098
It's tough for a kid.

541
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,436
Adults. Rules. Tough.

542
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,897
Stop talking like that.

543
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,691
-Can't stop.
-Turn back into a human.

544
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,568
I can't. Help.

545
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,697
I forgot I was tired.

546
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,449
I'm glad.

547
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:51,170
Do you think the bar is high
for a kid actor to become an adult actor?

548
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:00,930
What's wrong?

549
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,266
Did you run out of robot fuel?

550
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,822
Miss Kandagawa...

551
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,450
Huh?!

552
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:37,925
Yuji called you "Kandagawa"?
Oh my gosh!

553
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,593
Why my real name?

554
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,929
Didn't you say
he was sleep talking?

555
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,056
Why'd that happen?
Are you two...

556
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,558
No, that's not it.

557
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,184
He just leaned on my shoulder.

558
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,687
Huh? He leaned on you?!

559
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,606
Which shoulder? Left or right?

560
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,650
Left? Which was it?

561
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,694
Hey, that's not important.

562
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,572
If people find out I'm Kandagawa,
I'll get fired.

563
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,783
Hmm. Sleep talking, huh?

564
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,786
Maybe he likes you.

565
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,288
No way!

566
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,293
You're so lucky.

567
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,549
Let's take a new headshot
that will boost your image.

568
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,885
-Get ready.
-Alright.

569
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,219
Thank you very much.

570
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,387
Let's do this.

571
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,099
Camera guy, chop chop.

572
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,726
Mr. Kimura, not "camera guy."

573
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,150
Instead of cute-looking,
let's try some mature-looking makeup.

574
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,154
Wow, looks good.

575
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,823
A trendy K-beauty look
you picked up in Korea.

576
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,074
Thank you very much.

577
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,328
Camera guy, you're lagging behind.

578
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,913
Don't taunt me.

579
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,041
Camera guy,
you should be pitching ideas.

580
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,834
So should you!

581
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,795
-Tuck your chin in.
-OK.

582
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:57,796
Ready?

583
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,509
Camera guy slash gaffer,
light up his eyes now.

584
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:02,885
What a sloppy request.

585
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:03,928
Ready?

586
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,555
It looks great.

587
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,599
I love it.

588
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,642
Thank you.

589
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,604
Otoya, you will spread your wings
and take on the world.

590
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,773
So remember these words.

591
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:17,358
"Package deal."

592
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,945
Chant these words,
and we will rush to your side.

593
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,781
Don't put weird ideas in his head.

594
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,825
Everybody here needs your help.

595
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:30,037
Repeat after me.
Package deal.

596
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,288
Package deal.

597
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,414
Package deal.

598
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,499
Package deal.

599
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,583
Package deal.

600
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,127
Say "package deal."

601
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,170
Say...

602
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:39,922
Package deal.

603
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,257
Well done.

604
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,841
Stop chanting it like a curse.

605
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,009
Please stop.

606
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,892
Toyo Productions will be
managing Otoya Moriguchi.

607
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,310
Keep him in mind.

608
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,812
He's available.

609
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,774
Yes, his acting is really convincing.

610
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,150
You're really moving?

611
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,653
Alright.

612
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:04,655
Why didn't you tell me?

613
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,825
I tried to, but I couldn't.

614
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,410
Tell me why.

615
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:13,247
My life would be boring
without you around.

616
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,207
-But...
-But what?

617
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,375
Then don't go.

618
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,336
DIRECTOR MATSUBA
MOVIE AUDITION

619
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,133
That's right.
The child actor, Otoya Moriguchi.

620
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,884
I was shocked, too.

621
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,263
The same issue happened
at his previous agency.

622
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,349
I'll talk to you later.

623
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,271
Eavesdropping?

624
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:43,861
I heard Otoya got cast in a movie,
so I came to congratulate you.

625
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,489
Then I came across you
doing something sickening.

626
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,203
Oh, by the way,

627
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,331
about your newbie manager.

628
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,124
What about her?

629
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,209
She smells like trouble,

630
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,962
so keep her on a short leash.

631
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,757
You better not trouble us.

632
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,760
Especially Yuji Sanada.

633
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,848
Are your instincts good?

634
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,225
Or is she just full of potential?

635
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,104
In any case, I'm not her guardian.

636
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,940
Sorry to bother you.

637
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,818
Reiko, the representatives are here.

638
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,153
Alrighty.

639
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,825
DIRECTOR MATSUBA
KICKOFF MEETING

640
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,706
Be yourself and you'll do just fine.

641
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,666
Okay.

642
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,838
Huh? His mom?

643
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,174
I told her not to come.

644
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,845
-Hi there.
-Hello.

645
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,389
I'm glad I came.

646
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,183
All the parents are here.

647
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,187
Oh, that's because they belong
to child talent agencies.

648
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,148
We're managing Otoya, so don't worry.

649
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,858
Uh, but...

650
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,238
It's Day 1, so just today.

651
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:12,282
Starting tomorrow,
he should come alone.

652
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,794
Why would you say that?

653
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,255
You're being annoying.

654
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,216
Say more, and I'll punch you.

655
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,093
I'm serious.

656
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,636
Kota, don't lie.

657
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,639
I know you wanna stay with us.

658
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,517
And watch Stand By Me--

659
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,936
Isn't something off about Otoya?

660
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:43,856
Really? Like what?

661
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,942
Otoya, you can act more annoyed.

662
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:53,657
The thing is, Taiga knows that
Kota is hiding his true feelings.

663
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:54,742
Thanks, guys.

664
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:56,994
What's wrong?

665
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,832
It seemed like you were
forcing yourself to concentrate.

666
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,500
Otoya.

667
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,919
You were awesome.

668
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,256
But I think you got a little tense.

669
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,507
Right. Sorry.

670
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,261
Director, I'm truly sorry about that.

671
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,306
My son was a bit nervous.

672
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,599
Oh, right.

673
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,851
It's the first rehearsal,
so don't worry.

674
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,186
I'm very sorry.

675
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,605
I'll make sure he practices at home.

676
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,816
I promise this won't happen again.

677
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,359
Oh... sure.

678
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,908
She was always with him,
so I bet it's hard to let go of him.

679
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,451
You're right.

680
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,371
Mothers tend to put their kids
before themselves.

681
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:46,627
I bet once Otoya settles down,
his mom will come to understand.

682
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:53,091
Otoya, do you want to practice
today's scene with me?

683
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:54,885
I'm fine.

684
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,263
I'll make lunch starting tomorrow.

685
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,641
You're allergic to shrimp.

686
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,434
I'll take it out.

687
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,147
You're really okay without me?

688
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,944
If you're worried about the acting,
I'll talk to the director--

689
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,070
Will you shut up?

690
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,787
"TENDER ADOLESCENCE"
SAKI GOTO

691
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,331
Touch up your makeup in 30.

692
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,374
Okay.

693
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,005
Hello? Hi.

694
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,799
Hello, Michiko?

695
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,551
Can you come to rehearsal?

696
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,760
How dare you!

697
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,388
Is that Otoya? Otoya!

698
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,850
I'll be fine, so please go.

699
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,602
I'll be right there.

700
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,648
We're terribly sorry.

701
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,526
Why did he fight?

702
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,195
I don't know the reason.

703
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:59,116
But Otoya threw the first punch.

704
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,745
It's to show my appreciation.

705
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,582
F... Fine then.

706
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:09,459
I'll take this today,
but from now on...

707
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,463
Another fight, huh?

708
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,340
There has to be a reason.

709
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,758
Last time, it was bullying.

710
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,470
Perhaps it's because
you haven't poached him yet.

711
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,432
I said I poached him.
We signed a contract.

712
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,811
Poor boy. Where's Otoya now?

713
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:29,605
His mom took him home.

714
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:39,197
I was hoping
that you could rescue that boy.

715
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,658
You're so oblivious.

716
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,537
Of what?

717
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,957
Can we both agree...

718
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,711
that you blew the mission?
Ka-boom.

719
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,588
What's that tone?

720
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,929
-I know why Otoya punched the boy.
-Why?

721
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,138
It's about his mom.

722
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,765
His mom?

723
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,060
There's this tell-all influencer
named Goda Random.

724
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:13,440
Today, I've got some juice
on the popular kid actor "O."

725
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,526
I received a tip-off about him
that'll blow your mind.

726
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,615
"O" successfully changed agencies
without hassle, because...

727
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,868
his mom bribed her way to a contract.

728
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:28,205
It's so dark, it's not even funny.

729
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:32,209
Those in the child acting industry
knew that he landed every role

730
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,336
because payments were made.

731
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:38,215
No way, no way...
No freakin' way.

732
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,552
You storm out and storm back in.
What a busy lady you are.

733
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:43,804
"No way" what?

734
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:47,975
Who else but you would sell
fake news to a tell-all influencer?

735
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,143
He never said "Otoya."

736
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,313
Even a monkey would know
that he's talking about Otoya.

737
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,773
Take it easy.

738
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,236
Why don't you try one? It's good.

739
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,197
Cookies that Otoya's mother brought.

740
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,865
I don't want one now.

741
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,217
You're kidding.

742
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,595
When I said to "poach" him,

743
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,349
it meant to poach him
"from his mother."

744
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,353
Then why didn't you say so?

745
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,607
That mother is like cancer to Otoya.

746
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,027
Huh? How can you say that?

747
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,405
The proof is heading our way.

748
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,991
These are your lines.

749
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:55,250
Make sure to rip that mother
away from Otoya.

750
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:00,964
Mom, wait.

751
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:01,965
Mom!

752
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,717
Otoya, you be quiet.

753
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,343
Saigawa!

754
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,428
Stop it.

755
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:13,018
Where's Saigawa?

756
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,521
Is this some kind of joke?

757
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,565
You're in on this, huh?

758
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,443
You tipped Goda Random off
about the money.

759
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,196
But it's the truth, isn't it?

760
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,201
I don't want your dirty money.

761
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:34,206
I'll be his manager starting today.

762
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,083
I'm terminating the contract.

763
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,751
You still don't get it?

764
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,047
If you do that... you'll crush Otoya.

765
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,548
Huh?

766
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:49,096
Otoya should experience things
and be given opportunities to fail.

767
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,349
You're taking them away
and ruining his life.

768
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,728
Listen carefully.

769
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:01,233
You are like cancer to Otoya.

770
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,069
C... Cancer?

771
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,491
Hey! Stop running your mouth.

772
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,369
You don't know my mom.

773
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,245
Otoya!

774
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:19,209
Don't give me that
"poor little me" face.

775
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,627
Don't scold him.

776
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,711
Shut up.

777
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,298
You need to stop doing that.

778
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:29,678
You're not protecting him.
You're tying him down.

779
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,807
It's... for Otoya's sake.

780
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,183
It's for "your" sake.

781
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:39,896
You're shoving your dreams and pride
down Otoya's throat.

782
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,191
You hand out money
and hinder his growth.

783
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,235
All for your self-satisfaction.

784
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,531
Otoya.

785
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,285
You knew what Mom was doing, huh?

786
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,373
Answer me.

787
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,133
How do you really feel?

788
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:09,843
Tell me.

789
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:14,598
I...

790
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,642
I...

791
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,187
I want to continue acting.

792
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,400
I know I have to be more mature.

793
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,988
But I couldn't
stand them mocking Mom

794
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,324
after she worked so hard for me.

795
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,451
You're out of your prime!

796
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:39,706
His mom bribed the agency's CEO
to land him roles.

797
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,499
-That's messed up.
-Shut up!

798
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,003
Otoya.

799
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,216
You were taking advantage of it.

800
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:55,597
If you had told her, "Stop doing it,"
none of this would've happened.

801
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,605
At home, you take it out on her
like a boy going through puberty.

802
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,317
Take that childish facade off.

803
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,113
Otoya...

804
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,201
You need to tell her.

805
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,171
If your parents die...

806
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,966
you can't thank them.

807
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,430
Mom.

808
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,769
I want you to put yourself first.

809
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:48,024
You sacrificed everything for me.

810
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,151
You and Dad aren't getting along.

811
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,949
If I could be by your side
to support you,

812
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,910
that's enough for me.

813
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:01,913
Mom.

814
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:07,377
You've given me everything
I'll ever need.

815
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,134
You always woke up early
to drive me to the site.

816
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,263
You woke up when it's still dark
to prepare my lunch box.

817
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,308
You were worn out...

818
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,269
but always practiced scenes with me.

819
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,689
You'd praise me or give me critiques.

820
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:33,278
You're the one who taught me
that acting can be so fun.

821
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:37,449
I...

822
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:43,496
I want to continue working as an actor.

823
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,499
But...

824
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,961
I want you to prioritize your own life.

825
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,550
Thank you for everything,

826
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:57,594
Mom.

827
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,848
Otoya...

828
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,413
I'm truly sorry for everything.

829
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:29,834
It's no longer
your responsibility to apologize.

830
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:34,005
That's the job of Toyo Productions,

831
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:39,302
and it's our responsibility
to change his attitude.

832
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,013
Thank you--

833
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:43,431
Thank you very much.

834
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,397
If you'll excuse us.

835
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:58,780
The poaching is finally complete.

836
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:01,533
Seriously.

837
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:05,161
When will you understand
a mission's true meaning?

838
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,497
Why can't you be straightforward?

839
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,959
Stop training me to
"find my way to the meaning."

840
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:12,877
Your next mission--

841
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,504
Forget it. Not today.

842
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,887
Sorry, do you have time?

843
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,181
What is it?

844
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,642
I want to take next Thursday off.

845
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,394
For you-know-what?

846
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,938
I thought your time was over.

847
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,023
No.

848
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,528
Not yet.

849
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,283
I'm not done as a comedian yet.

850
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,035
