1
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:07,216
Shino Asakura changed my life.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,094
I want to see you act one more time.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,930
There's no time.
Let's hurry up and start rehearsal.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:13,848
Yes, ma'am!

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,267
I don't...

6
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,895
deserve to be called "Mom."

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,648
Mom, what are you saying?

8
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,233
I'm not confident.

9
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,613
Of being called "Mom" by you.

10
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:31,991
The word...

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,495
pierces my heart like a thorn.

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,414
Okay.

13
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,751
That's her.
That's Shino Asakura.

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,753
I know that. Ouch.

15
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,963
And here we are
panicking over minor roles.

16
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,798
Once more, please.

17
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,218
Thanks to Shino,
I think it'll work.

18
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,428
It's not working.

19
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,806
The ticket sales are disastrous.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,433
Why? It's "Shino Asakura."

21
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,143
She's a "thing of the past."

22
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,104
You're kidding.
She's THE Shino Asakura.

23
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:05,357
For all ten days, the theater
is packed with empty seats.

24
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,401
At this rate, we'll go bankrupt.

25
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:10,321
Bankrupt?
What do you want me to do?

26
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,655
Cast Yuji.

27
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,242
He was in Ms. Kawashima's
project proposal.

28
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,829
Starring in a play
produced by his rumored girlfriend

29
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,331
is risky but viral-worthy.

30
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,249
That won't happen.

31
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,170
Meaning you have other means
to sell out tickets,

32
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,922
ace producer Kandagawa?

33
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,590
I'm wearing many hats.

34
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,301
Print and post fliers and posters
with Shino's name,

35
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,305
getting social media comments,
meeting with the wardrobe team, and--

36
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,016
-Rolling, and action!
-Hire catering and...

37
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,017
Listen to me!

38
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,607
Hey, what happened
to "Good morning"?

39
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,736
Mr. Janitor, you're so pesky.

40
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,865
I'm so sorry, this girl is so--

41
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,450
-Again.
-Yes, sir.

42
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,285
Hey, what--

43
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,080
No, my heart's not feeling it.

44
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,665
Specifically?

45
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,333
Use your instincts.

46
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,085
Yes, sir.

47
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,003
Again.

48
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,632
Tada!

49
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,884
Wow, this is amazing.

50
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,387
The battle begins.
Let's brace ourselves.

51
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,806
Alrighty!
You bought water, right?

52
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:19,723
TO-DO LIST

53
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,600
Sorry.

54
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,602
-You promised to.
-Sorry!

55
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,820
She's "my" daughter.
I can do whatever I want.

56
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,655
But still...

57
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,366
Quit lecturing me,
you petty teacher.

58
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,034
I'm her father.

59
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,411
Stop, stop.

60
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,662
That was terrible.

61
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,164
Don't make me repeat myself.

62
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,040
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,668
Can you be specific, please?

64
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,713
If actors can't think for themselves,
they're doomed.

65
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,883
How long's your career?
You have zero taste.

66
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,092
I need water.

67
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,760
Wait a minute.

68
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,178
Huh?

69
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:01,765
You're complaining
without giving them instructions.

70
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,101
There's no meaning to that.

71
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,270
Why are you even here?

72
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,814
To lower their motivation?

73
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:13,068
You suddenly appear
and criticize the director like a boss?

74
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,863
You call yourself a "director"?

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,448
Give me a break.

76
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,367
You're not cut out for it.

77
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,078
Get lost.

78
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:28,000
You're all a load of crap.
I'll be happy to leave.

79
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,217
Uh... what do we do now?

80
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,678
Should I go after him?

81
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:40,804
Forget it.

82
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,141
That felt refreshing.

83
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,770
Thank you, Shino.

84
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:49,980
Me too.

85
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:51,815
Thank you so much.

86
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,654
Shino. Shino.

87
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,914
Let's do it.
We're in this together.

88
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,376
The final out in the 9th
can turn a baseball game around.

89
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,961
We're a team!

90
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,837
I feel like we can do this.

91
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,340
With these members,
we can do this.

92
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm still freaking out.

93
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,430
Oh, I blacked out.

94
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,474
Shino, a few words, please.

95
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,643
-Me?
-Yes, who else?

96
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,020
A few words, then.

97
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,065
You up for it?

98
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,359
Y... Yes.

99
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,527
You up for it?

100
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,695
Yes!

101
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,487
You up for it?

102
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,738
Yes!

103
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,448
-You up for it?
-Yes!

104
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,952
If you're up for it, raise your fist!

105
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,876
KATSU SANDWICHES
COURTESY OF SHINO

106
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:40,049
"You" are Akane's mother,
no matter what people say.

107
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,134
Good.

108
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,890
Takeru, you've become
the perfect teacher.

109
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,183
I appreciate it.

110
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,186
Working with this team
was a blessing.

111
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,190
Stop crying.

112
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,943
Don't cry yet.
Save it for the closing day.

113
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
Mom...

114
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,657
You keep rejecting me.

115
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:09,495
No, it's because I care about you.

116
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,205
Do you hate me?

117
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,124
Why would you say that?

118
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,305
Sorry, the rehearsal room
closes at ten.

119
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,307
I need to practice more.

120
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,393
I'm not ready to perform
in front of an audience.

121
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,315
-I'll help.
-Huh?

122
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,984
I could tell something was wrong.

123
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,112
I'm a Shino fanatic, so.

124
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:47,241
I've memorized every single line.

125
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,994
Wow...

126
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,038
A read-through first?

127
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,331
Okay.

128
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,042
Stop. Stop it.

129
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,007
You said we were family, Mom.

130
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,178
You said
we'd stay together forever.

131
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,557
Was everything a lie?

132
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,851
No.

133
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,687
I love you.

134
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,356
You...

135
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,776
You are my everything.

136
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,820
So why does it
have to be like this?

137
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,489
I also...

138
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,868
wanted to stay with you forever.

139
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,706
I wanted to keep
watching you grow up.

140
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,876
Sharing laughs with you.

141
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,045
Sharing tears with you.

142
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,593
I wanted to argue with you.

143
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,513
And to make up with you.

144
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,308
Then stay with me.

145
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,560
Why...

146
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,104
Your happiness...

147
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,821
Just be happy.

148
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,492
But Mom, being with you
is what makes me happy.

149
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,788
They're amazing.

150
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:18,916
They are.

151
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:25,881
Mr. Sanada.

152
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,679
No matter what it is,
don't live with regrets.

153
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,476
-Here.
-Thanks.

154
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,770
That was fun.

155
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,105
You're still talented.

156
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,651
I'm so flattered,
especially coming from you.

157
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,278
You have to continue acting.

158
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,823
I want to act alongside you.

159
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,285
It's truly an honor.

160
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,955
But you know...

161
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,875
My dream was
to get you back into acting.

162
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,463
Now that it has come true,
I'm overwhelmed with happiness.

163
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,260
And while pursuing that dream,

164
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,807
I happened to take a liking
to an odd job as a manager.

165
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,893
Is that so?

166
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,687
Yes.

167
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,238
You're not fit to be her father.

168
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,990
EVE OF OPENING DAY

169
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,618
I'm the one who's
biologically related to her.

170
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,162
Do you really love Akane?

171
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,665
Because I love her,

172
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,335
I'm going to use her
to my advantage.

173
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,839
Give Akane back!

174
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,842
Give her back!
Give Akane back!

175
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,970
Give her back!
Give Akane back!

176
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,432
Good.

177
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,268
Um, Shino?

178
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,687
When you kick Kohji,

179
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,731
can you kick higher?

180
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,108
-Sure.
-No, consider her age.

181
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,234
I can do it.

182
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,361
See?

183
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,285
-Prince Charming!
-What the heck?!

184
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,037
Here.

185
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:21,705
What's this?

186
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,790
Vitalium... Z!

187
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,209
-Cringe.
-I copied you.

188
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:27,669
Thanks.

189
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:37,304
What Ms. Kawashima did
was morally unacceptable.

190
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,140
Honestly, it's creepy.

191
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,310
Creepy, huh?

192
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,396
But...

193
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,274
If it weren't for Ms. Kawashima,

194
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,445
the Yuji I like
wouldn't have existed.

195
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,114
So, I can't completely reject her.

196
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,746
Did I slip up and say I like you?

197
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,749
Forget it. It's a lie.

198
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,086
Is it a lie?

199
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,841
It's not a lie, but...

200
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:20,055
But... this is an unfulfilled love.

201
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,569
Hey... about the play.

202
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,279
Yeah?

203
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,327
Nah. It's nothing.

204
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,371
Good luck. You got this.

205
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,332
Yeah. Thanks.

206
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,428
Mom, look at this.
It's Sis's name.

207
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,679
PRODUCER:
MIWA KANDAGAWA

208
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,306
Don't worry.

209
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,725
Everything's fine.

210
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,603
Damn Scumgawa!

211
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,943
She's living her best life.

212
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,955
I'd say it's 20% full.

213
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,540
OPENING DAY

214
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,876
At this rate, we're going bankrupt--

215
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,836
Will you give me some advice?

216
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,920
I'll give you one.

217
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,339
Yuji is still available.

218
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,176
I said I'm not casting him!

219
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,940
YUJI SANADA JOINED TODAY.

220
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,613
HIS FIRST COMMERCIAL.

221
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,947
HIS DRAMA DEBUT.

222
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,536
Not like that. Show your emotions.
One more time.

223
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,833
HE'S LOOKING GREAT.

224
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,001
A FULL-FLEDGED ACTOR.

225
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,465
FULFILL EACH JOB WITH DEDICATION.
YOU CAN DO IT.

226
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,889
Okay, sorry.

227
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:27,891
We're sorry.

228
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,603
Alrighty, guys, it's showtime.
Let's show them what we've got.

229
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,438
Actually, we have a problem.

230
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,607
Shino hasn't shown up yet.

231
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,359
She hasn't? Why not?

232
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:38,985
Hey, call her.

233
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,696
I've been trying,
but she's not answering.

234
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,077
Guys, Rin's calling me.

235
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,413
Hello, Rin? Where's Shino?

236
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,499
We're at the hospital.

237
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,836
Mom fractured her right foot.

238
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:57,921
Why?

239
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,966
Last night, she was
practicing her kicks.

240
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,468
"Kicks"?

241
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,347
When you kick Kohji,
can you kick higher?

242
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,269
Gotcha. If something comes up,
feel free to call us, okay?

243
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,229
Alright. Bye.

244
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,940
Does this mean...

245
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,151
the show is canceled?

246
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,452
Thank you very much
for coming today.

247
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,790
Our main actor, Shino Asakura,
was in an accident and injured her foot.

248
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,043
Therefore, today's show is canceled.

249
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,170
I deeply apologize.

250
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:41,965
I'm so sorry.

251
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,925
I need to go.

252
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,136
With a broken foot?

253
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,265
Why?

254
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,018
I'm family, too.

255
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,152
Shino.

256
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,157
I'm sorry
for my irresponsible remark.

257
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,034
I'm sorry.

258
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,705
I'm... truly sorry, everyone.

259
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,167
I'll make it up to you...

260
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,628
through acting.

261
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,172
-Starting tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

262
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,590
You can't with a broken--

263
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,799
Yes, I can.

264
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,718
I could've performed today, too.

265
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,053
The doctor said no.

266
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,763
It's "my" body. I'll decide.

267
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,556
The doctor's a liar.

268
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,224
It's not broken...

269
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,186
I can stand!

270
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,443
YUJI SANADA

271
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,536
You made the right call
as a manager.

272
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,206
Right?

273
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,459
Now, it's up to you.

274
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,711
Am I right?

275
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,089
Huh?

276
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,175
I'm conveying my message
through my back.

277
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,136
I can't hear a thing.

278
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,683
No regrets, okay?

279
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,114
Hey.

280
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,616
-Sorry to call you.
-It's fine.

281
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,746
Uh... it's about the play.

282
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,670
No, forget it.

283
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,216
Whoa, I would've regretted it.
Sorry.

284
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,139
Can I ask you?

285
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,558
What?

286
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,270
This is last minute, but...

287
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,608
Can you cast me in the play?

288
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,235
Huh?

289
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,079
I'm having a hard time accepting...

290
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,622
"MY BELOVED CHILD"
YUJI &amp; SHINO

291
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,499
that Reiko is creepy.

292
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,882
I know it's a risky decision, but...

293
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,552
As an actor, I feel that...

294
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,138
I need to be in it.

295
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,100
IT WILL DEFINE YUJI SANADA.

296
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,276
This play needs Yuji Sanada.

297
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,945
Will you be in it?

298
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,492
My pleasure.

299
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,622
Joining us to play Janitor B is--

300
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,123
Janitor B?!

301
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,710
Lord Sanada's playing Janitor B?

302
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,671
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

303
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,173
Likewise.

304
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,258
Thank you.

305
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,177
No, just a minute.

306
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,138
Change with my "Janitor A."

307
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:18,848
A's better than B.

308
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,767
I can't be "A" when he's "B."

309
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,268
-Change with me.
-No--

310
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,187
One moment, please.

311
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,273
Change with me.

312
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,818
Huh? No, I can't--

313
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,027
Originally...

314
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,616
it was your role.

315
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,370
-I can't--
-If the minor-role janitor is radiating,

316
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,497
the audience can't concentrate, so.

317
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,374
Take it.

318
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,377
-But--
-Let him act cool.

319
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,423
Alright.

320
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,052
I'll do my very best.

321
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,889
Uh, which is it?

322
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,355
Good job, Takeru.
You the man.

323
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,609
I won't allow you to cast Yuji.

324
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:12,735
Huh?

325
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,617
He must be on TV as the ambassador
for the Musashino Int'l Film Festival.

326
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,245
Huh? You said he was available.

327
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,705
Yes, at that moment.

328
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,790
Hey, this is messed up.

329
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,586
If he cancels,
it will damage his reputation.

330
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,757
He says he wants
to be in the play.

331
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,551
You didn't hear me?

332
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,177
If he cancels, it will--

333
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,846
He'll do the ambassador gig.

334
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,098
And the play?

335
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,226
-You give up?
-No, I won't.

336
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,686
He'll do both.

337
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,941
Are you drunk?

338
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,861
If an actor wants it,
I want to make it happen.

339
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,654
That's our job.

340
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,992
That's so unrealistic.

341
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,495
You'll "make it happen"?
That's not always possible.

342
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,789
I didn't say, "I'll make it happen."

343
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,042
"I want to" make it happen.

344
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,418
It's a shared wish.

345
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,463
That's the starting line
for a manager and an actor.

346
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,300
Miwa.

347
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,639
It's important to put
your feelings into words.

348
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,853
I...

349
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,774
I want to become
like Shino Asakura.

350
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,320
Please let me act.

351
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,207
Let's start by sharing that wish.

352
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,252
That's our starting line.

353
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,261
He'll be in the play.

354
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,948
Alrighty.

355
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,267
Yes, yes, yes...

356
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,272
I'm in black?

357
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,357
Only you can pull this off.

358
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,984
Anyone can be a stagehand.

359
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,777
-No, they can't.
-Stop playing.

360
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:03,031
Sorry for the trouble,
but I'm counting on you.

361
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,074
Our hearts are one.

362
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,285
As the lead actors.

363
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,620
I'm humbled by your words.

364
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:13,541
I shall become the best stagehand
in the history of Japanese theater--

365
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,257
Hello, everyone!

366
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,843
Gomi is here!

367
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,720
Mr. Gomi.

368
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,306
-Shino, long time no see.
-It really has.

369
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,600
-How's your foot?
-Not good.

370
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,018
Oh, my goodness.

371
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:38,399
Nice! I love the pre-show buzz
actors have before showtime.

372
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,567
I love it.

373
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,447
I contributed to the ticket sales.

374
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,785
I sold 27 tickets
to the dudes in my neighborhood.

375
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,286
We appreciate it.

376
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,456
I brought caramels for everyone.

377
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,624
Thank you.

378
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,750
Let's eat.

379
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,834
Eat up, guys.

380
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:58,795
But it's showtime.

381
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,130
Eat caramel and get pumped!

382
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,673
They have a show.

383
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,383
It's not caramel time.

384
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:05,885
Eat it.

385
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:06,886
Mr. Gomi!

386
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,187
The cast and crew of
"Crisis Control 3" will be here shortly.

387
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,438
They're here.

388
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:46,759
I don't...

389
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,096
deserve to be called "Mom."

390
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,434
Mom, what do you mean?

391
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,936
I'm not confident.

392
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,648
Of being called "Mom" by you.

393
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,445
The word pierces my heart
like a thorn.

394
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,489
Tell us about the film.

395
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:12,493
I worked with a team with
whom I've made numerous films...

396
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,580
Oh, no, we're screwed.

397
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,874
"Screwed" how?
What's going on?

398
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,003
The red carpet is going slow.
Yuji will be late for the play.

399
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,088
Relax, Santa.
Take a deep breath.

400
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,509
It sounds like
you're hyperventilating.

401
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:30,678
I can't breathe.

402
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,222
You want to get rid of me, right?

403
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:37,226
That's not true.
All I care about is you, Akane.

404
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,395
You're only a mom
when you want to be.

405
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,149
That's not true. Akane, wait.

406
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,150
Akane.

407
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,320
Kohji, I need you
to buy some time.

408
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,073
Thank you so much.

409
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,700
Thank you, too.

410
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,914
The cast and crew's proud smiles
lit up the red carpet on this special day.

411
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,499
The awards ceremony will begin shortly.

412
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,336
Okay. Thank you.

413
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,421
Thanks. Hurry, this way.

414
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:07,757
You're fast.

415
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:11,969
Put these on.

416
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,846
Like a baton?

417
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,264
This way.

418
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,269
You're kidding me.

419
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,104
What do we do?

420
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,105
Hold on.

421
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,524
Hold on.

422
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,902
-Akane!
-She's not here.

423
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,946
Where's Yuji?

424
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,822
Every time you lie, you wear

425
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,157
a cast on your foot.

426
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,451
Akane!

427
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,579
He's buying time with action scenes.

428
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,455
Impressive.

429
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,165
Akane hasn't decided yet.

430
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,501
I'll decide for her.
Let's go, Akane.

431
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,128
Akane. Come here!

432
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,298
Run, Akane, run.

433
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,300
Run, Akane, run.

434
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,637
Akane, where are you?

435
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,646
Hello, Santa? Where are you?

436
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,904
Hey, what's that crowd?

437
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,031
My fans sensed something.

438
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,157
We're screwed.

439
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,243
Ah, we're totally screwed.

440
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,036
Will you just calm down?

441
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,206
A blow to my body?

442
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,250
Punching me won't change anything.

443
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,501
I'm panicking.

444
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,171
But you managed
to land a punch in my liver.

445
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,799
You're underestimating him.

446
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,676
Who do you think he is?

447
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:38,681
He's the superstar of the century
whom I raised with loving care,

448
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:40,850
Yuji Sanada.

449
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,602
Ms. Kawashima.

450
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,897
I'm surprised you don't have
any crisis measures in place.

451
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,107
I'm ready.

452
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,528
Don't just stand there.

453
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,363
-Help her.
-Okay.

454
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,078
What a foolish
and reckless thing to do.

455
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,584
Because the play was your idea.

456
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,215
So, thank you.

457
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:17,803
Listen up.

458
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,473
Failure is not an option.

459
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,266
Yes, ma'am!

460
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,354
Hey, isn't that Yuji?

461
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,105
Run for it.

462
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,321
Hurry, run faster.

463
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:45,998
Who's that?

464
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,541
Don't look!

465
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,134
Mr. Sakamoto, what should I do?

466
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,512
Mr. Sakamoto?

467
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,472
Mr. Sakamoto?

468
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:09,355
Then I remembered what
Mr. Sakamoto, Akane's teacher, said.

469
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:14,902
"You" are Akane's mother,
no matter what people say.

470
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,321
What a smooth transition.

471
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,574
He cleverly arranged Yuji's lines.

472
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,036
Mr. Sakamoto also said...

473
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:28,040
I've never seen such love
between a mother and daughter.

474
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,920
Hurry, take it off.

475
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,797
Your sunglasses.

476
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,132
Time to change.

477
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,591
I'm closing it.

478
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,301
Alright, let's go.

479
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,678
You look fine!

480
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,224
Go, go, go!

481
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,475
Mr. Sakamoto...

482
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,280
You're her only "true" mother.

483
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:01,657
Indeed...

484
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,035
she has left this world.

485
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,248
But I'm sure
the time she spent here

486
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,417
was rich and meaningful.

487
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,962
That's because Emi...

488
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:21,552
she had you.

489
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,471
Mr. Sakamoto.

490
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,559
Mr. Sakamoto...

491
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,404
Akane.

492
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,407
Can you hear me?

493
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:46,869
I am...

494
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:51,999
your one and only mother
in this world.

495
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,338
I want to see you.

496
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,174
One more time.

497
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,719
And hold you tight.

498
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:07,556
In my arms...

499
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,808
Thank you very much.

500
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,436
How wonderful...

501
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,190
if I could do that.

502
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,532
Akane!

503
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,452
I'll join you there
when the time comes.

504
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,206
And when we meet again...

505
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,377
Will you...

506
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:42,550
Will you call me "Mom" once again?

507
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,762
Akane!

508
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,352
Akane!

509
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,419
Wonderful job.

510
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,214
How... was it?

511
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,135
Absolutely brilliant.

512
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,275
Are you alright?

513
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,945
The less I'm alright,
the better I can act.

514
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,781
That mindset is unhealthy.

515
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,866
You're right.

516
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,869
If I get injured and can't act again,
that'd be a problem.

517
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,370
Exactly.

518
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:59,460
Wait, do you mean
you'll continue acting?

519
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:04,673
By the way,
he's in really bad shape.

520
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,259
It's Mr. Saigawa's fault.

521
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,220
I can't understand
what that guy wants to do.

522
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,432
Maybe to start from scratch,

523
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,518
he destroyed everything.

524
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:21,231
The current TOYO Production, and...

525
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,109
your past.

526
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:27,696
My past?

527
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,074
He never changes.

528
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,993
All he said was, "Miwa, Miwa."

529
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:35,287
You made me jealous, you know.

530
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,341
You mean... everything?

531
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,527
Hello?

532
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,696
It's another scoop.

533
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,198
Huh? Which one of us?

534
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,658
Me? Yuji?

535
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,077
Mr. Saigawa.

536
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:16,870
Huh?

537
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:22,876
Workplace harassment
in our company has come to light.

538
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,755
This has certainly caused
trouble and concern

539
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,008
among our clients,
partners, and fans.

540
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:33,220
I truly apologize for that.

541
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,141
Is everything in the article true?

542
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,142
Yes, they are.

543
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,102
You admit to the harassment?

544
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,228
Yes, I do.

545
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:44,231
Forcing Miwa Kandagawa
to change her name?

546
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,525
Forcing her to do grueling work

547
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,236
in exchange for her debt
and revoking her dismissal?

548
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,446
They're true.

549
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,742
What about Yuji Sanada's manager,
Reiko Kawashima?

550
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,327
It said you emotionally abused her.

551
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,455
That's true, too.

552
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,750
To add to that...

553
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:07,379
the roasting of Masae Tanabe's
radio show and Kohji Wada's commercial.

554
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,798
And your favorite story of all.

555
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:15,053
Yuji Sanada and Miwa Kandagawa's
love scandal was set up by me, too.

556
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,556
What's the point of doing all that?

557
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,059
The point?

558
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,686
The same as you.

559
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,772
Because it goes viral.

560
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,857
Customers want it.

561
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,655
Each and every one of you
feed off scandals, don't you?

562
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:39,703
What about Miwa Kandagawa's
public apology 17 years ago?

563
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:44,416
Is it true it was
part of your so-called "scenario"?

564
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:46,877
Of course it was.

565
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,299
Children don't say those things.

566
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,009
Excuse me.

567
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:55,886
Go ahead.

568
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,101
Do you feel remorse?

569
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,321
Let me ask.

570
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,409
Did I do something THAT bad?

571
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,045
What were you thinking?

572
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,592
I absolutely agree.

573
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:40,597
Making a 12-year-old
endure an environment like this.

574
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,475
What was I thinking?

575
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,726
No, I mean...

576
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,772
I'm resigning from TOYO Production.

577
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,485
Aren't you starting from scratch?

578
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,449
That's an awfully romantic scenario.

579
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,785
But in reality,

580
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,957
a pathetic power-wielder is leaving
due to an anonymous whistle-blower.

581
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,251
That's all there is.

582
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,088
Cut the crap!

583
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,843
I said, cut the crap.

584
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:21,638
You're the one
who's been stuck for 17 years.

585
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,934
We've all moved on.

586
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,773
But you?
You're clinging on like a kid.

587
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,153
Look at me.

588
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,823
Look at me...

589
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:46,914
I'm finally comfortable enough
to move forward.

590
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,169
I blame you.

591
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,172
It's all your fault.

592
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,676
After "managing" my life,

593
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,845
you just disappear?

594
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,723
What about your life?

595
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,477
Who'll look after "you"?

596
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:17,903
Come on...

597
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,823
Don't quit.

598
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,635
I expected you
to be more mature by now,

599
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,721
but you haven't changed at all.

600
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,392
You're still the same.

601
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,771
Like a kid.

602
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,571
Apparently, you still...

603
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,117
need lines fed to you.

604
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:09,913
Read it.

605
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:20,465
Read it for me.

606
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,691
I...

607
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,278
I'm the Dept. 4 Director,

608
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,282
Miwa Kandagawa.

609
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,580
TOYO PRODUCTION'S
SAIGAWA STEPS DOWN

610
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,292
PRESIDENT
YOSHIHIKO GOMI

611
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,169
Due to the mayhem,

612
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,672
people's opinions have changed.

613
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,050
You're being pitied.

614
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,303
They're insisting that
you were all victims.

615
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,349
It's time for a clean start.

616
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,935
I, President Yoshihiko Gomi,

617
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,729
will hereby announce
the new appointments.

618
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,482
Director of Dept. 1.

619
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,027
Reiko Kawashima.

620
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,781
Provide backup for Yuji
when necessary.

621
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:09,533
Huh?

622
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,035
I've already spoken to him directly.

623
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:14,871
I appreciate it.

624
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,707
Director of Dept. 2,
Chiaki Komatsu.

625
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,378
Director of Dept. 3,
Kimura... Kimura...

626
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,547
-Santa, sir.
-Right, Santa.

627
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,675
And Director of Dept. 4.

628
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:30,095
-Miwa Kandagawa.
-Yes, sir.

629
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,265
Accordingly, the company's name
will change as well.

630
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,725
The new company name is...

631
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,440
SEKAI Production.

632
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,068
From "Toyo" (the East)
to "Sekai" (the world).

633
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,028
I have a shoot to go to--

634
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,238
One more thing.

635
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,575
We've established a new section.

636
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:53,660
An overseas branch.

637
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,537
Say hi to...

638
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,331
Mister S.

639
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,835
Nice to meet you. I'm Mister S.

640
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:04,629
But that's...

641
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,215
It's GY Pork from South Korea.

642
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,967
In collaboration with GY Pork,

643
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,930
we're managing new talents
who can succeed on a global scale.

644
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,809
To all of you
working like ants in Japan.

645
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:23,273
Find, nourish, and manage
talents who can make it big overseas.

646
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:25,775
I'm counting on you.

647
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:27,527
Alright then.

648
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,208
Miss Yamazaki,
do you have gifts for today's shoot?

649
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,420
SEKAI Production's online drama...

650
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,130
is a go!

651
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,633
The main actor is...

652
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,766
-Lord Tsutomu.
-Tsutomu again?

653
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,812
Remove your glasses.

654
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,022
Okay.

655
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:05,982
Tsutomu.

656
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,151
Until you and I become one.

657
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:09,903
Are you up for it?

658
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,655
I am.

659
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,666
I didn't expect to be
the first global candidate.

660
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:26,211
I'm gonna miss hearing
your cringe remarks.

661
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,882
I want to see how far I can go.

662
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,467
All the best.

663
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:37,764
As the Dept. 4 director,
I'm going to help them grow, too.

664
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:38,848
Good luck.

665
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,437
I'll send my cheers on a shooting star,
so look up at the sky.

666
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,522
Thanks.

667
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,489
That'll probably be
your last cringe remark, huh?

668
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,461
After shining worldwide,

669
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,880
I'll return to Japan.

670
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:14,968
And when I do...

671
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,681
Let's get married.

672
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,434
Huh?

673
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,566
Our unfulfilled love.

674
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,069
Let's fulfill it.

675
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,160
Hold on.

676
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,788
I need to say something.

677
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,668
I...

678
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:52,547
I really like you, Yuji.

679
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,763
YOU AND ME

680
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,893
Come on, you two.
Will you please smile?

681
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,520
I can't.

682
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,065
I'm too nervous, I can't.

683
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,652
You don't need to smile
if you don't want to.

684
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,737
You're always like that.

685
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,030
Natural is always best.

686
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:01,116
-You'll look cuter.
-You're on.

687
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,075
Coming.

688
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:03,743
Are you ready?

689
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,578
Rolling...

690
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:09,582
And... action!

691
