1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,216
I'm Michiko Sumidagawa.
I've been assigned to Department Four.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,635
I'll change. From child star
Miwa Kandagawa...

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,470
to Manager Michiko Sumidagawa.

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,764
-Scout?
-Find a newbie.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:14,640
You narcissist!

6
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:17,560
You know nothing about me.
Don't talk like you know me!

7
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,229
So, is this the moment
a star is born?

8
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,735
Thursday she has a costume fitting...

9
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,905
I'll confirm and call you back shortly.

10
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,700
Okay. Thank you.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,035
CALL BACK SHORTLY

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,205
I understand. Thank you and see you soon.

13
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,667
Are managers always this busy?

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,210
If they have a rising star.

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,338
Shall we take a deep breath?

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,631
DEEP BREATH

17
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,342
Don't turn that into a task.
It's just my advice.

18
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,219
SANTA'S ANNOYING

19
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,512
Now that's just rude!

20
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,098
Tsutomu has an audition at 2:00 p.m.

21
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,725
Crap! Can you cover for me?

22
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,059
Huh? It's already time.

23
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,604
-Please!
-You don't need to stick that on me.

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,481
In any case, calm down, okay?

25
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,357
You seem out of it lately.

26
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,234
Sorry, Tsutomu. I'll be right there!

27
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,863
GREEN ROOM: SAKI GOTO

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,156
It's almost time...

29
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,659
Huh? No way. Hold on.

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,621
Were you trying to leave?
You were totally about to.

31
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,247
You were trying to flee, right?

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,208
I can't...

33
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,919
do this after all.

34
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,587
"Can't?" Wait!

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,132
You know, getting this commercial
was quite frankly a miracle.

36
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,468
So I can't with you saying "I can't."

37
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,763
But I'm not cut out for
a fashion commercial. And with...

38
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,725
with a superstar.

39
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,311
Test one. And... go!

40
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,482
-Cut!
-On standby.

41
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,608
Let's try again.

42
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,986
So she can smile, after all.

43
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,739
She doesn't think she's good at it.

44
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,035
Our Yuji is taking the lead.

45
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,996
You don't need to say thank you.

46
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,164
Thank you.

47
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:06,919
It's fine. I just wondered if you noticed.

48
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,504
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

49
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,923
I don't want you to apologize.

50
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:15,177
I know she's getting positive reviews.

51
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,597
And she's gotten a late-night commercial.
That reminds me!

52
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,933
-She just went to Korea, right?
-Yeah.

53
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,477
That director has been giving
more offers lately.

54
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,479
That's amazing.

55
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,982
That has made news
and led to more offers.

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,152
Her schedule is completely packed,
or rather, she's filling in every inch.

57
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,114
Saki's your first talent
to manage, right?

58
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,490
Yes.

59
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,160
I'd be a bit more afraid if I were you,

60
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,454
"Afraid?"

61
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,047
Great job.

62
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,426
I was so nervous,
my guts turned inside out.

63
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,144
You're not...

64
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,647
forcing yourself, are you?

65
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,567
I am.

66
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,694
Of course I am.

67
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,073
But... this...

68
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,660
is something that feels good.

69
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,707
I see. Right? I'm glad.

70
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,585
And now, look.

71
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:33,088
I snatched up this
beauty product commercial.

72
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,174
"Whitening."

73
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,844
I'll make sure the schedule's
not too crazy. Well?

74
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,722
Michiko.

75
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,308
I...

76
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,518
Can I have a word?

77
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,273
Go ahead.

78
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,818
Sorry, you must've been surprised
by a star's sudden appearance.

79
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,406
By the way, here's my new book,
if you'd like.

80
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,036
Yes! That scream gives me power.

81
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,080
Page 38.

82
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,583
Thank you... so much.

83
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,376
Of course.

84
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,544
Is this book filled with
phrases like that?

85
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,505
Real cringe stories.

86
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,714
-Hey.
-"Cringe IRL."

87
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,841
You're the only one who can't relate.

88
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,594
"When the sun sets, a star appears."

89
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,012
-Awesome, right?
-What is this?

90
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,807
Stars in a night sky.
That's totally normal.

91
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,183
I get it!

92
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,768
Right? I told you.

93
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,396
I don't get it. Anyway, thank you.

94
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,855
You can have it.

95
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,940
I'm okay.

96
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:33,941
I've signed it, look.

97
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,193
-It's wasted on me.
-"Wasted?"

98
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,903
Isn't this situation weird?

99
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,989
I'm not giving you something bad.

100
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,365
Quit being so stubborn.

101
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,950
I'll lose if I take it.

102
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,577
What kind of battle
are you fantasizing about?

103
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,912
Yuji!

104
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,791
Director Kuroshima. Long time no see.

105
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,502
You seem busy as always.

106
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,837
Not at all.

107
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,172
I'll always be free for your sake.

108
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,800
You say that, but you
turned down my offer.

109
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,593
There's no way I'd do that.

110
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,179
But you did, for the role in my next work.

111
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,931
-I gave you an offer.
-Huh?

112
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,350
And she said, "That timing is bad."

113
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,352
Manager Kawashima.

114
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,445
Hi, can I have a word?

115
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:20,779
What is it?

116
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,533
Why did you turn it down
without asking?

117
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,326
What do you mean?

118
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,455
I heard you turned down
Director Kuroshima's offer.

119
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,832
The answer wouldn't change
even if I told you.

120
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,875
You're fully booked.

121
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,127
You know I'm a fan of his.

122
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,629
If you knew, you would've
forced yourself, right?

123
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,842
If you got sick, that would negatively
impact your other jobs.

124
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,137
That's why first, you need to do
the work you've already taken.

125
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,515
That way you'll continue to be popular
as you have been until now.

126
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,101
As a result, everyone is happy.

127
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,228
But you still should've asked me.

128
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,065
Fine, fine. I'll do that next time, okay?

129
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,943
It pisses me off
how you treat me like a kid.

130
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,281
We're out of sync.

131
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,575
The two of us.

132
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,125
In that case, why don't you quit,
join another company, or go on your own?

133
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,756
Let's stop right there.

134
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,550
That joke's a bit harsh,
saying he should quit.

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,847
It's rare for Yuji to get so heated up.

136
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,642
Can entertainers just change agencies
or go independent?

137
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:18,147
Not too long ago, it was unthinkable.

138
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,191
Stars would get pressured
from their previous agents.

139
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,863
Or have to step back from show biz
for one year after switching agents.

140
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,323
Dept. 4 is kind of like that already.

141
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,117
We're in business, baby!

142
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,578
-Just getting warmed up!
-Hurry up with that.

143
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,581
Well, we aren't getting much acting work.

144
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,790
It's not that!

145
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,001
The work of an actor is to wait.

146
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,797
And in other words, by continuously
waiting, we're continuously working.

147
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,800
Old man, no need to get into
actor mode now. That's enough.

148
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,427
Thank you, everyone. No!

149
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,055
By waiting each day, we are training.

150
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,557
No more actor theory, okay?

151
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,185
"That's enough" means to stop
the blabber and jokes.

152
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,313
So are we also done
with your actor theory, Ms. Masae?

153
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,773
Just shut up for now.

154
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,443
Lots of people switch agents
or go on their own now.

155
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,821
This is the age of deciding
your own way of life.

156
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,700
So there's a chance he may leave too?

157
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,951
No way.

158
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,496
Yuji has been with Reiko for a long time.

159
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,417
Since he was a child actor, right?
So over 20 years.

160
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,629
Wait, Yuji was a child actor?

161
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:24,588
You didn't know?

162
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,258
Look here.

163
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,011
Wow! They look nothing alike.

164
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,971
He wouldn't quit so easily.

165
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,808
He knows what would happen
to the agency if he did so.

166
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,018
What would happen?

167
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,314
We'd probably all be fired.

168
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,567
I just heard a crazy word
whispered just now.

169
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,903
Please let's not get out of hand here.

170
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,448
One-third of Toyo's profits
are connected to Yuji.

171
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,786
If such a key player were to quit,
our survival would be in danger.

172
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,371
In such a tough situation--

173
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,790
Say no more. These thoughts
might turn to reality.

174
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,084
-Our job is to wait!
-Idiot!

175
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,586
You may as well be
on a sinking ship!

176
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,383
Of course if that does happen...
managers are also subject to dismissal.

177
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,177
Miss Sumidagawa.

178
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:13,971
A word, please.

179
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,809
Find the owner of this account.

180
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,020
"Cherry..."

181
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:26,400
It's the account of a so-called talent
who hints at industry secrets

182
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,026
and other unreleased info.

183
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,823
Hey, that's us! So in other words?

184
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,951
It seems to be a secret account
of one of our members.

185
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,748
Nothing wrong with having
a secret account or two.

186
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,669
No, we can't afford to be that carefree.

187
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,759
"My manager doesn't show sincerity."

188
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,887
"#I have many choices."

189
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,056
"#Will there be a right answer?"

190
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,394
"#Leave it all behind."

191
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,688
-Huh?
-Read top-to-bottom.

192
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:05,647
Top-to-bottom...

193
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,860
"I WILL LEAVE."

194
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,362
This is...

195
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,367
If they were going on their own,
we'd still have cards to play.

196
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,621
But if they transfer to another agency,
we can't turn a blind eye.

197
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,310
It's the same…

198
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,313
Rolling, and…

199
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,836
This must be the person
who took the photo.

200
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,965
And it's the same T-shirt

201
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,259
that Yuji is wearing.

202
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,568
Hold on.

203
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,737
What are you doing here?

204
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,364
It's my secret base.

205
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,243
When I was a kid, I used to cry in here.

206
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,789
So what're you doing
now that you're an adult?

207
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,376
Nothing.

208
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,213
Were you crying--

209
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,631
Of course not.

210
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,175
Why are you always so blunt?
Be more considerate.

211
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,179
Would you like to get a drink?

212
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,474
I guess we shouldn't go out alone.

213
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,685
I'll be considerate.

214
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,160
Wow, you can drink!

215
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,494
I don't usually.

216
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,246
I wouldn't wanna mess with work.

217
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,289
Overachiever.

218
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,875
But are you okay to drink now?

219
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,418
This much is totally fine.

220
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,503
Well, I'm trying to stay in shape.

221
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,549
Oh, now that you mention it,
you were a bit chubby as a child actor.

222
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,717
-What?
-What?

223
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,303
You saw? How I used to be?

224
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,637
I caught a glimpse.

225
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,638
And? Did you...

226
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,808
Did you remember anything?

227
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,810
"Remember?"

228
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,937
Remember what?

229
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,365
That's only your second!

230
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:09,164
They all treat me like a kid!

231
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,334
Do you mean Ms. Kawashima?

232
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,419
Yeah, seriously…

233
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,340
She... really does.

234
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,133
I think your tongue's out of order.

235
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:24,763
She doesn't understand a thing about me.

236
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:30,685
I've always wanted to play a role
written by Director Kuroshima

237
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,606
about the dark side of human nature.

238
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:40,111
And I keep asking for those roles,
but she won't get any for me.

239
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,615
"Please get me those roles!"

240
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,411
So you don't feel sincerity
from your manager?

241
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,832
Right, no sincerity from my manager.

242
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,752
Yeah, you've totally got it.

243
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,338
Is that why...

244
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,714
you wanna leave?

245
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,551
What do you mean?

246
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,886
Since Ms. Kawashima said that.

247
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,482
Sorry--

248
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,693
You're kidding.

249
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,073
You're such a lightweight.

250
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,742
This is suspicious,

251
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,662
but I'll see how things play out.

252
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,798
YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE

253
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,155
YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE

254
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,663
Good morning!

255
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,956
Hey.

256
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,292
Isn't it cruel to leave a star like that?

257
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,544
That was reality TV-level right there.

258
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,255
Who would want to watch you sleep...

259
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,592
I guess, there are people who would.

260
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,677
Exactly. You've learned something.

261
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,889
I'm a walking TV program,
just as you said.

262
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,974
I didn't go that far.

263
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,604
Did I say anything? I can't remember.

264
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,106
About that, there's something I wanna ask.

265
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,734
I did say something, didn't I? Did I?

266
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,194
It's the Earl!

267
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,529
My Lord, in a place like this?

268
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,365
Don't hog the Earl to yourself!

269
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,034
How are you, sir?
Have some mineral water.

270
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,496
If you have any worries or problems,

271
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,665
please tell us, your humble servants.

272
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,168
We are your seniors after all,
so tell us your troubles any time.

273
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,419
You are so cool!

274
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,046
I want to support you from here!

275
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,383
I've always looked up to you,
but someday I want to catch up

276
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,967
and become a star myself.

277
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,094
Me too, I--

278
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,470
I have to get to work.

279
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,013
Excuse me.

280
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,558
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

281
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,103
We should've praised him even more.

282
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,479
"Praised?"

283
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,148
Yeah, by doing so every day
he'll feel good,

284
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,859
and then he'll never leave.

285
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,945
-That's our strategy.
-But...

286
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,198
This is just a possibility, but…

287
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,159
he might quit.

288
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,411
-What?
-What?

289
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,662
Don't tell anyone.

290
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,751
But this is Yuji's secret account.

291
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,170
Look at the first words.

292
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,715
"I will leave."

293
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,426
What about my salary?

294
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,969
Ya better say, "sayonara."

295
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,598
Since we'd be hung out to dry if he left,
let's change to a Threaten Him strategy.

296
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,559
I have a friend who's good at threats.

297
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,853
In any case, we should
stop him from leaving!

298
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,688
Let's do it!

299
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,022
Yeah!

300
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,357
-Stop him!
-Stop him!

301
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,863
Michiko.

302
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,865
What's up?

303
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,034
I have something--

304
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,123
Is your schedule too full? Hard?
Wanna eat this?

305
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,045
What is it?

306
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:32,260
Um… it's about the beauty commercial.

307
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,762
Oh, pretty great, right?

308
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,392
I… I want you to…

309
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,020
turn them down.

310
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,108
-I'm sorry.
-Hold on a second.

311
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,276
It's a commercial.

312
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,404
We worked so hard to get it!
You've gotta do it.

313
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,698
You're perfect for the part,

314
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,243
and the client understands we're going to
go with the natural you.

315
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,370
-"Natural…"
-Right.

316
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,499
I like you just as you are.

317
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,584
So I want to work together.

318
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,178
Go ahead. It might be important.

319
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,439
I'm… I'm sorry. Let's talk again later.

320
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,992
Hey, it's starting.

321
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,870
The interview with GY Pork.

322
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,874
Why did you come to Japan?

323
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,087
We've come with a big surprise
for everyone here.

324
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,797
What do you mean by that?

325
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,132
It involves our show, Sleuth Game 2.

326
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,094
Other than that, you'll have to find out.

327
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,345
Ugh!

328
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,181
GY Pork is out to get
Japanese talents again.

329
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,269
And I bet he'll make them
star in Sleuth Game 2.

330
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,897
"GY Pork?" Who's that?

331
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,816
You don't know?

332
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,236
He's the rep for a huge
talent agency in Korea.

333
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:17,740
Lately every time he's here,
he scouts another Japanese talent.

334
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:23,079
They say that he's taking another talent
this time around too.

335
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,710
"True Form?"

336
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,129
Oh, that's GY Pork's agency.

337
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,050
YOU HAVE ONE NEW MESSAGE

338
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,473
And that's why it's highly likely
that it's Yuji's account.

339
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,601
So he's contacting GY Pork's agency.

340
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,770
Hey, if he leaves, will I really be fired?

341
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,439
Sadly, you'll be the first to--

342
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,982
I don't buy this.

343
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,692
I'm in charge of Saki now.

344
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,361
Hey, write some more lines.

345
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,448
Ones that will stop him from leaving.
The usual stuff!

346
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:05,580
Very well... When the user is revealed,
say this.

347
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,668
"I see."

348
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,504
"So you're the one trying to leave."

349
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,881
"I'm glad."

350
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,008
You're not even trying.

351
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,718
This would just tick them off.

352
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,970
There's no time.

353
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,681
If you really want to stop them,
you'd better move.

354
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,392
That's why you should write
non-irritating lines--

355
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,685
Rolling, and…

356
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,020
action!

357
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,069
Nothing makes sense.

358
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,924
-Reiko.
-Hm?

359
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,425
What is this?

360
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,054
The role that I agreed to
has been changed.

361
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,265
You're not ready to play
such a dark villain.

362
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,559
Can you stop changing things
without telling me?

363
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,020
The director and producer have agreed.

364
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,940
I took this job because
I liked the original premise.

365
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,734
That is not what society wants from you.

366
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,239
This is the time for you to maintain
popularity and stay at the top.

367
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:25,326
You can take on that kind of role later.

368
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,121
Whatever.

369
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:30,581
Yuji.

370
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,419
Yuji.

371
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,509
I'll get straight to the point.

372
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,433
Is this your account?

373
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,981
It says that you will leave this agency.

374
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,151
What if it is?

375
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,490
I thought so…

376
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,160
Oh, I mean…

377
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,830
Dept. 4 and I,

378
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,333
we'll be fired if you leave.

379
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,336
So...

380
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,131
could you possibly...

381
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,551
not leave, or something?

382
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:29,307
Sorry, I know I'm being selfish.

383
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,726
But we've worked really hard too.

384
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,854
Though we make only
one-thirtieth of the earnings.

385
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,565
No, one three-hundredths.

386
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,442
One three-thousandth's?

387
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,028
-No, thirty-thousandth's!
-That's why you'd stop me?

388
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,824
You're the same.

389
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,576
You're like her.

390
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,289
No, wait!

391
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,375
Um…

392
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:03,883
I see…

393
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,888
So you're the one trying to leave...

394
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,564
Right…?

395
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,363
Wait!

396
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,828
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.
DO YOU HAVE TIME TOMORROW?

397
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,413
Now's not the time for this.

398
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,085
So it was Yuji's account?

399
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,255
He didn't deny it, so it must be true.
We'll be fired.

400
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,215
Why me?

401
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,717
You're probably in trouble too, Santa.

402
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,220
If Dept. 4 is dissolved, yeah.

403
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,180
You'll be left out on the streets.

404
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,766
Just let me decide what'll happen, okay?

405
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,396
But what are managers for, anyway?

406
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,275
We try our hardest, just to get cut off.

407
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,027
Don't abandon me…

408
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,208
I'm not getting through.

409
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,752
Please try again. I'll make some calls.

410
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:22,670
Understood.

411
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,506
Hello.

412
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,303
Did something happen in Dept. 1?

413
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,679
Goodbye,

414
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,598
my salaried life.

415
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,058
-Huh?
-The Earl.

416
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,979
He hasn't arrived on set.

417
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,941
He's not picking up or at home.
Everyone's panicking.

418
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,693
He's definitely leaving.

419
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,946
I should find a new place to live.

420
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,908
Michiko, do you have a big yard?

421
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,951
Even if I did, I wouldn't lend it to you.

422
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,954
Come in.

423
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,625
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

424
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,589
This... it's Yuji's secret account.

425
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,885
If you read the first words,
it says "I will leave."

426
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,638
Also,

427
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,808
I saw he'd been in contact
with GY Pork's agency.

428
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,562
-So--
-He's gone to GY Pork.

429
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:22,480
Is that it?

430
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,235
Is that fine with you?
We should stop--

431
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,987
An amateur like you shouldn't be worried.

432
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,531
First you should focus on your own work.

433
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,200
I'm doing my--

434
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,328
Is that so? Because it seems like
you don't know anything.

435
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,330
About this job...

436
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,083
or about me and Yuji.

437
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,335
You're the one who doesn't understand.

438
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,129
-Yuji said the--
-Reiko!

439
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,109
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,443
I overslept.

441
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,365
I thought so.

442
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,117
Where have you been?

443
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,286
My secret base.

444
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,623
My phone ran out of battery.

445
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,750
Did you drink?

446
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:26,961
Just one beer.

447
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,549
Listen.

448
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,968
You've missed one day.

449
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,889
Do you understand what that means?

450
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,058
Yes.

451
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,355
I'll go to the set.

452
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,149
I'll go too--

453
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:52,320
This is the first time
you've drunk alcohol before a shoot.

454
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:57,658
This might be my fault.

455
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,455
So I'll apologize.

456
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,790
You go home and rest.

457
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,712
Then when you're recovered, tomorrow,

458
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,590
you'll give your all
to the job you've taken.

459
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:16,594
Okay.

460
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,066
Here.

461
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,151
Thanks.

462
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,992
I thought you went to GY Pork.

463
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,369
Hm? Why?

464
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:45,956
Well… I saw you'd gotten messages.

465
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:51,962
Sometimes they call me,
so I try not to answer.

466
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,340
That's why I saved their number.

467
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,510
I see.

468
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:02,807
But you know, about that account.

469
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,770
That's not me.

470
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,313
Huh?

471
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,982
-So you're not leaving?
-Of course not.

472
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,028
Because we two are one.

473
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,699
If that's the case,

474
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,576
whose account is it?

475
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,495
Does it even matter anymore?

476
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,914
I need you to work properly for me.

477
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,750
You still owe me a hefty sum of money.

478
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,585
I'm hanging up.

479
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,254
I'm meeting Saki at karaoke.

480
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,173
-Karaoke?
-She wanted to talk about something,

481
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,633
at a karaoke place.

482
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,136
I see.

483
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,598
People who stutter
tend to stutter less while singing.

484
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:49,019
So they might go to karaoke
when they want to get pumped up.

485
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:53,649
Perhaps Saki has
something important to tell you.

486
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,734
"Something important?"

487
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,490
Thanks for waiting.

488
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,575
No problem.

489
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,712
You haven't noticed, have you?

490
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:19,550
Wishing on a starry night

491
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,634
Cherry

492
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,219
"Cherry..."

493
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,905
It has to be.

494
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,991
Here's your Korean cheese dog.

495
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,618
It has to be!

496
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:52,416
Um…

497
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,794
I have something I wanted to ask.

498
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,423
What is it?

499
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,055
I wanted… to take time off.

500
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:07,556
Time off?

501
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,267
From tomorrow.

502
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,853
-For five days.
-"Five?"

503
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:16,607
Actually…

504
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,776
I already got a plane ticket.

505
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,236
Hold on a second.

506
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,278
"Plane?"

507
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:26,951
First, can I ask why?

508
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,537
There's somewhere I wanna go.

509
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:33,499
Where?

510
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,753
Korea.

511
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,424
Why?

512
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:45,803
It's…

513
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,352
You can't say, huh?

514
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,984
Hey, did you think you could go
without giving a reason?

515
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,487
-N-no…
-In other words,

516
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,531
it seems like you can't tell me.

517
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,285
-Um…
-You can't take off like that.

518
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,330
It's true isn't it? I'm so stupid.

519
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,835
It hasn't been long
since we got paired up,

520
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:21,046
and I don't plan to talk about
gross things like trust.

521
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,966
I don't, but I…

522
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,301
Michiko--

523
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,388
Sorry. I'm the gross one here.

524
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,224
Ah, um…

525
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,768
Fine, you can go.

526
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,186
Do whatever you want.

527
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,315
Please.

528
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,399
Listen--

529
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,026
I don't want to!

530
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,737
I don't want to listen.

531
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,745
I… I'm…

532
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,914
I'm not an unfeeling object!

533
00:31:58,876 --> 00:31:59,710
Wait!

534
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,594
I'll have a beer.

535
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,263
I feel sick.

536
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,140
Here's some water.

537
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,558
Thanks.

538
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,729
Being a manager must be hard.

539
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,984
It's hard, infuriating,
frustrating, sad, lonely…

540
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,695
Maybe I ask for too much.

541
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,574
This book made it sound a bit nicer.

542
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:31,367
WORDS BY THE EARL
YUJI SANADA

543
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,452
You haven't read it?

544
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,789
Her interview was included,
Yuji's manager.

545
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,678
Because we two are one.

546
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,722
"Two are one…"

547
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,273
So that account was Saki's?

548
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:06,068
-Yeah…
-She's really leaving.

549
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,904
She's going to Korea today.

550
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,365
People aren't always what they seem, huh?

551
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:16,412
But I didn't expect her
to write in code like that.

552
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,166
It was super lame, wasn't it?

553
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,710
No it wasn't.

554
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,379
But there was a type of
off-putting lameness to it.

555
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,965
Like, "I'm different from everyone."

556
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:31,385
It was spiteful, arrogant,

557
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,346
but also empty. And--

558
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,807
I said it wasn't lame!

559
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,933
Sorry.

560
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,143
Why are you angry?

561
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,394
Aren't you overreacting?

562
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,521
I was fine when you thought it was Yuji.

563
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,441
But now Saki…

564
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:50,863
That goes to show how
little interest you have in me.

565
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,742
That T-shirt. Why do you have it?

566
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,911
This shirt is already
popular among his fans,

567
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,830
so it's not unusual to wear it.

568
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,208
So Saki is a Yuji-fanatic?

569
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,877
She never mentioned--

570
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:06,754
Hey!

571
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,548
I'm Yuji's fan too.

572
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,176
I always looked up to him.

573
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,680
-What?
-Do you know where Saki's from?

574
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,141
-Kokubunji.
-How about me?

575
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,101
Uh…

576
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,853
-Iwate, right?
-No.

577
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,897
-Gifu?
-No, it's…

578
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,982
-Shimane, right?
-Yamagata.

579
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,066
Sorry.

580
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,737
We were all off! And?

581
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,533
Yamagata's fruit.

582
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:38,952
"Cherry."

583
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,246
That's the account name.

584
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,540
In other words, it's--

585
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:44,708
My account.

586
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,752
You would write like that!

587
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,214
I don't care anymore.

588
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,966
It was nice knowing you. I'm leaving too.

589
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,885
Hold on, calm down!

590
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,764
Do you even have anywhere to go?

591
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,266
Anywhere is better than here!

592
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:02,935
Wait!

593
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,478
Wait, hold on!

594
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,731
So that account isn't Saki's?

595
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,858
I keep saying it's mine!

596
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,152
It's not Saki's….

597
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,407
I see.

598
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,537
So you're the one trying to leave.

599
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,790
I'm so glad!

600
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,139
Wonderful.

601
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,726
That was your best performance yet.

602
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:47,020
Not using lines, but your own words--

603
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,273
Okay, whatever. Anyway,

604
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,483
did you know from the start?

605
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,027
That it was Tsutomu's account.

606
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,281
I knew where he was from.

607
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,701
So what should we do?

608
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,619
Cherry might really leave.

609
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:03,954
Tsutomu will not leave.

610
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:07,958
He likes attention,

611
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:12,004
so he won't quit unless
everyone tries to stop him.

612
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,714
He wants to be missed.

613
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,341
That's pretentious.

614
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,634
I'm counting on you

615
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,511
to stop him.

616
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,432
Hey, but seriously,

617
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,142
do we really need to stop him?

618
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,980
I have confidence in him.

619
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,608
I feel like that confidence is misplaced.

620
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,568
That would be in regards to you.

621
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,739
You quickly threw away
the first person you were assigned,

622
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,867
and now you're trying
to make the same mistake.

623
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,078
You're similar...

624
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:47,539
to how I was back then.

625
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,418
No! I'm not like…

626
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,132
Fine, I'll stop him.

627
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,344
If I try to stop him he'll leave,
so I'll act like I won't.

628
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,262
Now for your lines.

629
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:05,849
By the way, have you read it?

630
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,437
Let's just sit.

631
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,813
Sit down.

632
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,783
Tsutomu, thanks for everything!

633
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,662
Right, thanks for--

634
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,915
Good luck at your new agency!
I'm rooting for you!

635
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,208
What're you saying? Stop him!

636
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,626
I'll carry your things.

637
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,003
Hold on, what do you think you're--

638
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:38,632
Don't be shy. I want to support you!

639
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,468
Wait!

640
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,221
Give it back!

641
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,014
I won't give it back!

642
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,184
What are you saying? That's mine!

643
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,437
It's my job to carry
my entertainers' bags!

644
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,190
Stop already and give it back!

645
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,193
What's happening?

646
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,532
Why don't you get it?

647
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,410
That's not what I want
out of a manager.

648
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,539
I want you to find me work.

649
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:13,125
Work that makes use of
my skills and personality.

650
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,919
Well, we've tried,
and you've seen the results.

651
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,046
It's not management
if there are no results!

652
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,175
Take me more seriously.

653
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,389
I'm not the agency's plaything.

654
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,434
I'm not an unfeeling object!

655
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,107
Do you have the resolve?

656
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,071
To be properly managed by me?

657
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,741
Yeah.

658
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,493
Didn't I tell you what I want?

659
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,537
That management is just make-believe!

660
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,914
The one-sided demands of a brat!

661
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,876
I'm asking if you have the resolve

662
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,797
to experience real management
that isn't so shallow.

663
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,592
Real…

664
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,011
management?

665
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,184
Where you and I become one.

666
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,562
I'm asking if you have
what it takes or not!

667
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:18,565
Do you have my book?

668
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,734
WORDS BY THE EARL
YUJI SANADA

669
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,446
WHEN TWO BECOME ONE...

670
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,783
If two become one,
there are no debts or favors.

671
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,120
They learn everything about each other,
butt heads, shed blood,

672
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,290
and still pour everything into each other.

673
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,293
Until I die.

674
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,211
UNTIL THE OTHER...

675
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,587
Until the other melts away.

676
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,048
Until the two become one!

677
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,052
That is…

678
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,638
my style of management.

679
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,140
Two…

680
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:55,477
become one.

681
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,313
Sticking together,

682
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:01,066
no matter what, forever.

683
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,319
Forever…

684
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:08,824
But that's exactly why

685
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,743
there must be resolve.

686
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,245
Both in you,

687
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:14,996
and also…

688
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:17,332
in me too.

689
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,089
Me too…

690
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:31,471
I wonder if I ever had resolve.

691
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:42,941
Where'd she go?

692
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:44,818
What's going on here?

693
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,904
-I don't know.
-Two…

694
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,865
become one.

695
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,703
It don't mean anything weird.
You got that, right?

696
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,874
Please let it be my misunderstanding.

697
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,222
Saki!

698
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,816
You're really going.

699
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,201
I'm sorry.

700
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:40,332
I didn't have enough resolve.

701
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,959
For two of us to be one.

702
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,382
I told you I didn't want to listen to you,

703
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,931
even though that's exactly
what I should've done.

704
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:01,686
What you want to do, what bothers you,

705
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,105
what pains you…

706
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:11,404
I should have asked you all these things.

707
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,034
-Michiko.
-Saki.

708
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:23,833
Don't go.

709
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,462
Don't go!

710
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,465
Stay...

711
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,844
Let me manage you.

712
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,140
Please.

713
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,146
I…

714
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:53,029
I want you to be my manager.

715
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,157
I want to try many things together.

716
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,959
-Great--
-After I get back from Korea,

717
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,378
I'll call you.

718
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,506
You're going?

719
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:13,675
You're still going?

720
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:15,510
After all that?

721
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,222
Yes, I have a reservation.

722
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,558
For what?

723
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,394
Spot removal.

724
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:28,023
"Spot removal."

725
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,774
-Spot removal.
-Spot removal?

726
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,234
Yes, spot removal.

727
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,320
Huh?!

728
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:34,863
In Korea,

729
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:39,075
there's a famous beauty clinic.

730
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,371
It's one of GY Pork's businesses.

731
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:45,999
When I went to Korea recently,

732
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:49,127
I saw so many Korean stars
that looked like porcelain.

733
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,296
I wanted to be like them too!

734
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,340
What spots? You don't have any!

735
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,759
They're just waiting to come out!

736
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,720
Who cares about that? Just use makeup!

737
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,847
Whether someone cares or not

738
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:02,807
depends on the person!

739
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:06,144
Why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

740
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,228
I couldn't!

741
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:11,775
Michiko, you said you like how I am.

742
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,278
You said to turn my insecurities
into strength.

743
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:17,280
That's another story!

744
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,532
I need to go!

745
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,911
Ugh, fine! Hurry and get out of here!

746
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,372
Saki!

747
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,375
Call me when you get back!

748
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,961
I want to hear a lot more about you.

749
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,760
Okay! I want to hear more about you too!

750
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,222
See you later!

751
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:43,765
Take care!

752
00:44:55,693 --> 00:45:00,865
Producer GY Pork has revealed
his new product, "GY Pork Sausages."

753
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:04,494
These are part of a collaboration
with Sleuth Game 2.

754
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:08,915
It sounds like Tsutomu...
has decided not to leave.

755
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:09,749
Yeah.

756
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:14,838
In the end, everyone stayed.
Nothing's changed.

757
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,339
"Nothing?"

758
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,591
I wonder.

759
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,470
Well, Saki's spots-in-the-making
may disappear…?

760
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,890
Anyway, it seems like she'll
get busier from now on.

761
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,768
Something so trivial
shouldn't shake you.

762
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,397
Sounds like you should learn
from Ms. Kawashima.

763
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,526
Hey, by the way,

764
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,736
how were you back then?

765
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:41,239
"Back then?"

766
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,534
You know, when I…

767
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,997
You mean when you killed Shotaro?

768
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,751
