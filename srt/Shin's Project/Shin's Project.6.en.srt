31
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,755
Detective, do you want Yun Dong Hee to get better?

32
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,265
Just enough to be coherent.

33
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:51,065
Because I have a ton of questions for him.

34
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:55,205
Mr. Shin.

35
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,545
At the time, I was certain about my investigation.

36
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:04,675
Even though it made me look like a conspiracy nut in the end.

37
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,785
I mean, I'm not saying...

38
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:11,555
it was unfair or anything.

39
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,455
I should get going.

You can't come in without an ID, sir.

50
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,835
- Stop it. - You need to leave.

51
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,705
Honey, we're making a scene. Let's not embarrass him.

Excuse me.

57
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:24,625

63
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:50,115
No wonder Judge Cho is so good. He takes after his parents.

64
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:53,955
Well, our Judge Cho is a spitting image of me.

67
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,765
Oh, no, it's fine. I've got it.

68
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,805
What are you two doing here without calling?

69
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:09,205
Well, your aunt called this morning.

70
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:11,375
She said you work at a chicken place.

71
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,405
Judges are incredibly busy.

72
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:16,745
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

73
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:20,445
Yes, that's right. Judges have a lot on their plates.

74
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:23,955
Exactly. And not everyone is cut out for that.

75
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:27,725
Judge Cho has only ever studied. He's never cooked a day in his life.

76
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,055
He can't drive, so forget about making deliveries.

77
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:34,125
Father. Judge Kim is busy, so let's go.

78
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,395
Not at all. I'm not busy.

79
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,935
Gosh. Let's just go.

80
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,335
I'll see you out.

81
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:43,805
Why didn't you tell us? That you're working with that judge.

82
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:47,805
Oh, I was going to tell you, but I've just been so swamped.

83
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,615
He was a sharp kid. He turned out great.

84
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,045
- Thank you. - Honey.

85
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:57,685
We've taken up enough of their time. We should go.

86
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:59,625
- Right, let's go. - Let go of me.

87
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,455
- What's gotten into you? - I'll leave when I'm ready.

88
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,925
Just one last thing.

89
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,835
You must really love fried chicken, Your Honor.

90
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:18,405
- Excuse me? - Your team eats chicken daily.

91
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:22,775
So whenever Pillip comes home, the whole house reeks of chicken.

92
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:29,655
I see. I'll be mindful, and we'll have beef.

93
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:33,225
- Oh, that's not what I meant. - I'm taking the picture now.

94
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:36,455
One, two, three!

95
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,565
- Have you eaten, sir? - Are you not eating?

96
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,365
- I did. - You did?

97
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:45,695
Working hard, are we?

98
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:48,635
I'm sorry, sir.

99
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:50,205
At least you know you should be.

100
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:52,105
Yes. My father...

101
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:55,575
insisted I send a proof shot to my aunt.

102
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,115
Why'd you have to drag your parents into it?

103
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,245
It was good to see them. It's been too long.

104
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,285
So then,

105
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:04,255
what did I do wrong now?

106
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:08,855
What did I tell you on your first day?

107
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,925
To become a good judge,

108
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,595
you must first become a good person.

109
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:18,065
- And? - Work hard. You have much to learn.

110
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:19,865
- And? - This place has great chicken.

111
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:21,305
It won't be a bad place to work.

112
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:25,575
- Not that. - Mr. Shin is eccentric,

113
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:26,875
but he's good at the job.

114
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,575
I think that was the last thing you said.

115
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:33,515
Right. Mr. Shin is eccentric.

116
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,385
He bends the rules instead of following them.

117
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:39,625
You're the one who told me he breaks the law without a thought.

118
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,125
And now, you're letting him rub off on you?

119
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,195
Me, sir?

120
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,525
What's Article 7, Section 2 of the Judicial Code of Ethics?

121
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,465
A judge must not join an organization...

122
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:50,665
with political objectives,

123
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:54,305
nor engage in election campaigns or compromise their neutrality.

124
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:57,575
I wasn't campaigning.

125
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,405
That crook on TV, Choi Woong Sik or whatever,

126
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,975
you said you wanted him to lose the election.

127
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,885
No, but I didn't directly campaign against him.

128
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:10,215
I only found evidence of his illegal activities.

129
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,385
Hanging out with Mr. Shin has made you a real smooth talker.

130
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:19,425
Is that a compliment?

131
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,535
Follow me.

132
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:33,675
I sent you there to learn how to be a real judge.

133
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,575
Not some book-smart elitist in a robe...

134
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:41,085
but a real judge who can see cases from the people's perspective.

135
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:43,985
But instead, you get caught on video next to an election candidate.

136
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:45,415
That's a misunderstanding.

137
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:47,925
Due to a false food poisoning claim, MFDS and Kkokkio came, so...

138
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:52,155
You should avoid all appearances of impropriety.

139
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,435
- Yes, sir. - You've worked hard with Mr. Shin.

140
00:10:56,835 --> 00:10:58,065
It's time to come back now.

141
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,065
You mean, right away?

142
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,365
Why?

143
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,175
Don't you want to?

144
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:08,905
No, it's not that. You said I need to approach the case...

145
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,015
from the perspective of the public.

146
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,815
I still lack practical experience and... Well...

147
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:16,985
And Mr. Shin is now teaching me the art of negotiation.

148
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:20,925
And that's a skill that's essential for mediating cases in the future.

149
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,085
Don’t stutter.

150
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,955
What's your point?

151
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:25,925
I'd like to train under him...

152
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:30,365
for just two more months.

153
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,065
Two months?

You don't even run. So why didn't you buy yours?

165

- What did you say? - Give me that!

166

Nothing's in Kim Yong Woo's name. Not his phone, house, or accounts.

181
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,155
He's probably using a burner phone or someone else's name.

182
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:09,255
He's so shameless, he could get away with even more.

183

Yes. If it weren't for Mr. Shin,

Ji Woo and Joon's fates could have been switched.

186
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:28,775
It's terrifying just to think about it.

187
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,745

00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:57,615
Hey, I'm not finished talking yet. Sit back down.

356
00:27:57,685 --> 00:28:00,425
- No, really, I'm good. - I said I'm not done talking.

357
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,725
Hey, Pillip!

358
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:05,425
- Squeeze every last cent. Got it? - Yes, sir!

359
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,325
- If he refuses, play hardball. - Yes, sir!

360
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:08,565
- Got it? - Yes, sir!

361
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:12,435
Sir!

362
00:28:14,035 --> 00:28:16,005
What? You don't think you can handle it either?

363
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:17,975
No, that's not it.

364
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:19,675
It's just...

365
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:23,045
By any chance, this child...

366
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:25,875
is he Mr. Shin's son?

367
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:29,985
(Child dead in drug-fueled playground hostage situation)

368
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:34,285
- What did Mr. Shin say? - I haven't had a chance to ask him.

369
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:36,955
I just thought you might know.

370
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:39,655
If you're curious, ask him yourself. Don't ask me.

371
00:28:39,955 --> 00:28:42,395
So that's why you were giving him that sappy look.

372
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:54,275
If you want to know something, find it out yourself.

373
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:56,745
If you're curious, ask him yourself. Don't ask me.

374
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:59,415
But how am I supposed to ask him?

375
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,415
"Mr. Shin, are you married?"

376
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,215
No, that's not it. "Mr. Shin, do you have children?"

377
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:07,015
That's even worse.

378
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,685
"Why did you go drinking with Judge Kim?"

379
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:12,155
I have no idea.

380
00:29:13,695 --> 00:29:16,495
If you're curious, ask him yourself.

381
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:21,665
What's up? Did something good happen?

382
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:25,175
Why are you staring at that wall like you're in love with it?

383
00:29:26,805 --> 00:29:28,975
Why so jumpy?

384
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:30,975
Did you squeeze him for that commission?

385
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,815
- Commission? - The old man asked us to work.

386
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:40,985
Aren't you coming?

387
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,655
Oh, coming!

388
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:51,595
Why are we here? Shouldn't we meet the parties first?

389
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:56,035
It's a lawsuit between friends. They know each other inside and out.

390
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:57,775
We're at an overwhelming disadvantage.

391
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:00,235
The key to any negotiation...

392
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:03,175
isn't what you say, it's what you know.

393
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,945
Are you any good with a camera?

394
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:08,285
Of course. Want me to take one for you?

395
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:10,485
Forget it. Just play your part.

396
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,435
Not all of the kids here are orphans.

397
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:27,235
"I'll be back in a month."

398
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:28,905
"Just stay for a year."

399
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:31,675
But they never come back, so this is their home.

400
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:35,475
What about Baek Seung Mu and Ko Jae Kyung?

401
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:38,875
Oh, Jae Kyung doesn't have parents,

402
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,985
and Seung Mu's mother left him here when he was seven.

403
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:44,715
They both aged out of our care and left to live on their own.

404
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,015
Were the two of them close?

405
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:50,755
Oh, yes. People used to ask if they were blood brothers.

406
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:54,265
I remember when Seung Mu first arrived.

407
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:57,095
He wouldn't eat or say a word.

408
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:01,605
Whenever he got upset, he'd hide in the corner and stay.

409
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:03,005
Seung Mu!

410
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:07,275
Seung Mu.

411
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:11,115
Found you. Now I'm...

412
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:12,715
coming in.

413
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:17,585
When I'd check on them later, I'd see them playing together inside.

414
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:23,455
To think those cute kids are all grown up now.

415
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,595
Not too long ago, Jae Kyung brought his girlfriend to visit.

416
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:30,495
And Seung Mu reconnected with his mom and moved into her building.

417
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:32,535
Oh, Jae Kyung lives in the same apartment building too.

418
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:34,465
- The same building? - Yes.

419
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,665
By the way...

420
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:41,575
which paper did you say you're from? I'm afraid I don't recall.

421
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,845
We're just a small publication,

422
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,045
so people tend to forget about us.

423
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,515
Hey, Reporter Jo.

424
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:49,785
When the article comes out, send it to her right away.

425
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:51,385
Will do.

426
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:56,555
What a shame.

427
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:58,555
A friendship torn apart over a security deposit.

428
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:00,195
It's not torn apart yet.

429
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:02,325
What makes you say that?

430
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:03,865
Didn't you hear them?

431
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,095
They said they live in the same apartment building.

432
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,565
Well, that's just a fact.

433
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:12,375
When Jae Kyung brought his girlfriend over,

434
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,545
he must not have mentioned his problems with Seung Mu.

435
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:15,945
He probably didn't want the director to worry.

436
00:32:16,075 --> 00:32:18,215
So what's the deciding factor in a negotiation?

437
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,145
Information, not words.

438
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:23,185
I'm really glad we came here.

439
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:26,155
You're being unusually agreeable today.

440
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:28,985
What are you talking about? When have I ever been difficult?

441
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:30,355
So how are things going with Si On?

442
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:33,395
What are you talking about? It's not like that between us.

443
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:35,895
I meant how is her GED prep going?

444
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,365
Hit a nerve?

445
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:39,865
I'm not being defensive.

446
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:41,005
Hey, hold on.

447
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:44,405
- Hey, I said let go so we can talk! - So what are you gonna do about it?

448
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:46,435
- I told you I'd pay you back! - Darn it.

449
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:48,945
You want to hit me? Go on, then. Hit me!

450
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:50,005
You jerk!

451
00:32:50,445 --> 00:32:53,615
Hey, you're so dead. You hear me?

452
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:57,285
Go on, kill me! Hit me! Just do it! I wish I were dead.

453
00:32:57,755 --> 00:33:00,515
- I swear I will... - Hey, what are you doing?

454
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:02,685
Watching the fight. Stay out of it.

455
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:04,725
- Go on, kill me. Just do it. - Sir, you can't just...

456
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:08,565
- I really do wish I were dead. - Oh, this is great.

457
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:13,435
Don't mind me. Keep fighting.

458
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:15,565
It was getting fun. Why did you stop?

459
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:17,005
What's so great about this?

460
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:21,305
Of course it's fun, my friend. If you can't enjoy a good fight,

461
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:24,745
- what's the point of living? - Who says something like that?

462
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:28,445
I do. What about it?

463
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:31,885
If you start a fight, you finish it.

464
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:35,885
It was just getting exciting. Man, what a buzzkill.

465
00:33:38,255 --> 00:33:40,355
Hey, you jerk! Baek Seung Mu, where are you going?

466
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:43,595
Excuse me.

467
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:45,265
Baek Seung Mu.

468
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:47,535
And you must be Ko Jae Kyung?

469
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:53,975
If you two are done fighting,

470
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,145
I need to have a word with you.

471
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:03,014
I've been under a lot of stress lately.

472
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,784
Is this apartment building really in your name?

473
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:15,224
Yes. It wasn't long after I aged out of the children's home.

474
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:17,254
My mom contacted me.

475
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,624
She apologized for not being there and offered me this building.

476
00:34:22,134 --> 00:34:23,534
And your friend, Ko Jae Kyung...

477
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:26,064
moved in with you at that time?

478
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,064
Yes.

479
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:31,244
I was in public housing before that, but had to move when my aid ran out.

480
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:33,874
Didn't you know the building was heavily mortgaged?

481
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:37,644
I just found out. The agent said everything was fine.

482
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,614
And since Seung Mu was the owner,

483
00:34:39,884 --> 00:34:43,254
I didn't suspect a thing. We're practically brothers.

484
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,724
What did you do with the deposits you collected?

485
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,324
It was a pretty hefty sum.

486
00:34:48,594 --> 00:34:50,454
I honestly don't know.

487
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,634
My mom handles all the money. I never even saw a cent of it.

488
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:56,534
But Seung Mu is the landlord.

489
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:59,134
He's not just some random person.

490
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:02,404
We grew up in an orphanage together. We know exactly how hard it's been.

491
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:05,304
This money...

492
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,714
is everything to me.

493
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:10,714
My wedding is in a month,

494
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:13,314
and I still haven't been able to tell my fiancée.

495
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:15,714
I never said I was going to stiff him.

496
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:19,284
My mom invested it somewhere. She hasn't gotten it back yet,

497
00:35:19,354 --> 00:35:20,724
so I asked him to wait.

498
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:24,864
He's said "soon" for six months! I was desperate, so I sued him.

499
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:27,394
I can't even sleep. I just jolt awake,

500
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,764
and sometimes, I honestly just want to die.

501
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,934
Do you know your mother's address?

502
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:39,104
Yes. I have her address, but...

503
00:35:39,174 --> 00:35:40,644
I've never actually been there.

504

(Haneul Apartments)

505
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,214
Ko Jae Kyung's apartment has only a single mattress.

506
00:35:49,284 --> 00:35:53,384
Baek Seung Mu had pill bottles, and his mood swings are extreme.

507
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:55,654
Why does it feel like they're both victims?

508
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,264
This whole thing spells trouble.

509
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,894
This is exactly why I can't stand that guy, Judge Kim. Seriously.

510
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,234
The judge is a good person. I'll work harder.

511
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:09,674
Oh, would you look at that? Sticking up for your own, are we?

512
00:36:09,774 --> 00:36:13,344
- The legal cartel at its finest. - Excuse me?

513
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:15,344
Unbelievable.

(National Legal Medical Facility)

515
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,434
You're back? You missed lunch. Where have you been?

516
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:38,034
I'm on a diet.

517
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:40,404
Does any of this make sense to you?

518
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:41,574
What part?

519
00:36:41,604 --> 00:36:43,904
Since we started our investigation a month ago,

520
00:36:43,974 --> 00:36:45,304
the number of victims has actually gone up?

521
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:47,844
That's because more and more leases are coming to an end.

522
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:52,184
After meeting with that victim, I've decided to buy my own place.

523
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:53,644
The whole thing just freaked me out.

524
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:55,414
Must be nice. Buying your own place.

525
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:59,554
- I need to get a loan first. - Must be nice, getting a loan.

526
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:01,224
This is it.

527
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,634
Looks like it's broken.

00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,374
Oh Mi Sook? Are you home?

529
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,604
(Bill payment notice)

530
00:37:17,674 --> 00:37:19,504
Oh Mi Sook? Are you in there?

531
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,214
No one lives here. It's just a registered address.

532
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:23,874
There are several months' worth of mail piled up.

533
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:29,514
Oh Mi Sook!

534
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:30,984
Anyone home?

535
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:41,394
I seriously can't make heads or tails of this.

536
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:45,004
Shouldn't this be written clearly to stop people from getting scammed?

537
00:37:45,534 --> 00:37:48,304
There's a senior collateral mortgage on the property,

538
00:37:48,374 --> 00:37:50,774
and all nine tenants are on rental deposit contracts.

539
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,544
On top of that, ownership changed from Oh Mi Sook to Baek Seung Mu.

540
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,074
It's a textbook rental deposit scam targeting a multi-family building.

541
00:37:56,144 --> 00:37:58,044
That's not how Baek Seung Mu sees it.

542
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:01,854
He thinks he can repay the deposits when his mom's investment pays off.

543
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:03,654
He's just naive enough to believe it.

544
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:08,224
I know, right? It's obvious his mom framed him and skipped town.

545
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:13,264
What mother abandons her son, and returns after 20 years for this?

546
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:14,964
A monster of a mother.

547
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,664
Well, she is awful. You're better off without her.

548
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:21,934
It's better for the child's mental health.

549
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:23,804
And another thing, not having a mom...

550
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,404
doesn't make you pitiful or messed up.

551
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:27,174
I mean, look at me.

552
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:30,944
You're really something else.

553
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:38,654
I'm just proud of you for solving those problems without nodding off.

554
00:38:44,924 --> 00:38:46,264
Hello, you've reached the fried chicken restaurant.

555
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,334
That's it! That's it!

556
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:49,864
You're here?

557
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:51,104
Come on!

558
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:54,404
Come on. Darn it.

559
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:57,274
- You couldn't even hang in there? - You play video games?

560
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,714
I was just killing time while waiting. So I played a bit.

561
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:04,684
Hey, but listen.

562
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,584
Where do you keep digging up these cases?

563
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:11,284
You think I picked them? It was Judge Kim.

564
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:15,594
Forget it. I'm allergic to court matters.

565
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,094
Does Oh Mi Sook have a record too?

566
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,664
No, but the guy she's living with does.

567
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,594
Three priors for real estate fraud.

568
00:39:22,864 --> 00:39:27,264
Besides that multi-family building she transferred to her son's name,

569
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:30,234
she currently owns more than 10 other properties.

570
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:33,644
Five of which are about to go to auction.

571
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:36,844
- So the guy's a broker? - Exactly.

572
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:41,454
There are these investment groups joined by word-of-mouth,

573
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:44,314
where they get tips on developments, sell properties,

574
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,724
and find properties you can get without paying a premium.

575
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:51,524
At first, they let you make a profit on little deals, bit by bit.

576
00:39:51,594 --> 00:39:54,894
But once you bite on a big one? They clean you out completely.

577
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:57,564
Hey, get me in there.

578
00:39:57,904 --> 00:39:58,904
Darn it.

579
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,774
What?

580
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,474
It's an exclusive group.

581
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:10,414
- Stop dissing me, man. - You're too small-time.

582
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,184
Hey, Mr. Shin.

583
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:17,614
Yes, Chairman Park. Where are you right now?

584
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:28,334
Why are you waiting out here?

585
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:31,634
His guest just left. He's waiting for you inside.

586
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:33,864
Okay.

587
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,084
What are you staring at?

588
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:49,854
Sir.

589
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:53,524
You know that credit card you have. The black one.

590
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,494
- Yes? - A card like that has no limit?

591
00:40:56,694 --> 00:41:00,124
What do you mean, no limit? The limit is whatever I can afford.

592
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,964
Why? You need money? Running for the merchant association?

593
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:09,574
That's way too small-time. I'm aiming for bigger fish this time.

594
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:14,814
Sure. Do whatever you want.

595
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,484
Just run your business properly.

596
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:20,414
And no more health inspections.

597
00:41:20,484 --> 00:41:23,584
What's the point, when you tell me not to make a profit?

598
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:25,224
My costs are too high.

599
00:41:33,564 --> 00:41:35,534
- Have a safe trip home, sir. - Okay.

600
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:45,244
Thank you.

601
00:41:49,344 --> 00:41:50,414
Madam Joo.

602
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:52,814
Are you free tomorrow, by any chance?

603
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,114
What for?

604
00:41:59,924 --> 00:42:01,994
The chairman wanted you to have this.

605
00:42:03,294 --> 00:42:04,294
Well...

606
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:05,694
Thank you.

607
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:15,174
He said be careful with the watch. It's a limited edition.

608
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:17,404
Right, I will.

609
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:26,214
He's so full of himself.

610
00:42:32,624 --> 00:42:35,494
This watch is ridiculously fancy.

611
00:42:39,294 --> 00:42:41,964
Oh, right. Now, where were we?

612
00:42:43,464 --> 00:42:45,634
I'm free tomorrow.

613
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:47,974
Perfect.

614
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:53,404
- He's practically robbing me blind. - What on earth is he up to now?

615
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:55,614
At least he's not moping around. What's the big deal?

616
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:59,084
You're loaded, so I guess it's fine.

617
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:01,714
Look at you, so generous with my money.

618
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:27,904
This doesn't look good on me, does it?

619
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:30,674
What are you talking about? You look absolutely beautiful.

620
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:35,984
Here, try this one on too.

621
00:43:36,284 --> 00:43:37,284
Come on.

622
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:16,654
Everything's ready.

623
00:44:17,694 --> 00:44:19,564
- Shall we go? - Okay.

624
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:23,434
I'll have the rest sent over. Just take this for now.

625
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:34,074
I've never done any of this before.

626
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:36,474
It was a first for me too, and I had a lot of fun.

627
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,484
But you seemed like such a natural.

628
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:42,454
I meant it's my first time shopping with someone like this.

629
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:46,424
My daughter is about your age,

630
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,654
- but I've never done this with her. - Why not?

631
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,424
She moved abroad when she was little.

632
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:57,764
But why do I need to go through all this?

633
00:44:57,834 --> 00:45:00,364
- Mr. Shin said it was for a date. - He did?

634
00:45:06,944 --> 00:45:08,714
- Glad you could make it. - Yes.

635
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:11,584
Mr. Lee.

636
00:45:12,014 --> 00:45:13,884
- How have you been? - Good to see you.

637
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,284
Thanks to you, I've made a fortune.

638
00:45:15,354 --> 00:45:16,614
Right. I'll swing by later.

639
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:32,834
What area are you interested in? Redevelopment?

640
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:35,234
Buildings? Or maybe auctions?

641
00:45:35,304 --> 00:45:39,104
No, I prefer something small-scale. Quick in, quick out.

642
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,804
But in high volume.

643
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:45,414
You think a lot like that gentleman over there with the glasses.

644
00:45:47,684 --> 00:45:51,624
I run a VIP group. I'll send you an invite.

645
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:53,684
Just enter the password written here.

646
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,694
You have my ID, right?

647
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:06,904
Of course. Everyone here is verified,

648
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,604
so getting in early is a surefire way to make money.

649
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:12,444
Thank you.

650
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:24,684
They're meeting right now.

651
00:46:24,684 --> 00:46:27,724
(Si On: They're meeting right now.)

652
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:30,708
(From Mr. Shin)

653
00:46:30,878 --> 00:46:33,908
Since Baek Seung Mu knows our faces, Si On, you go to the meeting place.

654
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:37,178
When they split up, follow Oh Mi Sook, then meet Pillip.

655
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:39,988
But, Mom, I told you Jae Kyung's getting married next month.

656
00:46:40,248 --> 00:46:42,088
It's for the deposit on their new place!

657
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:47,228
I'm so ashamed that I can't even face you or Jae Kyung.

658
00:46:48,158 --> 00:46:51,668
I just called the investment firm. They said to wait one more week.

659
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,028
They said if I pull out now, I'll lose 20 percent of the principal.

660
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,698
But you've been saying "just wait" for months now.

661
00:46:57,268 --> 00:47:01,738
This is killing me too. The market's awful, I'm losing money.

662
00:47:01,808 --> 00:47:04,308
Anyway, I'll get you the money next week.

663
00:47:05,108 --> 00:47:09,648
If I have to, I'll take out a loan to pay Jae Kyung's deposit first.

664
00:47:09,718 --> 00:47:10,818
I promise.

665
00:47:11,648 --> 00:47:15,318
- You mean it this time, right? - Of course I do.

666
00:47:16,888 --> 00:47:20,128
We'll go to Jae Kyung's wedding together.

667
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:21,358
Okay?

668
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:24,928
Let's go.

669
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,738
Check, please.

670
00:47:34,308 --> 00:47:36,108
They're leaving the cafe now.

671
00:47:37,008 --> 00:47:39,078
- Get home safe! - Okay, you too.

672
00:47:47,718 --> 00:47:49,858
Seung Mu is blowing up my phone.

673
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:54,488
I can't wait until the end of this week.

674
00:47:55,058 --> 00:47:58,728
I sent the documents this morning, so cash out and move our flight up.

675
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:09,238
What are you doing?

676
00:48:09,908 --> 00:48:11,578
That woman already left.

677
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:19,148
Are you coming or what?

678
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:30,098
Where are you off to? Got plans tonight? A get-together?

679
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,768
- What do you mean? I'm off to work. - Then why do you look so pretty?

680
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:38,198
I know, right? I startled myself in the mirror.

681
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:41,438
I was just so pretty. I barely recognized myself.

682
00:48:42,338 --> 00:48:44,838
No, I'm serious. Why are you all dolled up?

683
00:48:46,108 --> 00:48:47,108
It's for the date.

684
00:49:01,128 --> 00:49:02,128
Hey, you're here.

685
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,928
- What's up? - I just saw my mom.

686
00:49:07,198 --> 00:49:11,138
She'll pay the deposit next week. She'll get a loan if she has to.

687
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,868
Darn it. I'll believe it when I see it.

688
00:49:13,938 --> 00:49:14,938
It's not like this is the first time.

689
00:49:15,008 --> 00:49:16,278
She said she's really sorry.

690
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:18,448
She wants to go to your wedding with me.

691
00:49:18,648 --> 00:49:19,648
For real this time?

692
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:23,278
Yes. Listen, Jae Kyung.

693
00:49:24,218 --> 00:49:26,918
Please, just give her one more week.

694
00:49:27,148 --> 00:49:28,958
I'm sorry. My mom promised.

695
00:49:30,288 --> 00:49:32,628
Give me a break with the "my mom" excuses.

696
00:49:33,128 --> 00:49:35,058
Whatever. I should get back to work.

697
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:37,998
- Hey, Jae Kyung, wait up. - What is it?

698
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:43,898
Here, take this.

699
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:46,808
It's 10,000 dollars. Put it toward the wedding.

700
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:48,308
Where did you get this?

701
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:53,008
My pay and my part-time job. I broke into my savings for the rest.

I'm a landlord.

Okay.

- Hello? - I'm dropping the lawsuit.

712

Excuse me?

713
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:38,288
Did you get the deposit?

714
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:41,158
What? He's dropping the lawsuit without even getting the deposit?

715
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,598
Yes. Apparently, Seung Mu's mom promised it for next week.

716
00:50:44,228 --> 00:50:46,468
Seriously? And he's naive enough to believe her again?

717
00:50:47,298 --> 00:50:49,898
Okay, I'll go meet with Ko Jae Kyung.

Hey, you. What are you doing here? I saw you on the street earlier.

Why would I be following you?

724
00:51:15,328 --> 00:51:17,558
You've been following me since before the intersection.

727
00:51:23,668 --> 00:51:26,438
I was on a call outside. Have you been waiting long?

728
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:30,508
Oh, and you are?

729

No.

731

This lady keeps asking if I was following her.

732
00:51:36,878 --> 00:51:38,618
Do you have something to say to my girlfriend?

733
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:41,088
I must have been mistaken.

734
00:51:42,488 --> 00:51:44,318
