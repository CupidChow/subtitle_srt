00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,170
(This is a work of fiction)

3
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,570
Hey!

4
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,110
Shut that dog up!

5
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,110
My kid's studying, so keep it down!

6
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:13,547
Hey!

7
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:17,057
- You jerk!
- At least three times a day,

8
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:19,687
during roughly 35 years
of our working lives,

9
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:23,057
we face about 40,000
conflicts, big and small.

10
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,557
Move your car.
Why are you making such a scene?

11
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,767
The moment people can't
contain their anger,

12
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,997
- Hey!
- disputes and fights break out.

13
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:31,607
In those hair-trigger moments,

14
00:01:32,637 --> 00:01:34,567
it's best to read the room and walk away.

15
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:36,877
That's what Mr. Shinsaid.

16
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:42,947
Are you looking down on me
because I have a tiny shop?

17
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:44,377
Just take it all back!

18
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:46,617
Fine, I'll just stop getting
my supplies from you.

19
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:50,157
How dare that old hag point at me?
I've let things slide for a regular.

20
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:51,827
Pay me what you owe right now.

21
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:55,157
Who are you to call me an old hag?
You have no right to call me that.

22
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:56,957
When did I talk to you like that?

23
00:01:57,297 --> 00:02:00,097
If you take someone's goods,
you have to pay for them, right?

24
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,697
You've got to be kidding me.

25
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:06,607
Mr. Shin!

26
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:10,737
Go to the police station
and get the police.

27
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:15,817
He keeps leaving junk in my store.
All he gives me is worthless trash!

28
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:17,677
And now he's trying to play dumb about it!

29
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:20,087
And that's an excuse to
not pay for three months?

30
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:22,787
Call the cops or whoever you want!
Let's see who comes out on top!

31
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:25,357
Okay, you just wait! He's making the call!

32
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:26,357
- Hello?
- What?

33
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:27,757
Is this the Namhyung Foods head office?

34
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:32,567
I'd like to ask a question.
I'm a loyal customer of your milk,

35
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:35,097
but it seems the local distributor...

36
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:38,467
is supplying items that
are about to expire.

37
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:39,867
Can you tell me what's going on?

38
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,007
- Excuse me?
- Well...

39
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,077
The distributor's name?

40
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:45,707
(Maheon-dong Distributor)

41
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:47,807
Sir, you're the Maheon-dong
distributor, right?

42
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,647
When did I ever give her expired products?

43
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,887
When did I say you gave
her expired products?

44
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:56,557
I said they only had a few days left.

45
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:00,527
Hello? They hung up.

46
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:04,797
(Ttoli Super)

47
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:06,297
Oh, Attorney Oh.

48
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,397
Let me ask you something.

49
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,767
A friend of mine bought
some goods on credit,

50
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:15,607
but she's three months behind.
What's the best course of action?

51
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,477
Debt collection?

52
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:19,047
Oh my goodness.

53
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:21,377
A provisional seizure.

54
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:24,247
- Oh, that thing.
- That's horrible.

55
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,887
You mean they put seizure notices
on the goods so they can't be sold?

56
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:30,057
What? What seizure notices?

57
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:32,987
This guy must have had some spoiled milk.

58
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:35,727
Calling me this early in the
morning just to talk nonsense.

59
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:37,057
Okay. Got it.

60
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,097
Hey, how long have you known this guy?

61
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:41,937
We've been doing business
for over ten years.

62
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,207
You should take this chance to pay
what you owe and cut ties with him.

63
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:48,207
He'll be fired by corporate anyway.

64
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:49,837
What?

65
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:54,347
And you, sir,
instead of causing a ruckus here,

66
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:58,017
you should just sue her.
That's the cleanest way.

67
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:01,817
Like you said,
it's not like the products are expired,

68
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:05,157
and there's still time left, so if you sue,

69
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:07,687
you should be able to collect on
your unpaid balance right away.

70
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:11,557
Come on, it's not enough
money to go to court over.

71
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,897
But him getting fired seems a bit harsh.

72
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,597
Your son just got into college this year.

73
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:17,737
Why are you worried about that?

74
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:21,267
Gosh, I have kids of my own,
so of course I'm worried.

75
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:26,147
Unbelievable.
You were about to kill each other.

76
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:30,277
Fine, I'm out of it then.
Shake hands and make up, or don't.

77
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,787
Just make up.

78
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:34,687
- You don't sue someone you know.
- Right.

79
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:35,757
Right, you know each other.

80
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,687
Stop making a scene and
just shake on it already.

81
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:41,087
- You don't sue your neighbors.
- That's right.

82
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:44,157
- Oh, honestly.
- Make up.

83
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,727
- If you have any fresh produce,
- Let's go.

84
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:49,167
make sure she's your first delivery.

85
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:52,737
And if you have any extras,
give them to Ttori Super first.

86
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:54,407
And you.

87
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:58,237
If you owe me anything,
pay your tab on time.

88
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:03,177
Everyone here knows you're loaded.
Hey, kid, you know it too, right?

89
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:04,847
- Yes.
- Right.

90
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:08,887
As long as the produce is good,
I always pay right on the spot.

91
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,257
I'm not the type to
stiff someone on a bill.

92
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:15,357
It's not like I did it on purpose.
Sunshine Mart in the next town...

93
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:18,027
keeps placing huge orders
and then canceling.

94
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:19,397
So I'm left with all this extra stock.

95
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:23,337
Meat processed in unsanitary places
with no regard for standards,

96
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,507
and food made with ingredients
that are no longer fresh,

97
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:29,507
- are being sold unregulated.
- Let's see.

98
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:32,507
- A cramped, airless workshop...
- Goodness.

99
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,977
In a place with inadequate
sanitary management...

100
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,417
What a son of a wench.

101
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:40,487
People who mess with the
food we eat like that,

102
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:43,517
they should have every single
one of their fingers broken.

103
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,157
You watch this show too?

104
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:49,857
Yeah, it's pretty good.
I watch this, dramas and reruns.

105
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:51,827
Here, two dollars.

106
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,327
- How it ends up in our markets...
- Mr. Shin.

107
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:56,537
- What?
- and who's behind those...

108
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:57,867
A little something extra!

109
00:05:58,137 --> 00:05:59,137
You might be carelessly...

110
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:02,877
You really are the best.

111
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:06,047
Oh, honestly. Thank you so much for today.

112
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:09,047
- Sure.
- On-Site Pursuit starts now.

113
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:11,047

00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:26,827
(Shin's Project)

117
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,537
- It stings.
- What on earth happened to you two?

118
00:06:32,207 --> 00:06:35,107
- Did you two fight?
- I do not fight.

119
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:39,147
You can tell he can't fight
just by looking at him.

120
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:43,647
I graduated top of my police class.
I have a 3rd-degree Taekwondo belt.

121
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:49,617
It's not that I can't fight.
I choose not to.

122
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,257
What did you say?

123
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,457
Police university valedictorian.
He's just bragging.

124
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:57,757
What a show-off.

125
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:00,767
When was I bragging?
I was just stating a fact.

126
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:01,867
So was I.

127
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:04,697
Goodness.

128
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,777
But aren't you calling the cops?

129
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:10,237
It's obvious they're backed by someone.

130
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:14,577
If we call the cops,
the plate on the truck is probably fake...

131
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,277
and the driver's long gone.

132
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:19,747
Still, we can't just let this go.
That was attempted murder.

133
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:24,757
Who says I'm letting it go?
I never let bad guys get away.

134
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:29,327
I'm going to put them in misery.

135
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:32,727
Now,

136
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,467
I risked my life to get this.

137
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:37,797
This is it.

138
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,437
I'm busy as hell.

139
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:46,147
What is it?
I told you, no deliveries before 6.

140
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:47,677
Seriously.

141
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,677
(No Memory Card)

142
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:15,407
What?

143
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,177
- What is it?
- No, it's just...

144
00:08:18,947 --> 00:08:21,247
Aren't those the guys who showed
up at the convenience store?

145
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:25,947
Hold on.

146
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:28,817
Right.

147
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,857
- It is. It's him.
- Let me see.

148
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,127
Couldn't we find them by
tracing this license plate?

149
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,597
- Let's take this to the police.
- Pillip.

150
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:45,837
They're trying to kick out the
locals to build a resort...

151
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,607
run us over with a truck.

152
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:51,737
And they do it all without
getting their own hands dirty.

153
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,347
This is impossible without
someone powerful backing them.

154
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,317
How can you investigate if you don't
know who's pulling the strings?

155
00:08:58,077 --> 00:08:59,887
Do you know what's scarier than the law?

156
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:01,487
What? Your fists?

157
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,787
To me, nothing is scarier than the law.

158
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,687
That's your problem, kid.

159
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,157
What's so wrong with
living by law and order?

160
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:14,097
The problem is that you
don't even see the problem.

161
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,277
Let me see it too.

162
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:25,137
I really think it's a match.

163
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:32,187
Like I said, he's out on patrol.
He's not in.

164
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:33,947
I'm hanging up now.

165
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:36,617
What, is it that guy again?

166
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:39,957
I'll handle it, sir.

167
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:44,097
This is Maheon Police, Seobu Substation.

168
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:48,897
Listen. I told you, he's out on patrol.

169
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,367
You're making things very difficult for me.

170
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:54,807
I've got the phone. What do you want?

171
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:59,307
Hey, you little punk.
Who do you think you are?

172
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:03,647
Officer Choi?
You think this cop's a pushover,

173
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:07,887
but I'm a Senior Police Officer.
The Captain and I came up together.

174
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:09,687
What?

175
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:15,697
I'm coming to your house right now,
so you'd better not go anywhere.

176
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:18,627
I'm going to throw you in jail
for obstruction of justice.

177
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:22,567
You get out, I'll throw you back in.
Get out again. I'll do it again.

178

until the day I retire,

foot over the crosswalk line,

180
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:32,507
I'll bury you in fines and jail.
Understand?

181
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:33,577
Got it?

182
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:36,477
Unbelievable.

183
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:45,927
- How can I help you?
- Hi.

184
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:53,567
What are you doing here?

185
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:06,047
I didn't realize you were
working at a substation.

186
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:09,947
Well, you know, one thing led to another.

187
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,717
It's already been 15 years.

188
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:15,987
Is it because of what happened back then?

189
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:18,387
I suppose so.

190
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:21,927
It wasn't your fault,
Senior Police Officer Choi.

191
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:25,057
Please, just call me Detective Choi.

192
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,327
On second thought,
I'm not a detective anymore.

193
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,897
- Just call me Officer Choi, then.
- But just a minute ago,

194
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:36,137
you said you were Sr. Officer
Choi, and came up with the Captain.

195
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:41,107
There's a guy who calls us when he's drunk.

196
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:45,617
But he calls every single day
instead of sleeping at home.

197
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:48,687
He just throws fit,
and I was too angry before.

198

Anyway, what brings you here?

199
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:56,027
I'll get straight to the point.

200

I have a favor to ask you, Detective Choi.

201
00:12:01,497 --> 00:12:04,637
I'd like to ask you to run a
background check on this guy.

202

He agreed.

It must be because of your file.

210

left and the resort is being built.

No, an older guy I know just said if
I filmed a video and sent it to him,

00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,707
he'd cover the security
deposit for a shop in Seoul.

at it until I get married.

No. That's for the merchants.

00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:23,017
Not going to use your
right to remain silent?

343
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:25,587
Yes.

344
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
(Gangchun Salted Seafood Market)

345
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,930
I overheard him at the hospital.
When I confronted him later,

346
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,030
he said he was ordered to do it.

347
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,230
It's all my fault.

348
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,840
I felt so bad for him, having to
be raised by his old grandmother.

349
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,310
So I spoiled him rotten.

350
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,180
That's right.

351
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,980
We have to catch the jerk
who made my grandson do this,

352
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
and have Gi Beom...

353
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,420
pay for his crime.

354
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,460
Is the purchase of that
shopping center finalized?

355
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, there are one or two left,
but it's pretty much a done deal.

356
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,570
I heard a good spot opened in Mapo.
You should go check it out.

357
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,240
I already took care of everything
with the realtor there.

358
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,100
Thank you so much.

359
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,380
By the way, is it true they're
building a resort in Gangchun?

360
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,610
Well...

361
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,950
It's a global company called HI.

362
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,890
It's a global company, and I'm in the know.

363
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,320
Usually, for big projects like this,

364
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,290
you can't get them done without
help from public officials.

365
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,160
I helped out a lot on this one.

366
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:45,360
- So, what's in it for you then?
- Me?

367
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,400
Manager Lee got us the site cheap,
and settled the case out of court.

368
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,970
But there is one thing
that still bothers me.

369
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,940
Oh, you mean the leak of the
resort development plans?

370
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,610
You don't have to worry about that.
The contract is legally sound,

371
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,920
and besides,
projects like this take years anyway.

372
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,920
There's no evidence. None at all.

373
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,090
Shouldn't you start planning
for your kids' studies abroad?

374
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,930
Thank you.

375
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,700
Oh, and I've booked dinner
with Mr. Mayor for this week.

376
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Good.

377
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,630
Here you are, Mr. Mayor.

378
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,040
I look forward to working with you.

379
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,440
Don't mention it.

380
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,640
I'm the one who should be
asking for your support.

381
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,180
Thanks to HI Group, our Gangchun City...

382
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,480
is being reborn as a
tourism and leisure hub.

383
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,750
- To Gangchun City and HI Group!
- Cheers!

384
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,800
Hi. What is it?

385
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,270
- What's wrong?
- Sir.

386
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,940
Plagued by corruption from the start,

387
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,840
the Gangchun Resort project.

388
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,280
Now that the web of corruption and
its masterminds have been exposed!

389
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,920
We, the producers of On-Site Pursuit,

390
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,450
will hunt down every last
piece of the truth...

391
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,390
and ensure those responsible
are held accountable.

392
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,330
So, was there anything you found strange...

393
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,630
or suspicious at all?

394
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,860
They usually offer a premium on top.

395
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,630
My goodness, look at this ungrateful brat.

396
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,670
Kids these days...

397
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,940
should be punished.

398
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
Hey.

399
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,110
Oh Jin Ho told everything.

400
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,780
We have witnesses and evidence,
so come along quietly.

401
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,610
You punk. Who do you think I am?

402
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,550
- Let go of me!
- Hey, he's making a run for it!

403
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,980
Get that punk!

404
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,220
Last February, we received a tip...

405
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,760
about the moggot seafood and
later aired a report about it.

406
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,660
While we meant to raise awareness
of poor food distribution,

407
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,700
we have recently discovered...

408
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,840
that the evidence and the tip...

409
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,640
were fabricated.

410
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,540
Due to our team's negligence,

411
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,240
to the merchants who suffered
irreparable pain and damage,

412
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,350
we once again offer our deepest apologies.

413
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,020
Furthermore,
to ensure this never happens again,

414
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,690
we will be fully responsible...

415
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,990
- We make this solemn promise.
- He's amazing.

416
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,990
We promise.

417
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,530
What's so cool about him?
That guy is so arrogant.

418
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,340
- But he is amazing.
- That doesn't excuse arrogance.

419
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,270
Oh, don't be so petty.

420
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,310
Give credit where credit is due.
He produces such an incredible show.

421
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,610
No, Mr. Shin and I are incredible.
We caught the culprit for them.

422
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,110
- Unbelievable.
- What?

423
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,380
You can't see me on screen, but...

424
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,980
I'm telling you, I was really there!
Right, Mr. Shin?

425
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,120
You took a soda from here, didn't you?

426
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,460
- What?
- You drank it, right?

427
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,360
I only had one.

428
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,430
- I'm docking you two dollars.
- Come on.

429
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,330
But I'm telling you, I was really there.

430
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,040
Okay, so this key...

431
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,770
should be placed facing this way.

432
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,910
- This way?
- Yes.

433
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,520
So was there anything you
found odd or suspicious?

434
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,560
I think I saw something.
Something about pushing merchants out.

435
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,860
Okay, I will now read
the settlement agreement.

436
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,960
Article One. The merchants of
the Gangchun Cooperative...

437
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,930
will fully cooperate with reporting
by TVC's "On-Site Pursuit"...

438
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,840
for their episode on the
Gangchun HI Resort corruption.

439
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,640
Article two. TVC Broadcasting
Station and Kim Young Ho...

440
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,410
will broadcast an apology for the
"Maggots in Salted Seafood" episode.

441
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,480
(Court)

442
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,290
Come in.

443
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,030
- Do you have a trial?
- Yes, in ten minutes.

444
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,900
- Did you get the settlement?
- Have you seen the news?

445
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,670
The mayor of Gangchun City is out.
And the HI Group is being raided.

446
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,680
I pulled off something big, didn't I?

447
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,050
I even got some airtime.

448
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,580
Oh, by the way,
The Gangchun folks are a handful.

449
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,750
- They filed another lawsuit?
- Another one?

450
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,690
You haven't heard? This time...

451
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,630
it is against the city
hall and the HI Group...

452
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,630
for one million dollars in damages each.

453
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,130
Wow, they keep upping the ante.

454
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,470
Hand it over.

455
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,340
What, for nothing?

456
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,740
Remember that noise complaint
case involving everyone...

457
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,970
on fifteen from 1 to 15?

458
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,940
That woman who sued
everyone in the building.

459
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,240
I went through a lot for you on that one,

460
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,310
and you still haven't
paid me what you promised.

461
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,250
(Deposit: 500 Dollars From: Kim Sang Geun)

462
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,060
- Happy now?
- With just 500 dollars?

463
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,330
For this job,
my medical bills and gas money,

464
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,160
and the cost to junk my car,

465
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,530
I've attached all the receipts.

466
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,970
So you need to reimburse me for those, too.

467
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,470
I was going to bill for his food,
but I was nice and took it off.

468
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,340
(Seoul Lawsuit: HI Group Corporate Crimes)

469
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,250
So this is it.

470
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,450
The reason you gave me this job.

471
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,950
It was all because of the HI Group.

472
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,860
I swear on law books,
it was for the salted seafood merchants.

473
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,730
You wanted to sway public
opinion before the big trial.

474
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,530
You knew I'd make them apologize.

475
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,800
I knew there was more...

476
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,440
You are one scary man.

477
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,770
I'm telling you, that's not it.

478
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,340
I'm telling you,
I was truly worried about the merchants.

479
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,950
Whatever. I'm going back to frying chicken.

480
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,180
Pillip and I...

481
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,090
we almost got killed by that truck.
Producer Kim Young Ho was right.

482
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,790
You have to dig for the
truth until the very end.

483
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,860
That's not what this is!

484
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,130
Darn...

485
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,570
Look at this. Down to the last penny.

486
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,840
This is insane.

487
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,040
Isn't he so photogenic?

488
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,040
Hey! Hey, you're a star now!

489
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,240
- I'm far from being a star, kid.
- No!

490
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,350
Look at this, look! See?

491
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,380
"Cop Catches Hostage-Taker
With Civilian's Help."

492
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,950
It already has over two million views.

493
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,890
A TV station wants an interview,
and there's talk of a commendation.

494
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,890
Let's be honest,
you're the one that gathered the proof.

495
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,260
The Maheonseo detectives just
swooped in to take the credit.

496
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,700
That's life. Some set the table,
and others just come to eat.

497
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,840
Still, you'll be able to return to
the Detective Task Force, right?

498
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,510
I've been waiting for 15 years.
It's not like I'm an old boy.

499
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,160
By the way, Boss.

500
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:29,690
How do you think they caught him?
There's no way he turned himself in.

501
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,900
Oh Jin Ho?

502
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,600
Is that his name? Oh Jin Ho?

503
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,340
Yes. Apparently, he parked illegally,

504
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,470
and someone reported him.

505
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,810
What?

506
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,340
I just don't get it at all.

507
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,580
How did the orders just dry
up completely in a few days?

508
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,020
Hey.

509
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,750
The phone was ringing nonstop last
week, right, Pillip?

510
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,120
Well, I must have taken at
least a hundred calls myself.

511
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,760
So why did they just suddenly stop cold?

512
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,630
And I ordered a mountain of chicken too.

513
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,330
It's because of that jinx over there.

514
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
Who?

515
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,100
Pillip.

516
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,940
What did you do?

517
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,970
Gosh, seriously.

518
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,540
It's a hit! The best in our neighborhood.

519
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,980
You mean 100,000 people are watching him...

520
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,080
eat chicken in a yellow suit, live?

521
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,650
- He's here!
- Why?

522
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,650
How should I know?
Many are more famous than Kkokkio.

523
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,590
With this many views,
he must be making a fortune.

524
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,190
Look at the camera. They're my fans.
Say hello. One, two, three...

525
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,730
Some of us spend all day
in front of a deep fryer,

526
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,430
frying chicken just to barely make rent.

527
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,930
This time, this is really...

528
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,670
a real eye-opener for me.

529
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,910
Hey, Pillip.

530
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,110
Get ready.

531
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,120
Who is it?

532
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,020
(Chicken Center)

533
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,830
Kkokkio, this is on the house.

534
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,790
On the house?

535
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,230
A small token of our appreciation
for being such a loyal customer.

536
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,900
- A special event, you could say.
- Excuse me, coming through.

537
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,790
(Donation, 50 dollars, Get lost!)

538
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,160
Hey, you can't just
tell people to get lost.

539
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,760
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

540
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,800
You know the drill. One, two, three!

541
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,040
Kkokkio!

542
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,440
- See? There you go.
- Oh, right.

543
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Everyone, look at the camera.

544
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,580
One, two, three! Kkokkio!

545
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,140
Guys. This party today is for Cho Pillip,

546
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,580
to welcome to our family,

547
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,680
and a birthday party for Lee Si On.

548
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,620
Oh, and it's also a wrap
party for that eventful...

549
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,290
Gangchun Seasoned Seafood case,

550
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:45,390
and also to wish for the continued
success of our restaurant.

551
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,930
So, on that note, cheers!

552
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,300
Are you cramming a year's
worth of events into one meal?

553
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,400
Cheers.

554
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,870
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

555
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,940
Cheers.

556
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,980
- This is nice.
- Is it your birthday?

557
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,850
Not for another two weeks.

558
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,320
Hold on. Anyway,
with the publicity from that stream,

559
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,050
if orders start pouring in,
deliveries will get crazy busy.

560
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,420
Pillip, do you know how
to ride a motorcycle?

561
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,760
- No, I've never ridden one before.
- What?

562
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,490
Well, I can still make the
deliveries, though.

563
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,600
Don't be ridiculous.

564
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,330
You think just anyone can do deliveries?

565
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,270
I mean, there's GPS on my phone.
If I get lost, I can just call...

566
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,870
There's a knack to it, you know.

567
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,410
Stop being so full of yourself
because of your good looks.

568
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,980
So I'll learn!
I guess you can teach me, Si On.

569
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,580
You want to steal my job too? Act your age.

570
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,180
Yes, that's a great idea, Si On.

571
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,160
This is a perfect opportunity.
Si On, you give him bike lessons,

572
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,360
and you, Pillip, can tutor Si On.

573
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:56,760
Hey, Si On.
Why don't you finally take your GED?

574
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,530
And maybe even the CSAT.

575
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,370
Forget it.
It's hard enough making ends meet.

576
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,770
I don't have time for studying.

577
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,910
Did you just chug that?

578
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,520
Pillip?

579
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,460
Pillip.

580
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,000
- Pillip.
- Looks like Si On's drunk again.

581
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,930
- Off three beers?
- Hey.

582
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,870
Her limit is two glasses, you punk.

583
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,340
Hey!

584
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,510
You...

585
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,710
Is that...

586
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,450
an American...

587
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,220
name?

588
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,080
Don't call me "you."

589
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,990
There's a limit to my patience...

590
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,820
Pillip.

591
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,130
You're in charge of Si On. Take her home.

592
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,030
- Wait, me?
- Ma'am, what's the bill?

593
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,730
- Sir, where does she live?
- How much?

594
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,440
(Do not urinate.)

595
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,830
I guess this isn't it.

596
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,750
Is anyone home?

597
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,990
Who is it?

598
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,650
Si On!

599
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:39,320
Your sister's sleeping. It's okay.
I'm one of her coworkers.

600
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,330
Did she have more than two beers?

601
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,070
Grandma's sleeping, so come in quietly.

602
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,540
She must've been exhausted.

603
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,690
- Sir!
- What is it?

604
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,860
We have a huge problem!

605
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,300
(Community Service Center)

606
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,580
Number 74? Anyone?

607
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,350
Why aren't they calling my number?

608
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,420
Number 75.

609
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,830
How can I help you?

610
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,030
I'm here to see Mr. Kim.

611
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,430
Na Yeon, could you take
this to the Team Leader?

612
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,740
What can I do for you?

613
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,050
Right. Why did you call me, Mr. Kim?

614
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,720
You drag me here for something,
and then you make me take a number?

615
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,360
You should have called me sooner!
I've been waiting over half an hour.

616
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,630
This is so frustrating.

617
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,060
What's this?

618
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,270
The complainant posting maliciously
on the forum for a year.

619
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,200
Hey, Master Shin,
can you take care of this for me? Please.

620
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,870
Hey, I'm Master Shin.
I fry chicken for a living.

621
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,910
You're a service center manager
who's meant to serve the public.

622
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,380
Local elections are coming up.
The Mayor is on the District Mayor,

623
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,990
the District Mayor's on the Director
and it's all rolled downhill to me.

624
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,660
It must be resolved by month's end.
I'm losing sleep over this.

625
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,890
Then just delete them.

626
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,460
When we deleted a few last year,
they posted 2 or 3 times more.

627
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,970
They completely flooded the forum.

628
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,000
Then it slowed to maybe 2 or 3 a month,

629
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,740
but since last month,
they've been posting 3 or 4 a week.

630
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,310
And on top of all that,

631
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,180
these days, you'll cause an uproar
if you delete posts from the forum.

632
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,710
Then resolve their complaint.

633
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,320
If I could, I wouldn't ask
you, Master Shin.

634
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,720
With the election so close,
the higher-ups fear losing support,

635
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,860
and those of us at the
bottom can't do anything.

636
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,400
I seriously think I'm going to die.
I'm going to die, I swear.

637
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,930
Goodness.

638
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,530
Do you even know who it is?

639
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,810
It was posted anonymously,
but I do have a suspect in mind.

640
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,740
Yes.

641
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,880
This video was just uploaded
to the Blue House public forum.

642
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,360
Isn't that Hwang Seong Sik,
the mayor of Yongdan City?

643
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,800
Yes. He was abducted this morning.
His phone was found at the scene.

644
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,860
What about the kidnapper?

645
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,600
They're not in the video,
and the IP address was masked.

646
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,940
What does the kidnapper want?

647
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,540
There are no demands.
The post only had one sentence.

648
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,780
- "You will all pay for your sins."
- Have you identified the location?

649
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Thank you.

650
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,900
Pillip, you must be loaded.
Taking taxis everywhere.

651
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,730
Boss, you told me to commute
to a place with no bus service.

652
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,340
What do you mean there's no bus?
Did I crawl my way here?

653
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,440
Well, there is one.

654
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,910
Once in the morning,
and once in the evening.

655
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,140
Exactly twice a day.

656
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,010
You've got a smart mouth.
Always need the last word, right?

657
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,120
So, what brings you here anyway?

658
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,690
To resolve a complaint for a client.

659
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,960
What's this mediation about?
Did Judge Kim Sang Geun stop by?

660
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,960
Did he happen to mention me?

661
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,770
About Ms. Lee Si On.

662
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,910
She lives with her grandmother
and a younger sibling?

663
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,510
- Her parents aren't around?
- Are you interested in Si On?

664
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,050
What? Oh, no.

665
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,390
You told me to tutor her.
I have to know her to prepare.

666
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,190
Then give her a level test.
Why are you digging into her life?

667
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,720
I'm telling you, it's not like that!

668
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,790
Why are you getting so worked up?

669
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,530
You're being suspicious.

670
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,030
Hello? Anyone home?

671
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,900
Hello?

672
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:29,570
Is anyone here?

673
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,790
So, who lives here?

674
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,790
The one who made the malicious post
about the Community Service Center.

675
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,670
Username WKQCH?

676
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,030
On a Korean keyboard, it spells out "Weed."

677
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,170
He keeps repeating the phrase,
"You must pay for your sins."

678
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,780
- So this is where Weed lives?
- I'm not sure.

679
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,080
Diesel?

680
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,320
- Boss.
- Yes?

681
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,360
That picture you just took.
That's ammonium nitrate, right?

682
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,330
- I wonder what they used it for.
- Isn't that fertilizer?

683
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,070
This is the countryside,
so they probably use it for farming.

684
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,270
Okay, a question for you.

685
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,740
The federal building in Oklahoma in 1995.

686
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,980
2002, Bali, Indonesia.
And 2011, Oslo's government quarter.

687
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,350
What do these three have in common?
Easy for a top police grad, right?

688
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,180
They were all sites of terrorist bombings.

689
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,850
And the other common factor?

690
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,990
What happens when you mix
ammonium nitrate with diesel fuel?

691
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,090
An ammonium nitrate bomb.
It's extremists' bomb of choice...

692
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,330
because it's so easy to make.

693
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,500
I've seen one firsthand in the Middle East.

694
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,430
Were you in the military?

695
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,670
Hey! What man in South Korea
hasn't served in the military?

696
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,380
- Don't tell me you're an exception.
- I was stationed at a GP.

697
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,710
Anyway, why the sudden talk about bombs?

698
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,180
I don't know. Something feels off.

704

Hey, the drink is missing.

705
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,670
Oh, they asked to leave
it out when they ordered.

706
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,180
- I see. I'm heading out.
- All right, take care.

707
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,450
Wait a second.

708
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,950
Are you free this weekend?

709
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,690
Me?

710
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:07,460
The GED exam is held twice a year,
and next month's is too soon,

711
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,200
so I was thinking we could aim for
the 2nd test 4 months from now.

712
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,040
The customer will be really
mad if this gets cold.

713
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,480
So that's...

714
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,320
not a no?

715
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,120
Check inside first.

716
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,690
Hey, get upstairs, quickly! Hurry up.

717
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,960
Move!

718
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,130
I'm...

719
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,700
I'm Hwang Seong Sik,
the mayor of Yongdan City.

720
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,340
I have done wrong.
People died because of me.

721
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,910
I deserve to die for what I've done.

722
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,540
Commissioner.

723
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,180
It sounds like he's referring
to the deaths in Yongdan City.

724
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,220
And the kidnapper seems to think
that Mayor Hwang's to blame.

725
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,290
During Mayor Hwang's term,
there've been 38 deaths in Yongdan,

726
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,860
and we're contacting the
families to get more details.

727
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,020
It's likely the kidnapper is one
of the victims' family members.

728
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,930
We're searching abandoned
warehouses around Yongdan City,

729
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,830
but we have to be discreet,
so it's taking some time.

730
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,530
Commissioner, let's open a tip line.

731
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,440
No way! The media might
provoke the kidnapper.

732
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,900
And if Mayor Hwang ends up dead,
who's going to take responsibility?

733
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,750
Hello?

734
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,050
Is anyone here?

735
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,850
Who is it?

736
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,890
Oh, hello.
I'm here to see Mr. Lee Sang Hyeon.

737
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,030
Oh, Sang Hyeon didn't come home last night.

738
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,830
- Why do you ask about my youngest?
- Do you know where he went?

739
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,300
He's between here and his gosiwon,
studying for the civil service exam.

740
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,800
What is this about with my youngest son?

741
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:00,400
Well, I just need to talk
to him about something.

742
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,740
I just can't get a hold of him.

743
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,510
He doesn't really answer his
phone when he's studying.

744
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,880
But wait, who are you?

745
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:11,320
Ma'am, does Mr. Lee
happen to do any farming?

746

- Yes, sir.

- Stop it. That's so embarrassing.

You're finally getting reinstated.

thanks to that very same case.

762
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:35,573
