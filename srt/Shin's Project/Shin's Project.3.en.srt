(Previously)

7
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,040
Why did you call me, Mr. Kim?

8
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,910
So, what's the mediation case this time?

9
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,810
The one who made the malicious post about the Community Service Center.

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,280
He keeps repeating the phrase, "You must pay for your sins."

11
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,990
I deserve to die for what I've done.

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,160
Isn't that Hwang Seong Sik, the mayor of Yongdan City?

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,630
What happens when you mix ammonium nitrate with diesel fuel?

14
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,360
An ammonium nitrate bomb.

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,530
Well, I just need to talk to Mr. Lee about something.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,300
I just can't get a hold of him.

17
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,440
We found the IP address that uploaded the video!

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,910
It's ringing, but they're not picking up.

19
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,670
This is really urgent, so please, just try one more time.

20
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,040
Okay, I will.

22
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,850
I said, who are you?

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,530
(15 years ago)

24
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,750
Hey!

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Hey!

26
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,890
- Hey! Yun Dong Hee!
- Jay...

27
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,590
Answer me, you scum!

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,420
- Jay.
- Let go.

29
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,390
Let me go!

30
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,230
- Jay!
- I said answer me, you jerk!

31
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,300
- Jay, please.
- Why did you do it?

32
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,070
- Jay.
- Why did you do it, you jerk?

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,000
- Let go of me!
- Stop, Jay!

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,470
Why did you do it?

35
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,010
Why did you do it?

36
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,280
Why?

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,580
Why did you do it?

38
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,380
Why did you do it?

39
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Jay.

40
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,010
Shin Jay?

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,850
What's he like?

42
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,460
Mr. Shin, I mean.

43
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,490
Why do you ask?

44
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,930
Is Mr. Shin giving you a hard time?

45
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,230
- No, it's nothing like that.
- Then what is it?

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,870
He's not your average chicken restaurant owner,

47
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,700
handling mediations so easily.

48
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,170
He's no lawyer, but he knows the law well.

49
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,670
He breaks it all the time.

50
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,510
And he doesn't seem to feel the least bit guilty about it.

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,180
He's totally unpredictable, and trouble follows him everywhere.

52
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,650
I can't figure out what he's up to.

53
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,620
I need to know that to figure out why you sent me to him.

54
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,490
I bet even he doesn't know.

55
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,160
- Pardon?
- Mr. Shin doesn't make a move.

56
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,160
He's the one who makes his opponent make a move.

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,860
I don't understand what that means.

58
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,440
Answer it.

59
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,710
- Hello?
- Hey, Pillip. Where are you?

60
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,980
I'm with Judge Kim right now...

61
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,380
After we hang up, if I don't call back within five minutes,

62
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,520
call 112 and give them the address I'm sending you now.

63
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,150
And Pillip, you get over there too.

64
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,120
- Wait, where is that?
- It's urgent! Hurry!

65
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,190
Wait, Mr. Shin!

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to go.

67
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,770
- Okay, go on. I'm busy too.
- Okay.

68
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,270
And...

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,340
if you're curious about something, find it out for yourself.

70
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,580
Understood.

71
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,090
If I were going to tell you everything,

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,990
why would I have sent you there?

73
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,910
It's because of your brother, right?

74
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,340
The one who died of lung cancer three years ago.

75
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,410
No, that's...

76
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,450
Let's talk this over inside.

77
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,080
Pretend you didn't see anything and just go.

78
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,550
It's a little late for that. How can I pretend I didn't see you?

79
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,390
Your mother must be worried.

80
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,060
I saw your mother this morning.

81
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,500
Luckily, she doesn't know anything yet.

82
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,470
If I press this, it'll go off regardless of the timer.

83
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,370
And this whole building will be blown too.

84
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,010
All right. I get it. No one's arguing.

85
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,610
Let me just go inside.

86
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,220
About deleting that comment.

87
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,650
I have to confirm it's been deleted with my own eyes.

88
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,990
Come on, Weed.

89
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,530
Just think about it for a second. I found this place pretty quickly,

90
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,230
do you really think the cops won't find this place?

91
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,910
I really didn't want to have to say this.

92
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,880
Team up with me.

93
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,790
You'll get a real advantage with me. A much better shot at winning.

94
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,090
You've got nothing to lose, right?

95
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,090
If you don't like how things go, you've still got that remote, right?

96
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,700
Just... Boom!

97
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,930
And why would I do that?

98
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,400
Why? Are you kidding me?

99
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,670
Because in this situation,

100
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm the only one who can help you.

101
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,590
(Shin's Project)

102
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,950
If you want to get the hostage out alive,

103
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,160
then negotiate with me, starting now.

104
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Mr. Shin!

105
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,100
Let him in.

106
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,440
What are you talking about?

107
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,440
It's just as I said.

108
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,810
To save the hostage, you deal with me.

109
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,720
Here are the terms. We meet here once an hour...

110
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,150
to exchange demands.

111
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,860
- So, that gives us about ten hours.
- What's the hostage's condition?

112
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,830
He's hungry. He hasn't eaten in over 24 hours.

113
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
What kind of bomb is it?

114
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,200
What happens when you mix ammonium nitrate with diesel fuel?

115
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,300
An ammonium nitrate bomb.

116
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,810
That's right. Enough to blow this whole building up,

117
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,310
and another remote can detonate it, regardless of the timer.

118
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,450
And Lee Sang Hyeon has the remote.

119
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,050
- So, what does the kidnapper want?
- His first demand is...

120
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,720
three bowls of ox head soup within thirty minutes.

121
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,890
For now, that's it. Lee Sang Hyeon clammed up after that,

122
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,060
so I couldn't get anything else.

123
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,590
He's not talking?

124
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,200
Even if he's not talking now, he might talk while eating, right?

125
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,530
So just get us the food.

126
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,470
How do we get in touch?

127
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,370
- What's his number?
- I have it.

128
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,870
- And you are?
- I'm...

129
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,940
I work for Mr. Shin.

130
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,550
What is this? You expect us to eat out of this?

131
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,460
- The earthenware pots are a risk.
- A risk? What kind of risk?

132
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,760
Afraid we'll get burned by the soup? Or get hurt if the pot breaks?

133
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,830
Hey, Jang. There's a bomb in here.

134
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,200
Is a pot more dangerous than a bomb?

135
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,000
If that bomb goes off in nine hours,

136
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,340
this could be our last meal.

137
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,910
We're not asking for the world.

138
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,010
I'm just asking for a little basic respect.

139
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,110
Yeong Su.

140
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,350
Jang Yeong Su.

141
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
Yes, sir.

142
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,390
Did I...

143
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,490
teach you to act like this?

144
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,530
Take it back. The deal's off!

145
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,530
Hey! What about all this plastic? Isn't ruining the planet a risk?

146
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,080
Get three new orders of the soup.

147
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,150
And serve them in earthenware pots with care.

148
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,930
Gosh, Mayor Hwang.

149
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,930
Try not to spill soup on your vest while you eat.

150
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,560
Is it going to go off?

151
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,070
It's homemade and a little unstable. What if it shorts out?

152
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,040
It doesn't hurt to be careful.

153
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,620
Mr. Lee, come on, let's eat.

154
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,020
Anyone watching would think you're the hostage here.

155
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,490
What's wrong? Don't you like ox head soup?

156
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,830
Want me to ask for something else?

157
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,800
How can I eat in a situation like this?

158
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,340
That's all the more reason to eat.

159
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,770
A full stomach helps you keep your nerve.

160
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,250
Here.

161
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,380
Don't be like that. Hurry up and eat.

162
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,620
I even asked for dessert.

163
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,490
A latte for me. And what about you, Mayor Hwang?

164
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,630
- Iced Americano.
- What was that?

165
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,200
- Iced Americano.
- Ice cream? Sounds good.

166
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,030
He'll have the one without juice. And you, Weed?

167
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,730
I'm good.

168
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,940
Come on. Have something to drink.

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,810
A little caffeine will clear your head.

170
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,510
Excuse me, I'm going to order.

171
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,530
- Fried dumpling for you.
- Thanks!

172
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,130
Just a second.

173
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,700
(Mr. Shin, Master Shin, Jun's father)

174
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,930
My youngest loves the ox bone soup.

175
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,530
I can't stand the smell from my job,

176
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,570
but he says he likes it because it smells like me.

177
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,640
He's such a good son. He's my one and only.

178
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,010
There you go again, only doting on your youngest.

179
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,070
You're going to hurt your other kids' feelings.

180
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,680
He's my only one now.

181
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,450
My oldest passed from lung cancer three years ago.

182
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,420
Oh, my. Listen to me, rambling on to a stranger.

183
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,620
I guess I just have that effect on people.

184
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,990
I make them want to confide in me, even if we've just met.

185
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,000
All right, now that we've all eaten and had some caffeine,

186
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,340
let's all talk openly.

187
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,240
Mr. Lee.

188
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,310
What is it that you want, exactly?

189
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,320
- Mayor. How did you wrong him?
- Excuse me?

190
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,790
I have no idea...

191
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,820
So, we just wait to go "boom" and die together?

192
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,300
I just ate on the house, so I have to earn my keep, right?

193
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,200
And let me be clear, I'm not walking out of here alone.

194
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,940
You're not leaving alone, Weed. As for me, I have...

195
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,870
no one waiting for me at home. But you two do, don't you?

196
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,580
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

197
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,980
This frustration is going to kill me before the bomb ever does.

198
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,590
Hey, Mayor Hwang.

199
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,890
Mayor Hwang. Did you ruin this man's life?

200
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,590
Or what?

201
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,930
Did you mess with his brother?

202
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,460
No.

203
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,000
I'd never do something like that. I don't even know who they are.

204
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,130
My brother is dead!

205
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,080
The plant's toxic waste killed him. And it wasn't just my brother.

206
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,350
Three other neighbourhood elders died too.

207
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,360
"One. The company and the government..."

208
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,930
"must admit to these facts and properly compensate the victims."

209
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,570
"Two. Severely punish those who made the bereaved families suffer twice."

210
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,370
"Three. Release all case details to the media." That's all.

211
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,610
If these demands are not met,

212
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,950
he says he'll live-stream the bomb as it goes off on the internet.

213
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,280
I'll confirm the facts and discuss this with the agencies.

214
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,820
Hurry up, Jang. We don't have time to negotiate.

215
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,060
We can't possibly admit to that!

216
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Here, take a look.

217
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,730
I did the epidemiological survey near the plant.

218
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,300
Water and soil quality were normal.

219
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,770
I get that the survey came back normal,

220
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,270
but there are over ten cancer cases near the plant.

221
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,140
And eight of them died. Did you offer them a settlement?

222
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,210
Yes, we did.

223
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,110
The survey results were clear, but the locals didn't believe them.

224
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,420
So the mayor told the plant to take moral responsibility.

225
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,550
What about Lee Sang Hyeon's brother? Why wasn't he compensated?

226
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,090
He lived more than a kilometre away.

227
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,320
At that rate,

228
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,930
we'd have to compensate everyone with cancer in the city.

229
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,130
Don't you agree?

230
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,000
The man is just throwing a tantrum!

231
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,100
Mr. Lee claims besides his brother, three others in his town also died.

232
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,670
They passed away from old age and pre-existing conditions.

233
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,150
- How would they know that?
- It says so right here.

234
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,910
I heard you were Master Shin's assistant,

235
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
but you're nothing like him.

236
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,980
I'm his employee, not an assistant.

237
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,520
And look, the autopsy report says there's no direct link.

238
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,990
Can't you read?

239
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,260
It says "no direct link." So there might be an indirect one.

240
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,430
You have to read between the lines.

241
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,730
The three elders who died in town were cremated without an autopsy.

242
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,170
Their children were paid off for that condition.

243
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,840
And to keep their mouths shut.

244
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,870
But Lee Sang Hyeon had an autopsy done...

245
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,140
and worked hard to find the cause.

246
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,740
He did it secretly to spare his mother.

247
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,980
He did it himself, secretly.

248
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,250
But he found nothing. Water and soil tests came up empty.

249
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,650
Gosh. Some investigation that was.

250
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,120
Here, take this.

251
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,930
That investigation. It was all fabricated.

252
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,160
They only investigated long after people got cancer and complained.

253
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,670
The factory was busy "cleaning up," in the meantime, right?

254
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
They were in on it together.

255
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,840
Building that factory there was wrong.

256
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,310
A protected water area is downstream,

257
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,210
so how could they build a factory upstream from it?

258
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,280
Why don't you tell him? You're the one who approved it.

259
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,720
I thought it was built ten years ago.

260
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,320
Were you the mayor back then?

261
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,060
No, not back then.

262
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,360
He was in the Construction Division of Yongdan City.

263
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,490
He illegally approved the factory.

264
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,330
And this warehouse here? He built it for "small businesses,"

265
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,470
but he let the factory use it free. They abandoned it for a bigger one.

266
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,580
So that's why you came here? To expose everything?

267
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,550
Yes. You see,

268
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,680
no matter what I do,

269
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,750
no one's going to listen.

270
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,320
When you're against people with power...

271
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,020
and money, they can just bury it.

272
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,460
Even though people are dying, they still side with the factory.

273
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,800
I told you, I did it by the book! Do you have any proof?

274
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,970
My brother is dead! What more proof do you need?

275
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,840
Gosh, come on! Mayor Hwang, you're not helping.

276
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,910
- Okay?
- Excuse me?

277
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,080
Can't you read the room?

278
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,650
Just keep your mouth shut and stay put.

279
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,820
Who gave you the right to talk back? I'm trying to save your skin here,

280
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,890
so just be quiet.

281
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,760
(Chicken Center, Take-out and delivery)

282
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,310
Mr. Shin gave you this, right?

283
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,510
Yes, he did. Why are you taking it?

284
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,280
Why do you think?

285
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,750
I'll make a delivery.

286
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,090
A delivery? To whom?

287
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,490
Hey, I'm coming with you!

288
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,060
Are they keeping me out of the loop?

289
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,850
- Who is it?
- I'm here to see Madam Joo.

290
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,780
Mr. Shin sent me.

291
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,460
Did Mr. Shin really send you?

292
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,060
- Yes.
- Did something happen?

293
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,830
I don't know about that,

294
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,330
but he just said it was urgent.

295
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,770
Oh, right.

296
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
This too.

297
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,410
I can't make heads or tails of it, though.

298
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,520
(Secret, Madam Joo, Document delivery, Catherine, Tonight)

299
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,090
Just a moment.

300
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,410
When I last saw my brother on leave from the army, his weight...

301
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,320
was down to just 40kg.

302
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,080
He was 180cm tall,

303
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,720
but he was nothing but skin and bones.

304
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,650
I barely recognised his face.

305
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,060
Even now that he's gone, I see that face in my dreams,

306
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,000
and he cries. Imagine how wronged he must have felt.

307
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,730
Still, besides the bomb,

308
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,100
you had other options, didn't you?

309
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,170
Like what?

310
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,910
(Take responsibility for my brother's death!)

311
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,110
(Don't play dumb!)

312
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,710
It's no use.

313
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,980
I heard they're suing for defamation.

314
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,780
The law couldn't even punish them.

315
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,050
Mr. Mayor!

316
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,160
People are dying out there! What are you doing, Mr. Mayor?

317
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,560
Sir, you can't do this.

318
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,660
- If the truth is revealed...
- Even using force didn't work.

319
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm doing this because I have no other choice.

320
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,130
So you're just going to take everyone down with you?

321
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,500
This is our retribution.

322
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,770
Him and me too.

323
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,710
Then what about your mother?

324
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,280
What sin did your mother commit...

325
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,920
to deserve the horrific punishment of losing both of her children?

326
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,850
Every time she opens her eyes, with every breath she takes,

327
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,260
she'll be drowning in the guilt of failing to protect her children.

328
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,590
She will spend the rest of her life in absolute agony,

329
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,860
remembering her youngest son and his brother.

330
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,570
Mom.

331
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,470
My mom has done nothing wrong.

332
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,770
But when parents have to bury their own child,

333
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,440
they are the ones who feel like criminals.

334
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,910
With no hope of being forgiven.

335
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,450
So, do you still think you have to die?

336
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,360
(Seobu Substation)

337
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,110
(Jun's father)

338
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,850
This is my last request.

339
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,520
Dohun. This is urgent. I need your help.

340
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,560
So that's why you came all the way to Financial Supervisory Service.

341
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,730
It's kind of a long story.

342
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,360
- Okay, listen up.
- Okay.

343
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,370
Could you please check the files I sent over?

344
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,970
Okay, got it. Let's take a look.

345
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,440
So, this guy's info... Right. Here it is.

346
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
Yes!

347
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,340
What's the situation in there?

348
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,250
Well, that depends on your answer, Jang.

349
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,580
So, I looked into it.

350
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,420
It looks like Lee Sang Hyeon has suffered a great injustice.

351
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,920
"Express empathy for the hostage-taker."

352
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,060
Okay, I'll pass that on. Now, what's the bottom line?

353
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,760
There are no legal grounds to link the plant to the patients' cancer.

354
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,200
So they won't admit to the facts?

355
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,830
It's also legally difficult to punish anyone involved.

356
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,300
What about the development act they violated to build the plant?

357
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,040
And what about the bribery charges?

358
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,910
The statute of limitations has expired.

359
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,710
My gosh. For those rich, powerful jerks,

360
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,080
the law sure is convenient.

361
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,020
Listen, what if we offer to pay instead?

362
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,220
The Deputy Mayor and the plant's CEO...

363
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,360
want to pay Lee Sang Hyeon in person.

364
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,660
And they'll apologise, if he wants.

365
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,090
Apologise for what? You said they did nothing wrong legally.

366
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,160
As a moral gesture.

367
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,560
If we're going to negotiate, we have to offer something.

368
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,430
Who said anything about money?

369
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,870
If you committed a crime and killed someone,

370
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,140
you have to be punished!

371
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,770
He refuses. Mayor Hwang said the same thing.

372
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,540
He said he just did everything by the book.

373
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,840
And that he's sorry that his brother died.

374
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,010
Goodness.

375
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,820
What if...

376
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,820
we ask his mother to talk to him?

377
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,150
Come on, Jang. Don't be such an amateur.

378
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,160
Leave his mother out of this. The second she knows, he'll snap.

379
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,190
But we have to save the hostage.

380
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,200
Of course we do. I'm doing my best, so you better...

381
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,730
figure something out.

382
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,070
And...

383
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,270
he's about to start a livestream.

384
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,310
He's mad that his demands aren't being met.

385
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,840
We'll need to beef up security.

386
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,310
Hurry. And don't let Lee Sang Hyeon notice.

387
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,880
- Talk to you in an hour.
- Right.

388
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,290
All personnel around the warehouse, fall back 50m.

389
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,350
Roger that!

390
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,530
The dates, the times. They all line up perfectly.

391
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,030
Well, what do you know. You're pretty sharp as an assistant.

392
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,970
I'm his employee, not an assistant.

393
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,000
You're skilled, Manager Kim.

394
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,970
You could be a hacker when you retire.

395
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,070
What's that supposed to mean?

396
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,440
Didn't Master Shin tell you about me?

397
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,110
In his text earlier,

398
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,750
he just said, "Manager Kim from the Community Service Center."

399
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,260
Come on, we've known each other for over 15 years, you know?

400
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,020
And the number of cases we've solved together...

401
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,500
Forget it, I'm leaving.

402
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,470
What kind of cases did you two solve together?

403
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,840
We persuaded a Saudi prince to merge with a US energy company.

404
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,040
And pulled off the M and A. It was a huge deal!

405
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,410
I'm telling you, Master Shin's connections are insane.

406
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,810
Really?

407
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Hey, this is more legendary.

408
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,290
Before the Iraq War ended, two US officers were taken as POWs.

409
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,820
We'll trade you 5 Iraqi soldiers for the 2 US officers.

410
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,860
Master Shin went there himself and brought them back.

411
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,400
What, you really didn't know?

412
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,430
Goodness.

413
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,640
He's the negotiator our government went to great lengths to recruit.

414
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,140
Then why is he running a fried chicken place?

415
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,780
Gosh, look at the time. It's gotten really late.

416
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,750
We'll talk later.

417
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,890
- But...
- We'll talk later.

418
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,190
The second this goes live online, it's over.

419
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,630
It'll likely go off before then.

420
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Instead of just talking,

421
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,600
let's use a drone to check the warehouse.

422
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,630
If the back's clear, we move in.

423
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,300
That'll just make things worse. Their negotiator told me...

424
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,300
Who is this guy you keep telling us to blindly trust?

425
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,940
Like I said, he's a capable negotiator.

426
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,740
He's still on their side.

427
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,640
Why would you trust a guy who undermines his own team?

428
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,310
Because he's never failed. Not once. Not in his countless missions.

429
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,310
He saves everyone,

430
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,780
including hostages and the hostage-takers too.

431
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,420
- We're lucky he's on this, okay?
- Okay, I get it. Keep talking.

432
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,390
He said to cut the net and stream so Lee Sang Hyeon won't find out.

433
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,860
That's why I took pre-emptive measures.

434
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,800
Right now, all internet access within a 10km radius is blocked.

435
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,330
- Cell tower 5 is down.
- Cell tower 11 is down.

436
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,570
Cell tower shutdown is complete.

437
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,870
Team Leader.

438
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,410
All right, move out!

439
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,310
- A is clear.
- B is clear.

440
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,480
- C is clear.
- D is clear.

441
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,580
But if we cut the internet, won't Lee Sang Hyeon find out?

442
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,250
That's why we're using a fake tower. He shouldn't notice right away.

443
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,850
- We need to have a talk.
- Regardless,

444
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,750
we cannot accept his demands.

445
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Deputy Mayor.

446
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,420
There are no absolutes when a life is on the line!

447
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,830
That bomb goes off in two hours! The mayor's life is on the line!

448
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,700
Say you'll review what went wrong. That you'll investigate.

449
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,300
Is that really so hard? What are you so afraid to find?

450
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,430
- Team Leader.
- Yes?

451
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,870
Excuse me.

452
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,810
- Hey, who are you?
- He's...

453
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,470
I'm an employee of Lee Sang Hyeon's negotiator.

454
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,240
I need to speak with you for a moment.

455
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,220
Mr. Lee Sang Hyeon. I told you I'm here to help.

456
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,420
Negotiation is all about give-and-take.

457
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,590
When did I ask you to save my life?

458
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,060
Come on. Just listen to what I'm trying to...

459
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,960
Just let go of me! Darn it!

460
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,560
What is wrong with you?

461
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,670
Are you trying to get us killed?

462
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,050
What are you doing here?

463
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,690
He's your temporary assistant negotiator.

464
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,190
- You got another new job?
- Hey, that's not important now.

465
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,560
Listen to this. Five years ago,

466
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,760
a fertilizer CEO wired US dollars to a flower shop in California.

467
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,000
The manager of that shop is a Korean mom with a kid at school.

468
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,270
Her husband is with Yongdan Health. He ran the contamination tests.

469
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,970
Also, the researcher's mother-in-law landed a public project in Yongdan.

470
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,640
Exactly three months after the environmental report came out.

471
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,180
- Apparently a psychic knew the bid.
- What?

472
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,420
And that bidding price was known only to three people,

473
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,120
the mayor, the deputy mayor, and the section chief.

474
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,490
- Just those three.
- Hold on.

475
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,520
So you're saying, Yongdan City faked the environmental report,

476
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,220
took a bribe from the fertilizer plant,

477
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,530
and the mayor covered the whole thing up?

478
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,460
Exactly.

479
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,740
You figured all this out yourself? In half a day?

480
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,080
Yes. More or less.

481
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,380
I had help from my friend at the FSS and Manager Kim.

482
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,420
If we can prove the bribery, the environmental report is invalid.

483
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,290
Plus, the statute of limitations hasn't expired for these two cases.

484
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,260
Jang, let me talk to you.

485
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,470
Lee Sang Hyeon has clammed up.

486
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,540
- Why?
- Me leaking that info to you.

487
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,500
I think he's caught on.

488
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,770
What about the fake cell tower?

489
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,110
Not yet.

490
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,940
But it's only a matter of time.

491
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,910
If you tell him what we just heard, won't he soften up?

492
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,050
No. He'll just think I'm lying.

493
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,590
That's too risky.

494
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,630
Can you really pull that off?

495
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,230
If I fail,

496
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,970
what's the worst that could happen, me dying?

497
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,010
- Mr. Shin!
- What is it? I'm busy.

498
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,880
I believe in you, Mr. Shin.

499
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,250
Don't give up.

500
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,380
You're rooting for me, right?

501
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,920
You're not just messing with me, are you?

502
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:49,151
Why isn't he coming out?

503
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:55,691
Let's go.

504
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,621
How can we just leave? Mr. Shin is still in there!

505
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:03,261
If I don't come out for the last negotiation,

506
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:05,331
cut the power, no questions asked.

507
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,001
Cut the power in five minutes.

508
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,571
Wait.

509
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:37,861
He's coming out.

510
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:45,101
No bomb.

511
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:46,341
Go get him!

512
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,821
- Medics!
- Mr. Mayor!

513
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:00,991
Mr. Mayor, are you okay?

514
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:02,291
Let's move him.

515
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,961
- Mr. Shin, are you okay?
- What about Lee Sang Hyun?

516
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:06,091
The negotiation failed.

517
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:08,661
But he's not coming out.

518
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:12,261
Get a drone up now! Yes, sir.

519
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:19,971
This isn't working. I'll go back in and get him myself.

520
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,341
Sir, no! It's too dangerous.

521
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:26,341
- Mr. Shin!
- Man, it's too dangerous!

522
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,761
All right, secure the scene.

523
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:19,031
Copy that.

524
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:22,331
Check for hotspots.

525
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:30,111
The guilty party walks away unscathed,

526
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,141
but Lee Sang Hyun, who tried to expose him...

527
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:34,681
It's infuriating. It's just not right.

528
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:36,081
I'm fine.

529
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:43,321
Pillip. Still think the law's always right?

530
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,721
That's all the more reason to set things right.

531
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:47,231
By the book.

532
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,361
Mayor Hwang will be indicted soon, too.

533
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:52,261
Right.

534
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,031
We'll see about that.

535
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,671
Are you okay?

536
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:03,481
At least you saved the hostage.

537
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:05,381
Yeong Su, I'm sorry.

538
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:07,881
You went through a lot today.

539
00:36:11,621 --> 00:36:12,881
Temporary Assistant Negotiator.

540
00:36:14,151 --> 00:36:15,651
Take good care of Mr. Shin for me.

541
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:17,061
You two make a good team.

542
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:18,391
Yes.

543
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:26,431
- So he's the legendary negotiator?
- One of the best.

544
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:29,301
Too bad he tarnished his perfect record today.

545
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:34,411
I heard he'd always saved everyone. But he couldn't save Lee Sang Hyun.

546
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:38,441
Apparently, chemical drums were there. He burned up,

547
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:39,681
leaving no trace.

548
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:43,081
What will they tell his family? Not even a bone fragment left.

549
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,881
They won't even believe he's dead.

550
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:52,161
Last night, a warehouse caught fire on the outskirts of Yongdan City.

551
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,731
A man in his 20s died in the fire.

552
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,831
Police suspect the man started the fire himself...

553
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:03,401
What a shame. He had such a bright future.

554
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,971
It's just heartbreaking.

555
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:07,711
...Reportedly having difficulty determining the cause of the fire.

556
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:10,681
Why are you always watching such grim stuff?

557
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:12,681
Aren't your trot shows on?

558
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:16,481
Of course I do! It's my "Chance."

559
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:19,221
- What happened to your face?
- It's nothing. Just a scratch.

560
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,651
Honestly.

561
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:23,761
So what's this "Chance" thing? Here you go.

562
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:26,491
My "Lee Chan Won Chance"!

563
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:30,501
You don't get it? You really don't get it.

564
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:31,561
So uncool.

565
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:36,331
I don't know about all that. The only "chance" I need is you.

566
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,241
Here, this is my "Chance Service."

567
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,641
- Listen to Chan Won's song.
- All right.

568
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:43,881
You're going to love it!

569
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:46,951
- Thanks.
- Go on.

570
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:48,011
Yes.

571
00:37:58,221 --> 00:38:02,631
Number 37. Number 37, report to 2.

572
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,071
Na Young.

573
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:09,801
If the Team Leader is looking for me,

574
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:12,901
tell him that I'm out handling a nasty complaint.

575
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,211
(Number 37)

576
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:26,581
Yongdan City is in a total uproar.

577
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:28,591
I hear the cops are tearing the place apart.

578
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:32,261
This is all thanks to you and your assistant.

579
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:34,431
Be straight with me.

580
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:38,061
You knew from the start, didn't you? The hate comments were an excuse?

581
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,471
What kind of nonsense is that?

582
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:42,501
How was I supposed to know that kid...

583
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:44,401
would strap a bomb to May Hwang?

584
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:48,911
You were working with Lee Sang Hyun from the start, weren't you?

585
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,941
No, it's not like that.

586
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:55,351
Besides, you're fine, aren't you?

587
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:57,351
"Fine?" What do you mean, "fine?"

588
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:59,551
Can't you see this? This? This?

589
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,821
I couldn't open my restaurant. I was stuck in that warehouse all day.

590
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:06,421
Have you ever tried eating lunch next to a bomb?

591
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:09,491
Is that really what you're worried about?

592
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,911
(From Mr. Shin: To Madam Joo, Document Delivery by Pillip)

593

(Overseas wire transfer records)

594
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:31,021
Hello?

595
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:34,421
Come on. If you'd just listen to me...

596
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:36,251
Come on!

597
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,561
Please, just listen to me.

598
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,761
Are you really going to kill us all?

599
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:42,631
Your mother is waiting outside.

600
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:46,761
This guy is unbelievable. He just won't listen to reason.

601
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:51,371
I found proof of a fixed assessment. Mayor Hwang will pay for this.

602
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:53,911
Go out the back door. I'll take care of everything.

603
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:55,741
Okay, fine. Fine.

604
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:58,741
Press it! Go on, press it! Let's all die together!

605
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,951
I thought we were on the same side.

606
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,351
This is for your expenses. Stay at the safe house, then leave.

607
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:45,061
Son. This is me, but the name is wrong.

608
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,961
Look. Your son has a new name, too.

609
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:53,931
It's a chance to leave it all behind and start a new life.

610
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:07,951
Good job.

611
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:12,751
- Are you crying?
- Of course not.

612
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:17,291
I'm just thinking about what a mess yesterday was.

613
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,261
Who else could've solved something like that in just half a day?

614
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:25,131
- Only you could do it, Mr. Shin.
- Don't ever call me again.

615
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:27,171
All right.

616
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:29,571
You call me if you ever need anything.

617
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:31,171
I won't.

618
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:35,411
For the record, this repays my debt. That means we're even.

619
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:36,471
Fine.

620
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:41,811
Just call.

621
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,021
A city official is being investigated...

622
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:52,991
for corruption tied to the rescue.

623
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:56,291
The late Mr. Lee was right. It all came to light because of him.

624
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,261
That's why we're handling it quietly.

625
00:41:58,261 --> 00:41:59,331
Have you met with the family?

626
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:00,431
I heard it's just his mother, right?

627
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,001
She didn't come home last night. And she didn't show up for work.

628
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:04,071
Her phone is off, too.

629
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,801
Could she have done something rash?

630
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:07,511
We're still trying to reach his family.

631
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:08,871
What's for lunch today?

632
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:11,241
I've prepared spicy beef soup for today.

633
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:12,311
It's spicy beef soup.

634
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,121
Look at them.

635
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,091
Sir, where are you going? It's not time for patrol yet.

636
00:42:26,161 --> 00:42:30,531
Just running an errand. When I first got here, I wanted out.

637
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,431
But it's different now I'm leaving. I've got a few goodbyes to say.

638
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:35,631
I'll be back.

639
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:40,571
Sir. I plan to apply to the Detective Task Force if I can.

640
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:43,841
- Really?
- Yes.

641
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:48,211
Okay. You'll be a better detective than I ever was.

642
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:51,221
You got this! I'll be back. See you later.

643
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,351
Take care, sir.

What are you doing?

646
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:16,811
What does it look like I'm doing?

647
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:18,281
Cleaning.

648
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:20,711
Decided to drop the formalities?

649
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:25,721
You speak informally, so I am too. You told me I could.

650
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:27,081
I'm not complaining.

651
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,791
- Where's Mr. Shin?
- Hasn't come in yet.

652
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:31,891
Why'd you call me over?

653
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:33,461
Right.

654
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:38,961
I wanted to give this to you.

655
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:43,331
It's for you.

656
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:46,771
Are you an idiot?

657
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,711

Classes are on weekends. Saturday and Sunday, two hours each.

660
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:59,651
On weekdays, you'll work on the assigned problem sets.

661
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:01,191
Deal.

662
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,091
After class on Sunday, let's go for a ride.

663
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,401
I'll teach you for exactly 30 minutes.

664
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:22,771
I'm out.

665
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:45,431
Yesterday, for those two people, we only had their photos and info.

666
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,601
I heard nothing about new passports and putting them on a plane.

667
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:51,371
So how did you know?

668
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,871
I saw the text. Catherine. Tonight.

669
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:58,181
Fifteen years ago, my Ji Woo...

670
00:44:58,241 --> 00:45:00,911
also got a new passport under the name Catherine...

671
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:03,151
and I sent her to a private school in the Philippines.

672
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:11,121
So Kim Yong Woo could never find her.

673
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,631
Bring me Kim Yong Woo!

674
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:18,761
Get over here! Get over here.

675
00:45:21,531 --> 00:45:23,831
Excuse me.

676
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:24,901
- Ma'am, you can't.
- It's dangerous.

677
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:27,811
Ji Woo! Please, let me through!

678
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:47,021
Right now, this man is terrified.

679
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,761
He has no intention of harming the child,

680
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:56,671
and he's not the one calling the shots.

681
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,841
There are two SWAT teams outside right now.

682
00:46:00,941 --> 00:46:03,541
The second that door opens, they'll open fire.

683
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:06,141
An MP5K. It fires 900 rounds per minute.

684
00:46:06,281 --> 00:46:09,651
Shut up! Bring me what Kim Yong Woo stole.

685
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:11,121
Or I'll shoot this child.

686
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:23,261
If you let the child go now, I will take her and leave.

687
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:25,761
And the SWAT teams will leave with me.

688
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:29,071
When you walk out of here, no one will be around.

689
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:34,041
The debt collectors will be gone. You can just go home, like normal.

690
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:37,271
- Just like nothing happened.
- Bring me the item first!

691
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:39,781
But if...

692
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:42,551
I have to walk out of here alone,

693
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:45,251
then you won't have any more choices.

694
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:49,191
You will never make it out of here alive,

695
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:51,761
and of course, you won't get the item you want.

696
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:55,361
Shut up! I said bring me the item!

697
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:59,101
Since you were cowardly enough to kidnap a child,

698
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:03,871
they'll kill your family even more brutally.

699
00:47:05,371 --> 00:47:06,701
Your parents, your siblings.

700
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:10,171
First, they'll be told what you did.

701
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:16,481
Before they die, they at least deserve to know why,

702
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:18,551
don't you think?

703
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:23,351
What are you? Are you a soldier?

704
00:47:23,421 --> 00:47:24,761
A cop?

705
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:28,231
- I'm neither.
- Then what the heck are you?

706
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:40,571
I'm just going to take this call.

707
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:46,581
I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

708
00:47:48,151 --> 00:47:50,581
I'm not here to kill you.

709
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:54,591
I'm here to save that child. Kim Ji Woo.

710

00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:11,641
All right, think about it. The child hasn't seen your face.

713
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:14,771
And I'll forget you ever existed.

Please, let him go.

- Please, let my son go. Let Jun go!
- Mom.

728
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:24,641
Take me instead.

729
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:26,481
Take me instead.

730
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:33,951
Out of the way! Move! Let me through! Let me through!

731
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:40,161
Are you his guardian? Get her back. Back, move back.

732
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:42,591
Jun, that's my boy. That's my baby.

733
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:45,901

- Oh, kiddo.

- Mommy...

00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,081

It's okay. It's okay.

744
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:09,591
What do you mean, 'it's okay'? What about me?

745
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,621
I'm not crazy!

746
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:13,621
Hey, stop all that yelling. You're scaring the kid.

747
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:18,901
Hey, that's enough, man. I told you, I'll hear you out.

748
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:21,631
Who said you were crazy? You're not crazy.

749
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:25,101
I know you're not crazy, all right? So while I'm still asking nicely...

750
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:26,801
put down the knife and let the kid go.

751
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:29,541
Do that, and we can go talk this out.

- The hostage has been rescued.
- Finally, he's coming out.

Thank you so much for saving my Ji Woo.

765

I'll never forget this.

766
00:51:25,061 --> 00:51:29,671
Well, more importantly... He kept asking for Kim Yong Woo.

767
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,071
We're divorced. I haven't seen him since.

768
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:35,911
Whatever he may have stolen,

769
00:51:36,371 --> 00:51:38,011
I honestly have no idea.

770
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:43,351
Listen, until they find what they're looking for,

771
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:48,121
- Ji Woo won't be safe.
- Then what am I supposed to do?

772
00:51:50,321 --> 00:51:52,561
Jay!

773
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:55,831
Jay, why didn't you answer your phone?

774
00:51:55,891 --> 00:51:58,461
- What are you doing here?
- Why didn't you answer, you idiot!

776
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:03,901
It's Jun.

777
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:05,271
What?

778
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:06,871
It's about Jun...

779
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:10,541
What? What happened to Jun?

780
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:39,441
Get out!

781
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:42,111
Where have you been!

782
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:46,241
Jun was crying...

783
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:50,551
and calling for you over and over.

784
00:52:52,451 --> 00:52:56,421
Why didn't you answer your phone? You were supposed to save him!

785
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:03,591
How can you even call yourself his father?

786
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:07,261
You killed him.

787
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:11,171
You.

788
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:14,241
You killed him!

789
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:18,141
You killed our son!

790
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:45,441
This is my final request.

791
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:48,341

794
00:54:15,524 --> 00:54:17,194
so you can just head home early.

No, it's fine. I'll take out the trash.

796
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:22,134
Just go when I tell you to. Or do you want to work overtime?

- What?
- Giving her free lessons...

00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:35,584
all day long and saying "tutoring, tutoring, tutoring."

802
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:37,084
When have I ever done that?

803
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:42,884
Should I roll the CCTV footage? And check it by the book?

804
00:54:44,954 --> 00:54:45,994
I'll get going, then.

805
00:54:49,294 --> 00:54:50,424

You're the one who used to say...

817
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:25,694
that it's better to use an opponent than to make them an enemy.

818
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,224
Is that what you did this time, too?

00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:53,354
Gosh.

That's why I even made you that coffee.

825
00:57:13,504 --> 00:57:17,304
The Commissioner chewed me out. You used me to shut down...

826
00:57:17,374 --> 00:57:18,614

827
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:23,144
You lied to police to get him out. Even if he was framed, it's too far.

828

It wasn't for Lee Sang Hyun.

829
00:57:27,754 --> 00:57:29,024
It was for his mother.

She already lost her eldest son.

831
00:57:36,394 --> 00:57:38,734

You really hold a grudge, you know that?

- Tracking me all the way down here.
- Be glad I'm not arresting you.

843
00:58:49,604 --> 00:58:52,304
Besides, it's not as if you have proof it was me.

But Yeong Su.

845
00:58:57,644 --> 00:58:59,814
There's something more important than using your opponent.

00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:03,944
It's more rewarding to understand them.
