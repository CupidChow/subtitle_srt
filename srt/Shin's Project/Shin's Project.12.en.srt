00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:13,815
So, you're Ye On's boyfriend?

6
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,485
How'd you know?

7
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:17,925
The keychain.

8
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:19,525
It's a matching set, isn't it?

9
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,195
You must be the guy Ye On mentioned.

10
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,765
I got this for our "Two Two" anniversary.

11
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:29,105
- Two Two?
- Our 22nd day together.

12
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:31,905
What? You didn't do this for Si On?

13
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:35,245
Dude, celebrating anniversaries is just basic.

14
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,575
Two Two, our 50-day,

15
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:41,115
and I spent two dollars on our 100-day anniversary.

16
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,745
I get it.

17
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:44,045
So what?

18
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:47,925
- What are you trying to win?
- What's in it for me if I tell you?

19
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:50,225
- What?
- We have to negotiate.

20
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:52,525
It's a little give-and-take.

21
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:53,825
That's what a negotiation is.

22
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,335
Fine.

23
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,105
What do you want?

24
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,435
A double date.

25
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:05,975
You pay for it,

26
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:07,605
and I'll make the plans.

27
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:09,705
Deal.

I don't normally tell anyone this, but I'm only telling you.

Okay, loosen it up.

37
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,025
That's it.

38
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:56,555
How's that?

39
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,125
Good. Tie it up. Yes, tie that side too.

40
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,195
- Tie it up.
- Okay.

42
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,665

43

- Congratulations, Si On.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,065
- You did great.
- It came out nice.

45
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:08,435
Looks great, doesn't it?

46
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:11,075
What is this? And what's with that picture?

47
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:14,075
Who said you could do this? This is so embarrassing.

48
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:18,575
Chil Bong, I told you this photo was too much.

49
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:22,015
That's what I'm saying. I even cited Penal Code Article 307,

50
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,555
and even explained Article 750 of the Civil Code.

51
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:28,985
You all said you liked it, and now you're backing out?

52
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,925
Who said we didn't like it?

53
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:34,025
Not when she passed with flying colours like this.

54
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:35,865
That's what I meant, too.

55
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:38,335
- So you were all in on it.
- Right?

56
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:41,105
When I'm a cop, I'm going to arrest every last one of you.

57
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:46,375
- A cop?
- Hey, Si On, you want to be a cop?

58
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:49,145
Hey, Cho Philip, didn't you go to the Police University?

59
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:53,015
- So you'd be my junior?
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

- I just got here.

64
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,995
Well, everyone, Jang Tong Woo's back from fighting with his girlfriend.

65
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,895
- Unbelievable.
- Where have you been?

66
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,235
- Sorry I'm a little late.
- Not at all.

67
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:12,295
Did you two make up?

68
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,205
Keep your voice down. Now everyone will know we fought.

69
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:18,875
He hasn't made up with her yet!

70
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:21,105
Look at this.

71
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:24,815

Congratulations.

74
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:33,155
What's all this?

75
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,785
We've got expensive Chinese dishes.

76
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,395
What's going on with you? Did you put your shop up for sale?

77
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:43,025
You called us all here. I'm nervous. What is this, the last supper?

78
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,735
To think, yesterday I was still on the fence about this.

79
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:46,995
Everyone,

80
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,165
I'm getting married.

81
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,175
- Let me see.
- Here. Please make sure you come.

82
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:56,475
- Congratulations.
- Congrats. I'll be there for sure.

83
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,745
- Congratulations, Mr. Jang.
- Thank you.

84
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:00,015
So you're really going through with it?

85
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,145
You know the saying about weddings. Nothing's final till you say 'I do'.

86
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,315
There you go again with your nonsense.

87
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:10,985
I'm just worried, that's all. He wasn't eating for days on end.

88
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:14,395
- And now suddenly a wedding...
- Come on. That's enough.

89
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,265
To be honest,

90
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,735
I just don't understand how a woman's mind works.

91
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:22,605
One minute, she's not mad anymore, and the next, I'm not so sure.

92
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:25,275
It's just a few days away.

93
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:28,575
If you've set the date, then it's a done deal.

94
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:30,175
Speaking of which,

95
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,615
I'd like you to officiate for me.

96
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,045
What?

97
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:35,445
An officiant?

98
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,015
Mr. Shin.

99
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:44,055
A widower as an officiant? Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:48,865
Besides, don't you know having no officiant is trendy now?

101
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,225
Is that right?

102
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:54,095
- Then Pillip, you can be the MC.
- What? Me?

103
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:55,505
- Yes.
- That's a great idea.

104
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,905
The MC's always the handsome friend.

105
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,045
Wait, no.

106
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:07,715
What I mean is, he's the best-looking one here.

107
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,185
Did you have to pick from just us?

108
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:12,655
But since I'm from Andong,

109
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:16,285
not having one feels a little...

110
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,725
What's with that look?

111
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:23,095
It's kind of scary.

112
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,235
Here, take this.

113
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:27,665
What is this?

114
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:30,635
Congratulations on passing your exam.

115
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,775
Buy yourself something nice to wear to the wedding.

116
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:37,005
I have plenty of clothes. Mr. Shin already bought me a lot.

117
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:38,415
That's different.

118
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:40,775
This is for your wedding attire.

119
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:42,215
My wedding attire?

120
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,585
It's a family gift for the wedding.

121
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,455
To me, you're like my little sister.

122
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:51,995
Come on.

123
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,995
I guess I really am part of the Hujin Arcade family.

124
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:58,435
You didn't know? We all think of you as family.

125
00:06:58,495 --> 00:06:59,495
I know.

126
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,905
What's wrong with it? I think it's pretty.

127
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,245
Go change, Si On. That's not it.

128
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:21,055
Perfect, Si On. You look like Her Majesty the Queen.

129
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,655
- How much is this?
- It's around 2,000 dollars.

130
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,025
No.

131
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,535
Isn't it a little revealing right here?

132
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,465
- Look, Mr. Shin.
- What?

133
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,805
I think I liked the last one better.

134
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,015
Fine, just pick whichever one you want.

135
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:49,545
This is perfect for a wedding. The other ones were little...

136
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:50,615
This is the most appropriate, right?

137
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:56,155
Si On, I should've gotten the strawberry.

138
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,755
I want some ice cream too. It's not fair you two eat without me.

139
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:01,965
- Then go get some yourself.
- I'll be right back.

140
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,325
All right, see you in a bit.

141
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,585
- I'll have this one.
- Okay.

142
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:31,495
Is it true you hired Yun Dong Hee to commit a contract killing?

143
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:35,165
- Why order Cha So Yeon's murder?
- Did you really gaslight him?

144
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:40,335
I treated my patient, and didn't gaslight him.

145
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,835
Based only on the words of a patient with a severe mental illness,

146
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:46,675
framing me as a criminal is a criminal act itself.

147
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:49,805
- I will fully cooperate.
- Stand back!

148
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,815
- Do you admit to the charges?
- Please give us a statement!

149
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,975
Please just say something!

150
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:54,715
(With the People! For a Hopeful Future!)

151
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,255
Since police filed no charges, the case is as good as over.

152
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:02,325
If Yun Dong Hee appeals, it could go to prosecution,

153
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:05,095
but he has his own hands full, so I doubt he can do it.

154
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:11,635
With me at the police station, you've been busy, Pillip. I'm sorry.

155
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:14,295
Mr. Shin.

156
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,305
Detective Choi.

157
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:20,305
- You've been through a lot.
- Not at all.

158
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,945
I owe it all to you, Detective Choi. Thank you so much.

159
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,015
You two haven't eaten, have you? Let's go.

160
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,655
There's a delicious tofu place right in front of the station.

161
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,155
Tofu?

162
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:37,285
Sounds good. Time for a fresh start, Mr. Shin.

163
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,225
You little punk, shut it.

164
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:40,855
Let's go.

165
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:42,395
Let's go. Yes.

166
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,435
Hello.

167
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,335
Nice tie.

168
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:55,245
- You made it.
- Yes, I'm here.

169
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:56,805
- Hey!
- Please, go on up.

170
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,045
- Hello.
- Hi.

171
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,785
- Hey, you made it.
- Let's go!

172
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:12,625
(Groom: Jang Tong Woo Bride: Song Yeon Ji)

173
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:24,435
Wow, this is why I love traditional weddings.

174
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:29,245
They did a nice job with the photos here.

175
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:34,985
Hey, is that really Mr. Jang?

176
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,085
They really overdid it with the Photoshop.

177
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,285
It doesn't even look like Mr. Jang.

178
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,485
Right? It doesn't look like him, does it?

179
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:45,125
You've really made it, Mr. Jang.

180
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,395
With a bride this beautiful,

181
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,765
what's a little heartache?

182
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:53,165
That guy is a real piece of work.

183
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:56,635
Not too long ago, he was out for his blood.

184
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:58,205
I can't help it. I'm getting emotional.

185
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:01,235
You should've been this nice when he was still around.

186
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:04,815
So you're saying it's not happening?

187
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:08,045
Yes. My dad won't approve.

188
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:10,285
What's so wrong with a fifty-fifty marriage?

189
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,755
You know my dad.

190
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,955
He insists the man has to be the one to buy the house.

191
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,895
Who even thinks like that these days?

192
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:21,725
Listen.

193
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:23,965
Look at me.

194
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,595
When I said I'd cancel the wedding, what did you tell me?

195
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:32,105
You said you'd convince your father before the wedding, right?

196
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:36,905
I got my parents to approve. What are you going to do now?

197
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,815
Let's just have the ceremony, and I swear...

198
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:44,015
I'll definitely convince my dad. Okay?

199
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:46,655
How can I possibly trust you now?

200
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:48,855
A man who lied to me right up until our wedding day.

201
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:54,725
Look, I'm about to lose my temper. Can you leave? I might hit you.

202
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:55,925
Yeon Ji!

203
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:01,265
Unbelievable...

204
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:07,635
Mr. Jang.

205
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,405
- You're here.
- Your wedding photos are great.

206
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,945
Hey, are you sick? Why the long face?

207
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:17,445
Why the long face?

208
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:20,385
Yeon Ji says she can't marry me.

209
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,085
Why? Did she fall out of love with you?

210
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,625
It's not that.

211
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:28,625
What Yeon Ji wants is a fifty-fifty marriage.

212
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,695
A fifty-fifty marriage? What's that?

213
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:35,265
- Half the time together?
- Seriously...

214
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,935
It's when a couple splits expenses fifty-fifty.

215
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:41,605
That's pretty popular these days. I like it. No burden on either side.

216
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,575
Then what's the problem? You guys can just do that.

217
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,375
My father is the problem.

218
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,545
And Yeon Ji's parents are just as adamant.

219
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:53,085
For goodness' sake.

220
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,585
Looks like you'll have to step in.

221
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:01,695
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

222
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:07,295
Whoever gives more naturally expects more in return.

223
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:11,705
It doesn't matter who's who.

224
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:16,145
We're just saying let's be fair. What's the problem with that?

225
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,545
He's 100 percent right about that.

226
00:13:22,145 --> 00:13:23,745
A daughter-in-law who's so blunt about what's right...

227
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,055
I'm just worried she'll get on her in-laws' bad side.

228
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:32,595
See? This is exactly why I want to split it all fifty-fifty.

229
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:35,195
My mom and dad only have me.

230
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:37,225
And you're an only son.

231
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:38,235
Tong Woo.

232
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:49,105
I want to treat both sets of parents equally.

233
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:53,945
I want to split costs to be an equal partner in our life.

234
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,315
- Right, Mom?
- Of course! Absolutely!

235
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,515
- Right, Dad?
- Yes. You bet. Of course.

236
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,085
Why won't your father let us?

237
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:03,885
- Dad!
- Knock it off!

238
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:08,595
Come on, just let the kids do what they want.

239
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,725
Why are you always taking his side?

240
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:14,565
When a new bride joins the family, the groom's side provides the house.

241
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:16,435
That's our family's way, isn't it?

242
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:20,235
That's how you've lived your life in comfort, like a queen!

243
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:25,675
Comfortable? I was sick with worry. I don't care about the tradition.

244
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,785
Do you want our son to die a lonely old bachelor?

245
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:32,015
What are you on about now? Always muttering and scheming!

246
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:34,215
- Dad!
- Attention!

247
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:37,725
I offer to buy you a house, and you still make a fuss.

248
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,155
And it's not just about our family tradition.

249
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:44,725
We need to pay so that, as a man, you can hold your head high.

250
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:48,635
- Look at the state of you.
- What's wrong with the state of me?

251
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:52,305
You're acting like the houseboy. Here, go ahead and sweep.

252
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,275
Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am.

253
00:14:57,045 --> 00:15:01,145
Yes, my name is Mr. Shin. I run the chicken shop by Jang's.

254
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,515
Yes. A pleasure to meet you.

255
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:06,555
It's clear how much you both love your son.

256
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:09,655
- What parents don't?
- Exactly.

257
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:16,695
But the bride's family is saying they don't need any gifts or money.

258
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:18,495
What I'm getting at is...

259
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:23,765
I hear her family observes ancestral rites nine times a year,

260
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:26,605
and since Tong Woo is such a great cook,

261
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:31,375
he could make the savoury pancakes and the soup for every ceremony,

262
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:35,445
and on holidays, he could even make some braised short ribs.

263
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:39,155
If he does all that, his in-laws will absolutely adore him,

264
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:42,525
and he could hold his head high. What do you think, sir?

265
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:47,055
What are you talking about? Why should our son serve their dead?

266
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:50,425
I'm about to stop doing it for our own ancestors!

267
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:53,435
So why are you spouting such ridiculous nonsense?

268
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,865
I offer to give them the house and still...

269
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,805
Just give it to them.

270
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:06,075
Just skip the parents, and give it to the grandchild directly.

271
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:09,345
A grandchild that doesn't exist yet? That could take ages!

272
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,155
Oh, my gosh! Is she pregnant?

273
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:13,455
For real?!

274
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:16,685
- What? For real?!
- My boy!

275
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:20,525
- Easy there, ma'am.
- Dad, it's always been Yeon Ji.

276
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:23,065
- Well done, son!
- Is it a boy? A boy?

277
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:26,265
- It's a boy.
- How can you ask that right now?

278
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:30,505
- He's quick, just like his dad.
- We should go.

279
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:32,735
- I got it in one shot!
- Thank you.

280
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:44,445
(Agreement: Tong Woo and Yeon Ji Home and Wedding: Pay Evenly)

281
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:45,515
(Parental allowances: equal. 5: Events: equal. 6: Chores: fair)

282
00:16:58,265 --> 00:16:59,835
I think you're clear to begin your address, sir.

283
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,265
- Understood. I'll keep it brief.
- Yes, brief is good.

284
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:05,075
- Right.
- Is that Chancellor Kim Kyung Soo?

285
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,075
- Who's that?
- Could it really be...

286
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:11,845
he's the officiant?

287
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:15,485
- Sir, if you'll just step this way.
- Yes.

288
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,715
Tong Woo, that punk.

289
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,825
Let me introduce the groom and bride!

290
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:23,825
She's so pretty.

291
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:29,425
Article one. Our house cost will be split fifty to fifty.

292
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:33,695
Article two. Wedding costs will be split evenly.

293
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:38,265
Article three. For one holiday, we'll see the groom's family first,

294
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,905
and the bride's family first for the other.

295
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:46,075
Article four. We'll give parents equal allowance.

296
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,545
Article five. We'll treat family events equally.

297
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:51,915
Article six.

298
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:56,225
House chores will be divided fairly by mutual agreement.

299
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,995
The groom, Jang Tong Woo,

300
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,665
- The bride, Song Yeon Ji.
- We...

301
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:05,595
are now getting married.

302
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,305
As they say, "Man proposes, God disposes,"

303
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,635
and from that, a harmonious home will prosper.

304
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:14,605
So love each other, always and forever.

305
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,945
Next up, we'll have a speech from the groom's father.

306
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:24,885
Let's give him a warm round of applause, everyone.

307
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:36,925
Hello...

308
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:38,595
Is this thing on?

309
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:43,405
Yes, I am the father of the groom, Jang Tong Woo.

310
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:48,105
I had a speech prepared, Instead, I'll address their agreement...

311
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,215
my son and his bride prepared. I'll give that instead of my speech.

312
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:56,285
First, I offered them a house, but since they refused,

313
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:59,185
we'll do it their way and split it evenly.

314
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,585
I'll give my half to my grandchild who will be born next year.

315
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,925
It's all about splitting things fifty-fifty these days.

316
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:12,235
And for the holidays, you don't need to see us twice a year.

317
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:14,535
Just come once, and take a pass on the other!

318
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:16,235
I'll skip the rest.

319
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:18,775
Oh, happy day!

320
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:26,245
- Dad, smile.
- I am smiling.

321
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:28,685
One, two, three.

322
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,255
Everyone looks so happy.

323
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:39,855
Hey, Si On, does this make you want to get married?

324
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:43,295
Someday...

325
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:45,335
I guess I will.

326
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:49,435
No matter which punk you marry,

327
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,665
you can't do it without my blessing.

328
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:52,805
Of course.

329
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:54,935
You're the one who's going to walk me down the aisle.

330
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:06,255
Friends and family, please come forward.

331
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,755
Let's go get our picture taken. Come on, let's go, Si On, come on.

332
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:09,825
Let's go.

333
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:17,665
Thanks.

334
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:22,235
- Hope you'll be happy.
- Thanks.

335
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,275
Congratulations.

336
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:37,445
(Ji In)

337
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,255
Hello?

338
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,355
Congratulations.

339
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:00,905
I was planning to tell you after the college entrance exams.

340
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:04,245
But that banner really made me angry.

341
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:05,545
What?

342
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:06,875
I...

343
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,485
I really want to be a cop.

344
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:11,215
Really?

345
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:13,855
Then how about the Police University?

346
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:16,455
I'll tutor you. I was 1st in class at the academy.

347
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:18,625
There you go again, showing off.

348
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:28,065
This place was pretty during the day,

349
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,205
but it's beautiful at night, too.

350
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:32,635
Yes.

351
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:35,105
The moon is beautiful, too.

352
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:41,545
You're more beautiful.

353
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,085
Whatever...

354
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:50,155
Yes, I know.

355
00:21:58,595 --> 00:21:59,595
I have something for you.

356
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,785
What do you give it to me?

357
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,645
Who else would I give it to?

358
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:19,985
There's no one but you.

359
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:27,925
Why?

360
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:30,095
Don't you like it?

361
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:05,395
It's beautiful.

362
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:51,345
(Courthouse)

363
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:54,645
The number of civil cases filed in court in 2023 was...

364
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:59,055
over 4.57 million, and the number continues to rise.

365
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:01,015
And I'm sure everyone here knows that, right?

366
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:04,885
On average, a civil lawsuit costs thousands to tens of thousands.

367
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:07,525
And the first trial takes an average of one year.

368
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:10,525
For ordinary people, that's an agonizing amount of time and money.

369
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:13,835
But does going to trial even guarantee a clean resolution?

370
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:16,805
Is the law truly fair to everyone?

371
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:19,775
Do you really believe that's what justice is?

372
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,875
I, for one, do not.

373
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:24,305
The wealthy can afford to hire expensive lawyers,

374
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:27,615
while those without often go unrepresented.

375
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:31,915
Too often, the verdict is decided by who has more money.

376
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:36,555
The law shouldn't be a weapon for the rich and powerful, right?

377
00:24:37,385 --> 00:24:42,025
This is why I decided to create the Conflict Resolution Task Force.

378
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:45,595
But isn't that what the Mediation Committee is for?

379
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:47,735
The current system makes proactive mediation very difficult.

380
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,065
We're all experts at reviewing documents, aren't we?

381
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,405
But let's be honest.

382
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,075
How can people like us, stuck behind our desks,

383
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,575
truly understand the hardships...

384
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:58,915
that ordinary people face every day?

385
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:00,745
Mediation is a great idea, sure.

386
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:03,145
But is it realistically feasible?

387
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:07,955
The Shin's Project. For 18 months, I've funded this...

388
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:12,525
from my own pocket, and through it, we've mediated over 20 cases.

389
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:16,565
All of them were settled amicably without ever going to trial.

390
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:20,965
Cases range from neighbourly disputes to corporate lawsuits.

391
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:23,305
They included suits against local government.

392
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:27,575
Best of all, it saved a lot of time and even more money.

393
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,575
The court provides legal support,

394
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:33,675
while communication and mediation are handled by a field expert.

395
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,075
What kind of expert?

396
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:37,915
Mr. Shin of the Shin's Project.

397
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:40,915
And who is he exactly?

398
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:43,855
Shin Jay.

399
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:47,095
He's a former FBI and Interpol crisis negotiation advisor,

400
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:52,095
He's a negotiation expert who was the youngest to teach at Harvard.

401
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:57,405
Recruited by our Foreign Ministry, he has handled disputes...

402
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:59,075
of all sizes and negotiations between nations.

403
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:02,575
You mean someone so accomplished is leading this Task Force?

404
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,345
I'm telling you, he's been doing it this whole time.

405
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:06,475
Of course, he handled some of them alone,

406
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,815
but he also worked on several cases...

407
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,915
together with one of our judges, Cho Pillip.

408
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:14,985
So the two of them are leading the Task Force?

409
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,755
That's the plan for now.

410
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,155
So this is that task force you were talking about?

411
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,725
I knew something was fishy when you brought Pillip in.

412
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:27,865
Using my name without permission and stirring up all this trouble.

413
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:30,135
What, you think I'm doing this for my own benefit?

414
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:32,375
So you're doing it for my sake then?

415
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:36,375
You do what you do best, and so does Judge Cho.

416
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:39,345
- You two work so well together.
- Oh, come on. No.

417
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:41,475
Find someone better than me.

418
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:43,645
To me, you're the best person for the job.

419
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:46,385
Oh, really? Why? Because I'm easy to boss around?

420
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:50,225
Wait, wait. I just thought of someone better.

421
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,225
He has a great give-and-take dynamic with Pillip.

422
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:55,825
This job is perfect for him.

423
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,165
Who?

424
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:01,335
You got them all?

425
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:04,035
- 100 percent?
- See for yourself.

426
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,465
No way.

427
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:13,715
What is this?

428
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:15,245
You really did it.

429
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:20,055
I can't believe it. It was so hard to convince Ms. Jeong.

430
00:27:20,185 --> 00:27:22,855
Yes, she was a tough one.

431
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:25,025
I had to wash her blankets...

432
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:27,755
and spent an hour sorting her recycling.

433
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:35,465
- Thank you!
- Wow!

434
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:37,105
Hey, Pillip.

435
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:39,505
Wow, I'm impressed.

436
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:44,505
Of course. Our motto is "Give and Take."

437
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:55,985
(Give and Take by Kim Su Dong)

438
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:57,925
I already know how skilled Kim Su Dong is.

439
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:00,625
Does he still hack The Blue House these days?

440
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:04,895
Making a public official do your dirty work.

441
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,535
I told you, I didn't make him do it.

442
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:11,035
This country is so corrupt, he was just curious about it.

443
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:12,435
And he says he just took a little peek.

444
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:17,175
But the timing is suspicious. Why are so many scandals popping up?

445
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,575
He just looked. That's it.

446
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:22,015
He is doing nothing illegal. He's been clean for a long time.

447
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,545
All right, tell everyone to come on down.

448
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,285
- Count me out.
- Why?

449
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:28,215
- I have somewhere to be.
- Where?

450
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:29,285
America.

451
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:31,725
To see Ji In?

452
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:34,655
A week should be enough then, right?

453
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:36,925
I'll be with her for a long while.

454
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:39,765
Okay. Two weeks.

455
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:41,265
Tell you what, I'll give you two weeks.

456
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:43,135
Tell Ji In I said hello.

457
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,535
This guy, I swear.

458
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:49,305
You're such a pain. Seriously. .

459
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:54,115
Stop laughing.

460
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:57,085
(Temporarily Closed)

461
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,985
You really didn't have to come all this way.

462
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:06,295
Please give this to Ji In. It's just a little something.

463
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,855
I just wanted to show her I care.

464
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:10,425
Ji In also...

465
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:14,595
wanted me to tell you she's grateful you care for Jun.

466
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:19,035
- Have a safe trip.
- I will. Thank you.

467
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:25,375
Hey, why did you all come out too? It's not like I'm leaving for good.

468
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,815
Mr. Shin, you have to come back soon.

469
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:29,615
If you're gone too long, we'll lose our regulars.

470
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,655
- Especially since I'm leaving too.
- Worry about yourself, not me.

471
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:36,585
Once you're at that task force thing,

472
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:39,395
you'll see how Judge Kim Sang Geun is.

473
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:41,125
Then you'll get a taste of it yourself.

474
00:29:41,795 --> 00:29:43,295
I'll be back, Si On.

475
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,625
- Take care.
- Okay.

476
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,095
I'll be back, everyone.

477
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,095
You take good care of the shop.

478
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,505
- You have your passport, right?
- Hey, of course. Come on.

479
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,875
I'm off.

480
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,505
Hey, Si On. All right.

481
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,215
You can head in now, Madam Joo.

482
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,975
(Let's smile more today than we did yesterday)

483
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:05,245
(Conflict Resolution Task Force)

484
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:08,355
So this was your grand plan all along.

485
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:10,755
What do you think?

486
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:13,325
It's great.

487
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:17,225
To be honest, I learned a lot working with Mr. Shin.

488
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:19,795
That even the smallest cases are never simple.

489
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:23,705
- I've got my work cut out for me.
- Okay, good.

490
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:26,075
And you?

491
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:30,305
Looking at this, I'll have my hands full.

492
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:31,845
With a workload like this,

493
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:35,615
I should get overtime and hazard pay for this, right?

494
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:38,445
This is the Court. If I don't get you paid, I'm fired.

495
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:42,085
All right then.

496
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:43,625
Deal!

497
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,455
Okay, so you two are in.

498
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,825
For now, let's eat. This is good. So good.

499
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,765
It's delicious, right?

500
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:52,495
This is good.

501
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:54,295
I know.

502
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:56,765
(One Month Later)

503
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,205
Cho Pillip!

504
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,105
How have you been?

505
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,405
You've been well?

506
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:03,175
I've been well.

507
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:06,775
(Conflict Mediation TF, Project S)

508
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,075
Judge Cho, about that...

509
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:10,145
what happened with that lawsuit?

510
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,755
Which one? There are so many lawsuits.

511
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:15,255
The lawsuit about not feeling "soul-refreshing"...

512
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:17,155
You mean Jung Kyung Uk?

513
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:20,955
Yes. He sued again. Said he wasn't happy after one bite.

514
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:24,465
If you ask me, the guy's not in his right mind.

515
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:27,235
He's obviously harassing the defendant.

516
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,095
Do we really have to settle this?

517
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:31,235
Shouldn't we just take it to court and hit him with a hefty fine,

518
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:34,375
Whether we hit him with a fine or make him pay court costs,

519
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:35,975
Following the law is the easy part.

520
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:37,645
What you should be asking yourself is,

521
00:31:37,945 --> 00:31:39,675
why he keeps doing this.

522
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:45,515
If we check up on Jung Kyung Uk, I'm sure something will pop up.

523
00:31:45,585 --> 00:31:46,915
Forget a background check. Do a "foreground" check.

524
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:48,955
The two of you, go meet him and ask him directly.

525
00:31:49,455 --> 00:31:51,225
I'm going to see Judge Choi.

526
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:53,095
I ran into him earlier,

527
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,295
and he said he absolutely will not join.

528
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:56,825
And you're proud of that?

529
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,365
What did you say to make him refuse so strongly?

530
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,595
I told him it was rewarding work.

531
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:07,905
You should've told him it's the path to a great future.

532
00:32:07,975 --> 00:32:11,205
A future for the Republic of Korea, a future for his career.

533
00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:15,145
You're so inflexible. What did Mr. Shin teach you?

534
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:20,655
That guy has a weird way of putting things.

535
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:23,355
Why bring up Mr. Shin? Unbelievable.

536
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,455
Mr. Kwon, you're going too far.

537
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:29,525
You're the one who's going way, way too far, ma'am.

538
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:31,595
What do you mean the cleaning bill is 250 dollars?

539
00:32:31,895 --> 00:32:34,135
I've been your customer for ten years.

540
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,595
How can you charge this much?

541
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:36,835
Why doesn't it make sense?

542
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:40,505
Five dress shirts for 15 dollars, five coats for 75 dollars,

543
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:43,005
and 160 for the mink. It adds up.

544
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:45,045
I even threw in the scarves for free.

545
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:46,475
160 Dollars for a mink coat?

546
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:47,745
Look, Mr. Kwon.

547
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:51,085
- Since when do you charge for mink?
- I decided to start this year.

548
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:55,855
For ten years, I cleaned your minks, ironed your shirts, and for what?

549
00:32:56,155 --> 00:33:00,495
You threaten to kick me out, and you're always raising my rent.

550
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,795
You should have some shame. Why do you always rip me off?

551
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,625
Are you done, Mr. Kwon?

552
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:09,065
Who do you think you have to thank for your business here?

553
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:10,935
I get by on my own skills, so what?

554
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:14,505
I won the grand prize...

555
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,305
at the National Dry Cleaning Competition twice!

556
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:19,975
Look at him, getting all bug-eyed.

557
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:22,475
Mr. Kwon, are you crazy?

558
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:29,215
Honey, I'm at the dry cleaner's in the arcade.

559
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:31,125
Tell them to kick this shop out immediately.

560
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:32,525
The nerve of that tenant!

561
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:35,995
I'm only gone for a month...

562
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:39,435
and the whole neighbourhood has turned into a war zone.

563
00:33:39,795 --> 00:33:41,635
Hey, Mister, who are you?

564
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:52,705
Me?

565
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:57,385
I'm just the small business owner who pays rent to fry chicken here.

566
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:58,915
Why do you ask?

567
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:00,655
Mr. Shin!

568
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:06,095
Look at all the riff-raff sticking together.

569
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:10,425
We get along just fine, so you don't need to worry about us.

570
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,325
But listen, ma'am.

571
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:13,665
This man here...

572
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:17,105
Do you have any idea who you're messing with?

573
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:18,335
What's that supposed to mean?

574
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:23,105
Ma'am, you've picked the wrong guy. Your husband is trying to impress...

575
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:25,375
City Councilman Kwon Bong Geun, right?

576
00:34:25,745 --> 00:34:30,085
He and this man, Kwon Chil Bong, are blood brothers.

577
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:31,285
The Kwon Family!

578
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:33,155
That's ridiculous.

579
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,255
Don't lie.

580
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:40,455
Go ahead and check for yourself. Who are you to pull a power trip?

581
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:42,825
- What? A power trip?
- Who's on a power trip?

582
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:45,065
Pillip!

583
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:52,605
She wants her mink coat cleaned free and threatens to have me kicked out.

584
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:56,745
That statement falls under Criminal Act 283, Intimidation,

585
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:59,545
punishable by up to 3 years' prison or a fine of up to 5,000 dollars.

586
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:03,145
Also, it appears you are obstructing his business in front of the store,

587
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:06,455
which is Criminal Act Art. 314, Obstruction of Business,

588
00:35:06,515 --> 00:35:09,115
punishable by up to 5 years in jail or a fine of up to 15000 dollars.

589
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:10,655
Shall I continue?

590
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:14,495
What, are you all ganging up...

591
00:35:14,595 --> 00:35:16,865
on one defenceless woman?

592
00:35:17,725 --> 00:35:18,795
I'm not going to stand for this!

593
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,435
You'll pay for this!

594
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,775
- Tell Mr. Kim to come himself!
- Unbelievable.

595
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,735
Mr. Shin.

596
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:30,475
I've missed you.

597
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:35,375
This neighbourhood falls apart the second I'm gone.

598
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:37,715
Mr. Shin. I missed you too.

599
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:40,255
Come here. I missed you too.

600
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,755
Hey, Pillip, aren't you getting in on this?

601
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:52,625
Alright, hold on. It's been a while, so it's my treat.

602
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:54,595
Let's go grab some chicken. How about it?

603
00:35:54,665 --> 00:35:56,505
- Yes, okay!
- Let's go.

604
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:58,743
That outfit isn't your daily outfit,

605
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:00,513
nor Officer Kim's.

606
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,413
What's the look you're going for?

607
00:36:03,313 --> 00:36:04,983
These days, I'm just...

608
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,613
Kim Su Dong.

609
00:36:07,183 --> 00:36:10,153
Man, once my online and real-life personas merged,

610
00:36:10,423 --> 00:36:11,753
it's so liberating.

611
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:15,493
Hey, you're one to talk, Mr. Shin. What's with this whole getup?

612
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:17,763
I know, right? What's with that hat?

613
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:21,763
I have a friend named Manuel, in California,

614
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:25,833
who runs a big Mexican restaurant.

615
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:29,673
Business was going so well he opened some branches in Mexico.

616
00:36:30,503 --> 00:36:33,743
But you know how it is, things don't always go as planned.

617
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:40,313
He wanted to sell the business. I brokered a deal with a rich local.

618
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:45,083
The deal went through smoothly, so he gave me this as a gift.

619
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:47,693
But after all that incredible work,

620
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:49,323
did you really only get a hat?

621
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:53,563
Hey, what do you mean, "all I got"! A Mexican master artisan made this.

622
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:58,003
He painstakingly made this by hand, stitch by stitch.

623
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:59,603
Limited edition.

624
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:02,003
Alright, so how much did it cost?

625
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:04,173
45 bucks.

626
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:09,343
- Come on. Seriously?
- Hey, just listen.

627
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:11,213
Anyway, what brings you two here?

628
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:15,253
Mr. Shin, you need a little after-sales service.

629
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:16,783
After-sales service?

630
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:18,053
What kind of after-sales service?

631
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:22,123
Remember Jung Kyung Uk, who sued us? Said it wasn't "soul-refreshing."

632
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:23,423
Jung Kyung Uk?

633
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:26,093
Right. That psycho?

634
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,993
- Yes, but we settled that.
- He's suing us again.

635
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:30,863
- Again?
- This time,

636
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:34,203
he's suing since it didn't make him happy.

637
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:35,273
What a lunatic.

638
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,003
That absolute psycho.

639
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:38,573
He's a serial suer.

640
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:43,243
A guy like that needs a taste of real misery...

641
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:46,113
to realise, "Wow, I actually had it good."

642
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:50,523
- "That's the true taste of joy." - Right.

643
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:52,823
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes?

644
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,893
- What should we do?
- What?

645
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:55,963
What should we do?

646
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:59,263
What do you mean, "what should we do?"

647
00:38:00,293 --> 00:38:01,293
You two are...

648
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:04,503
the so-called Task Force, right? You guys handle it.

649
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,473
- What?
- Hey!

650
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:07,533
That's a low blow.

651
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:11,043
Mamma mia, señorita.

652
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:15,343
- Seriously.
- Hasta la vista.

653
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:18,983
Hasta la vista.

654
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,953
Hasta la vista!

655
00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:27,453
And Ji In...

656
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:28,953
is doing well?

657
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:32,993
She's gotten so thin.

658
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:37,763
It took me 15 years...

659
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,103
to say I'm sorry to Ji In.

660
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:42,173
When I think about it,

661
00:38:43,403 --> 00:38:45,203
I feel just awful about it.

662
00:38:46,943 --> 00:38:48,013
I'm glad you went.

663
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:50,383
You did the right thing. Here, have a drink.

664
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:57,323
So now, what's your plan?

665
00:38:57,623 --> 00:38:59,053
What do you think?

666
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:02,723
The shop was closed for a month, but my landlord, Chairman Park...

667
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:07,563
- still demanded rent. Unbelievable.
- He did?

668
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:12,203
Seriously. What's with that guy?

669
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:13,433
Tell me about it.

670
00:39:13,773 --> 00:39:15,403
It's tough making a living.

671
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:17,143
So,

672
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,513
come work for the Task Force.

673
00:39:19,873 --> 00:39:21,473
I'll give you a 20 percent pay bump.

674
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:26,383
20 Percent? How stingy. At least double it.

675
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:27,583
Come on.

676
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:29,553
You're a straight-up thief.

677
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:34,053
It's called "Shin's Project," right? Well, I'm Mr. Shin.

678
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,593
All right, fine.

679
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:37,763
We'll see how you do.

680
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,433
I'm sure Su Dong is crushing it, as always.

681
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:45,973
- How's Pillip doing?
- Yes,

682
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:51,273
- he's actually really on the ball.
- Well, who do you think taught him?

683
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,083
This is hitting the spot.

684
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:15,233
Hey, Judge Cho!

685
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:16,963
Hey, turn up the volume.

686
00:40:20,603 --> 00:40:23,903
Lee Heo Jun, who gaslit an inmate into murdering a colleague,

687
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:28,843
was sentenced to 17 years in prison in his first trial today...

688
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:30,213
and was taken into custody.

689
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:33,653
- The former director...
- Sweet justice.

690
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:35,553
He has denied all charges and will appeal immediately.

691
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,683
Park Jae Hyung has the story.

692
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:38,823
(Congrats on the promotion! To your future!)

693
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:39,893
(From Gyeonggi Bukbu Detective Task Force)

694
00:40:39,953 --> 00:40:43,123
All right, all right. Next up, from Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency,

695
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:45,893
Detective Task Force, Officer Choi Cheol.

696
00:40:50,463 --> 00:40:54,973
I grant a special one-rank promotion to Sergeant.

697
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:59,643
Choi Cheol! Choi Cheol!

698
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:04,243
Kang Yeo Gyeong, Park Jung Hwan, congratulations on your promotions.

699
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,513
- Thank you.
- Let's hear it for them!

700
00:41:08,353 --> 00:41:10,923
- Everyone's off today, right?
- Yes!

701
00:41:10,983 --> 00:41:13,853
Let's drink our hearts out tonight. Come on!

702
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:16,063
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

703
00:41:16,563 --> 00:41:17,763
Congratulations.

704
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:20,563
- Thank you.
- You did great. Really great.

705
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:22,963
But, if you want to get technical,

706
00:41:23,303 --> 00:41:26,203
Cheol is the one who deserves all the credit for this award.

707
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,643
Come on, it wasn't me. Our Team Leader did all the work.

708
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:32,243
- Team Leader, give us a song!
- Me?

709
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:33,873
- Yes, belt one out!
- You really want me to sing?

710
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:40,153
You're really something else. You made history by being disciplined,

711
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:42,053
and then made history again by getting promoted for it.

712
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:45,993
On our team, a new Sergeant and a Superintendent.

713
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,953
Man, that's really something.

714
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:52,023
What does it matter if I have three pips or four?

715
00:41:52,123 --> 00:41:54,033
A detective's job is to catch crooks, that's it.

716
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:57,733
Detective Kang, let's go bust some fraudsters.

717
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:58,833
What?

718
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:02,073
All right, everyone. Congratulate our team leader tonight.

719
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:05,143
- I'm off to catch some criminals.
- Man, you're a real workhorse.

720
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:06,213
We'll be on our way.

721
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,313
- Raise your glasses.
- Let's have a drink.

722
00:42:07,313 --> 00:42:09,113
- Cheers.
- Thank you for your hard work.

723
00:42:11,213 --> 00:42:12,213
Enjoy!

724
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:14,683
(Hujin Arcade, Chicken Center)

725
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:17,553
- Your Honour, shall we begin?
- Yes.

726
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:24,163
Man, this guy really set me off. I haven't been this mad in ages.

727
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:28,163
The number of lawsuits he's filed and then dropped...

728
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:31,733
is over 30. And you know what's even crazier?

729
00:42:31,803 --> 00:42:36,143
All the settlement money combined isn't even five grand.

730
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:38,773
He wasn't just doing this for pocket change.

731
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:40,113
What else have you got?

732
00:42:40,173 --> 00:42:43,683
I'd love to dig into his bank accounts,

733
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:48,353
and expose his personal information. My fingers are itching to do it.

734
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:51,623
But I need a warrant for all that.

735
00:42:53,293 --> 00:42:55,423
Mr. Shin, hello.

736
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:59,693
Congratulations on your promotion, Sergeant Choi.

737
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:02,293
How did you know? Thank you.

738
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:05,663
- Congratulations, Detective Kang.
- Thank you.

739
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:09,573
For my promotion, I'm buying. Can we get some chicken?

740
00:43:09,943 --> 00:43:12,103
All right. Go ahead and have a seat.

741
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:13,713
I'm so sorry.

742
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:17,213
The traffic was terrible, so I'm a little late. I'm sorry.

743
00:43:17,313 --> 00:43:19,513
Look who's here. The guy with the warrant.

744
00:43:20,753 --> 00:43:23,723
In Jung Kyung Uk's bank account, we found money from a law firm.

745
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:28,723
So, he's a litigation broker.

746
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:30,363
Jung Kyung Uk files a suit,

747
00:43:30,663 --> 00:43:34,033
the firm approaches the defendant and gets hired to represent them.

748
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:36,033
All right, chicken's here.

749
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:38,263
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

750
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:43,573
Pace yourself.

751
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:46,773
Hey, Mr. Shin!

752
00:43:47,713 --> 00:43:48,713
What?

753
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:51,083
Why are you going to the kitchen? There are no other customers.

754
00:43:51,183 --> 00:43:53,753
Hey, don't be lonely by yourself. Come eat with us, okay?

755
00:43:53,813 --> 00:43:57,323
- Let go of me, man.
- Hey, the chicken here is amazing.

756
00:43:57,653 --> 00:44:01,523
- Who do you think you're telling?
- Come on, eat with us.

757
00:44:01,523 --> 00:44:02,993
Come on, sit down.

758
00:44:04,723 --> 00:44:07,663
Telling the owner of a chicken joint to eat his own chicken.

759
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:11,563
(Chicken Center)

760
00:44:12,203 --> 00:44:13,573
Look at this. Just look.

761
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:18,073
Every single one of these victims is a small business owner.

762
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:20,873
Why? Because they're easy targets.

763
00:44:20,943 --> 00:44:23,883
So he nitpicks over the most ridiculous things.

764
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:25,843
Hold on a second.

765
00:44:30,553 --> 00:44:32,823
Crispy to the soul.

766
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,593
Our original fried chicken.

767
00:44:36,763 --> 00:44:38,363
Take one bite,

768
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:41,993
and our sweet and spicy chicken brings pure joy.

769
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,633
What do you think?

770
00:44:46,403 --> 00:44:48,903
If we use this as our ad, right?

771
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:52,603
Don't you think that crazy punk will try to sue us?

772
00:44:53,913 --> 00:44:56,683
Are you saying you want to be the bait?

773
00:44:56,943 --> 00:44:59,413
We have to go big, right?

774
00:44:59,683 --> 00:45:01,953
It's "Shin's Project," after all.

775
00:45:23,643 --> 00:45:25,873
It's only once a week. Are you sure you'll be okay?

776
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:27,773
You must feel cooped up in your cell.

777
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,613
You should consider daily visits, sir.

778
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,413
For now, it's bearable.

779
00:45:35,313 --> 00:45:36,723
The people here...

780
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:38,423
treat me very well.

781
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,153
I'm glad to hear that.

782
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:31,243
Those inmates over there, where are they from?

783
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:34,913
They're temporary from Seonhyang. It's under construction.

784
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:36,843
They'll be sent back next week.

785
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:39,853
Let's go.

786
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:05,803
The presidential election is just around the corner.

787
00:47:06,473 --> 00:47:08,043
About a month ago, I think...

788
00:47:08,713 --> 00:47:11,643
on my way to an interrogation, I saw your son.

789
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:14,653
He's the spitting image of his father.

790
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:18,783
I'll be waiting for good news.

791
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:31,233
Man, it's hot today.

792
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:35,573
Guard.

793
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:39,943
Would you like an IV drip?

794
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:43,143
- I'm fine, Doctor.
- Okay.

795
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:24,453
Dong Hee.

796
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:26,493
Teacher.

797
00:48:55,113 --> 00:48:56,113
Ready.

798
00:48:56,653 --> 00:48:57,653
Go!

799
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:08,893
Hey, Si On. You shaved off half a second today.

800
00:49:10,303 --> 00:49:11,703
Now let's just shave off one more second.

801
00:49:11,803 --> 00:49:14,033
Man, getting into the Police University is intense.

802
00:49:14,103 --> 00:49:17,343
. Hey, you'll run her into the ground.

803
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:21,443
Hey, Si On. If Police University is too hard,

804
00:49:21,513 --> 00:49:22,873
you can just do something else.

805
00:49:23,113 --> 00:49:25,813
Right. Instead of going there, just marry a guy who did.

806
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:31,753
- You cheeky little punk.
- What? What did I say?

807
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:33,623
Hey, you two, stop it.

808
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:35,753
Let's go get some ramen. I'm starving.

809
00:49:35,993 --> 00:49:39,193
Ramen? Sure. Let's eat first, then train.

810
00:49:41,363 --> 00:49:42,433
No way!

811
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:45,733
Did he really sue you? Because it wasn't "soul-crispy"?

812
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:47,573
I told you he would.

813
00:49:47,973 --> 00:49:50,973
Do you have any idea what he wrote in the complaint?

814
00:49:51,943 --> 00:49:55,173
He said the fried chicken made his soul soggy,

815
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:58,713
and the seasoned chicken brought waves of misery crashing down.

816
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:02,753
That's insane. Our chicken is crispy and delicious.

817
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:05,223
- They don't know anything.
- It's hot.

818
00:50:08,493 --> 00:50:09,493
Yes.

819
00:50:10,563 --> 00:50:11,563
Really?

820
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,093
Understood.

821
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:17,433
Mr. Shin, the law firm called. We'll meet Detective Choi and Officer Kim.

822
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:18,703
Really?

823
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:22,573
- We should get going!
- Hey, let me finish eating.

824
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:25,843
- Then hurry up and eat.
- Hey, let him eat in peace.

825
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:32,643
So this is why all the tourists come to the Han River for ramen.

826
00:50:33,683 --> 00:50:35,783
Sexy Food, you know that?

827
00:50:35,853 --> 00:50:37,883
- Sexy Food!
- Sexy Food!

828
00:50:39,723 --> 00:50:42,223
Yes. Enjoy, everyone.

829
00:50:42,293 --> 00:50:43,823
- Sexy Food!
- Sexy Food!

830
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:45,263
Sexy Food!

831
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:46,663
- Sexy Food!
- Sexy Food!

832
00:51:02,932 --> 00:51:05,602
- Did you pack everything you need?
- I'm not a baby.

833
00:51:05,672 --> 00:51:08,202
Could've fooled me. That's why I'm walking you there.

834
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:11,642
Ye On! Hey, Si On.

835
00:51:11,712 --> 00:51:14,912
- Hey.
- I'm going to go with Han.

836
00:51:15,012 --> 00:51:16,012
Okay.

837
00:51:18,382 --> 00:51:21,682
Nice necklace.

838
00:51:22,692 --> 00:51:26,062
Tell Pillip to make sure he keeps his promise.

839
00:51:26,692 --> 00:51:27,692
What promise?

840
00:51:27,762 --> 00:51:30,062
That's our little secret. Let's go, Ye On.

841
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:31,332
I'm heading out.

842
00:51:38,202 --> 00:51:40,472
- Bye, you two.
- Bye.

843
00:51:44,172 --> 00:51:47,442
What a beautiful day.

844
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:51,412
Hey, Si On.

845
00:51:51,982 --> 00:51:53,022
Where's Ye On?

846
00:51:53,382 --> 00:51:56,222
- She's at school already?
- Yes, and I'm starting deliveries.

847
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:58,022
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes?

848
00:51:58,022 --> 00:52:00,522
- Cho Pillip is driving me crazy.
- Why? What's wrong?

849
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:03,732
Did that punk... did he do something to you?

850
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:07,162
No, we barely see each other weekly.

851
00:52:07,302 --> 00:52:09,202
But he said it might not even happen this week.

852
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:12,942
Why is there so much work with that stupid task force?

853
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:15,342
Oh my. To be young and in love. That sounds great.

854
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:18,972
What's so great about it? I'm miserable waiting for him.

855
00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:22,652
- All right, take care.
- Okay.

856
00:52:22,712 --> 00:52:23,882
- See you later.
- See you.

857
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:24,952
Yes.

858
00:52:27,452 --> 00:52:28,722
- Hello.
- Hi.

859
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:30,892
(Ttoli Super)

860
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,722
- Hey, Joo In. Cleaning up?
- Hey.

861
00:52:33,822 --> 00:52:34,892
Always working hard.

862
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,562
- Off to the bathhouse?
- Yes.

863
00:52:37,632 --> 00:52:38,992
- Hey, wait a second.
- What?

864
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:41,302
- Just wait right there.
- What? Why?

865
00:52:43,402 --> 00:52:46,342
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Shin.

866
00:52:46,502 --> 00:52:50,542
Try this free sample from Mr. Choi. It's brand new.

867
00:52:50,612 --> 00:52:52,912
Hey, if Mr. Choi gave it to you, why are you giving it to me?

868
00:52:53,182 --> 00:52:56,052
Hey, don't you remember what you told Mr. Choi last time?

869
00:52:56,112 --> 00:52:59,582
You told him to give free samples to Ttoli Super first.

870
00:53:00,582 --> 00:53:02,552
And he's been bringing them over ever since.

871
00:53:02,952 --> 00:53:05,652
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

872
00:53:05,722 --> 00:53:10,132
- It's all thanks to you.
- Thanks.

873
00:53:11,532 --> 00:53:12,802
- Hey.
- Long time no see.

874
00:53:12,862 --> 00:53:15,002
Yes. Go ahead.

875
00:53:25,242 --> 00:53:26,242
Roll down the window.

876
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:27,542
Down.

877
00:53:29,012 --> 00:53:31,482
- Why?
- Why aren't you getting a move on?

878
00:53:31,552 --> 00:53:33,982
There's someone crossing in front of us.

879
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:35,922
Don't you see all the cars waiting behind us?

880
00:53:35,992 --> 00:53:38,222
What are you even talking about?

881
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:41,892
So what? Should I run people over and keep going?

882
00:53:41,962 --> 00:53:45,032
Of course not. I'm just in a hurry. The cars behind...

883
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:50,072
You just violated the Traffic Act 49. License, please.

884
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:51,172
I did what now?

885
00:53:51,232 --> 00:53:55,742
You were honking in a school zone and threatening the driver ahead.

886
00:53:55,802 --> 00:53:57,172
Your license, now!

887
00:53:57,272 --> 00:54:00,012
Can't you let this one slide?

888
00:54:00,012 --> 00:54:02,212
- No! Give it to me now!
- I was just in a hurry...

889
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:04,252
- At least three times a day.
- I said give it to me, now!

890
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:06,582
Throughout roughly 35 years of our working lives,

891
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:10,152
we face about 40,000 choices, big and small.

892
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:19,632
Ultimately, every moment of our life is a choice, a negotiation.

893
00:54:20,962 --> 00:54:23,802
Hey, do you know who this guy is?

894
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:26,702
He's the punk who officiated your wedding!

895
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:28,542
Everyone, you all saw that, right?

896
00:54:29,002 --> 00:54:30,472
You saw him, right?

897
00:54:31,112 --> 00:54:35,742
he's Chancellor Kim Kyung Soo? He's a waiter named Shin Kyoung Soo.

898
00:54:35,942 --> 00:54:39,422
He's a con artist! How could you let that bum do it?

899
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:41,752
- You introduced him to me.
- Come here.

900
00:54:41,752 --> 00:54:43,752
When did I ask you to find one?

901
00:54:44,122 --> 00:54:46,362
Hey! Do you know what this is?

902
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:51,392
This is the wedding speech I wrote. It took me three whole days.

903
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:55,062
Every time you got a new girlfriend, I rewrote the whole thing.

904
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:56,732
A total of 26 times!

905
00:54:56,802 --> 00:54:58,372
What are you talking about? That's a crazy thing to say.

906
00:54:58,702 --> 00:55:00,702
When did I ever date 26 women?

907
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:03,812
Wow, what a player. Seriously, a player!

908
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:06,282
Should I jog your memory? Look.

909
00:55:06,342 --> 00:55:07,982
Eun Hye, Se Yeong, Seo Yeong...

910
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:09,042
Seriously, what did you write in there?

911
00:55:09,112 --> 00:55:10,952
- Ah Seon, Jae Eun, Yun Hui...
- Let me see that! Give it here!

912
00:55:11,012 --> 00:55:12,012
- Give me that.
- Let go! Get off!

913
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:15,582
This was expensive, you punk.

914
00:55:38,312 --> 00:55:39,582
What to give up...

915
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:41,882
and what to protect.

916
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:44,382
Establishing that baseline...

917
00:55:44,982 --> 00:55:46,352
is where negotiation begins.

918
00:55:46,982 --> 00:55:50,852
The important thing is to find a way to coexist.

919
00:55:51,722 --> 00:55:52,822
That's what Mr. Shin used to say.

920
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:38,772
(Chicken Center)

921
00:56:47,382 --> 00:56:48,582
So, tell me,

922
00:56:49,042 --> 00:56:52,182
- What qualities make a good judge?
- Well...

923
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:57,022
I don't know about good judges, but you must be a good person first.

924
00:56:59,492 --> 00:57:03,162
You live up to your reputation. We've hit the jackpot with you.

925
00:57:03,562 --> 00:57:05,032
I feel like we've gained a powerful ally.

926
00:57:06,162 --> 00:57:09,672
It's for a good cause. While I was on the bench,

927
00:57:10,532 --> 00:57:11,802
I've often thought the same thing.

928
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:15,442
Mucho

929
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:27,552
I've got to change this password.

930
00:57:27,852 --> 00:57:31,222
How can just anyone waltz in and out of the shop when I'm not here?

931
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:32,752
- Mr. Shin.
- What?

932
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:35,462
I'll have one whole fried chicken. And make the coffee...

933
00:57:35,522 --> 00:57:36,532
What?

934
00:57:37,562 --> 00:57:39,262
Son of a...

935
00:57:40,232 --> 00:57:41,632
- I'll make it.
- Hey, sir...

936
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:42,702
No, let me...

937
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:49,242
- I'm here.
- Si On.

938
00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:52,342
- Good to see you. You've been well?
- Yes.

939
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:58,282
Who's he?

940
00:58:07,992 --> 00:58:09,792
- Here you go.
- Thank you. You first.

941
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:10,862
No, please.

942
00:58:17,572 --> 00:58:20,002
- This is really good.
- The fried chicken here is great.

943
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:21,802
And not a bad place to work, either.

944
00:58:22,372 --> 00:58:23,372
Work?

945
00:58:28,682 --> 00:58:29,982
He's Mr. Shin.

946
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:33,082
Oh!

947
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:34,452
(Give and Take)

948
00:58:35,252 --> 00:58:38,022
I look forward to working with you! Mr. Shin!

949
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:49,162
Great, another Pillip?

950
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:53,942
Get ready!

951
00:58:56,772 --> 00:58:57,772
Yes.

952
00:59:14,462 --> 00:59:18,692
(Thank you to everyone who has supported Shin's Project)

953
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:22,202
