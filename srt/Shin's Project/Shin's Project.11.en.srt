I'd like to help.

Someone could die,

10
00:01:08,732 --> 00:01:10,392
or we might have to kill someone.

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,640
The two of them might go back farther than you think.

12
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:18,842
- So it is anger, after all. - So even if I get my revenge,

13
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:20,772
are you saying that would be okay?

14
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,272
Does he want me...

15
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:25,282
to kill him?

16
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:30,582
- Pluto didn't open up. - You two, go get Mr. Jang.

Who said you could just come back to Korea?

18
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:35,952
This is mine. Hold on.

19
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,392
This is big. I'm telling you, it's huge.

20
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:42,192
I'll get you that money. Where did you hide the original USB?

21
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:47,402
- It's all over now. - I have the original.

22
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:53,802
I'm going to end this now.

23
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:00,782
Honey, the bag.

24
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:02,612
Hey, Jun.

25
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:06,052
- Bye. Have a good day. - You're coming to get me, right?

26
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:08,822
Of course. I promise I'll come get you later.

34

To make it look like an accident,

35
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:57,232
he would've tailed him for days. And this place was on his route.

36
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,042
So what's here?

37
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,442
Someone who can't afford to run into Yun Dong Hee.

38
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,042
- Hey, watch your step. - Okay.

39
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,612
I told you we should've just gone straight home.

40
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:14,722

- Now forwarding to voicemail. - Detective Kang?

00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:33,802
- What brings you here? - Is something wrong?

47
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:37,512
Mr. Shin's phone is off. Is there another way to contact him?

48
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,142
But he never turns his phone off, no matter what.

The phone is off. Now forwarding to voicemail...

50
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:45,822
He's really not picking up.

Untie me.

Come on, untie me.

00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:15,252

Let me go.

63

- Why did you do it? - This is insane.

64
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:51,612
I really don't know.

65
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:53,482
I really don't know.

66
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:55,752
I don't remember, I swear.

I...

68
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,822
I told you, I don't remember!

69
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,892
This isn't fair.

70
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:04,732
This isn't fair to me, either. For something I don't even remember,

71
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:07,532
I was locked away for 15 years.

72

No, wait. You two wait here.

- You, with me. - Yes, sir.

00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:41,932
Anyone home?

77
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,252
Sir.

78
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:00,882
You have to see this.

79
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,142
You don't remember?

80
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,372
How could you not remember?

81
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,382
I remember it every single day.

82
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:27,582
Remember it, you son of a witch.

83
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,582
Remember every last detail.

is going to bring your darn kid back?

If this is how it's going to be,

89
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:00,642
then just kill me, you punk.

90
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:02,382
Just kill me.

91
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:41,782
Sir.

Don't touch my phone, sir.

00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:00,842
Sir...

101
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,212
Let me make one call.

102
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:05,542
Sir, don't do it!

103
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:07,542
Stop it!

104
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:13,522
- Did you take care of it? - Just let me see it for a second.

105
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,122
What did it say?

106
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:22,332
What exactly did the message say? Please?

107
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:24,992
Don't you touch my phone!

108
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:38,542
(It's all taken care of.)

109
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:47,622
Good work.

110
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:50,922
Good...

111
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:53,962
bye.

112
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,232
(Good work. Goodbye.)

113
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:00,732
What are you doing with my phone! Darn it!

114
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,702
Is it Lee Heo Jun? Is he your "teacher?"

115
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,342
I'm sorry. I'll apologize, okay?

116
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,742
For what happened to your son, I'll...

117
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:14,212
I'll give you a formal apology. I'm so sorry!

118
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:18,982
I admit I was wrong. But what did that message say?

119
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,922
- Please, just tell me that. - Is it Lee Heo Jun?

120
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:25,992
Was Lee Heo Jun behind all of this?

121
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:34,502
What happened between you and Lee Heo Jun that day?

122
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:02,062
I...

123
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:07,632
I really don't remember. I had lunch and some water.

124
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:09,232
I really don't remember.

125
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:13,842
I didn't even know who your son was.

126
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,612
Did Lee Heo Jun tell you to "handle" it?

127
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:24,482
Darn you.

128
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,522
I really don't remember.

129
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:05,992
I had lunch and some water.

130
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:25,742
I need you to run a location check. Name's Shin Jay, plate 26-Jo 7068.

131
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:26,812
I'll check it myself.

132
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:29,382
Hey, you can't. It's a crime scene. You're not allowed in.

133
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:31,912
You called forensics, right? What did you find at the scene?

134
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,382
I said we need to assess this first.

135
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:37,552
(Mr. Shin)

136
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,292
Mr. Shin, are you all right? Where are you right now?

137
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:44,332
I'm fine. I'm sending the location. Come here.

138
00:11:46,362 --> 00:11:48,402
- Mr. Shin. - Detective Choi.

139
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:49,572
Are you alone right now?

140
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:02,112
So according to you, Yun Dong Hee's killed five people, including Jun.

141
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:06,152
Yes. But that psycho went after Mr. Shin.

142
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:10,852
- We have to catch him. - I will catch him my way.

143
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,022
If you ask me,

144
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:16,432
I think Mr. Shin already knew.

145
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,562
- Knew what? - That Yun Dong Hee was coming.

146
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:37,982
You should've called me, or at least reported it to the police!

147
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:41,022
What were you thinking, bringing that punk here?

148
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:46,522
Anyway, I'll take over the investigation from here.

149
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,522
So you're done here, Mr. Shin.

150
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,662
You've committed kidnapping, confinement, and more.

151
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:54,262
Detective! How can you say that when you know?

152
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,102
The situation is what it is!

153
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:59,272
I mean, why are you taking it this far?

154
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:02,072
Why my son died...

155
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,812
I still haven't gotten any answers.

156
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:08,382
This is driving me crazy. Seriously.

157
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:11,452
What happened that day...

158
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:13,352
I have to find out, no matter what.

159
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:15,822
Mr. Shin.

160
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:18,692
You have to stop, or this will become a very serious crime.

161
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:19,762
Detective Choi.

162
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:21,962
The day Jun died,

163
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:25,292
Lee Heo Jun met with Yun Dong Hee.

164
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:37,272
I'll stay here too.

165
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:40,842
You can't do this alone.

166
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:44,552
Don't. Just stay out of this.

167
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:46,952
I don't care if you're Jun's father.

168
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,692
As a detective, I'm going to do my job.

169
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:52,762
Go ahead.

170
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,432
You do things your way, Detective Choi.

171
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:01,362
Wait. Detective Choi!

172
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:05,802
Darn it!

173
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:18,852
What are you planning?

174
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:21,852
Lee Heo Jun.

175
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:25,292
I'm bringing him here.

176
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,592
Why do you bring him?

177
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:33,402
Detective Choi.

178
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:36,772
When I bring Lee Heo Jun here...

179
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:56,322
Cho Pillip.

180
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:59,322
From now on, you're a negotiator for me.

181
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:04,692
You can either save me or be the death of me.

182
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:17,742
But I have one condition.

183
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:21,412
I'm calling the shots this time.

184
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:25,552
To do that, I can't be in the dark about anything.

185
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:30,192
Detective Choi.

186
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:33,022
Please help me.

187
00:15:37,362 --> 00:15:38,892
I have a condition of my own.

188
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:45,972
Never, ever try to take matters into your own hands.

189
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:47,372
Got it?

190
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,142
Because one way or another,

191
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:54,482
I'll make sure him rots in prison.

192
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:07,222
A kidnapping?

193
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:13,802
- Where are they? - Let's go. I'll explain on the way.

194
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:15,562
- Let's go! - Right!

195
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:37,522
Are you sure? Yes, got it.

196
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:40,022
I'm on my way now. Yes, text me the location.

197
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,492
Kim Yong Woo left behind evidence before he died.

198
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:46,832
Where did you hide the original USB?

199
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:49,432
Somewhere only Joo Yeong Mi would know.

200
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:53,572
We have to find that USB.

201
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,612
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

202
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:59,272
Okay. Be careful.

203
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,652
Officer Kim? Check for any deposits to Yun Dong Hee's account today.

204
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,922
Okay. Got it.

205
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,022
And Si On is going to bring you a USB.

206
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:15,392
Crack the password as fast as you can.

207
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:19,192
Hey, just tell her to get it here as fast as she can.

208
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:28,872
- Ma'am! - Come on in.

209
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:30,372
Mr. Shin sent me.

210
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:37,682
Madam Joo. These were Kim Yong Woo's last words.

211
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,682
He said it's in a place only Joo Yeong Mi would know.

212
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:44,452
I see you've been going to the temple.

213
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,462
It can't be for Ji Woo, so who are you praying for?

214
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,532
Are you spying on me now?

215
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:08,512
(Parents: Shin Jay, Son: Shin Jun)

216
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,002
I hope this helps.

217
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:31,332
Thank you.

218
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:32,602
Thank you!

219
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:52,692
- What are the demands? - Nothing specific yet, sir.

220
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,722
- The hostage's condition? - We're checking on that now.

221
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,762
Commissioner, what measures are you taking?

222
00:18:56,832 --> 00:18:58,662
- Please give us a statement. - What does the hostage-taker want?

223
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:01,902
Commissioner.

224
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:03,272
What is it?

225
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,972
I'm Cho Pillip, the negotiator for the hostage-taker.

226
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:28,592
Yes. Change the name on Yun's account.

227
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:31,162
And block all the connected lines, too.

228
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:33,532
Right. Thanks.

229
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:44,272
Why isn't this working?

230
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:47,982
Come on.

231
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:49,782
What's wrong with it?

232
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,782
This is weird.

233
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:01,822
Mr. Shin, Yun's account is blocked. Access has been revoked.

234
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:07,432
- What about the USB? - Si On has it.

235
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,132
What's the status on Lee Heo Jun?

236
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:11,702
No progress yet, but Detective Choi went to see him personally.

237
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,342
All right.

238
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:29,952
(Access Denied)

239
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:31,622
My money...

240
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,062
It's my money.

241
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:36,632
Have you ever even touched this money?

242
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,502
From the very beginning, Lee Heo Jun...

243
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:43,472
never intended to give you the money.

244
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,702
The day you stabbed that cop.

245
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:53,142
Have you ever stopped to think about why you were even there that day?

246
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,612
How can I stab you, Teacher?

247
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:02,252
No, Dong Hee. You have to do this.

248
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:07,222
You just need to make it a shallow cut,

249
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:09,732
so don't overthink it.

250
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,002
Okay.

251
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:18,232
I'll try.

252
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:23,872
You see Lee Heo Jun was on the phone with the police that day?

253
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:27,582
The cops showing up wasn't a coincidence.

254
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:28,642
(Detailed Call Log: June 2025)

255
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:29,712
(Called: Lee Heo Jun)

256
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,452
To Lee Heo Jun, you were...

257
00:21:32,812 --> 00:21:36,892
nothing more than trash to be used and thrown away.

258
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,022
Cut the crap, you punk.

259
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:52,702
We have breaking news. An escaped inmate identified as Yun,

260
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:55,702
is reportedly holding a civilian hostage.

261
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:58,342
Details are still emerging. A SWAT team has been deployed...

262
00:21:58,412 --> 00:21:59,412
So much for "handling it."

263
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:02,012
where a tense standoff is currently underway.

264
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:07,452
The news surprised me, too. What brings you to the hospital?

265
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:10,892
Yes, just like on the news, Yun Dong Hee has a hostage.

266
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:16,962
I need to ask a favor. We need a psychiatrist who knows him.

267
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:21,262
Is anyone at your hospital who could join us at the scene?

268
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:33,442
I'll go.

269
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:38,112
- You'll come yourself? - I'm the expert in this field,

270
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:41,382
and I know Yun Dong Hee better than anyone.

271
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:45,552
I'll meet you outside with my stuff.

272
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:46,892
Yes, of course.

273
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:52,162
Thank you.

274
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:21,722
How much longer?

275
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:27,032
I can't concentrate with you standing over my shoulder like that.

276
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:35,842
Don't just sit there and watch. Don't you have something else to do?

277
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:37,272
Nothing.

278
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:43,382
(USB Device Password Decrypted)

279
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:46,052
- I got it! It's done! - You cracked it?

280
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:47,122
Hold on, just a second.

281
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:50,152
It's done. Here you go.

282
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,822
- Thank you. - Be careful with that!

283
00:23:52,992 --> 00:23:54,222
- Who's that? - It's Lee Heo Jun.

284
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:55,562
- It's Lee Heo Jun! - That's Lee Heo Jun!

285
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:56,632
It's Lee Heo Jun.

286
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,442
I appreciate you all being here.

287
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,112
Although I have resigned from my public position,

288
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:13,812
he was a patient under my care.

289
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:15,582
I'll do everything I can to help.

290
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:19,652
- In that case... - What will you say to Yun Dong Hee?

291
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:25,452
Look at that. Your dear teacher is on his way.

292
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:30,762
I appreciate you all being here.

293
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,762
Although I have resigned from my public position,

294
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:36,332
he was a patient under my care.

295
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:41,042
- I'll do everything I can to help. - 15 years ago, Lee Heo Jun...

296
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:43,512
had you locked up in the Federal Medical Center,

297
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:47,082
I wonder what he'll do to you this time.

298
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,482
(Hostage-taker: Yun Dong Hee, Hostage: Shin Jay)

299
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:56,752
The hostage is the father of the kid Yun Dong Hee killed 15 years ago.

300
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:59,222
- What are his demands? - Money for a clear escape.

301
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,862
Is this guy insane? As if killing the kid wasn't enough,

302
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:04,092
now he's taking the kid's father hostage?

303
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:08,002
He's pressured by the investigation. We need to put the hostage at ease.

304
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:10,472
Darn it!

305
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:24,282
Open it up, open it.

306
00:25:29,352 --> 00:25:32,092
They've cracked the USB password. I got word she's on their way.

307
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:34,892
What about Lee Heo Jun?

308
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:39,662
Get me some water over here.

309
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:51,312
(Hostage-taker: Yun Dong Hee)

310
00:25:51,672 --> 00:25:55,812
What good is stalling for time? Shouldn't we try to talk to him?

311
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,612
He's right. I checked his medical records,

312
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:02,952
and he's been on strong medication for a long time,

313
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:04,752
so if his symptoms flare up while he's off his meds,

314
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,262
he could become significantly more violent.

315
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:11,992
As someone who knows Yun Dong Hee well,

316
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:13,932
I should be the one to go in.

317
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:17,102
Are you sure about that?

318
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:19,172
The longer we wait, the greater the risk for the hostage.

319
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:22,672
After I go in and assess his condition,

320
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:26,112
may I administer his medication if needed?

321
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:31,352
You would know the patient's condition best.

322
00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:32,982
Yes, go ahead.

323
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:35,682
All right, shall we head in?

324
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:37,292
Yes.

325
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:39,192
Si On, how close are you?

326
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:42,092
I'm almost there.

327
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:55,272
Hey, Si On! Over here!

328
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,412
Detective Kang! Just a second, hold on!

329
00:26:57,472 --> 00:26:59,272
- Excuse us. - Please let us through.

330
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:02,082
- You made it. - You have to hurry!

331
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:09,282
Detective Kang is on her way. Just stall them a little longer.

332
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,402
Phone, watch, and all electronic devices.

333
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:22,602
You'll have to leave them here.

334
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:25,072
It's one of the hostage-taker's demands.

335
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:37,652
What's in that bag?

336
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:40,552
It's Yun Dong Hee's prescription medication.

337
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:54,462
- It's nothing strange, is it? - I've had about enough of you.

338
00:27:55,302 --> 00:27:56,802
What do you think you're doing?

339
00:27:57,272 --> 00:28:01,302
To a doctor, of all people. You think you know this just on sight?

340
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,702
Would you even know?

341
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:06,642
- Let's not get carried away. - It's all right.

342
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:09,212
Hey, Detective Choi. You need to calm down and come here.

343
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:12,812
Please, this way.

344
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:15,782
Just a moment.

345
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:21,322
What now?

346
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:22,922
Hey, hold on. Isn't this going a bit too far?

347
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:24,992
This is also part of his demands.

348
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:29,432
For crying out loud. You're really trying my patience.

349
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:31,202
Let's just humor them, all right?

350
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:41,212
Let's go.

351
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:55,992
We're heading up!

352
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:47,143
You're not the hostage.

353
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:50,243
You're the real hostage-taker, aren't you, Shin Jay?

354
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:55,053
To fool everyone outside and orchestrate all of this...

355
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,823
That's not something a sane man could pull off.

356
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,293
Listening to him talk,

357
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:08,533
- you're the crazy one. - Yun Dong Hee is mentally ill.

358
00:31:09,663 --> 00:31:10,663
And you believe what he says?

359
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:14,873
Yun Dong Hee needs treatment right now.

360
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,503
Let's calm the patient down first.

361
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:29,753
Are you okay?

362
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:37,423
He's not in good shape.

363
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:38,923
I'm going to have to intervene.

364
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:02,553
This is what you want as well,

365
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:05,353
isn't it?

366
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:07,793
Revenge.

367
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:32,613
What are you doing?

368
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,783
You're trying to kill me?

369
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,593
I did everything you told me to.

370
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:44,193
I did everything you told me to do!

371
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:46,023
I killed them all.

372
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:47,663
I even killed Cha So Yeon,

373
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:49,593
and Kim Yong Woo.

374
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:52,603
I did everything you told me to do,

375
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:55,633
So why are you trying to kill me?

376
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,273
- I killed them all, didn't I? - I'm heading to HQ.

377
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:00,443
I killed them all! But then,

378
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:04,083
- you said you'd give me the drugs! - Yun Dong Hee!

379
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,583
Quiet down.

380
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:10,883
- Wait until I'm finished speaking. - But you're the one who said it!

381
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:14,423
For killing Han Ji Young and Lee Han Jun,

382
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:16,253
when I got caught by the cops,

383
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:20,133
you said you'd get me off! You promised diminished capacity!

384
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:21,833
That's what you promised!

385
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,533
For murdering Han Ji Young...

386
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:25,203
and Lee Han Jun,

387
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,573
you said you drugged me to plead diminished capacity!

388
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,703
That's right, you punk.

389
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:33,913
So they wouldn't call you a murderer.

390
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:35,143
So you wouldn't get punished.

391
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,113
Because your mother wanted it. I told you why, you punk!

392
00:33:42,113 --> 00:33:43,113
Then what about Cha So Yeon?

393
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:44,753
And Kim Yong Woo?

394
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:47,523
You ordered me to kill all of them.

395
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:50,923
I killed them all on your orders! My money!

396
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,163
Give me my money.

397
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:56,193
- Give me my money! - Stop interrupting and shut up!

398
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:04,243
That's enough out of you!

399
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:06,813
What's your problem?

400
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,243
- Isn't this what you wanted? - Get up, you punk.

401
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:11,513
Get up!

402
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:14,053
All right, so...

403
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:15,813
what is it that you want?

404
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,423
The truth.

405
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:19,983
The truth about that day.

406
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,493
If you give me a straight answer to my questions,

407
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:27,593
and if that punk Yun Dong Hee lives or die,

408
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,233
I don't give a darn.

409
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,533
Why...

410
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,733
Why did you kill my Jun?

411
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:43,313
I did no such thing.

412
00:34:44,513 --> 00:34:47,113
Look, I didn't even know who you were.

413
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,653
How could I have known your son, let alone kill him?

414
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:53,493
I mean, seriously. Just to find out that one thing,

415
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:56,253
you're going to cause this much of a scene?

416
00:34:58,423 --> 00:34:59,823
Since things have come to this,

417
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,233
I'll tell you everything.

418
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,373
I wasn't thinking straight that day...

419
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:16,013
because I had to go take care of Kim Yong Woo,

420
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,713
after dealing with Yun Dong Hee without any complications.

421
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:24,553
You see, Kim Yong Woo...

422
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,053
had taken something very important from me.

423
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:30,823
Bring me what Kim Yong Woo stole. Or I'll shoot him.

424
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:33,993
You were there too, weren't you?

(Caller ID Restricted)

426
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,903
That was the day.

427
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:47,543
Come to think of it,

428
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:50,613
we're bound by a cruel fate.

429
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,183
It might be a coincidence,

430
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,153
but it's a cruel fate.

431
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,133
Get away from me!

432
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,893
I'm not crazy!

433

(Caller ID Restricted)

434
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:24,613
That day, I prescribed a drug to Yun Dong Hee.

435
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,283
But look.

436
00:36:27,713 --> 00:36:29,683
I administered the drugs correctly,

437
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,723
but he still went wild like this.

438
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:35,053
He went completely berserk!

439
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,463
This isn't anyone's fault.

440
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:41,093
It was purely...

441
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,233
an accident.

442
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:45,563
Just an accident.

443
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:47,673
In this world,

444
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,243
countless tragic things like this happen all the time.

445
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:54,343
Buildings collapse, sinkholes open up,

446
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,873
car accidents happen.

447
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:02,783

448
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:05,623
Right.

449
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,193
Shin Jun.

450
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:09,953
He just...

451
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:13,963
met with one of those accidents, that's all.

452
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:17,203
It wasn't a problem with Dong Hee's prescription.

453
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:20,303
It was just an accident. An accident, I tell you.

454
00:37:20,403 --> 00:37:21,403
Just...

455
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:23,973

"Just"?

458
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,473
A "tragic thing"?

459
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:32,043
My entire world came crashing down.

460
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:33,853

00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,653
"Just"?

462
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:41,293
Answer me, you punk!

463
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:48,663
Move in.

464
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,323
Yes, we're securing him now.

465
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,353
- Yes, right now. - Commissioner, we're all set.

466
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:14,393
Yes.

467
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:34,613
Si On.

468
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:39,143

472
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,753
Yes, we got a fingerprint from the second one.

- Process this first, and hurry. - Yes, sir. Right away.

Sir.

480
00:41:32,553 --> 00:41:34,453
We will now begin the press briefing...

481
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:38,063
on yesterday's hostage situation involving Yun Dong Hee.

482
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:42,033
Since Yun Dong Hee's escape from the medical center a month ago,

483
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,063
Gyeonggi Bukbu Detective Task Force...

484
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:49,903
launched a special investigation to apprehend him.

485
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,543
During our investigation, we found evidence that Yun Dong Hee...

486
00:41:52,673 --> 00:41:57,613
was part of a murder-for-hire plot. In order to identify the mastermind,

487
00:41:57,713 --> 00:41:59,943
we expanded the scope of our investigation,

488
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:03,013
concurrently, we began tracking Yun Dong Hee's movements...

489
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:06,323
and his potential hideouts.

490
00:42:06,453 --> 00:42:10,663
Furthermore, we have arrested the man who tried to kill Yun.

491
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:13,863
It's Lee Heo Jun, the director of the Federal Medical Center.

492
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:16,893
He's charged with four more counts of soliciting murder...

493
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:19,663
and taken into emergency custody at the scene.

494

(Chicken Center)

495
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,143
I was a nervous wreck during that whole briefing.

496
00:42:24,473 --> 00:42:26,473
You were good. You didn't even blink.

497
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:27,773
What was that?

498
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:30,013
Nothing. Just that the camera loves you.

499
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:31,483
It always has.

500
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,953
Entrapment? How rediculous!

501
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:38,783
You pulled a fast one on the nation, and you call it "entrapment"?

502
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:42,993
But we caught the bad guy. How else could we catch the punk?

503
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:46,193
- Please, just stop. - Listen to him brag. Unbelievable.

504
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,033
But catching the bad guy is a good thing, right?

505
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:51,463
He runs the Federal Medical Center.

If you fail to get a conviction, be prepared to turn in your badges!

507
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,103
And if we do?

508
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:58,103
You'll drop charges on Mr. Shin, won't you?

509
00:42:58,173 --> 00:42:59,243
I don't know.

510
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:00,843
Get out!

511
00:43:01,273 --> 00:43:02,273
Yes, sir.

512
00:43:02,743 --> 00:43:04,483
- Let's go. Let's get out of here. - Okay.

513
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:07,813

Just go, man.

- Yes. - Hey, Jung Hwan.

517

We have to get the charges against Mr. Shin dropped.

518
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:22,193
We wouldn't have caught Lee Heo Jun without him.

519
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:25,833
I'll do whatever it takes. I'll prove Lee Heo Jun's guilt.

520
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,573
- About that... - I know.

521
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:29,503

Sir. The injection results are in.

The cap on the vial says "Vanoxin," but...

527
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,623
the contents are KCL.

528
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:50,193
Potassium chloride.

529
00:43:50,823 --> 00:43:53,993

00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,083
I'll have one, too.

537
00:45:52,813 --> 00:45:54,283
- Hello. - Hello.

538
00:45:55,513 --> 00:45:57,683
- Here it is. - I'll pour you the drink.

539
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:01,253
Hey, everyone.

540
00:46:01,823 --> 00:46:03,793
What is this? A funeral?

541
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:06,923
Come on, let's make a toast. Hey, Pillip, pour me one, too.

542
00:46:09,793 --> 00:46:11,103
Here, drink up.

543
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,873
- Thank you. - You too, Pillip.

544
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,373
Here you go.

545
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:19,373
Who... Who are you?

546
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,173
He's the one who cracked the USB.

547
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,743
Right. Hello, I'm Choi Cheol.

548
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:27,453
Detective! A pleasure. I'm Kim Su Dong.

549
00:46:27,513 --> 00:46:30,083
It's a pleasure to meet you. Let me pour you a drink.

550
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:31,923
Your name doesn't really suit you.

551
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:36,623
Hey! Live up to your name. I used to be a very passive guy,

552
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:40,093
But Mr. Shin got me involved in everything.

553
00:46:40,093 --> 00:46:41,133
Here, drink up.

554
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,833
All right. Let's make a toast.

555
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,133
We didn't say no!

556
00:46:48,303 --> 00:46:50,603
We went with the flow!

557
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:54,843
And we got the culprit! To you-know-what!

558
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:56,443
Yes, to you-know-what...

559
00:46:57,343 --> 00:46:58,343
You-know-what, you-know-what...

560
00:46:58,413 --> 00:47:00,613
It sounds little strange. To you-know-what!

561
00:47:00,683 --> 00:47:02,013
To you-know-what!

562
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:10,553
- Hey, don't we have any snacks? - Should I fry up some chicken?

563
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:12,593
No, don't bother.

564
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:17,293
Only Mr. Shin makes good chicken.

565
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,803
- I miss him. - That's a shame.

566
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,303
I've never had his chicken before.

567
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:25,973
It's seriously the best.

568
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:28,743
Still, we should have something to munch on.

569
00:47:30,043 --> 00:47:32,113
- Should I grab some chips? - Yes, we need something.

570
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:36,813
May I ask what year you were born?

571
00:47:36,913 --> 00:47:39,053
Yes. I was born in 1966.

572
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:40,953
- How old are you? - So you're my senior.

573
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:42,023
Stop it.

574
00:47:42,223 --> 00:47:43,523
You're a handsome guy.

575
00:47:58,773 --> 00:47:59,773
This is heavy.

576
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:03,113
Goodness.

577
00:48:05,043 --> 00:48:09,883
It's a lot. There's chocolate milk, pig's feet, and porridge.

00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:22,063

If you're just going to complain, then don't eat any of it.

591

You need to live a long life.

592
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,683
Your father paid for my school fees. I've never forgotten that.

593

That's why I'm still helping you all these years later.

594
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,653
This is all a debt. You must repay it with your life.

595
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:24,793
I know.

596
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:27,893
That I'm still alive because of you.

601
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:03,893
Have some porridge, too.

602
00:50:04,903 --> 00:50:06,463

Even though he was told to be quiet,

607
00:50:29,223 --> 00:50:31,693
he made that noise and just dropped dead.

Mommy wants to sleep, too.

611
00:50:42,003 --> 00:50:43,973
I guess Daddy's story is boring.

612
00:50:44,303 --> 00:50:46,573
All right. You go ahead and sleep.

613
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:52,683
Good night, Jun.

Thank you.

- All right, please enjoy. - Yes, thank you for the meal.

625

- Thank you for the food. - Go on, start eating.

626

635
00:52:26,903 --> 00:52:28,173

636

I feel so terrible about it.

You hear me? Especially in a crisis negotiation,

657
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:22,685
you must never threaten or provoke the hostage-taker.

658
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:26,855
When did I provoke them?

Yes. I'll be sure to remember that.

665
00:54:52,385 --> 00:54:54,415
Your technical skills were garbage,

666
00:54:55,185 --> 00:54:56,655
your sincerity got through.

667
00:54:59,355 --> 00:55:03,255
Your determination to save me at all costs.

668

00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:08,525
Here you go. Your coffee.

685
00:56:08,925 --> 00:56:10,925
Time to get back to your real job, right?

686
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:14,665
Real job, my foot. This chicken joint is my real job.

687
00:56:14,735 --> 00:56:17,395
It's a silly suit against a small business.

688
00:56:17,395 --> 00:56:19,635
It's simple, so let's end this fast.

689
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,035
No way.

690
00:56:21,305 --> 00:56:25,845
Our task force is up for review, and we're a little short on cases.

691
00:56:25,905 --> 00:56:28,175
- It's urgent. - What task force?

692
00:56:28,215 --> 00:56:29,775
The Conflict Resolution Task Force.

693
00:56:30,915 --> 00:56:33,645
A department the Court should've had ages ago.

694
00:56:33,785 --> 00:56:36,655
Wait, if that department should belong to the Court,

695
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:39,625
why being set up in a chicken joint of all places?

696
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:42,595
What is this?

697
00:56:44,325 --> 00:56:48,165
It said it'd refresh your very soul, so I drank it.

698
00:56:48,265 --> 00:56:51,705
"My soul doesn't feel refreshed?" This is insane.

699
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:55,105
Right? Even you think it's crazy, Mr. Shin?

700
00:56:55,505 --> 00:56:59,205
Can we let this drag on for a year? Settle it by the end of the week.

701
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:02,575
- It's urgent. I'm leaving. - Hey, who said I'd do it?

702
00:57:03,675 --> 00:57:05,485
Call me when you're done. It's urgent.

703
00:57:05,485 --> 00:57:09,285
Hey, you can't just leave. To move forward, I need some cash...

704
00:57:09,285 --> 00:57:11,255
- Go on inside. - Yes.

705
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:12,455
Darn it.

706
00:57:13,025 --> 00:57:15,955
Just my luck. Always ending up like this.

707
00:57:16,495 --> 00:57:19,565
I swear, this job is going to be the death of me.

708
00:57:20,095 --> 00:57:22,795
So what does "refreshing down to your soul" even mean?

709
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:25,905
How should I know? It's just one thing after another.

710
00:57:25,965 --> 00:57:27,765
Even buying and selling souls.

711
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:30,035
It's just chaos these days, total chaos.

712
00:57:31,575 --> 00:57:32,875
Hold on a second.

713
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:35,915
I was dying for some action anyway.

714
00:57:36,045 --> 00:57:39,115
I'll strip this punk down to their soul...

715
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:41,585
and give them a refreshing send-off.

716
00:57:41,715 --> 00:57:43,355
- Mr. Shin. - What?

717
00:57:44,285 --> 00:57:45,455
This time,

718
00:57:45,955 --> 00:57:47,325
let me handle it.

719
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:52,665
What are the four taboos again?

720
00:57:54,995 --> 00:57:57,735
Commands, conditions, judgments...

721
00:57:59,065 --> 00:58:00,365
And insults!

722
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:08,875
Show them what you've got!

723
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,085
(The epilogue will begin shortly)

724
00:58:16,515 --> 00:58:19,985
(Shin's Project)

725
00:58:20,785 --> 00:58:24,495
(Epilogue)

726
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:38,975
I felt like...

727
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,545
I should at least pray from afar,

728
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:44,275
so I'd come by sometimes,

729
00:58:44,575 --> 00:58:46,985
and I'd pay my respects on the anniversary of his death.

730
01:00:08,465 --> 01:00:09,765
Go on, go to bed.

731
01:00:10,095 --> 01:00:11,435
All right, all right.

732
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:17,505
Okay.

733
01:00:26,645 --> 01:00:28,815
Say Dada. Come on, Dada.

734
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:31,315
That's it. Yes, that's my boy.

735
01:00:31,385 --> 01:00:32,625
Dada.

736
01:00:33,355 --> 01:00:34,355
There we go.

737
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:36,025
(Our Beloved Jun's First Birthday)

738
01:00:36,095 --> 01:00:38,265
All right, Jun.

739
01:00:38,595 --> 01:00:41,295
Pick your favorite one from here.

740
01:00:41,735 --> 01:00:42,935
That's it!

741
01:00:43,165 --> 01:00:47,035
We'll play catch together. Just you wait a little.

742
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:48,775
Your daddy's always working, and can't even play catch with you.

743
01:00:48,835 --> 01:00:49,835
Hey, honey.

744
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:51,235
Jun.

745
01:00:52,175 --> 01:00:54,005
Tell your dad to finish up and come play.

746
01:00:54,075 --> 01:00:57,575
- Daddy, hurry up and come play. - Okay, okay, I'm coming, Jun.

747
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:00,115
- What's this? - Mommy's amazing, right?

748
01:01:00,185 --> 01:01:01,185
How'd you do that?

749
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:03,285
Ready!

750
01:01:03,715 --> 01:01:05,725
Go!

751
01:01:06,855 --> 01:01:08,095
One,

752
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:09,795
two,

753
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:11,625
three,

754
01:01:12,165 --> 01:01:13,295
four.

755
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:14,965
Four seconds.

756
01:01:15,435 --> 01:01:17,395
Wow, Jun, you're The Boss!

757
01:01:17,395 --> 01:01:18,605
Hey, Jun.

758
01:01:18,765 --> 01:01:21,605
- Bye. Have a good day. - You're coming to get me, right?

759
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:25,205
Of course. I promise I'll come get you later.

760
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:28,145
Be safe. Bye-bye.

761
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:29,615
- Bye-bye! - Bye.

762
01:01:29,675 --> 01:01:30,675
Let's go.

763
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:33,445
Say bye-bye to Daddy one more time.

764
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:35,955
Bye, Jun! Have a great time!

765
01:02:08,215 --> 01:02:11,215
(Shin's Project)

766
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:13,985
Hey, everyone. I'm getting married!

767
01:02:15,595 --> 01:02:17,655
You never know till you say 'I do.'

768
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:19,125
Come on, knock it off.

769
01:02:19,195 --> 01:02:22,265
- Looks like you have to step in. - All right. I'll give it to them.

770
01:02:22,395 --> 01:02:26,505
- Pretty cool, right? - And just like that, you passed.

771
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:31,105
Believing only a severely ill person and framing me as a criminal...

772
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,605
is a criminal act itself.

773
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:35,915
The Shin's Project. You do what you do best,

774
01:02:35,975 --> 01:02:38,075
and Judge Cho does what he does best.

775
01:02:38,585 --> 01:02:40,215
Get ready!
