It's okay. Really. I'm not some kind of creep.

You're Yun Dong Hee's doctor, right?

5
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,000
I've called you dozens of times, and I've come looking for you.

In that case, let me just ask you one thing.

The medication Yun Dong Hee was on,

10
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,110
did you prescribe it?

11
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,680
It's all right. Please, just tell me the truth.

12
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,550
Because of Yun Dong Hee,

13
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,190
- someone could be in danger. - I have nothing to say.

14
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,930
You didn't do this alone, did you? Someone put you up to this, right?

15
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,230
Detective or not, you can't be here. This is completely out of line.

16
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,770
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm not trying to make this difficult for you.

23

a doctor in her 40s fell to her death.

24
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,189
The woman, a psychiatrist at the National Forensic Hospital,

25
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,690
was recently suffering...

26
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,589
- Where did he go? - from extreme work-related stress.

27
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,289
Based on the apartment's CCTV footage,

28
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,560
police believe she jumped to her death.

29
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,499
Meanwhile, police plan to investigate...

Are you sure Dr. Cha So Yeon jumped?

37
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,109
There are no signs of foul play.

38
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,250
She must've been under great pressure.

39

Hey, you said she was on duty the day Yun Dong Hee escaped, right?

40
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,820
Yes. She was sleeping in the on-call room,

41
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,830
and it was all caught on CCTV.

42
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,259
No, let go of me! Let me see his personal physician!

44

I told you, she's not here right now.

Darn it. So she was at the hospital after all.

Let me know as soon as Cha So Yeon's autopsy results are in.

47

Her family is refusing an autopsy.

What? Why would they refuse?

49
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,049
There were no signs of foul play.

50
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,620
Besides, she apparently wasn't eating,

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,990
and she wasn't sleeping well either. They're closing the case soon.

We didn't even get paid. We just got on the manager's bad side!

177
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,460
- I'm sorry. - Please, don't drag us into this.

178
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,640
- The CEO is away on business. - When is he expected back?

179
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,740
Next week.

180
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,750
What's this?

181
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,350
Is this better than padding? This...

182
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,059
Seriously? What the heck?

183
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,160
Shoulders, upper chest, arms.

184
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,930
Perfect. I'll buy this for now.

185
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,870
If this works... Man.

186
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,640
Won't I look way too jacked?

187
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,980
If you want to leave your info, I can pass it along to him.

188
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,380
That's all right. I'll just come back next week.

189
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,950
- Okay. - It's all ready for CEO Hong.

190
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,250
Cho Pillip?

191
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,190
Wait, Dong Seok? What are you doing here?

192
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,920
What do you think?

193
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm the legal counsel for PHG.

194
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,530
I see.

195
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,260
Is that right?

196
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,100
You must be hot. Here, drink up. There you go.

197
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,110
It seems PHG has its employees sign independent contractor agreements.

198
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,210
And it's designed to make it hard to prove their employment.

199
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,950
That's pretty much a standard contract in this industry.

200
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,650
It says it all right there.

201
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,349
Despite being fully informed about...

202
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,350
the option of an employment contract,

203
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,119
the party agreed to sign this agreement.

204
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,790
They knew exactly what they signed.

205
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,590
You must have drafted it yourself.

206
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,330
That's why it's legally airtight.

207
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,459
Airtight for the employer, maybe.

208
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,130
But unfair to the helpless employees.

209
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,870
That's the mark of a good lawyer. You must give your client an edge.

210
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,740
And are you aware your client hasn't paid employees in six months?

211
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,880
Such minor details don't concern me. Why?

212
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,010
Is someone suing?

213
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
Which branch?

214
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,180
Hey, leaving already?

215
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,890
I should get going. The contract you drew up,

216
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,890
isn't a display of a lawyer's skill. It's just legal maneuvering.

217
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,489
And it doesn't just favor your client.

218
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,230
It encourages illegal activity.

219
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,630
It looks like there's a lot to review, legally speaking.

220
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,300
See yourself out.

221
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,340
That disrespectful little punk. Darn it.

222
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,910
He gets appointed as a judge and suddenly has no respect...

223
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,050
Gosh, that son of a...

224
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,860
That punk shows up out of nowhere and starts making trouble. Bastard.

225
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,830
Did you get ahold of CEO Hong?

226
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,000
He said he's surfing all day and asked not to be contacted.

227
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,740
Gosh, that guy's head is always in the clouds.

228
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,640
He doesn't realize how critical this is.

229
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,780
Which branches had the unpaid wages again?

230
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,250
The Maheon 1 and 2 branches, and the Chungsan 1 branch...

231
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,580
Alright, I get it.

232
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,180
Get me all of the employee contracts from those locations.

233
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,160
The conditions are different from the contract. Take a look.

234
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,560
It's a bit of a gray area to report as a labor law violation,

235
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,560
and I'm not sure we'd be able to win in court.

236
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,200
This is technically airtight, so maybe we need to find a new angle.

237
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,510
Have you ever handled a similar case?

238
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,470
Hold on a second.

239
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
Look at this.

- They just keep coming. - I packed the drinks and radish.

246
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,719
Okay.

247
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,290
Seriously, that Pillip kid.

248
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,650
Taking a day off at a time like this?

249
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,460
He's absolutely useless.

250
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,460
- I saw him walk by earlier today. - You're kidding. Where?

251
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,890
He was with some woman.

252
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,460
What woman?

253
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,670
The pretty woman from last night. I'll be back.

254
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,570
Okay, be careful.

255
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,810
It's funny how she can tell that other people are pretty,

256
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,380
but she's clueless about how pretty she is.

258
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,650
Help yourselves, everyone. Eat up.

259
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,280
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you!

260
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,350
Sure.

261
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,850
Let's eat. Come on, dig in.

262
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,690
You could've just come by yourself. You brought your whole crew.

263
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,719
They had to come pay their respects.

264
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,660
And my guys here, they just, you know,

265
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,760
love this chicken.

266
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,100
Hey, no need to worry about me. My restaurant is doing just fine.

267
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,400
It's a nice, cozy little place.

268
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,340
For some reason, it feels especially cozy today.

269
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,710
How have you been? Things slow?

270
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,080
Gosh, business is very slow right now, so no, not busy at all.

271
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,649
But even if I was swamped, Mr. Shin,

272
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,680
I'd drop everything and come running.

273
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,820
After all, you're the reason I'm able to make an honest living.

274
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,160
- Hey, Kim. - Yes, sir.

275
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,360
- I need to ask you for a favor. - Of course. Name it, sir.

(Chicken Center)

277
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,780
- That was incredibly delicious! - That was incredibly delicious!

278
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,619
All right, guys, get in the cars.

279
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,689
We're drawing too much attention,

280
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,420
and a big group makes us look more suspicious.

281
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,390
- Let's go! - Right away, sir!

282
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,430
- Sir. - Yes?

283
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,840
I have a few "tools" lying around. You should come for an "inspection."

284
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,070
A chainsaw, a pickaxe, and a crowbar.

285
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,070
Let me know if you need any equipment.

286
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,880
No. That's far enough, Kim.

287
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,380
I'll handle the rest from here.

288
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,480
- Understood, sir. - Thanks.

289
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,679
- Thanks for the food, sir! - Anytime.

290
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,920
- Right. - Get home safe.

291
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,050
Thank you, sir.

292
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,890
What? A chainsaw, a pickaxe, and a crowbar?

293
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,700
Yes. You told me to report strange things.

294
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,370
This qualifies as strange, right?

295
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,769
Huge guys were bowing deeply to him,

296
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,240
and this was long after closing time.

297
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,810
What did his accent sound like?

298
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,440
He had a strong regional accent.

299
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,250
Do you know him, Judge Kim?

300
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,350
- He's in construction. Ex-gangster. - A gangster?

301
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,190
And he said Mr. Shin would "handle the rest."

302
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,020
What do you suppose he meant by "handle it?"

303
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,760
That's what you have to find out.

304
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,800
Find out what dangerous business Mr. Shin is getting into.

305
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,730
Could it be related to Jun...

306
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,630
this time, too?

307
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,610
Hey, it's been a while. I was hoping you could do me a favor.

308
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,750
It's just a really old case, so there aren't any records.

309
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,850
Thanks.

310
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Si On!

311
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
Si...

312
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,810
- You're here early. - How was your date yesterday?

313
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
What date?

314
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,780
I heard you were with that woman who came by the other day.

315
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,790
- You mean Sun Mi? It wasn't a date. - So her name's Sun Mi?

316
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Yes.

317
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,429
A few years ago, the franchise owners of a macaron shop...

318
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,329
called Daldalbongju filed a class-action lawsuit...

319
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,730
against the head office.

320
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,340
There were persistent problems with inflated supply costs.

321
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,740
(Daldalbongju Margin Fee Class-Action Lawsuit)

322
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,350
Back then, Mo Sun Mi was a young startup franchisee.

323
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,880
Punish the Daldalbongju head office for taking unfair profits!

324
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,579
- Punish them! Punish them! - After a year and a half,

325
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,920
the head office won the first trial.

326
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,090
And I was the lawyer for the head office.

327
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,189
We'll take care of it all.

328
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,760
Right. Let's go.

329
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,290
Yes, let's get going.

330
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,970
- Punish them! Punish them! - Punish them! Punish them!

331
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,370
Then I guess that makes you her worst enemy.

332
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,170
Not her enemy, exactly.

333
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,539
I even told her about a precedent...

334
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,510
where franchisees won a similar case.

335
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,750
Wait, why? Feeling guilty?

336
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,680
That's an ethics violation for a lawyer, you know.

337
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,320
It's not a violation. Besides, legal precedents are public.

338
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,690
After I quit the firm, I took on a few cases pro bono,

339
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,190
but I couldn't help Sun Mi with her appeal.

340
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,559
The head office delayed the deadlines and postponed the trial,

341
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,660
so it's still not moving forward.

342
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,770
So?

343
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,400
Sun Mi's in a really tough spot.

344
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,110
She has to pay back her startup loan,

345
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,810
and prepare for the appeal,

346
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,309
but she hasn't been paid in six months,

347
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,880
so she's homeless and lives at a gym.

348
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,650
So, this time...

349
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,820
I really want to help Sun Mi.

350
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,590
The law shouldn't be a hindrance for young people trying to make it.

351
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,530
So is this what you came up with?

352
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,290
You think you can win with this?

353
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Yes.

354
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,299
So they can't pull this stunt again,

355
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,830
I want to pull them out by the roots.

356
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,570
Right, but how does this let you pull them out by the roots?

357
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,040
With another "Article-something, Clause-something" argument?

358
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,710
There's none of that in here.

359
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,180
So I'm going to create it myself.

360
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,350
You confident?

361
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,720
Yes.

362
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,350
I'm confident.

363
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,560
Go ahead. I'll help you. On one condition.

364
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,730
Give and take.

365
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,790
I'll be sure to repay the favor.

366
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,600
Getting hit with this? Yes, that would hurt.

367
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,669
A chainsaw, a pickaxe, and a crowbar.

368
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,500
I'll handle the rest from here.

369
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
What is it?

370
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,610
No. It's nothing.

371
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,620
Gosh, who works out this early in the morning?

372
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,860
That's why they call it a morning workout.

373
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,160
Exercise is great! A marathon? Or a run in the park?

374
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,260
This all used to be muscle.

375
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:16,000

What? Pillip?

377
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,600
I'm going to this place. First session is free. Don't miss it.

Hey, isn't this that place? Where the woman with Pillip works.

380
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,510
What?

381
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,410
- I'm not going. - Playing the supportive boyfriend?

382
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Come on, what are you talking about?

383
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:36,280
There's nothing between Sun Mi and me.

384
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,420
That's what all the cheaters say.

385
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,390
There was another woman? You had another one?

386
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,390
Hey, will you just stop with the nonsense?

387
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,260
This guy's a breeding ground for fake news.

388
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,930
You keep that up and you'll all end up in cuffs.

389
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,870
- Another one? Really? - No, I'm serious.

390
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,030
- Just for today. - There was another one?

391
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,540
Extend your arms more. All the way out.

392
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,240
Don't lean forward. You need to lean back, back.

393
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,710
I can do this.

394
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,540
You're leaning forward again. Open up your chest.

395
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,920
All the way.

396
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,150
Don't pull with your arms. Use your back. Pull with your back.

397

Don't make your strides too long. And remember to breathe. Okay.

407

Sir, how much did you walk yesterday?

408
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,290
About 20,000 steps.

409
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,060
You really shouldn't be walking that much.

410
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,730
Why does he keep showing up? It's not like he's going to help out.

411
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,830
I know, right? What if the store manager sees him?

412
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,330
What can we do about it? We'll be the ones to clean up his mess.

413

Yes, I understand.

414
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,410

What are you talking about?

421
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,970
I should help Sun Mi the way she needs, not just the way I want to,

422
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,339
but I was so eager to help...

423
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,010
I'm worried I made her uncomfortable.

Look.

425
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,980
The trainers commit card fraud to meet their quotas,

426

plus they have unpaid wages and are behind on the electric bill.

Right. We need better soundproofing. Hold on.

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,750
Yes, we've got a few spare ones at the company.

486
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,650

Good work, Boss.

489
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,130
- Thanks. - I'll be in touch.

Yes. I'm taking a break from night deliveries until my exam.

But why is Han here?

497
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,928
We were playing at Han's house,

498
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:40,438
and he came to walk me home.

499
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,168
It's not safe for Ye On to go home by herself.

500
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:47,078
- And how are you getting home, Han? - Come on, I'm a guy.

501
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,978
You two are something else. I thought you fought and were done.

502
00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:56,948
And now look at you, holding hands.

503
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:00,058
That was yesterday. On our way to the field trip,

504
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:04,788
I was just mad because Han sat next to Seo Ah.

505
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:06,628
Why would that make you mad?

506
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:08,997
Because I like Han.

507
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:12,498
And besides, Seo Ah has long hair and she's so pretty.

508
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:17,308
No way. You're way cuter and prettier.

509
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:21,938
- You mean it? - Yes. You're infinitely prettier.

510
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,178
I can't watch this.

511
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:27,248
She's just jealous.

512
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,748
Why? Doesn't she have a boyfriend?

513
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,548
We're here. Go on in, Han.

514
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:33,218

Bye.

517
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,798
- Shall we go home? - Okay.

518
00:32:49,238 --> 00:32:50,707
She took one look at me and said,

519
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,338
"If I can't stand the sight of you, what other reason do I need?"

520
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:53,708
Just like that.

521
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:57,008
So you just left?

522
00:32:58,048 --> 00:32:59,748
What was I supposed to do? She couldn't stand the sight of me.

523
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:03,818

524
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:06,358
Do you hate the sight of Si On?

525
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:09,188
- No. - Then go see her.

526
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,488
What?

527
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,128
Who needs a reason to see someone they like?

528
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:19,598
Ye On.

529
00:33:20,368 --> 00:33:22,698
Aren't you at Han's place too often these days?

530
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,908
His mom always invites me over.

531
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,908
By the way, why doesn't Pillip come over anymore?

532
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,248
Why would he come over?

533
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:33,048
He visited us morning and night the other day.

534
00:33:33,118 --> 00:33:34,978
No, that's...

535
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:39,758
- He only came because of Yong Pal. - So Pillip isn't your boyfriend?

536
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:43,088
- Of course not! - Why not?

537
00:33:44,028 --> 00:33:45,028
Because he's not.

538
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,928
- There's Pillip. - Stop messing with me.

539
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:51,698
He's right over there.

540
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:54,998
Pillip! Hey, Pillip!

541
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:56,368
Hey, Ye On.

542
00:33:58,268 --> 00:33:59,938
- How've you been? - Good.

543
00:33:59,978 --> 00:34:01,078
Hey, Ye On, is your sister mad at me?

544
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:04,708
Kind of. I'm not sure.

545
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:20,628
What do you want?

546
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,498
I heard you're not doing deliveries until after your exams.

547
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:27,268
So I thought we could study together until then.

548
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:29,668
I can do it myself.

549
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,168
You said I'd pass just by studying the old tests.

550
00:34:32,468 --> 00:34:35,808
But tricky problems are easier if someone explains them.

551
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:37,248
We could go to a study cafe together...

552
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,448
Forget it. I'll just study at home.

553
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:42,578
All right, then.

554
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:44,418
Do whatever you're comfortable with.

555
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:49,358

556
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:56,058

- Of course not! - Why not?

558
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:02,938
Never mind.

559
00:35:03,608 --> 00:35:05,638
- Go on inside. - What did you want to say?

560
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:06,808
Nothing.

561
00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:09,478
I'm just glad I got to see you.

562
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,147

564
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:15,948
Go on in.

565
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,648

So, who told them to just blindly sign the contract?

572
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:07,667
They should stop just working on their body...

596

00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:45,888
So it is.

702
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,158
- It is red. - Seriously...

703
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,028
So why did you fry chicken all of a sudden?

704
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,608
Well...

705
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,038
Pillip, you want Si On on your side, don't you?

706
00:45:09,308 --> 00:45:10,308
Yes.

707
00:45:10,378 --> 00:45:13,708
Then who does she care about most in the world?

708
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:15,648
Her grandma and Ye On.

709
00:45:15,718 --> 00:45:18,418
- And what's their favorite food? - Chicken?

710
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:19,718
Our chicken, to be exact.

711
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:23,958
Here.

712
00:45:24,528 --> 00:45:26,528
Practice this recipe until you've perfected it,

713
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:28,798
and then make it for them.

714
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:33,798
I'm entrusting you with my special, secret recipe.

715
00:45:34,738 --> 00:45:38,308
Pillip, no woman can resist a man who can cook.

716
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:42,008
Besides, someone must run the kitchen when I'm not around.

717
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:48,578
So either way, I have to learn this, don't I?

718
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,858
This is the art of negotiation, manipulating the choices.

719
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:57,528
You don't force the other person,

720
00:45:57,928 --> 00:46:01,028
but you make them choose the path you've already laid out.

721
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,898
So you're using that tactic on me right now?

722
00:46:02,998 --> 00:46:04,528
Not just any tactic.

723
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:06,968
An advanced one.

724
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,298
Well, it just happened.

725
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,768
Do you want to help me out?

726
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:14,408
What?

727
00:46:16,078 --> 00:46:17,807
This special powder stops the grease...

728
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,278
and makes it crispy to the last bite.

729
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:22,678
There you go again, showing off. Even my grandma and Ye On know that.

730
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:25,588
Besides, I've been working here way longer than you.

731
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:27,088
But in the kitchen, I'm your senior.

732
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:29,158
You're so annoying.

733
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:33,028
Really? Seeing you always makes my day.

734
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,128
And I like the sight of you.

735
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:38,398
If I can't stand the sight of you, what other reason do I need?

736
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:51,878
Here, have a taste.

737
00:46:53,448 --> 00:46:54,448
Here we go.

738
00:46:58,688 --> 00:47:00,788
It's delicious! You try it!

739
00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:06,158
See?

740
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:08,128
That's just the kind of guy I am. I even make a mean fried chicken.

741
00:47:13,868 --> 00:47:15,198
So what's the deal with that woman?

742
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:21,608
I met her during my last case at the law firm.

743
00:47:23,438 --> 00:47:25,148
- A client? - No.

744
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:27,218
The opposing party.

745
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,348
She was in a tough spot, but she lost the case.

746
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:34,658
So why did she come here?

747
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:37,118
Apparently, the gym hasn't paid her in six months.

748
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:40,058
What? But why does she still work there?

749
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:42,158
Because she has no choice but to stick it out.

750
00:47:43,258 --> 00:47:45,328
They keep promising to pay her but push it back,

751
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:48,268
and stringing her along by promising a manager job at a branch abroad.

752
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:50,868
She seemed like she had it all together.

753
00:47:51,108 --> 00:47:53,308
- Are you that dense? - What?

754
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:55,578
You have no idea how amazing you are.

755
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,478
Whatever...

756
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:13,128
So that's how you're going to be?

757
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:16,028
Hey, stop!

758
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,278
(Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency)

759
00:48:43,818 --> 00:48:46,428
Why have you been watching the same footage since yesterday?

760
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:47,898
Yesterday was Building 103.

761
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:49,598
Today is Building 102.

762
00:48:57,908 --> 00:48:58,908
Yes.

763
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:02,478
What?

764
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:05,208
Okay. I'm on my way.

765
00:49:06,078 --> 00:49:07,618
Hey, what did you say you found?

766
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,318
Why was your business card in Cha So Yeon's pocket?

767
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:14,358
I'm not trying to make this difficult for you.

768
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:15,758
Ma'am.

769
00:49:16,258 --> 00:49:18,228
I'll wait. So please, call me.

770
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:21,198
What about her bag? Wasn't her bag at the scene?

771
00:49:21,298 --> 00:49:24,668
I clearly saw her put my card in her bag when I gave it to her.

772
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:25,798
Detective Choi.

773
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:27,868
That's not what's important right now.

774
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:32,438
It is important. Did she try to call before she died?

775
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:36,178
Hey, think about it. If she had, wouldn't that be strange?

776
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,978
Hey, this might not be a suicide.

777
00:49:39,548 --> 00:49:41,078
My business card could be the evidence.

778
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:44,288
What if they say she jumped because you kept harassing her?

779
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:47,618
That card could make you the number one suspect.

780
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:50,157
I already told everyone on our team to keep their mouths shut.

781
00:49:50,158 --> 00:49:54,028
What are you talking about? Darn it. I wasn't harassing anyone.

782
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:57,327
I just wanted to talk for a bit, but she took a call and left.

783
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,268
Check the CCTVs or any dashcams.

784
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:01,198
I don't know. Just stay out of it. Please.

785
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:02,898
Hey.

786
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:05,808
Who was the last person Cha So Yeon spoke with?

787
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:07,378
Detective Choi.

788
00:50:07,878 --> 00:50:10,578
This didn't happen at some small-time psychiatric hospital.

789
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:13,308
This was at the Federal Medical Center.

790
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,548
How much bigger does this need to be?

791
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:17,848
Just drop it.

792
00:50:19,118 --> 00:50:22,118
Hey, Detective Kwak!

793
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:23,358
Sir.

794
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:28,758
I'm thinking the same thing with you.

795
00:50:28,828 --> 00:50:32,928
But you were transferred because of Yun Dong Hee, right?

796
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:33,998
So what if I did?

797
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,198
Never mind.

798
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:38,568
Look. That punk is a wanted man,

799
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:39,868
but he's not in the news at all.

800
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:41,808
He was in the news 15 years ago,

801
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:43,137
but now no one even knows his name.

802
00:50:43,138 --> 00:50:45,108
This whole thing is driving me crazy.

803
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:46,578
Hey, just go on inside.

804
00:50:47,918 --> 00:50:51,848
Stop saying, "go inside." I'm your partner.

805
00:51:06,098 --> 00:51:09,798
When was the first deposit made into Yun Dong Hee's account?

806
00:51:09,868 --> 00:51:13,308
Twice in 2009, one month apart,

807
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:14,478
and then this most recent one.

808
00:51:16,308 --> 00:51:17,808
So, three times in total.

809
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,408
Is that it?

810
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:26,648
There was no deposit on the day of Jun's incident.

811
00:51:29,888 --> 00:51:30,888
Mr. Shin.

812
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,198
At the time, I was certain about my investigation.

813
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:37,568
There's no way Yun Dong Hee could've done this alone.

814
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,898
I've confirmed the million-dollar deposit.

815
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:43,198
Who on earth is paying him that much money?

816
00:51:43,698 --> 00:51:47,608
An inmate escaped from the hospital shortly before my wife died.

817
00:51:47,878 --> 00:51:49,438
She was really stressed out after that.

818
00:51:49,738 --> 00:51:54,478
My wife was so worried about the Director getting in trouble.

819
00:51:55,048 --> 00:51:56,648
And I never even realized it.

820
00:52:07,228 --> 00:52:08,758
You're Detective Choi Cheol, right?

821
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:11,228
You're the one who called me?

822
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:15,498
- Yes. I was told you could help. - I've been expecting you.

823
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,068
I gave Doctor Cha my business card that day.

824
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:23,938
I was wondering if she was trying to call me.

825
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:25,208
I was just curious.

826
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,778
I don't think that's it.

827
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,318
The last person my wife spoke with...

828
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:31,988
was the director of the hospital.

829
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:33,888
You mean Director Lee Heo Jun?

830
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,158
From the Federal Medical Center?

831
00:52:36,258 --> 00:52:38,788
Yes. After he spoke with my wife that day,

832
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:40,898
and then he called me right after.

833
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:41,998
Yes.

834
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:43,198
You need to go check on her now.

835
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,028
I'm getting worried. I keep calling, but she's not picking up.

836
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:46,228
I'll go up and check right now.

837
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:55,978
Yes, hello. This is Detective Choi Cheol...

838
00:52:56,038 --> 00:52:57,548
from the Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency.

839
00:52:57,678 --> 00:52:59,348
Is Director Lee Heo Jun available?

840
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:02,578
A meeting?

841
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:06,318
Then please leave him a message to call me back.

842
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:07,658
Okay.

843
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,288

Okay, thank you.

Detective Choi.

846
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,613
On the day Yun Dong Hee's psychiatrist fell off the roof,

847
00:53:45,983 --> 00:53:47,453
one million dollars was deposited...

848
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:49,353
into Yun Dong Hee's overseas account,

849
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,353
But how did you know that?

850
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:03,693
On October 11, 2009, and again on November 11,

851
00:54:04,163 --> 00:54:06,703
there are records of deposits made to the same account.

852
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:08,473
October 11th.

(Lee Han Jun Traffic Accident)

856
00:54:15,013 --> 00:54:16,013
Darn it.

857
00:54:17,243 --> 00:54:18,743
I knew it.

858
00:54:19,713 --> 00:54:21,413
Someone died in an accident that day.

859
00:54:22,283 --> 00:54:25,883
But it wasn't an accident. That case led me to Yun Dong Hee,

860
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:26,953
Yun Dong Hee was after...

861
00:54:29,093 --> 00:54:32,063
Every time money is wired to Yun Dong Hee's account,

862
00:54:32,863 --> 00:54:34,863
someone loses their life.

863
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:36,533
I suppose so.

864
00:54:37,703 --> 00:54:38,703
Mr. Shin.

865
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:41,733
I'm going to stop it.

866
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:43,633
I'll catch Yun Dong Hee,

867
00:54:44,003 --> 00:54:46,703
and I'll catch every single person behind him.

868
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:26,043
Yes, this is Choi Cheol.

869
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:27,813
I hear you called.

870
00:55:28,183 --> 00:55:30,353
This is Lee Heo Jun, Director of Federal Medical Center.

871
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:32,453
Hello, Director Lee.

872
00:55:32,923 --> 00:55:36,953
I have a few questions for you. May I come by the hospital now?

873
00:55:38,063 --> 00:55:39,893
I'm actually on my way home right now.

874
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:42,593
Then I'll just come to your home.

875
00:55:42,763 --> 00:55:45,003
- To my home? - It will only take a moment.

876
00:55:45,203 --> 00:55:46,233
All right, then.

877
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:48,403
Let's meet briefly in front of my house.

878
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:52,003
Got it. I'll head over right away. Could you text me the address?

879
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:54,213
- Okay. - All right, see you soon.

880
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:10,693
- Making a delivery? - No, this is for my parents.

881
00:56:10,863 --> 00:56:12,923
I'm taking this one to Ye On and my grandma.

882
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,593
- Then what about the last one? - It's for Sun Mi.

883
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:16,893
It was my idea to give it to her.

884
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:20,732
Hey, I'm the owner here, and I bought all the ingredients,

885
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:22,403
so why are you two taking all the credit?

886
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,403
- But we made it! - But we made it!

887
00:56:25,473 --> 00:56:26,503
Si On.

888
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:29,143
I expect it from him, but how could you...

889
00:56:30,013 --> 00:56:31,743
But you're the one who called me in.

890
00:56:33,113 --> 00:56:34,253
Unbelievable.

891
00:56:34,983 --> 00:56:37,683
I trusted you with my secret recipe so you could run the shop for me,

892
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:39,453
and you're running it straight into the ground.

893
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:41,023
We're going to fry it up and eat it.

894
00:56:41,453 --> 00:56:43,123
Make sure you clean the kitchen...

895
00:56:43,393 --> 00:56:44,893
and tidy this place up before you leave.

896
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:50,793
You're off for the night, right?

897
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:53,333
- Does it look like I'm coming in? - Have a good night.

898
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:57,473
Let's clean up quick and go before the fried chicken gets cold.

899
00:56:57,773 --> 00:56:58,873
I'll take care of the kitchen.

900
00:57:11,623 --> 00:57:12,983
What do I do?

901
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:15,293
What do I do?

902
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:22,163
What do I do?

903
00:57:52,323 --> 00:57:55,063
- I'll be there in five minutes. - Don't worry. Go home and rest.

904
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:59,233
Investigations are a two-person job. And I'm your partner,

905
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:01,473
so from now on, I'll be your backup, sir.

906
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:03,203
I'm telling you, you really don't have to come.

907
00:58:03,533 --> 00:58:05,573
So what are you planning to ask the hospital director?

908
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:08,572
He was the last person she spoke to.

909
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:10,243
I have to know what they talked about.

910
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:14,213
I just passed the intersection. I'll be there in under ten minutes.

911
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,913
Didn't you just say five minutes?

912
00:58:17,253 --> 00:58:18,823
Hey, I've got another call. I've got to go.

913
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:23,493
Yes, Director, I'm here.

914
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:27,363
Yes, I'll be by the streetlight.

915
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:16,343
So, let's say I were to get colon cancer...

916
00:59:16,973 --> 00:59:19,383
Yes, sorry. I'll have to call you back.

917
00:59:19,443 --> 00:59:20,583
I'm busy right now.

918
00:59:34,763 --> 00:59:35,763
Move!

919
00:59:52,813 --> 00:59:54,243
You son of a witch.

920
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:19,873
Hey, you! Call 911.

921
01:00:20,503 --> 01:00:22,613
Are you okay? No, don't try to move.

922
01:00:22,673 --> 01:00:23,673
Detective Choi.

923
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:28,983
Wait...

924
01:00:32,823 --> 01:00:34,323
Open the door, you son of a witch!

925
01:00:38,123 --> 01:00:39,563
Somebody, please help!

926
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:44,393
Open the darn door, you punk!

927
01:00:44,633 --> 01:00:45,833
Can you hear me?

928
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:01,283
Open up, you punk!

929
01:01:31,283 --> 01:01:34,143
(Shin's Project)

930
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:36,913
Why would Yun Dong Hee try to kill the director?

931
01:01:37,923 --> 01:01:40,583
I'm not going to sue him. What good would that even do?

932
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:42,653
I mean, how would you even do that?

933
01:01:43,323 --> 01:01:45,223
Then who took it?

934
01:01:45,293 --> 01:01:48,263
A boss who takes his workers' pay to go on overseas trips.

935
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:51,333
He must be incredibly shameless, right?

936
01:01:52,063 --> 01:01:53,732
Darn it. This is...

937
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:56,933
When Mr. Shin is in danger, you have to stick right by his side.

938
01:01:59,073 --> 01:02:01,873
Stay out of sight, and just lie low.
