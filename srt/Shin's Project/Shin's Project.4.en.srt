00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,110
Come on. Got it.

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,710
I almost had it.

10
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,760
All right, this is it.

11
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,990
Come on! Get in there, darn it!

12
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,930
This thing already ate ten bucks. Shouldn't I get at least one?

13
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,670
- How haven't I gotten a single one?
- I've won over ten of them.

14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,300
- How many?
- Ten.

15
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,270
- You did? How?
- Because I'm good at it.

16
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,380
No, I mean, how did you win so many? How did you get that many?

17
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,750
Want me to show you the trick?

18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,650
- Yes, show me.
- What's in it for me?

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,120
Win one first, then we'll talk. That's how you negotiate.

20
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,260
Negotiation?

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,790
- What's negotiation?
- Negotiation?

22
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,100
It's when you and I...

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,130
both give something to get something we want.

24
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,340

(Ttoli Super)

26
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,610
Hey, if you can't win one, I'm getting my money back.

27
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,910
- Okay.
- Good.

28
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,320
- Okay, try it.
- Watch.

29
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,190
- Okay.
- First, pick the prize you want.

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,450
That one! I want that yellow chick.

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,990
- Don't pick a toy that's too heavy.
- Why?

32
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,260
Because you're not good enough to win it yet.

33
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,460
- Fine, just do it.
- The claw has three prongs, right?

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,700
- Yes.
- Use two to grab the neck...

35
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,000
on each side.

36
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,700
And the last prong grabs the middle...

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,040
- of its head like this.
- Okay.

38
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,940
Grab the head on big-headed prizes.

39
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,940
I got it!

40
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,840
You're amazing! High-five!

41
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,750
Hey.

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,150
What's with you?

43
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,820
I'd like a slime, please. I held up my end of our deal,

44
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,590
- so now it's your turn, mister.
- Fine. Let's go to the store.

45
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,400
All right, kiddo. Here's your slime.

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
- Here you go.
- That's right.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,470
This is how you negotiate.

48
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,740
- Negotiation over!
- Okay.

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,840
Off you go.

50
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,940
- Mister.
- What?

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,480
Next time, If you can't win with five dollars, give up.

52
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,390
Spending ten bucks on a claw machine is a bit much.

53
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Hey, for that two-dollar slime,

54
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,660
you taught me your secret technique. I think I got the better deal.

55
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,360
You can find that on the internet, you know.

56
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,200
I told my dad how to do it, but he still hasn't won one.

57
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,640
He's just not a natural like me. See you.

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,910
Unbelievable.

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,640
You're the one who always said...

63
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,540
it's better to use an opponent than make them your enemy.

64
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,650
Is that what you did this time?

65
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,380
Lee Sang Hyun and his mother were caught...

66
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,450
on CCTV at the airport.

67
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,590
You used me to cut off cell service...

68
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,090
and secured their escape route, didn't you?

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,630
While smuggling Lee Sang Hyun out, you tricked all the authorities.

70
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,890
Harbouring a fugitive.

71
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,100
Aiding and abetting an escape.

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,070
Up to three years in prison or a five-thousand-dollar fine.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,780
And I thought we were on the same side.

74
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,290
Hurry up. We're almost out of time for a ride.

75
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,260
Hey!

76
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,270
I told you to just go for it! Treat corners like a straight line.

77
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,710
Relax your forearms.

78
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,510
Look. Your traps are way too tense.

79
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,450
Don't grip so tight. Easy does it.

80
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,480
Relax. Gently.

81
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,390
Even my grandma could ride better. How did you even get your license?

82
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,760
It's harder to focus when you keep nagging me.

83
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,830
Says you!

84
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,060
You were nagging me earlier when I was doing my workbook

85
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,230
- "Says you"? I'm your tutor.
- Well, right now, I'm your teacher.

86
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,070
I'll stop nagging. Just do one lap around the course by yourself.

87
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,070
- Mr. Shin!
- Hey, Ye On. Don't run.

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,470
Hey, Ye On. I won you a prize at the claw game.

89
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,480
- You really won this?
- Of course I did.

90
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,610
How many tries did it take? Once? Five times?

91
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,920
Ten?

92
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,490
What does it matter how many tries? The point is, I won it for you.

93
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,520
It's only a jackpot on the first go. Otherwise, it's a waste of money.

94
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Funny.

95
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,330
You sound just like your sister, Si On.

96
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,130
That's what my sister says. That's why she won't let me play.

97
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,670
Ye On.

98
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,370
This has to be our secret from Si On.

99
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,410
I totally wasted my money winning this.

100
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,810
So you have to keep what I said a secret from her too, okay?

101
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Sure.

102
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,620
- Good grief.
- So, what should we name it?

103
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,890
A name?

104
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,630
You were fine getting them put in. Why fuss now they're coming out?

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,600
- Not there, my foot!
- My bad.

106
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,200
You should've said so.

107
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,810
I heard you got hurt at your job. Isn't your boss covering the bills?

108
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,740
Forget it. It's too embarrassing.

109
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,210
(Hujin Arcade)

110
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,650
Lee Sang Hyun and his mother were caught...

111
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,020
on CCTV at the airport.

112
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,960
What did it do wrong?

113
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,700
What?

114
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,530
What did that table do to deserve being tortured with a rag like that?

115
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,540
That's not it, sir.

116
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,110
You've barely started working here and you're already slacking off?

117
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,380
It's not that, sir. It's just that you...

118
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,580
- kept things from me.
- What did I ever do to you?

119
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,480
- You're secretly breaking laws.
- I'm doing what?

120
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,690
Never mind.

121
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,020
Such a slacker.

122
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,800
Hello. I'm sorry, but we're not open yet.

123
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,030
Hey, he's not a customer.

124
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,230
He's not?

125
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,770
Business must be booming. You even hired help.

126
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,000
He's not my help. He was left here.

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Step outside for a bit.

128
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,610
- What?
- I said, get over here.

129
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,810
Why tell me to leave now? You don't give orders in my kitchen.

130
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,080
Technically, it's my kitchen. I didn't even charge you a deposit.

131
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,020
Well, if you're on a power trip, you might as well waive my rent too.

132
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,650
You change the oil every day, right?

133
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,250
- Can't you tell just by looking?
- Of course I can.

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
As if you know...

135
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,020
So, where's the sweet rice flour?

136
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,400
Why would you look for it there? It's right here.

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,740
Actually, I was about to buy some.

139

Hey, Pillip.

140
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,480
- You were about to get this, right?
- What?

141
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,610
The sweet rice flour.

142
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,950
Right.

143
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,550
You're not just phoning it in, are you?

144
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,820
Who, me?

145
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,830
I put my all into this business.

146
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,200
Hey, Pillip. Back me up here.

147
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,830
About what?

148
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,370
My dedication.

149
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,170
Right. Our chicken is really delicious.

150
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Hey.

151
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,050
Go buy the sweet rice flour.

152
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
I'll go get it.

153
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Hurry back.

154
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,330
Well, your apprentice is dense.

155
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,300
He's not my hire. I'm stuck with him. He'll quit soon enough.

156
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,200
You think I'd hire someone that dense?

157
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,640
But I mean I like him because he's a terrible liar.

158
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,800
Sounds like he's exactly the kind of person you need.

159
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,840
These old guys...

160
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,950
They're all the same, always barging into my shop unannounced.

161
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,520
Judge Kim was here too? Then who else put that kid here?

162
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,290
Darn, I'm a step too late. I should've put my own guy in here.

163
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,260
What am I, a dartboard? What's this "putting people in" talk?

164
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,960
This darn chicken shop...

165
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,730
(So glad you're here.)

166
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,100

That's him.

170
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,710
Let's see. Thousands, millions, billions...

171
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,380
Twenty-seven billion?

172
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,110
Wait, why would a corporate chairman be at our chicken place?

173
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,410
Who in the world is Mr. Shin?

174
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,650
Mr. Shin? He's the real deal.

175
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,220
The guy's connections are insane.

176
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,590
He's a negotiation expert who the government fought hard to get.

177
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,490
But if he's such a big shot, why is nothing about him online?

178
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,430
What's the deal with this chicken shop?

179
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,700
If you're so curious, find out for yourself.

180
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,910
(So glad you're here.)

181
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,140
Now what?

182
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,650
That guy's the landlord, right?

183
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,880
Is he here about the commercial redevelopment?

184
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,450
Yes, so he says.

185
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,320
Anyway, where are you off to, all dressed up?

186
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,920
I'm visiting my ancestors' grave.

187
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,660
So what did the landlord say?

188
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,630
Did he say you could keep the chicken shop running?

189
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,700
Who knows. What about you?

190
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,930
That's what's been keeping me up. I'm worried I'll be forced out.

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,040
Why? Are you planning to retire?

192
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,170
Retire? No, I'm perfectly able-bodied.

193
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,340
I can still thread a needle without glasses.

194
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,550
Well then, just keep at it. What's the problem?

195
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,380
That's the problem. My landlord, Mr. Kim,

196
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,090
- says there's no space for my shop.
- What?

197
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,090
Who gets to decide that?

198
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,660
Beats me.

199
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,960
I did all I could to please him. I ironed his shirts for free.

200
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,760
I even took care of his wife's mink coat.

201
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,630
And then he just stabbed me in the back.

202
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,400
So what, you're going to go ask your ancestors for help?

203
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
No.

204
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,810
I have something different to tell them today.

205
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,940
I'm just going to pay my respects and make a fresh start.

206
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,680
A fresh start? At your age?

207
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,950
Let's just say I have a plan.

208
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,620
Hey, no.

209
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,490
You can't open that yet. It's important.

210
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,730
I'm back.

211
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,260
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, there.

212
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,770
So what's the word from Pluto? Did he meet with the landlord?

213
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,470
As for Mr. Jang, the landlord...

214
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,780
Whatever, I don't even want to know. I'm off.

215
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,840
Hey, at least have a cup of coffee before you go.

216
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,950
He's dying to know, but he pretends not to.

217
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,160
Hey, Pillip.

218
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,260
Let's go grab some lunch.

219
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,730
But it's not even eleven yet.

220
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,570
Hey, just meet me at Pluto.

221
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,570
- Another order of meatballs!
- Got it.

222
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,370
- Hey, Si On. Have you had lunch?
- Meatballs, got it.

223
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,770
Not yet.

224
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,370
- Making a delivery?
- Yes.

225
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,980
Be safe.

226
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,850
- Enjoy your lunch.
- You too. Be careful out there.

227
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,820
My sister had to get stitches in her arm.

228
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,790
- And a big bruise on her stomach.
- So how did she get hurt?

229
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,730
She said she fell off her scooter.

230
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,760
- That's a lie.
- A lie?

231
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,560
There wasn't a scratch on her scooter.

232
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,630
Someone must have hurt her.

233
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,340
You have to find whoever did it and teach them a lesson.

234
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,010
I will.

235
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,480
I'll teach them a lesson. I promise.

236
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,720
Here, have this to start. It's on the house.

237
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,650
- Thank you.
- Hey, Mr. Jang.

238
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,820
Do you ever get nightmare customers?

239
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,320
We had this guy appear on a livestream, looking all smug,

240
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,330
Si On got chewed out on a delivery because of it. It was a mess.

241
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,130
What? I wasn't trying to show off.

242
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,730
You're the one who sent me there. I was just caught on camera.

243
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Hey.

244
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,800
I told you to make a delivery, not to star in a show.

245
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,010
You were flaunting your looks in that suit,

246
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,880
and Si On ended up taking the heat for it. That's a fact.

247
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,180
Don't even get me started.

248
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,610
Just the other day, some jerk called and said that the food was soggy,

249
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,920
so I checked his order and he'd gotten...

250
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,150
fried rice and sweet and sour pork.

251
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,760
I even packed his sauces separately,

252
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,420
so I asked him how anything could be soggy.

253
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,960
He said the driver was rude and that it ruined the taste of the food.

254
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,200
Does that even make any sense?

255
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,630
So what happened?

256
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,800
He threatened to file a complaint,

257
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,040
but then he ordered again today.

258
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,810
Wait, is that where she just went for a delivery?

259
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,110

260
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,210
Yong Pal, that son of a witch.

262
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,920
But I have to make the delivery.

263
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
You jerk.

264
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,550
You're late.

265
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,950
The elevator's out.

266
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,250
Did you have to take the stairs?

267
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,590
Apparently, he was a lawyer before he started working for me.

268
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,660
A real lawyer?

269
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,230
Yes.

270
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,660
Then why are you working at a chicken restaurant?

271
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
It's a long story.

272
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,570
Hey now, Mr. Jang. You have a funny way with words.

273
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,070
What's wrong with a chicken restaurant?

274
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,770
It's not about the chicken restaurant.

275
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,170
A lawyer in a place like this is odd.

276
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,110
Just a moment.

277
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,820
Hello, this is Pluto.

278
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,090
- Excuse me?
- I said the noodles are stuck.

279
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,190
The sweet and sour pork is also soggy. How can I eat this? Darn it.

280
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,530
I told her...

281
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,030
to bring me a new order, but she's refusing.

282
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,070
How do you train your employees? Darn it.

283
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
Hey.

284
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,910
Hey!

285
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,710
Take it.

286
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,220
Yes?

287
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,750
Just give him a refund, please.

288
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,990
Okay.

289
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,200
You've got to be kidding me. I'm starving, and you bring garbage,

290
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,270
and all I get is a refund?

291
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,540
Hey, you should be compensating me for damages!

292
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,780
You don't need a fancy degree to know that's just common sense.

293
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,950
Is this how you use your education?

294
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,850
You purposely made me take the stairs.

295
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,550
You're getting a refund, so just order from somewhere else.

296
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,490
I won't charge you for the broth. Go mix rice in it or whatever.

297
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,990
Where do you think you're going? Clean up this mess.

298

299
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,230
Still hurts?

300
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,670
Why did you run off and get hurt?

301
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,400
I wanted to meet up with a classmate.

302
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,040
You spilt it, you clean it up.

303
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
And make sure you sort your recycling properly.

304
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
What a creep.

305
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,450
Crazy witch. Hey, delivery girl! Lee Si On!

306
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,290
Darn it. You're dead meat.

307
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,860

If a customer uses insulting names like "jerk" or "son of a witch,"

309

310

312

or a fine of up to two thousand dollars.

313
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,970
Anyway, if that jerk of a customer gives Si On any trouble,

314
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,910
- Give me a call right away.
- Will do.

315
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,710
And not a word of this to Si On.

316
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,780
- Right.
- I'll do whatever I can to help.

317

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,290
Hey, Si On. Take him with you for a few days.

351
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,160
- What?
- Why?

352
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,200
So he can learn the routes and the tricks of the delivery.

353
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,230
No. I'm busy. He'll just slow me down.

354
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,100
I don't want to go either. What skills does delivery even need?

355
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,810
- You just drop it off.
- You're the worst.

356
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,440
Hey.

357
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,540
Have you ever played one of those claw machines?

358
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,580
You can't win every time just because you know how it works.

359
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,750
It might look easy, but there's a technique to it.

360
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,250
Deliveries are the same way, kid. It's a lot harder than it looks.

361
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,620
Right, Si On?

362
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,060
Just leave him be. Let him live and die a jerk.

363
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,330
- You said you could act.
- How was that?

364
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,660
Not even close.

365
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,330
Hurry up and follow her.

366
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,330
Honestly...

367
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,030
Get going!

368
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
Hurry.

369
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,210
- What now?
- We're on delivery.

370
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,580
Do you want me to drive?

371
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,450
Let's go.

372
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,260
- You are off the route.
- Where are you going?

373
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
This isn't the right way.

374
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
This isn't the GPS route.

375
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
We should've turned left back there.

376
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,410
You are off the route.

377
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,180
(Five minutes remaining)

378
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,580
You shaved off 5 minutes.

379
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
See that?

380
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,690
That's what you call skill.

381
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,490
Just go. You obviously don't need a GPS.

382
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,260
- Alright, we're heading out.
- Drive safe!

383
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,300
They're a weirdly good match.

384
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,040
Then again, I think she could do better.

385
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,990
- Mom.
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

386
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,060
Mom.

387
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,730
- Don't cry. Look at me, okay?
- Mommy...

388
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,430
- Mommy.
- I'm getting you out. It's okay.

389
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,530
What do you mean, 'it's okay'? What about me?

390
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,930
I'm not crazy!

391
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,240
It's also weird that the CCTV was off.

392
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,010
Han Ji Yeong and Lee Han Jun were murdered.

393
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,850
Yun Dong Hee is faking being on drugs. Can't you tell?

394
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,750
Gosh.

395
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,890
Seriously!

396
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,470
(Chicken Center)

397
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,070
Welcome.

398
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,610
Just one?

399
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,180
- Yes.
- Sit anywhere you like.

400
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,430
So, what can I get for you?

401
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,360
- Fried chicken and a Coke, please.
- You got it.

402
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
Nice.

403
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,140
I beat the GPS by seven minutes.

404
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Gosh.

405
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,580
It's pure skill.

406
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,420
That'll be 20 dollars.

407
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,590
I'll go get my wallet, so just wait by the door.

408
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,020
Oh, I'll just wait outside.

409
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,890
Okay, then.

410
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,900
- You again?
- What about you? Delivering again?

411
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,970
I see you running several deliveries from dawn till dusk.

412
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,640
You're nuts. Now pay me for the chicken.

413
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,510
Before I do...

414
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,950
That mess you made in the hallway of my officetel.

415
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
You need to pay for the clean up.

416
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,080
You're the one who made the mess. How dare you ask me to pay for it?

417
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,960
- Gosh!
- I've let it slide, witch! Darn it.

418
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,960
You haven't changed a bit since high school.

419
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,660
When are you going to grow up?

420
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,130
Hey! You're not getting away! Let go!

421
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,970
Hey, stop moving!

422
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Look at her!

423
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,510
You witch. You were too poor to even graduate.

424
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,350
I'm giving you business out of pity, and this is how you treat customers?

425
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,850
How about your damages cover the fee?

426
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,350
Oh, really?

427
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,790
What do you think you're doing?

428
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,600
Lee Si On.

429
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,330
Are you okay?

430
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,840
Who on earth are you, you jerk?

431
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,870
Gosh, you jerk!

432
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,780
Darn it! Seriously!

433
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,110
Let's go.

434
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,190
I told you, I'm fine.

435
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I mean,

436
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,930
can you even ride this thing? Want me to do it?

437
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm perfectly fine, I said.

438
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,870
You're usually so useless.

439
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,700
So, what was all that back there?

440
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,610
What are you talking about? When have I ever been useless?

441
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,010
I graduated from the Police University.

442
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,740
I'm a 3rd Dan in Taekwondo and a 2nd Dan in Geomdo.

443
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,810
There you go, bragging again.

444
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
Gosh.

445
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,010
Oh, right.

446
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,150
The money for the fried chicken.

447
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,520
That scumbag. Unbelievable.

448
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,020
Ever since high school,

449
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,790
has he been bullying you like that?

450
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,760
What are you looking at?

451
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,500
Hey. From now on, you're my cigarette runner.

452
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
I don't have any money.

453
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,070
You don't have what?

454
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,170
Hey. Is this the jerk?

455
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,340
Hey!

456
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,580
I said, stay still!

457
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,640
Hey! Get your head down.

458
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,450
Gosh, seriously.

459
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,750
Is that why...

460
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,190
I didn't drop out of school because of him.

461
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,090
You go on ahead. I'll grab a cab.

462
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,500
Wait, you're not going back there, are you?

463
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,170
Choi Yong Pal is a total thug and a complete psycho.

464
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,670
- He's trouble, so stay out of it.
- It's fine.

465
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,340
- He's got a bigger problem with me.
- But...

466
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,440
Don't worry.

467
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,140
I won't be reckless.

468
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,910
I'll just get the chicken money and be right back.

469
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
All right, I'm heading out.

470
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,450
- Don't take too long.
- Okay.

471
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Gosh.

472
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,430
Get home safe.

473
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Hurry back.

474
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,040
There we go.

475
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
Looks delicious, doesn't it?

476
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,520
- It does.
- So, do you live around here?

477
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,990
- No.
- First time here?

478
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,590
It is.

479
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,490
Oh, never mind.

480
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,930
Well, let me know if you need anything.

481
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,700
- Mr. Shin!
- What? Si On, you've no deliveries.

482
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,300
Hey, why are you here alone? Where's Pillip?

483
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,510
Choi Yong Pal is a total thug and a complete psycho.

484
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,950
He's trouble, so stay out of it.

485
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Forget it.

486
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:25,006
Come on, why isn't he answering his phone?

487
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,376
- Where are you going?
- I'll go check on him.

488
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:32,446
No, don't!

489
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:35,616
Hey, wait, Si On!

490
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:41,886
Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

491
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:43,956
Something urgent has just come up,

492
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:48,326
I'm afraid I have to close now. Can I pack this up for you?

493
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,696
- Please do.
- Oh, thank you so much.

494
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,776
(Mr. Shin)

495
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:08,086
- Yes, Mr. Shin.
- Si On, where are you right now?

496
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,386
I'm following a suspicious car.

497
00:32:09,446 --> 00:32:12,586
Don't do anything until I get there. Got it?

498
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:14,256
Just hurry up and get here.

499
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:28,636
(Si on)

500
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:15,446
Hey!

501
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:17,786
Someone's in here!

502
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:19,786
Hello?

503
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:22,356
Is anyone in there?

504
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,826
Someone's in here!

505
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:40,846
Si On!

506
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:43,446
What about the car? Where is it?

507
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:46,616
(Junkyard)

508
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:02,926
It's ringing, but he's not picking up.

509
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:05,536
- Right.
- Si On, go check over there.

510
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:06,596
Okay.

511
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,016
Someone's in here!

512
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:38,296
- Someone's in here!
- Hey, Cho Pillip!

513
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:41,006
- Pillip!
- Cho Pillip!

514
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:42,366
Pillip!

515
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:45,236
Pillip!

516
00:34:52,246 --> 00:34:53,276
(Lowering)

517
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,356
- Pillip!
- Answer us!

518
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:00,656
Cho Pillip!

519
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,286
Someone's in here!

520
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:33,886
I said, I'm in here!

521
00:35:34,526 --> 00:35:35,526
Pillip!

522
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:37,056
Cho Pillip!

523
00:35:39,726 --> 00:35:42,296
- Mr. Shin!
- Where are you?

524
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:44,566
- Mister, over there!
- Pillip! Where?

525
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,416
Stop!

526
00:35:59,316 --> 00:36:00,346
Pillip!

527
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:01,816
- Pillip!
- Raise it! Hurry!

528
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:04,916
- Raise it now! Lift it!
- Lift it! Hurry up!

529
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,786
- What are you doing? Lift it up!
- Raise it!

530
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:07,986
Please, lift it up!

531
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:11,796
Hey, Pillip! Get him out of there, quick!

532
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,256
Hey! Grab him!

533
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:15,426
Easy!

534
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:16,896
You got him? Two, three.

535
00:36:17,196 --> 00:36:18,196
Easy.

536
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:22,466
- Cut this for me.
- Okay.

537
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:24,976
Man, what on earth?

538
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,206
Hey, Pillip, you okay?

539
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:32,016
- Can you move at all?
- I think so...

540
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:36,146
- I'm okay. Just help me up.
- All right.

541
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:37,216
Let me.

542
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:42,556
Hey, Si On. Take him to the hospital. Go ahead.

543
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:45,396
- Okay.
- All right, you. Let's have a talk.

544
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,826
- Where's your office?
- Right this way.

545
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:49,126
Go on, hurry.

546
00:36:54,436 --> 00:36:56,636
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

547
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,336
I've got a bump on my head. I think they knocked me out.

548
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:02,876
Hold on.

549
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:21,396
I may be a bad driver,

550
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:23,296
but I know a thing or two about cars.

551
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:26,036
There's an emergency release inside the trunk.

552
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:27,066
You're annoying.

553
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:32,806
- Hey, I was just at death's door.
- You got a death wish?

554
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:36,576
I told you Yong Pal is a psycho. I said to stay away. Why did you go?

555
00:37:37,616 --> 00:37:39,346
You have no idea how ruthless that guy is.

556
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:41,846
Sorry for making you worry.

557
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:44,486
You should find another line of work.

558
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:46,886
You're not cut out for delivery work.

559
00:37:49,756 --> 00:37:52,026
Where are you going? Wait up.

560
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,356
Hey.

561
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:56,496
I mean...

562
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:00,136
I just thought you'd be worried, so...

563
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:03,006
I was just trying to lighten the mood.

564
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:20,386
Because of me...

565
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:25,896
You almost died because of me!

566
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:46,446
I'm sorry I joked about it.

567
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:50,746
And thanks for worrying about me.

568
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:30,456
(Under CCTV Surveillance)

569
00:39:30,526 --> 00:39:31,896
Why isn't this working?

570
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:36,066
What do you mean it isn't working? When you have this sign posted?

571
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:38,496
I just found out myself, but...

572
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:42,066
- Alab, did you turn off the CCTV?
- No, it wasn't me.

573
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:46,076
So it was working at some point. What about the other employees?

574
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,006
They all went home after the company dinner.

575
00:39:48,106 --> 00:39:49,876
Then why were you two still here?

576
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:54,646
Alab and I came back after dinner for a steel mill shipment tomorrow.

577
00:39:56,546 --> 00:39:57,586
Do you have team dinners often?

578
00:39:58,186 --> 00:39:59,356
Just every now and then.

579
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:03,326
Today, our boss booked a BBQ place, so it was just the employees.

580
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:05,956
Just the employees?

581
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:07,556
Yes.

582
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,996
Sounds like a good boss.

583
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:13,696
This is nice.

584
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:15,606
What?

585
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:18,676
Gosh.

586
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:22,376
Hey, what's up? For the record, you called me.

587
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:25,916
- Kim pro, dig dirt on someone.
- On who?

588
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,986
As much as you can, as fast as you can.

589
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:29,546
Yes.

590
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,186
So, what'd they say?

591
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:32,786
They said he's fine.

592
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:35,756
No concussion, and the bump will go down soon.

593
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:38,456
I told them I was fine, but they insisted on a CT scan.

594
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:40,596
Right. You get hit on the back of the head and knocked out,

595
00:40:40,656 --> 00:40:44,066
and almost crushed in a compactor, but I'm glad to hear you're "fine."

596
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:50,306
Gosh. No evidence, no doctor's report...

597
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:53,776
- How am I supposed to fight this?
- This is all my fault.

598
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:58,976
How is this your fault? Yong Pal is the one to blame.

599
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:00,746
Should we file a police report?

600
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:03,146
I just told you. We have no evidence!

601
00:41:04,146 --> 00:41:06,416
I'm going to handle this myself. I will take care of it.

602
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:10,256
As your boss, there's no way I can let this slide.

603
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:13,626
The nerve of those punks. How dare they mess with my staff?

604
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:15,596
My way.

605
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:17,196
I'll deal with this personally.

606
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:19,266
Then what about me?

607
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:21,266
You just rest up.

608
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:25,176
Then I'll look for evidence my own way.

609
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:35,886
My apartment building doesn't have any CCTV.

610
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,516
But there's a camera right here.

611
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:39,356
That one's a fake. It's a dummy.

612
00:41:39,656 --> 00:41:40,656
A fake.

613
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:48,996
(Multi-purpose CCTV in operation)

614
00:42:03,506 --> 00:42:05,916
Excuse me, could I please check this security camera?

615
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:09,116
I was assaulted near here, but I don't have any evidence.

616
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:12,356
I'll check the camera with this number.

617
00:42:12,786 --> 00:42:14,556
Officer Lee, can I get the request form, please?

618
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:24,096
Hey, digging into that family is actually pretty interesting.

619
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:27,736
- I got everything but a few things.
- What? Why'd you leave those out?

620
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:32,676
It's my lunch break. We public servants must eat on time.

621
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:35,046
Oh, I know. Even when I was at death's door,

622
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:37,406
you were having your meal all by yourself, right on time.

623
00:42:37,476 --> 00:42:39,546
Stop messing around. I'm hanging up.

624
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:40,616
Just send it already.

625
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:45,516
(Chicken Center)

626
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:56,896
(Closed today)

627
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:04,266
So, Mr. Shin, is "your way" working out for you?

628
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:05,536
How about you?

629
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:09,646
I'm working hard too. Even at the law firm, meeting people...

630
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:10,876
was pretty much all on me.

631
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:12,246
Is that right?

632
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,276
By the way, Mr. Shin, how did you know?

633
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:18,586
- Know what?
- That Choi Yong Min was after her.

634
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:22,456
How would I have known that? I had no idea who Choi Yong Min was.

635
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:27,296
That can't be right. You said to be her secret bodyguard.

636
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:30,596
That's why I followed her deliveries and put a tracker on your phone.

637
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,266
That was just because Mr. Jang from Pluto...

638
00:43:33,336 --> 00:43:36,106
mentioned a problem customer, so I was just being cautious.

639
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:39,276
Thanks to that, we protected Si On and I saved you too.

640
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:41,946
A little "better safe than sorry" killed two birds with one stone.

641
00:43:42,376 --> 00:43:43,446
Jackpot, in one word.

642
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:44,976
Just rest up.

643
00:43:45,616 --> 00:43:46,846
Where are you going? Want me to come?

644
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:50,186
No, it's our official day off. You should just rest.

645
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:51,716
I'll be back.

646
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,396
(Chicken Center)

647
00:44:20,716 --> 00:44:22,916
- Who is it?
- Delivery.

648
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:24,486
I didn't order anything.

649
00:44:30,386 --> 00:44:32,126
- It's a delivery.
- Darn it.

650
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:35,096
Darn it, I said I didn't order anything.

651
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:36,666
Isn't this unit 1208?

652
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:38,966
That jerk. Did he really order it to the wrong address?

653
00:44:39,036 --> 00:44:41,466
With an attitude like that, you must be Yong Pal.

654
00:44:43,406 --> 00:44:44,436
Who are you?

655
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:45,806
You a cop?

656
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:51,076
Hey. Scum like you ruin our scrap,

657
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:53,376
and our country's steel industry pays the price.

658
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:57,486
You jerk. Did you try crushing my guy in a car?

659
00:44:57,546 --> 00:45:00,316
- Did you order the car crushed?
- What? I did nothing.

660
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:02,756
- You got proof?
- Proof?

661
00:45:03,386 --> 00:45:04,386
Proof?

662
00:45:05,656 --> 00:45:06,796
Proof...

663
00:45:07,396 --> 00:45:09,066
Right here, you jerk.

664
00:45:10,966 --> 00:45:13,266
Hey!

665
00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:20,436
Yes, I recorded his voice. Sending it now.

666
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:23,676

(Voice Generation Complete)

669
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:48,997
It's been a while.

670
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:50,597
Mr. Shin.

671
00:45:51,157 --> 00:45:54,097
I wanted to thank you for your help the other day.

672
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:57,467
I was in a real jam,

673
00:45:58,907 --> 00:46:00,407
and you were the only one who came to mind.

674
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:02,207
I'm glad you called.

675
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:06,677
I was just happy I could help.

676
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:10,747
I bet Ji Woo's all grown up.

677
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:12,787
Is she doing well?

678
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:16,257
She's in college already.

679
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:18,427
I just saw her last month.

680
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:21,857
- She's doing great.
- Good.

681
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:24,357
By the way, Madam Joo.

682
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:26,927
Do you have any old photos of Ji Woo,

683
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:31,867
like one of her in a white dress holding a doll?

684
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:41,847
You mean this one?

685
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:48,687
I'm sorry, sir. Something urgent has come up.

686
00:46:51,557 --> 00:46:53,787
I saw a man with this photo yesterday.

687
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,797
Where? What did he look like?

688
00:46:59,397 --> 00:47:02,637
He came by my restaurant.

689
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:12,647
Kim Yong Woo.

690
00:47:15,577 --> 00:47:18,887
- The Kim Yong Woo from back then?
- Yes.

691
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,557
That's him. That scum.

692
00:47:22,087 --> 00:47:23,117
Ji Woo's father.

693
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:55,217
Having a hard time focusing today?

694
00:47:58,757 --> 00:47:59,957
It's just...

695
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:04,227
I'm just wondering what the point of all this is.

696
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:06,597
Why did you want to do it in the first place?

697
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:08,837
Well...

698
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,807
So I wouldn't get disrespected by jerks like Yong Pal.

699
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:16,207
What good is a GED anyway?

700
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:19,147
Even a genius like you almost got killed.

701
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:21,647
All the more reason to fight hard to make sure he's punished.

702
00:48:23,177 --> 00:48:24,447
That guy, Yong Pal...

703
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,487
Has he been harassing you all this time?

704
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,657
For about...

705
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,387
a month now?

706
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:36,857
I ran into him on a delivery.

707
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:02,687
He's still the same old jerk,

708
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,657
but he had the nerve to give me crap about dropping out.

709
00:49:06,087 --> 00:49:07,387
It was humiliating,

710
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:09,797
and it just upset me.

711
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:12,297
Whatever your motivation was,

712
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:14,267
what matters is that you're doing it.

713
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:16,537
But what's going to change even if I do?

714
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:18,737
Even if I pass the GED, I'm still...

715
00:49:20,637 --> 00:49:21,677
I'm...

716
00:49:22,537 --> 00:49:23,577
just me.

717
00:49:24,937 --> 00:49:27,507
Still got nothing, still powerless,

718
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:32,787
just a burden on you for no reason. And Yong Pal's dad is running again.

719
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:39,057
You are powerful.

720
00:49:41,427 --> 00:49:42,457
Are you kidding me?

721
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,957
I know you're only helping me because you feel sorry for me.

722
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,167
No, you really are powerful.

723
00:49:56,637 --> 00:49:59,747
Look. The preamble to Korea's Constitution.

724
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:02,017
The supreme law that defines government...

725
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:04,317
and the people's rights and duties.

726
00:50:04,477 --> 00:50:07,387
No law is above the Constitution. And what's more...

727
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:15,127
It's the most powerful law in the country.

728
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:17,727
And do you know what the very first article says?

729
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:19,197
Article 1, Clause 1.

730
00:50:19,497 --> 00:50:21,397
The Republic of Korea shall be a democratic republic.

731
00:50:21,697 --> 00:50:24,837
Clause Two: The sovereignty of the ROK shall reside in the people,

732
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,607
and all state authority shall emanate from the people.

733
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:30,437
You said Yong Pal's dad is a city councilman, right?

734
00:50:30,937 --> 00:50:32,707
His power comes from the people too.

735
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:36,717
- That's just textbook stuff.
- Exactly.

736
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:39,417
You have the right to vote, don't you?

737
00:50:40,047 --> 00:50:41,047
That's your power.

738
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:45,187
And Yong Pal's dad desperately needs your vote.

739
00:50:47,257 --> 00:50:48,827
The local elections are just around the corner.

740
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:52,397
(Article 1: The ROK is a democracy.)

741
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:53,627
(Article 2: Korean citizenship is defined by law.)

742
00:50:58,237 --> 00:50:59,767
You should quit your delivery job and become a judge.

743
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:01,537
It suits you better.

744
00:51:05,807 --> 00:51:06,807
I'll take that as a compliment.

745
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:09,877
Idiot.

746
00:51:13,187 --> 00:51:16,357
For that compliment, dinner's on me. I can get a bite before I go, right?

747
00:51:22,797 --> 00:51:25,167
(Mr. Shin)

748
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:36,477
Hey, I thought we were off. You told me to take the day off.

749
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:38,277
You've been resting all day.

750
00:51:38,337 --> 00:51:40,507
What good is that if I haven't even had dinner yet?

751
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:42,817
Are you hungry? Want me to fry you some chicken?

752
00:51:44,077 --> 00:51:45,487
So, why'd you call me in?

753
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,057
To share what I've got on Yong Pal.

754
00:51:51,957 --> 00:51:54,487
Though I'm still going to handle it my way.

755
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:56,627
Have a seat.

756
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,737
By saving Lee Sang Hyun,

757
00:52:10,977 --> 00:52:12,447
the same way you spirited him out of the country?

758
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:22,917
Mr. Shin. You know that's aiding a fugitive?

759
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:29,357
Thanks to Lee Sang Hyun, you exposed all that corruption...

760
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:32,727
and got the cancer patients justice.

761
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:33,727
I get that, but...

762
00:52:33,727 --> 00:52:35,937
So what? Should I have just let him die?

763
00:52:36,497 --> 00:52:39,207
And that poor mother would have lost both her kids,

764
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:41,367
and spent her life in misery. Is that it?

765
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:44,107
Pillip, what would you have done in my shoes?

766
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:52,017
- Hey.
- Manager Kim.

767
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:54,187
What's up? How have you been doing?

768
00:52:55,117 --> 00:52:56,757
What's up? Real cool entrance?

769
00:52:57,017 --> 00:52:59,487
- Try showing up on time for once.
- I know.

770
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:01,827
- Hey, Kim pro.
- Yes?

771
00:53:01,827 --> 00:53:03,897
So, did you dig up all the dirt?

772
00:53:03,957 --> 00:53:06,727
You know it. Hey, get me some coffee.

773
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:07,727
I'll get it.

774
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,167
No, it's okay. He's very particular about his coffee.

775
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:13,207
- I'll do it. Put the kettle on.
- But...

776
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:15,877
dig up dirt on who?

777
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:25,487
Choi Woong Sik. A three-term city councilman.

778
00:53:26,687 --> 00:53:31,117
Choi Woong Sik owns that whole area, including the Buhyeong Scrapyard.

779
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:34,987
The scrapyard is leased by Chae Eui Soo for next to nothing.

780
00:53:35,157 --> 00:53:37,297
Chae Eui Soo? What's their connection?

781
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:40,367
They're as close as brothers. And their sons are friends too.

782
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,897
- Choi Woong Sik!
- Choi Woong Sik!

783
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:48,807
He works the campaign at elections and even heads the fundraising.

784
00:53:48,907 --> 00:53:51,307
Just hearing about it reeks of corruption.

785
00:53:51,737 --> 00:53:53,947
He must be getting a lot of kickbacks.

786
00:53:53,977 --> 00:53:57,847
And get this. In this city, Choi Woong Sik...

787
00:53:57,917 --> 00:53:59,687
has more pull than the mayor.

788
00:53:59,717 --> 00:54:03,417
Why just a councilman? He could be a lawmaker or even a governor.

789
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:05,657
It's not that he can't, it's that he won't.

790
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:08,327
He has all the money and power he needs.

791
00:54:08,357 --> 00:54:12,567
His son is a total train wreck. He beat up kids in middle school,

792
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:16,367
bullying them, and doing other terrible things.

793
00:54:16,437 --> 00:54:17,497
But there's not one article about it.

794
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:20,307
Because his father's above the law?

795
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:23,207
That's insane. Covering up school bullying?

796
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:26,507
What about the victims? That trauma lasts a lifetime.

797
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:28,307
Why are you yelling at me?

798
00:54:28,647 --> 00:54:31,917
Hey, Pillip. Are you this worked up over Si On?

799
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:34,247
Yes.

800
00:54:34,787 --> 00:54:35,917
Well, it's partly because of Si On.

801
00:54:37,117 --> 00:54:38,187
And the other victims too.

802
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:42,557
Choi Yong Min's father, Choi Woong Sik.

803
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:44,657
Is he running in this election?

804
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:47,227
His kick-off ceremony was last week. He's about to win his fourth term.

805
00:54:47,297 --> 00:54:49,597
- No, that can't happen.
- Says who?

806
00:54:51,597 --> 00:54:56,507
Hey, you two, be careful. Wasn't your assistant nearly crushed?

807
00:54:56,707 --> 00:55:00,347
There are more people out there who don't value life than you think.

808
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:02,117
Don't worry about me.

809
00:55:02,547 --> 00:55:03,947
I don't die.

810
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:08,017
Hey, golden boy. Know my nickname in the Middle East?

811
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,487
Never Die.

812
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,897
What about in the US?

813
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,167
Kim Pro.

814
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:24,967
- You telling him stories about me?
- No.

815
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:29,937
Die Hard.

816
00:55:32,377 --> 00:55:33,507
Stop laughing.

817
00:55:38,447 --> 00:55:39,747
Stop laughing.

818
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:43,857
And what are you laughing at?

819
00:55:44,117 --> 00:55:47,857
I just love that movie. My mom is a huge Bruce Willis fan.

820
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:51,927
Hey, don't bring up Bruce Willis. The man's retired.

821
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:54,667
Oh, gosh. This guy...

822
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,797
couldn't die even if he wanted to. Right?

823
00:55:59,867 --> 00:56:01,437
(Mahon's leap forward! Choi Woong Sik)

824
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:07,877
(City councilman Choi Woong Sik)

825
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,547
Please get some tea for our guest.

826
00:56:10,647 --> 00:56:11,647
Thank you.

827
00:56:12,217 --> 00:56:13,247
Here you go.

828
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:16,087
(Achievement Award)

829
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:19,287
- Please, have some tea.
- Thank you.

830
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:24,527
I know Hujin Arcade well. I've been a local for 40 years.

831
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:26,867
Is that right?

832
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:29,267
So that must be why everyone...

833
00:56:29,337 --> 00:56:32,767
kept telling me I had to come and see you.

834
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:35,607
Even without this city council pin,

835
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:38,477
neighbours should help each other out.

836
00:56:39,247 --> 00:56:40,307
Yes, of course.

837
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:44,277
So, sir, what seems to be the problem?

838
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:47,517
I...

839
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:51,157
run a business that relies on deliveries.

840
00:56:51,217 --> 00:56:53,727
And I see all kinds of customers.

841
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:59,027
One customer was on a power trip, and it went way too far.

842
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:02,027
Are people still that shameless out there?

843
00:57:02,097 --> 00:57:04,767
Tell me about it. They're out there.

844
00:57:05,397 --> 00:57:06,507
Councilman.

845
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:10,177
My driver had such a hard time with them,

846
00:57:10,537 --> 00:57:13,477
she started recording their interactions when she could.

847
00:57:15,517 --> 00:57:17,977
- Would you mind taking a listen?
- Of course.

848
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:24,557
You're the one who trashed the place and you want me to pay for cleaning?

849
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:28,027
I've been letting this slide, but you...

850
00:57:29,257 --> 00:57:32,097
You've got some nerve, don't you? Talking back to me.

851
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:34,097
Let go of me.

852
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,637
You little wench. Too poor to even graduate.

853
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:43,237
Hey! Snap out of it. It's the middle of the day.

854
00:57:43,277 --> 00:57:45,647
So what? I'm leaving the country anyway.

855
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:49,247
- That wench has no bodyguard now!
- Dude, are you crazy?

856
00:57:50,047 --> 00:57:54,017
That delivery girl, Si On. She'll learn without a job or bike.

857
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:57,087
Hey, knock it off!

858
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:03,197
You treat a poor customer like this? The cleaning fee is your settlement.

859
00:58:09,967 --> 00:58:11,167
That's my son.

860
00:58:15,237 --> 00:58:16,637
So you knew all this when you came here.

861
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:31,917
I am so sorry.

862
00:58:32,227 --> 00:58:34,927
I'll do everything in my power to make this right.

863
00:58:35,227 --> 00:58:37,727
I'm not an unreasonable man.

864
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:40,897
If I have something to answer for, I'll take full responsibility. Yes.

865
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:54,947
That jerk is dead, right? Hey, don't worry about it.

866
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:56,777
My dad will take care of everything.

867
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:03,217
So who should take responsibility for this one?

868
00:59:05,357 --> 00:59:08,227
Your son? Or should I say you, Councilman?

869
00:59:32,617 --> 00:59:33,617
Fire!

870
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:35,717
Hey, get out! Quick!

871
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:44,197
What do we do? What are we going to do?

872
00:59:46,597 --> 00:59:47,797
That jerk...

873
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:50,597
He's not dead?

874
00:59:56,607 --> 00:59:59,677
Oh no, that's Si On's scooter. Si On!

875
01:00:01,947 --> 01:00:05,017
Why don't you be straight with me?

876
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:08,047
Is that why you're here? To threaten me?

877
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:10,017
Threaten you?

878
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:14,427
I wouldn't threaten someone over their son.

879
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:18,427
I'm here to negotiate, Councilman Choi Woong Sik.

880
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:25,497
If you withdraw your candidacy from this election,

881
01:00:26,937 --> 01:00:29,607
I will let you walk away from this.

882
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:34,947
The assault on Si On and the attempted murder of Pillip,

883
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:39,417
as well as threatening the victim and trying to cover up the truth.

884
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,217
If you take full responsibility and resign,

885
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:46,027
I'll let you walk.

886
01:00:51,827 --> 01:00:54,997
So, what's your answer?

887
01:00:56,097 --> 01:00:57,937
Would you rather find out what a real threat...

888
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:00,267
feels like?

889
01:01:01,707 --> 01:01:04,707
(Achievement Award)

890
01:01:55,427 --> 01:01:58,227
(Shin's Project)

891
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:01,967
This won't hold up as evidence in court.

892
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:04,097
We need more evidence.

893
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,907
Who has time to take down villains by the book?

894
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:11,177
I, Candidate Number Nine, Shin Jay, will make it happen!

895
01:02:13,677 --> 01:02:16,547
If we unify our campaigns and join forces...

896
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:22,517
- Just steamroll them all.
- I guess that's our only option.

897
01:02:23,017 --> 01:02:24,387
I might not look it, but I'm a good fighter.

898
01:02:24,457 --> 01:02:26,227
I have to complete it.

899
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:28,357
The election!
