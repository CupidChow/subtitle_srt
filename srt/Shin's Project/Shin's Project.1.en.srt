00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:07,212
(Episode 1)

2
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:08,272
(No urinating)

3
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:18,422
Hi, Si On.

4
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:24,422
(Milk)

5
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:32,102
Let's hurry. Okay, I'm coming.

6
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:34,672
- Hurry up.
- What in the world is going on?

7
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:35,902
That's Jeong Min's house.

8
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:38,402
No, I think it's Mi Jin's place. No, it looks like Jeong Min's.

9
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:40,612
What if there's a fire? What are we going to do?

10
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:42,942
What's that guy doing? He's the semi-basement guy, right?

11
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:44,342
He was robbed again?

12
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,982
Get out of the way!

13
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,192
- Get lost, all of you!
- Isn't that gasoline?

14
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:58,692
- Hey, what are we going to do?
- Get lost.

15
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:00,532
Why are you all ignoring me!

16
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,162
(Bathroom)

17
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:05,432
Get lost.

18
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:10,402
(City Gas)

19
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:12,572
Everyone, step back.

20
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:30,622
(Suyeong Express)

21
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,632
(Milk)

22
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:41,032
Everyone, get lost! I'm going to kill myself!

23
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,672
- Choi, handle crowd control there.
- What did I do wrong?

24
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:44,742
All right.

25
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:48,442
- Everyone, back up. It's dangerous.
- Get out of the way, cops!

26
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,912
Please follow our instructions, everyone.

27
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:51,742
Calm down, sir.

28
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,182
- Seriously, how many times now?
- Are you going to get lost or not?

29
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,822
- We understand, so...
- You want to see me die?

30
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,652
- Stop this and come on down!
- Get lost!

31
00:02:57,722 --> 00:02:58,752
Unbelievable.

32
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:02,562
- When's the SWAT team getting here?
- They're almost here.

33
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,132
(Gas)

34
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:10,432
What's that? Isn't that a butane canister?

35
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,332
Oh, no.

36
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:13,632
Hey, push them back.

37
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,012
All units, move in. Let's go, let's go.

38
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:22,342
- Get in position.
- Get in position.

39
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:24,612
(SWAT)

40
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,302
- Get ready.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:55,072
What is all this? Why is it so damn noisy!

42
00:03:56,742 --> 00:03:58,042
- Hey!
- What?

43
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,852
You jerk! Get down from there now!

44
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:02,522
No! What have you ever done for me?

45
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:06,192
- How many times have I told you...
- Look at this. What a mess.

46
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:09,062
What have you ever done for me? Who are you to talk to me?

47
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,162
I'm going to end it all.

48
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:13,092
What right? You're lowering home values, punk!

49
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:16,362
Why do you ignore me? Is it too much to ask?

50
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:18,602
Excuse me.

51
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,272
Let me just hang this laundry.

52
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:31,682
The elderly lady on the third floor has bad knees,

53
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:34,212
so I brought it up here for her.

54
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,252
Just going to hang the laundry.

55
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,492
Don't.

56
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:45,832
Them?

57
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:49,402
Don't you worry about that. They won't shoot you anyway.

58
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:54,332
The utility pipes here are ancient,

59
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:58,072
this whole area will be basically one big minefield, you see.

60
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:01,942
- See that fire truck over there?
- What?

61
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,012
The fire truck.

62
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:06,952
There's a firefighter next to that truck, right?

63
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:08,652
Take a good look at the hose...

64
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:10,582
that firefighter's holding.

65
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:13,792
That's right, that one.

66
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:17,562
That hose is taut, isn't it?

67
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:20,592
It's full of water. They're ready to spray immediately.

68
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:27,032
So what I'm saying is, no matter how hard you try to die,

69
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,202
it's not going to be that easy.

70
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:33,672
If you can't even manage to die, why try setting yourself on fire?

71
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,042
Mister.

72
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,642
- Do you like chocolate milk?
- What?

73
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,482
- Chocolate milk.
- Choco...

74
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:44,922
I bought this for myself, but have some. Just save me a little.

75
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:49,062
You've been working all night, so you haven't eaten a thing.

76
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,322
Your stomach must be killing you.

77
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:53,432
Here, have some.

78
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:58,402
Go on, drink up.

79
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:01,732
Mister!

80
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:05,442
Yes?

81
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,172
Who are you?

82
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:10,842
You know Ttoli Super?

83
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:13,252
- Tto...
- Ttoli Super.

84
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,312
Over there...

85
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,822
So you do know it.

86
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:19,152
You know Samgwang Villa next to it, right?

87
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,922
- Over there. That one.
- Hey!

88
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:23,992
- You jerk!
- What?

89
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,422
- Get down from there right now!
- Keep it up.

90
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:29,362
If you want to die, do it quietly! Why make a scene at my building?

91
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,902
A scene?

92
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:33,772
After everything you put me through in this building!

93
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:35,531
It's my building. I'll do what I want.

94
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,702
Who are you to tell me what to do?

95
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,772
Hey, you punk!

96
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:41,742
It's not like we stayed for free.

97
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,782
You took our rent money on time every single month,

98
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,852
so why do you suddenly pull a stunt like this?

99
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:50,052
What, you think your tenants are just a bunch of pushovers?

100
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,352
What's wrong with you?

101
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:53,292
What's he going on about? Is he telling me to leave?

102
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:54,952
Who on earth are you to be causing trouble here?

103
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:59,292
I tried to be patient with the geezer, but he's just ridiculous.

104
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:03,302
Me? I pay rent, so I'll make a scene.

105
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:06,902
- So what are you gonna do about it?
- You're what?

106
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:11,702
Sir, please calm down for a moment. Let's step aside so you can tell me.

107
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:14,372
- Get off me! I said, let go!
- Please calm down.

108
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:19,152
So arrogant over a single building. Hey, don't you pay him any mind.

109
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,812
Just completely ignore a guy like that.

110
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,882
Just ignore him.

111
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,681
- Mister.
- Yes?

112
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,292
You pay monthly rent, too?

113
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,262
You bet I do. I even have to pay rent in advance.

114
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,622
My landlord...

115
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,892
once threw all my stuff out onto the street.

116
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,472
Just because I was a week late with my prepaid rent.

117
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,002
I even ended up paying him back with interest.

118
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,172
So disgusting and petty of him. Seriously.

119
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,382
Buddy.

120
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:54,482
I know exactly how you feel. Whatever you've been through,

121
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:55,922
I swear,

122
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:58,922
I am 100 percent on your side.

123
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:03,962
Don't cry.

124
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:06,992
Come on, don't cry over something like this.

125
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,602
Move.

126
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,072
I said, move!

127
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:15,872
Oh, good grief.

128
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,972
Hey! Don't just stand there, shoot him!

129
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:22,712
What? More nonsense?

130
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,382
Go on, say it.

131
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:27,312
I hope you spend your life living under someone else's roof...

132
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,622
and get robbed of every cent you earn, you jerk!

133
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:32,752
Why you...

134
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:40,032
Has that old jerk lost his mind? He's really making me angry.

135
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,092
What did you just say?

136
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:42,662
I'm seriously...

137
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:45,502
Don't.

138
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:49,132
I'm going to burn this whole damn place to the ground,

139
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:53,612
- and leave you with nothing!
- He's lost it.

140
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:56,582
I'll make you spend your entire life living under someone else's roof!

141
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,752
- I swear I will!
- Stop it.

142
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,082
Hey.

143
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,282
- Don't you dare.
- No.

144
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:05,352
- Let's all die! Die!
- Don't! Stop it

145
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:07,552
Die.

146
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,392
After we all die together,

147
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:11,922
and go to the afterworld...

148
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,262
Wait a second.

149
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:17,032
Let's see who becomes the brighter star.

150
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,001
Come on in!

151
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,902
- Come on in!
- Stay back! No, stay back!

152
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,532
- Come on!
- You can't come in.

153
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:23,602
Come on!

154
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:28,742
Come on!

155
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:30,082
Go!

156
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:36,982
(SWAT)

157
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:40,422
Mister.

158
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:43,692
- Yes.
- Thanks for the chocolate milk.

159
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,562
Coming through.

160
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:09,112
(Police)

161
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,582
Thanks to you, it all worked out.

162
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,552
By the way, why did you break that window?

163
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:16,022
I smelled gas. Didn't you?

164
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:21,432
That could've caused an explosion, so I was just airing it out.

165
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:27,032
He apparently wouldn't install bars, so he's been robbed three times.

166
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:30,442
To make such a fuss over just some security bars, honestly.

167
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,612
What do you mean, "just some security bars"?

168
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:34,872
"Just some security bars"?

169
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:39,552
Do you know why people snap?

170
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:41,981
Because it all just boils up inside.

171
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,582
It boils and boils till it spills out,

172
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:46,892
and that's when the lid just blows right off.

173
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:51,022
Someone gets dumped, they jump. Their grades drop, they jump.

174
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,092
They jump because the person upstairs won't stop stomping around.

175
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:58,332
But I've never seen anyone jump for world peace.

176
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:02,402
Do you know why people risk their lives over such small things?

177
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:06,372
Because for them, that's the most urgent thing in their life.

It's a matter of life and death for them!

179
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,582
How dare you be so dismissive!

180
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:15,782
Wait, sir.

181
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:17,422
What?

182
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:19,822
If you don't mind my asking, what is it you do?

183
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:21,522
Me?

184
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,992
Well, I'm this kind of person.

185
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,302
If there's ever a reward,

186
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:32,602
be sure to give me a call.

(Shin's Project)

189
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:10,842
I'm so nervous. It's our first day. Where do you think you'll be posted?

190
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,442
I'm not sure.

191
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,342
Judge Cho will get a good post, wont he?

192
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,182
Of course. He graduated at the top of his class.

193
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:19,382
Well, I'm just going to work hard no matter which department I get.

194
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,052
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

195
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,682
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

196
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,652
- You're my role model, sir.
- Me too.

197
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,092
You must be Cho Pillip.

198
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,132
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:36,702
Come, let's talk.

200
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,132
- Welcome.
- Goodbye, sir.

201
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:40,202
- Goodbye, sir.
- Please, go on in.

202
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:42,572
- Gosh, I'm so jealous.
- So jealous.

203
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:43,902
He must be off somewhere great.

204
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:53,982
The director of the institute spoke very highly of you.

205
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:55,382
You're too kind, sir.

206
00:12:55,612 --> 00:13:00,352
Don't waste your time bowing to me. Save it for when it really counts,

207
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,222
and bow to the powerless with all your heart.

208
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:06,432
You're the senior judge my institute class admires the most.

209
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,092
I know. I'm popular.

210
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:14,172
Why hasn't this guy shown up yet?

211
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,412
Hey, where are you going?

212
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:29,212
What do you believe makes a good judge?

213
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:32,682
One who treats both sides fairly and listens closely to both sides...

214
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:35,252
Are there judges who don't do that? Give me something other than that.

215
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,292
Well...

216
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:39,362
- Also...
- Being honest.

217
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:43,832
Don't pretend you know everything. Honestly admit what you don't know.

218
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,002
Do you have the courage to admit that in court?

219
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:53,972
Oh, for crying out loud.

220
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:57,442
I should've changed the password.

221
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:58,542
What's with your getup?

222
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:02,152
Why can just anyone waltz in when the owner's away?

223
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:03,382
Get us two coffees.

224
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,152
What, does this look like a coffee shop?

225
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:12,222
Coffee at a chicken joint? It's ridiculous.

226
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,862
I can hear you. And only fill water three-fifths full.

227
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:22,102
Anyway, to be a good judge,

228
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,102
you first have to be a good person.

229
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:28,272
- Yes, sir. I'll work hard.
- You'd better.

230
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:33,952
Here. Three-fifths.

231
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:39,422
Or thirteen-twentieths.

232
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:41,892
Thirteen-twentieths?

233
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,022
- Master Shin.
- What?

234
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,462
Give me half a chicken.

235
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:48,192
- Oh, come on.
- I don't have time. Hurry up.

236
00:14:48,532 --> 00:14:49,932
Half a chicken?

237
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,382
That temper of his.

238
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,192
- Go on, eat.
- After you, sir.

239
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,832
- No, you eat first.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,772
- So? How is it?
- It's delicious. Please, have some.

241
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:31,242
This place has great whole chicken. It wouldn't be a bad place to work.

242
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:34,012
- I'll work hard for you either way.
- No.

243
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:36,512
I'm saying you're going to work here.

244
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,222
Master Shin is a bit of a handful, but he knows his stuff.

245
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:46,552
I have a trial this afternoon.

246
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:47,952
But sir...

247
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:50,822
No, that's all right. Don't get up. Enjoy your meal.

248
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:53,562
And from today on, you'll be clocking out from here.

249
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,502
- Have a word with me.
- You're right we need to talk.

250
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:07,312
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

251
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:09,742
- Are you kidding me?
- Am I?

252
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,112
It's an official judicial assignment.

253
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:15,912
Right, so why move a judge's aide to a chicken shop?

254
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:17,782
Where on earth is there a law that allows this?

255
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,892
- There's no law that says I can't.
- And there's no law saying you can!

256
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:25,622
How can a man on the taxpayers' dime get away with something like this?

257
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:29,832
You always duck out on the clock, running up tabs all over town,

258
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,902
and messing up the economy for us common folk.

259
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:37,072
Pulling strings for people now? Do your superiors know about this?

260
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:38,642
(Chicken Center)

261
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:42,642
If they knew, could you still waltz around in broad daylight?

262
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:49,952
What, did I commit a crime? Why can't I walk around?

263
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:53,292
The South Korean Judiciary is so very just.

264
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:57,422
A judge using blackmail and threats? Our court system is something else.

265
00:16:58,022 --> 00:16:59,062
Master Shin.

266
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:04,032
- Stop your whining and take this.
- I don't want to.

267
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:05,832
- Take it.
- I said no!

268
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:11,542
Gangchun's Salted Seafood Merchants have sued a TV network.

269
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:14,472
Mediate between them and settle this before the trial starts.

270
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:18,842
Why should they settle? It's cleaner to sort it in court.

271
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:20,952
Who ever said trials are clean?

272
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:22,881
This trial will take at least a year.

273
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:23,882
And the costs will be enormous.

274
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:27,592
Plus, if they're tied up in court, they can't run their businesses.

275
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:30,962
They may lose, and even if they win, what would they have really gained?

276
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:32,062
But what about me?

277
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:34,892
I'm also just trying to get by day by day.

278
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:38,062
- It's tough enough paying my rent!
- I'm paying for the part-timer.

279
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,732
I'm even giving you an employee.

280
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,032
A guy who's smarter than you, at that.

281
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:44,842
He'll be a big help. Now take it.

282
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:46,612
- What?
- Good luck!

283
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:50,582
Hey, who asked for an employee? You can't just leave!

284
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,642
Take this punk with you!

285
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:57,582
'The chicken here is great. It wouldn't be a bad place to work.'

286
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,922
'I'm telling you to work here.'

287
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:41,062
Yes, this is a fried chicken restaurant.

288
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:46,402
No, we don't deliver before six. Hold on a second.

289
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,972
Okay, go ahead with the address.

290
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,372
I'm from the Seoul Central District Court...

291
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,142
I heard you, okay?

292
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,271
So, before it gets cold,

293
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:56,372
- Wait...
- deliver it.

294
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:02,582
Hey. three whole chickens, ten dollars. Get the cash.

295
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:06,352
I'm just really curious about something.

296
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:09,822
What exactly is this place? Do you only sell fried chickens?

297
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:12,092
Go on, hurry. Before they get soggy.

I was supposed to become a judge.

300
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,272
But just like that...

301
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,772
I became an employee at a fried chicken restaurant.

302
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,141
(I was supposed to become a judge...)

303
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,212
(but I became an employee at a fried chicken restaurant.)

Alright, can you all see this? It's the Daily Chicken Man, Kkokkio.

305
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,392
Guess what's coming up next? This is going to be epic.

306
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,362
He's here!

307
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:59,072
Oh my goodness.

308
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:03,982
You're rocking that suit. Oh, hold on. Come on in.

309
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:05,542
Right this way.

310
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:09,582
Never mind your shoes. Come on in. Look right at the middle camera.

311
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:13,452
We're going to say "Kkokkio." One, two, three.

312
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,822
- Kkokkio!
- Kko...

313
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:19,522
Well, goodbye.

315
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,142
Where did Master Shin go?

316
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:38,842
Tell Master Shin I want to see him when he gets back.

317
00:20:40,882 --> 00:20:42,482
Who should I say is asking?

00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,252
There he goes again. Honestly.

A dry cleaner's?

321
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:56,092
Have Master Shin see me when he's back.

322
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:58,132
- Sir, could you tell me your na...
- Don't touch me!

323
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,402
What?

(Pluto, Welcome)

325
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:07,342
Alright, who's the jerk that knocked over my sign?

326
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:19,752
- Oh, a Chinese restaurant?
- Get out of my way.

327
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:23,562
- I said, get out of my way!
- Are you looking for the owner?

328
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:26,192
He's not here right now. And the door's locked.

329
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:27,492
What part of that don't you understand?

330
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:28,862
I said get out of my way!

331
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:34,932
Hey, what do you think you're doing? You can't just assault a bystander.

332
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:38,502
Then why were you standing there? I told you to get out of the way.

333
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,612
Hey, why are you talking to me like that?

334
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:42,942
The boss told me to let you in.

335
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:47,111
Hi.

336
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:48,952

(Chicken Center)

338
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:03,332
So, the delivery?

339
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:08,532
Here's the money for the chicken.

340

Hey, tell me later.

342
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:20,882

00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,862
Well, no. Judge Kim Sang Geun told me to work here, so...

350
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:38,562
He pulled some strings for you. That's what a parachute hire is.

351
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:41,772
Don't you ever mention that old geezer's name in front of me again.

352
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,372
Where are we going?

353
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:47,612
To run an errand.

354
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:56,582
You violated the Road Traffic Act by not obeying a traffic signal.

355
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:03,092
Do you want to get the crap beaten out of you?

356
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,031
On top of a 60-dollar fine and 15 points,

357
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,432
you'd also violate Criminal Act 260...

358
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:10,202
Get out, you punk. You're fired.

359
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:13,472
Hurry up and get out.

360
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:31,882
(I was fired two hours into my job at the chicken shop.)

361
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,222
I was fired two hours into my job...

362
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:36,352
at the chicken shop.

363

"On-site Pursuit."

364
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:51,342
Excuse me, are you Producer Kim Young Ho?

365
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:55,872
I'm a huge fan of On-site Pursuit.

366
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:58,712
I'm sorry to bother you, but could I please get your autograph?

367
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:00,552
- Oh, sure.
- Oh, thank you.

368
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:07,692
Producer Kim Young Ho.

369
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:11,562
You know the Gangchun Salted Seafood Cooperative...

370
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,562
Did you know they're suing you and the network for defamation?

371
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,662
And?

372
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:19,402
Well, I mean, if you two sue each other,

373
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:24,672
it's a waste of time and money. It's best to reach an agreement...

374
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,672
What kind of settlement are you talking about?

375
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:29,972
- What did I even do?
- No, that's what I'm saying.

376
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:34,182
What could you have done wrong for them to sue you like this?

377
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:36,822
Are you the lawyer for the Salted Seafood Cooperative?

378
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:40,022
Oh, please. If I were a lawyer, do you think I'd be here?

379
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,222
I'd be duking it out with them in court.

380
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:47,162
Then in what capacity are you here? What is it that you do?

381
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,162
- Oh, me?
- Yes.

382
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:54,672
Well, to put it one way, I'm an expert in these matters.

383
00:24:55,432 --> 00:25:00,312
His Honour sent me today, so you can just think of me as a mediator.

384
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,712
His Honour sent you?

385
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:04,142
Judge Kim Sang Geun...

386
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:06,512
wants you to settle this amicably.

387
00:25:07,782 --> 00:25:10,422
Look, we don't have much time before the trial, so...

388
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:13,152
when we meet next, I'll come with a more specific proposal...

389
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:14,392
That won't be necessary.

390
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,492
- What?
- From now on, talk to my lawyer.

391
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:19,022
If you'll excuse me.

392
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:22,662
Hey, wait, Producer Kim.

393
00:25:23,662 --> 00:25:24,662
Kim...

394
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,172
Hey!

395
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,212
What are you doing here? I told you, you're fired, you punk.

396
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:39,512
You may be the boss, but strictly speaking, you're not my employer.

397
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:41,482
Therefore, you have no authority to fire me. Also...

398
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,382
Then who is your employer?

399
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:46,452
Also,

400
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,852
I worked too hard to get certified to give up this easily.

401
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,222
And if this is truly an order from Judge Kim Sang Geun,

402
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:53,762
then I have to survive.

403
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:55,692
I've made up my mind.

404
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:57,532
Stop staring so intensely when you talk.

405
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:59,362
How did you know to come here?

406
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:00,632
Were you following me?

407
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:03,572
I saw the documents at the shop. I just had a feeling you'd be here.

408
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:04,642
Why you...

409
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:07,842
Give me your license.

410
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:11,212
Drive.

411
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:25,022
(Gangchun Market: "Maggot Salted Seafood")

412
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:27,462
You know the Maggot Salted Seafood Scandal?

413
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,662
I never miss On-site Pursuit.

414
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:33,201
Maggots were in the salted seafood cooperative for sale...

415
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:34,232
and in the co-op's own stock.

416
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:38,102
The Food and Drug Safety Ministry investigated but found no issues.

417
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:42,942
After the broadcast, sales plummeted and many shops closed, ruining them.

418
00:26:43,112 --> 00:26:47,512
So the merchants are suing. But it's hard to beat a network.

419
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:50,252
Korean law only allows compensation from the media, so...

420
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:55,022
That's why we're going to mediate. To settle before it goes to trial.

421
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,222
A settlement agreement?

422
00:26:56,822 --> 00:26:57,822
You are?

423
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:00,332
- Why?
- Why do you think?

424
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:02,762
Because that darn old geezer...

425
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:04,802
ordered me to.

426
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:07,602
Oh, did you major in law? Or maybe you're a lawyer...

427
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:11,672
Do I need a license to stop a fight? Stop with the law, article, clause!

428
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,272
- Well, not necessarily...
- Step on it.

429
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,342
Yes, sir.

430
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:39,562
(Gangchun Salted Seafood Market)

431
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:46,302

432
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:53,342
(Notice of Closure)

433
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:07,692
(We're closing down. we apologise. Kim Young Ho, apologise now!)

434
00:28:08,892 --> 00:28:11,232
- What is this place?
- A public market.

435
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:13,902
They closed down a month after the show aired.

436
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:16,502
Goodness, where did the maggots on the show come from?

437
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:20,372
I'm not sure about that. We were strict about our sanitation.

438
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:24,312
I heard Yun Ho's family sold up too. With business being so bad,

439
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:27,712
When Mr. Park offers a good price, let's just sell quickly. Okay?

440
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:31,752
Your mother raised you on this shop. And now, for a few extra bucks,

441
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:35,022
- you'd sell your mother's spirit?
- Spirit or not...

442
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:38,522
- We're about to starve, Granny!
- Be quiet.

443
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,162
Stop fighting.

444
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:44,262
Alright. Everyone.

445
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:47,302
Come on, we all need to stick together.

446
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:51,242
I mean, we have people who came from far away,

447
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:53,302
so let's hear what these people have to say.

448
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:58,542
That person is from City Hall, and they were sent by the judge.

449
00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:01,282
Why are they ordering business owners around?

450
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:05,452
You all filed a lawsuit against the network and Kim Young Ho...

451
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:08,292
for defamation, is that correct?

452
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:11,062
I'm the person sent by the judge.

453
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:14,692
Usually, once a trial starts, it can take, well, over a year,

454
00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:18,202
and as you all know, the costs are very high.

455
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:21,772
So, it's better for both sides to reach a settlement.

456
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,772
That is the judge's opinion.

457
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,942
If we win, won't the other side have to pay the court fees?

458
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:31,882
That's true if you win the trial. But that's precisely the problem.

459
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,312
Hey, explain it to them.

460
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:38,782
I've reviewed the complaint, and the network is legally favoured.

461
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:41,652
- Even if you appeal...
- If you lose the trial,

462
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:45,062
I mean, who is going to cover those costs?

463
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:47,792
Where would we get that kind of money?

464
00:29:47,862 --> 00:29:49,862
Okay. Everyone, calm down,

465
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:53,232
Let's discuss what would be most helpful for the merchants here.

466
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:58,102
The apology broadcast you all want realistically won't happen.

467
00:29:58,302 --> 00:30:02,011
So, the idea is to demand damages and wrap this up amicably...

468
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,212
What are we, beggars?

469
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:07,812
Forget that. Tell Producer Kim to get on TV and beg forgiveness.

470
00:30:08,112 --> 00:30:09,112
Ma'am.

471
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:12,052
This isn't something to approach so emotionally.

472
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:14,792
You should get actual compensation for your damages.

473
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:19,162
What are actual damages? Do you know what people are saying?

474
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:20,832
They say Gangchun salted seafood...

475
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:22,692
is something you wouldn't even feed to a dog.

476
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:26,462
"It's garbage teeming with maggots. You eat it and drop dead."

477
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:28,372
My whole life,

478
00:30:28,572 --> 00:30:32,172
I've treated my fermenting barrels as more pristine than my own body.

479
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:33,572
Everyone sitting here has.

480
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:37,312
Ma'am, because of your stubbornness, everyone will suffer twice as much.

481
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:40,652
Never mind twice, if I die 12 times, what's wrong is wrong.

482
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:45,352
Either restore all the shops here, or have him admit his fault...

483
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:48,091
and get on TV and grovel for forgiveness.

484
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:52,992
If not, I'll salt his palms. Only then will I sign!

485
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:57,092
Granny!

486
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:05,271
Please understand. She's just very upset.

487
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:08,872
Everyone's in a tough situation, so they'll settle for a fair price.

488
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:12,482
I guess pulling out his tongue and pickling it in salt is faster.

489
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:14,352
Let's go.

490
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,152
She's certainly stubborn.

491
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:21,322
I can understand the merchants' position.

492
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:24,962
Does "understanding" pay the rent? Does it put food on the table?

493
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:26,092
I'll be right back.

494
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:29,862
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm getting some salted seafood.

495

- I like salted squid.
- Okay.

No, it's not that. I'm here for some salted seafood.

Oh, well, here.

506
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:21,782
Here, have a taste of this. It's salted fermented squid.

- Ours is the best around.
- Oh, thank you.

508

- Boss.
- Yes?

509
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:34,862
Did you go for fermented seafood or to get pickled yourself?

510
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:38,062
There was a little misunderstanding, but I bought some.

511
00:32:38,902 --> 00:32:41,272
- This is the squid, right?
- Yes, she threw that in for free.

00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:25,517
You're not a local. Are you looking to invest?

520
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,387
Or looking to move?

521
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:31,517
Investing, of course. Those beach shops look pretty good.

522
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:32,887
The view is so wide open.

523
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:35,957
You're a step too late. There's nothing available there.

524
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,357
But we saw plenty of empty store fronts.

525
00:33:37,427 --> 00:33:39,867
Those are all gone. Most were urgent sales, and...

526
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,267
stores without key money get snapped up right away.

527
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:45,367
Instead of that area, if you go ten minutes further from here...

528
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:48,367
No, no, no. I'm set on that location.

529
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:50,777
Hey, where was that shop where you bought the salted squid?

530
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,947
Manager Cho.

531
00:33:56,277 --> 00:33:57,947
Snap out of it, man.

532
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,757
Oh, the granny's seafood place?

533
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:05,757
Yes, that's the one. I want that spot.

534
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:10,227
Imagine a building of all glass. The ocean's right there.

535
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:12,497
- It'd be a prime spot for the view.
- Exactly.

536
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:15,127
Ocean views by day, a sunset mecca by night.

537
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:16,637
It's got social media hot spot written all over it.

538
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:20,237
Look, I'll pay whatever it costs. Just sell it to me.

539
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:21,607
The old lady isn't selling her shop.

540
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:22,677
What? Why not?

541
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:24,407
I do have something in the works with her.

542
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:26,607
Oh, so you are talking. Perfect.

543
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:30,577
I'll pay a premium. Just convince her to sell to me.

544
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:34,546
A premium? I don't operate that way.

545
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:38,257
I'm sorry, but really, I have a client who asked first.

546
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:41,457
This whole business area is dead, but you're saying they're all sold?

547
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:43,727
- It's right on the waterfront.
- What about the shop next door?

548
00:34:43,797 --> 00:34:46,097
- That one's sold, too.
- And the one next to that one?

549
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:47,227
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:47,297 --> 00:34:51,537
This is ridiculous. So ridiculous. A shame, but nothing can be done.

551
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:53,567
- Let's go.
- Yes, Boss.

552
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:55,167
If you'd like to leave your number, I can...

553
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:57,877
That's all right. Thanks for your time.

554
00:34:57,937 --> 00:34:59,077
Okay. Take care.

555
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:05,017
Who's buying shops in an area with no customers or business?

556
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:08,647
This is strange, right? The whole key money situation...

557
00:35:08,747 --> 00:35:10,287
And his reaction to the premium.

558
00:35:17,797 --> 00:35:19,127
Did you get the pictures?

559
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:23,497
- He seemed a little suspicious.
- Hurry, before scumbags show up.

560
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,597
You know what this deal is worth, right?

561
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:31,507
Why use patches if you won't rest? How else will you get better?

562
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:34,077
My Gi Beom is the only one who looks out for me.

563
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:35,777
Come on, eat up.

564
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,887
Grandma, let's move out of here.

565
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:43,357
Not this again. Where would we get the money?

566
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:47,057
We can sell the shop, and I told you I'll handle the rest.

567
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:50,227
Oh, stop with that nonsense and just eat.

568
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:52,457
Here, try some. It's fermented just right.

569
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:56,867
I'm so sick of this seafood. So sick of it.

570
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:03,607
That little brat. Oh, Gi Beom!

571
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:05,407
Don't you know how stubborn my grandma is?

572
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:10,417
You said if I did what he asked, there wouldn't be any trouble.

573
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:15,287
You never said it would be on TV. Now I've ruined all the local shops.

574
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:19,357
Fine. I'll head there.

575
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:39,677
Hey, Pillip.

576
00:36:40,747 --> 00:36:42,576
What are you doing? Pick up.

577
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:43,577
Sure.

578
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:47,547
Yes, hello? This is the chicken shop.

579
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:49,687
Yes.

580
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:52,257
We’re a bit backed up right now, so it’ll take about an hour.

581
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:53,987
Thanks.

582
00:36:54,787 --> 00:36:56,756
Sir, one spicy and two regulars for delivery.

583
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:59,466
What’s going on today?

584
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,027
Did every other chicken shop in the neighbourhood close down?

585
00:37:05,697 --> 00:37:06,807
Here you go.

586
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:10,277
I got tricked.

587
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:13,007
Here.

588
00:37:13,307 --> 00:37:14,677
Here.

589
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:18,747
Here.

590
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,427
Is he out delivering somewhere?

591
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:28,757
What?

592
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,457
Who are you talking about?

593
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:33,096
Look right here. That’s where our viewers are watching from.

594
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:34,126
How about a quick greeting?

595
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,137
On the count of three, just shout "Kokkio!"

596
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,196
One, two, three.

597
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:38,997
Kokkio!

598
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:48,547
Yes, this is the chicken shop.

599
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,687
We’re actually sold out for the day.

600
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:56,017
I'm sorry.

601
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:00,127
Thanks, please call again next time.

602
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:02,457
Sure.

603
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:11,937
Where is Mr. Shin, anyway?

604
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,337
What is he really doing?

605
00:38:22,707 --> 00:38:25,977
When did Player Kim get in here?

606
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:27,646
Player Kim could hack...

607
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:29,716
The Blue House with one computer.

608
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:30,717
Wow, how many computers...

609
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:34,187
do they even have in here?

610
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,627
Oh, they're not all mine.

611
00:38:37,757 --> 00:38:39,997
I'm working for free.

612
00:38:40,097 --> 00:38:43,366
Hey, and besides, I've been out of the game a while.

613
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:46,637
You literally wash your hands every day.

614
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:50,077
Though you've been away,

615
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:53,807
You're still sharp?

616
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:01,887
You want me to pull real estate records?

617
00:39:02,147 --> 00:39:03,217
Yes.

618
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,687
It's a small agency in the country,

619
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:07,957
they're buying commercial property without paying key money,

620
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:12,557
They sometimes add a premium instead of key money.

621
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,667
Where's that premium from?

622
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:16,237
I want to know about that.

623
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:18,267
Darn...

624
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:20,506
It's illegal.

625
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:21,907
Of course it's illegal.

626
00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:24,376
But 15 years ago, I legally got you,

627
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:27,247
out of the slammer.

628
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:31,076
Is this Gomtang or Seolleongtang?

629
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,116
How often did you reboil this?

630
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:36,086
I still don't know how to repay you.

631
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:39,317
Just repay the favour and forget about it.

632
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:42,257
This must be why people come...

633
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:46,327
to internet cafes just to eat.

634
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:49,397
Sexy food.

635
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,106
Can you look into someone for me?

636
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:57,006
(Chicken Center)

637
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:58,577
No, it’s not what you're thinking.

638
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,947
I just want to know how he is

639
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,177
His background, that sort of thing.

640
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:06,987
Yes, anything.

641
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:14,627
Be careful.

642
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:19,727
- How old are you?
- Twenty-three.

643
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:22,397
You're 9 years younger and so rude.

644
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:23,867
What a fossil.

645
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:25,997
You're one to talk, always snooping.

646
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,977
- Did you hear that?
- What if I did?

647
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:33,847
Wait.

648
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:35,677
It's not what you think.

649
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:37,177
And what is it you think I'm thinking?

650
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,887
Technically, kicking me earlier was assault.

651
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:49,596
Criminal Act, Article 260,

652
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:51,797
simple assault...

653
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,267
carries a fine up to 5,000 dollars or...

654
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:54,597
Get lost!

655
00:41:00,337 --> 00:41:02,737
It's not that I'm going to sue you for real.

656
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,077
Go on, sue me.

657
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:11,047
Don't kick a man when he's down.

658
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:13,847
That's just cruel!

659
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:24,257
I'm home.

660
00:41:24,657 --> 00:41:26,267
Hey, is that our Judge Cho?

661
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,196
You're late. Have you eaten?

662
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,497
I'm not hungry.

663
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:32,397
I bought some some salted fermented seafood for you.

664
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,567
Oh, you shouldn't have.

665
00:41:35,707 --> 00:41:38,977
This is from Gangchun...

666
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:41,846
It's not what you think. It was carefully prepared by the owner.

667
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,216
I saw it for myself.

668
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:46,047
Well, if our honourable judge says so, I guess it’s fine.

669
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:48,687
How was your first day?

670
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:51,717
Looks like you had a team dinner? Chicken and beer?

671
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:56,726
- Yes.
- You must be tired.

672
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:58,056
Go wash up and get some rest.

673
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,966
Hey, sit down for a minute.

674
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:01,967
Oh, come on...

675
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:03,596
Please don’t call me that. It’s embarrassing.

676
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:06,167
Who did you take after to be so humble?

677
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:10,636
Top of your class at the police academy.

678
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:11,976
Passed the bar at the youngest age.

679
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:14,447
First among your class to be appointed as a judge, right?

680
00:42:14,947 --> 00:42:17,746
In our whole family,

681
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:19,246
you’re the first judge.

682
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:20,516
Your dad even changed your name

683
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:22,347
in his phone to “Judge Cho.”

684
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:25,056
Why don’t we just change the nameplate on our front gate too?

685
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:26,886
- Should we?
- Dad...

686
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:27,987
All right.

687
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,896
So how’s the work at court?

688
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:30,997
What’d you do today?

689
00:42:31,497 --> 00:42:32,657
Well...

690
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:38,197
I delivered fried chicken.

691
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,737
"Hello, this is the chicken shop.” I took orders...

692
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,277
and packed boxes.

693
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:45,477
Just...

694
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:49,077
worked.

695
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:50,876
If anyone’s giving you a hard time...

696
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:53,147
Here, eat this instead.

697
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:55,517
Even if he told you what he did at court, would you understand?

698
00:42:55,817 --> 00:42:59,287
- Go on, get some rest.
- Sure. Good night.

699
00:43:03,727 --> 00:43:05,596
The hairdresser gave me...

700
00:43:05,597 --> 00:43:07,196
way too much volume.

701
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:09,197
- Why? I think it looks cute.
- I look like an alien.

(Award Certificate)

704
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:18,507
In the end,

705
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:20,747
I still couldn’t tell my parents.

706
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:24,176
That I am a judge who works...

707
00:43:24,177 --> 00:43:25,346
(Chicken Judge)

708
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:27,247
at a fried chicken shop.

709
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:33,057
We will continue to dig deep...

710
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:35,586
and uncover the hidden truths...

711
00:43:35,587 --> 00:43:37,557
buried in our society.

712
00:43:39,257 --> 00:43:40,827
When small voices come together,

713
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:43,097
they can change the world.

714
00:43:43,597 --> 00:43:45,966
Your tips and concerns...

715
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:47,407
are the beginning of that change.

716
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:50,007
We won’t stop...

717
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:53,477
until the truth is no longer hidden.

(On-site Pursuit)

719
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:02,747
Cut!

720
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,087
Great job, everyone.

721
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:06,427
- Good job, everyone.
- Nice job.

722
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:08,727
- Good job.
- Good work.

723
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,827
Sir, someone’s here to see you.

724
00:44:12,957 --> 00:44:14,667
Someone? Who?

725
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:21,667
Did the shoot go well?

726
00:44:21,837 --> 00:44:23,006
Hey, show some respect.

727
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:25,577
This is Producer Kim.

728
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:31,647
While I was reviewing the settlement papers,

729
00:44:31,717 --> 00:44:33,446
something came up that I wanted to ask.

730
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:34,787
I told you I’m not settling.

731
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:37,117
I hear you.

732
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:40,686
How did that container of maggot-filled salted seafood...

733
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:41,957
even get discovered?

734
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:44,057
I saw there were...

735
00:44:44,397 --> 00:44:46,156
more than just one or two containers.

736
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:47,527
We got a tip-off

737
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:49,667
Oh, I see.

738
00:44:49,697 --> 00:44:52,737
Seems like you think only the merchants are the victims here.

739
00:44:53,097 --> 00:44:54,606
But the whistleblower who came forward...

740
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:56,937
they’re a victim too. Emotionally and psychologically.

741
00:44:58,437 --> 00:45:00,877
I guess that’s true.

742
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:02,577
Producer Kim.

743
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:04,916
I actually wanted to ask that whistleblower something.

744
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:06,316
Could you maybe share their contact info?

745
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:07,747
I can't reveal the source. It’s confidential.

746
00:45:08,447 --> 00:45:09,687
Sorry,

747
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:11,456
but under Korean civil and criminal procedure law,

748
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:13,757
there’s no legal protection for journalists to withhold sources.

749
00:45:14,987 --> 00:45:17,227
Hey, what article and clause is that?

750
00:45:17,457 --> 00:45:18,726
- Well...
- Hold on a second

751
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:20,427
So if that info gets brought up...

752
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:23,597
in court anyway, then...

753
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:25,797
Wouldn’t it be better...

754
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:27,366
for all of us to just…

755
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:30,277
settle this peacefully instead?

756
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:32,137
Producer Kim.

757
00:45:32,737 --> 00:45:35,547
How about the network issues...

758
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:39,047
a quick apology broadcast?

759
00:45:40,247 --> 00:45:41,287
Are you trying...

760
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:44,087
to threaten me right now?

761
00:45:44,217 --> 00:45:47,557
That’s a strong word. Not a threat.

762
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:50,357
I meant, a negotiation.

763
00:45:54,827 --> 00:45:56,497
Sorry

764
00:45:58,567 --> 00:45:59,767
Hello, sir.

765
00:46:00,307 --> 00:46:01,367
What?

766
00:46:05,025 --> 00:46:06,354
What happened?

767
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:08,124
Everyone else agreed to settle,

768
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,795
so I went to convince the old lady at her shop.

769
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:11,095
But it was closed.

770
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:13,294
We went to her house because we were worried something happened.

771
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:15,294
She was collapsed in her room, with a pill bottle beside her.

772
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,335
How is she doing?

773
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,635
We pumped her stomach and moved her to a room right away.

774
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:21,034
Thankfully, we found her in time, and she's stable now.

775
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:23,375
The moment she woke up, she asked for you two.

776
00:46:24,505 --> 00:46:28,875
(Gang Chun Hospital)

777
00:46:34,885 --> 00:46:36,225
Why would you do that?

778
00:46:37,485 --> 00:46:39,695
You haven’t even finished...

779
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:42,995
salting that jerk yet.

780
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:03,015
You know this already.

781
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:06,155
Win or lose the trial,

782
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:09,955
things won’t ever go back...

783
00:47:11,655 --> 00:47:13,395
to the way they were.

784
00:47:20,195 --> 00:47:21,265
Let’s just...

785
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:25,605
sign the settlement.

786
00:47:54,395 --> 00:47:56,365
Why did she suddenly give up?

787
00:47:57,705 --> 00:47:59,065
Because of this old lady...

788
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:01,075
nothing ever works out

789
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:04,444
You wait by the car.

790
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:05,474
What about you?

791
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:07,575
I left something in the hospital room.

792
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:11,715
Hello, sir?

793
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,785
Where’s the patient from Room 203?

794
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:15,255
Hold on.

795
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:21,655
Hello, sir.

796
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:23,225
It’s the hospital.

797
00:48:23,925 --> 00:48:25,864
After that big scene yesterday,

798
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:26,995
the old lady took pills.

799
00:48:27,465 --> 00:48:29,665
If she ends up actually dying over this...

800
00:48:31,205 --> 00:48:32,335
Darn...

801
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:36,545
If it comes to that, I’ll bring her seal myself.

802
00:48:50,225 --> 00:48:51,484
Hey, go inside and check.

803
00:48:51,485 --> 00:48:52,525
Yes, sir.

804
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:56,725
Wait...

805
00:48:58,625 --> 00:48:59,635
What?

806
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:01,765
Gosh, what?

807
00:49:04,265 --> 00:49:07,175
(Mr. Kim)

808
00:49:12,705 --> 00:49:13,774
What is it?

809
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:15,214
I'm in the middle of frying chicken.

810
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:16,444
Just get to the point.

811
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:18,915
You said it was just a corner store.

812
00:49:19,115 --> 00:49:22,255
I'm being traced right now.

813
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:25,524
I have to get out of here, okay?

814
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:28,455
Gosh! Hey, these guys are not small-time!

815
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:30,595
Anyway, hey,

816
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:33,335
I've printed out the ledger, so come and get it.

817
00:49:34,065 --> 00:49:35,965
Hey, newbie, get ready for a delivery.

818
00:49:36,065 --> 00:49:37,864
A delivery? Me?

819
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:39,605
What? Did I get fired?

820
00:49:40,505 --> 00:49:42,005
Gosh, you're the worst.

821
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:44,475
Hey, what did I do? I don't want to go either.

822
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:45,605
Read me the address.

823
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:48,045
Sung Chun-gu. Yes.

824
00:49:49,515 --> 00:49:50,615
Yes.

825
00:49:51,685 --> 00:49:53,085
All right. Bye.

826
00:49:56,925 --> 00:49:58,355
Never mind. I'll go.

827
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,195
We won't make the alley in this jam.

828
00:50:01,255 --> 00:50:02,525
Take the shortcut. It's five minutes.

829
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:04,265
A shortcut?

830
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:17,305
Payment accepted.

831
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:37,725
Here.

832
00:50:38,595 --> 00:50:40,035
Si On, wait here.

833
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:50,045
Hey, check the convenience store.

834
00:50:57,115 --> 00:50:59,014
With this, we're even.

835
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,455
Are you ever going to let that go?

836
00:51:01,555 --> 00:51:02,784
- Mr. Shin!
- Yes?

837
00:51:02,785 --> 00:51:04,184
Hurry, Mr. Shin!

838
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:06,855
- What's wrong? What?
- What is it?

839
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,755
Hey, over there!

840
00:51:12,525 --> 00:51:14,665
- That's him, right?
- Yes, that's him.

841
00:51:15,235 --> 00:51:16,364
Found him.

842
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,205
- Si On, I'll drive. Get in back.
- What?

843
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:35,655
Hold on tight.

844
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,225
Hurry up!

845
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:49,665
Cut them off from the side!

846
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:05,384
Darn it!

847
00:52:05,385 --> 00:52:06,515
Get them!

848
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:27,405
- Mr. Shin, this way!
- What?

849
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:32,545
Hey, where are they going?

850
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:36,984
Turn right!

851
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:38,915
Just step on it!

852
00:52:55,865 --> 00:52:57,705
- Mr. Shin! Turn left!
- Right!

853
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:11,085
Darn, what is this?

854
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:13,615
Hey, take this!

855
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,685
- Get this!
- Let's go!

856
00:53:19,585 --> 00:53:20,655
What is this?

857
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:23,964
Hey, I can't see a thing!

858
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:25,565
Hey, go slow,

859
00:53:25,925 --> 00:53:27,495
Lee Si On is the best!

860
00:53:27,895 --> 00:53:29,964
Lee Si On rules!

861
00:53:29,965 --> 00:53:31,505
Si On, you're doing great!

862
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:33,735
You called them here, didn't you, Si On?

863
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:36,605
- Lee Si On!
- You're awesome!

864
00:53:42,475 --> 00:53:45,185
(Chicken Center)

865
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:51,625
Gosh.

866
00:53:52,225 --> 00:53:53,824
I thought we were on a race track earlier.

867
00:53:53,825 --> 00:53:57,325
When did you call your friends?

868
00:53:57,865 --> 00:53:59,165
Back at the convenience store.

869
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,935
They outnumbered us, so I sent out an S.O.S.

870
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:05,805
Hey, you must be hungry. Come in, I'll make you something.

871
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:07,235
Oh, I have to go make a late-night delivery.

872
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:09,774
- What we got done earlier...
- All right.

873
00:54:09,775 --> 00:54:11,275
I'll pay you tenfold.

874
00:54:14,245 --> 00:54:15,715
- Now?
- Yes.

875
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:17,515
Come on. Gosh.

876
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:19,185
All relationships are transactions.

877
00:54:19,615 --> 00:54:21,354
There's no free lunch.

878
00:54:21,355 --> 00:54:22,715
That's how you survive.

879
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,455
And guess who taught me that?

00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:27,195
You did.

881
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:29,225
All right, fine.

882
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:33,695
Here. You've hit your daily target. Mother, you already know.

883
00:54:35,235 --> 00:54:36,335
I exceeded it.

884
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:39,905
Goodness.

885
00:54:40,935 --> 00:54:42,935
- I'm off, boss.
- Drive safe.

Look at these guys.

892
00:55:12,135 --> 00:55:14,975
They planned this two years ago.

893
00:55:16,905 --> 00:55:20,375
"Gangchun Salted Seafood Land Purchase Plan."

894
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:24,145
So they were planning to gobble up the whole thing.

The key money is 10 million dollars.

898
00:55:45,935 --> 00:55:47,704
The purchase price of the store is negotiated separately.

899
00:55:47,705 --> 00:55:49,234
Let's use the market price.

900
00:55:49,235 --> 00:55:50,244
What did you say?

901
00:55:50,245 --> 00:55:52,974
If you don't like it, you can void all the contracts...

903
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:56,415
Are you threatening me?

904
00:55:56,785 --> 00:55:58,384
You're making a mistake.

905
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:00,085
A threat's no good unless it's scary.

906
00:56:00,385 --> 00:56:02,615
This is a negotiation.

907
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:05,485
Think it over and give me a call.

908

- Gosh.

- Oh, gosh.

923
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:54,374
- What is he doing?
- Who does he think he is?

- Sir.
- Goodness, ma'am.

926
00:56:57,075 --> 00:56:59,244
Why would you just stamp this?

927
00:56:59,245 --> 00:57:01,175
The terms of this agreement are total garbage.

928
00:57:01,575 --> 00:57:04,115
We worked so hard on this agreement. Why are you doing this?

929
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:08,315
The specific clauses of this agreement need to be revised.

I was worried you'd already left. Thank goodness.

933

What's going on?

934
00:57:21,235 --> 00:57:23,435
Oh, an officer from the Traffic Division just told us...

935
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:26,365
there's work on the main road.

936
00:57:26,505 --> 00:57:28,005
It's faster if you take local roads.

937
00:57:28,105 --> 00:57:30,005
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

938
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:31,205
Have a safe trip.

939
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:32,845
Thanks.

940
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:42,014
I worked all night on that draft.

941
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:44,485
You should've told me earlier if you didn't like it.

942
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:45,724
Which specific clauses?

943
00:57:45,725 --> 00:57:46,954
What wording do you want to change?

944
00:57:46,955 --> 00:57:49,355
All of it. Give the merchants what they want.

945
00:57:49,455 --> 00:57:52,764
We'll get the apology broadcast, as the original complaint requested.

946
00:57:52,765 --> 00:57:55,765
Do you think Director Kim and the station will ever agree?

947
00:57:55,965 --> 00:57:58,504
A settlement needs mutual consent.

948
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,204
That's the law. From what I can see, this is...

949
00:58:00,205 --> 00:58:01,905
Who does that help?

950
00:58:02,035 --> 00:58:03,775
Are you on our side, or the law's?

951
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:18,125
What is this?

952
00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:23,795
I'm going to do things my way.

953
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,395
If it's wrong, I'll shut it down.

954
00:58:25,595 --> 00:58:27,794
But the livelihoods of the merchants are at stake here!

955
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,965
For someone who got this job through connections, you sure talk a lot.

956
00:58:31,105 --> 00:58:33,775
I'm the boss, Master Shin.

957
00:58:36,205 --> 00:58:37,205
What?

958
00:58:43,685 --> 00:58:45,544
Hey, what's wrong with that truck?

959
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:46,645
It's getting way too close.

960
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:49,485
What?

961
00:59:05,705 --> 00:59:06,705
Hey, get out!

962
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:11,205
The door won't open!

963
00:59:14,745 --> 00:59:16,615
Sir, the train...

964
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:19,015
- What?
- The train...

965
00:59:21,815 --> 00:59:22,815
Hey.

966
00:59:23,785 --> 00:59:26,225
Break the window and get out now!

967
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:40,435
Please...

968
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:48,275
The car behind us moved!

969
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:06,065
Seriously, I’m swamped right now…

970
01:00:07,235 --> 01:00:08,265
What is it now?

971
01:00:08,395 --> 01:00:11,735
I told you, no deliveries before 6pm.

972
01:00:12,065 --> 01:00:13,135
Darn it.

973
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,575
You need to hurry!

974
01:00:18,845 --> 01:00:19,875
Hurry!

975
01:00:26,115 --> 01:00:27,185
Mr. Shin!

976
01:01:16,095 --> 01:01:17,965
Why is it that every bad guy...

977
01:01:18,535 --> 01:01:20,005
pulls the same tricks?

978
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:32,445
I guess...

979
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:35,055
you haven’t heard.

980
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:39,155
I am Mr. Shin!

981
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,095

What’s the plan?

985
01:02:25,435 --> 01:02:26,565
Get ready!

Kkokkio!

987
01:02:30,905 --> 01:02:32,444
They breaks the law every chance they get,

988
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:34,375
but they show no sign of guilt...

989
01:02:34,515 --> 01:02:37,215
I’d like a background check on this guy.

990
01:02:38,985 --> 01:02:40,614
There must be a reason he’s doing all this.

991
01:02:40,615 --> 01:02:42,285
We’re in a hurry. Move!

992
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:45,425
We’re going to make them pay triple the pain.

993
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:48,755
From now on, you’re negotiating with me.
