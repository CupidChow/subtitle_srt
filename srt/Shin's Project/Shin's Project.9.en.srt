(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:04,593
When money was wired to Yun Dong Hee, an incident occurred.

5
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,363
I'll be waiting, so please be sure to call me.

6
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,003
A psychiatrist...

7
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,403
jumped to his death from her apartment.

8
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:14,573
- And who was that doctor?
- Yun Dong Hee's personal physician.

9
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:16,803
Lawyer Cho Pillip!

10
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,013
Mo Sun Mi?

11
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:19,313
This time...

12
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:21,883
I really want to help Sun Mi.

13
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:24,383
Pillip. Your hunch was right.

14
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,383
So go for it. I'll have your back.

15
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,183
I have a favour to ask you.

16
00:01:30,353 --> 00:01:34,463
That's for you to find out now. What danger Mr. Shin is involved in.

17
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:37,763
Every time money gets deposited into Yun Dong Hee's account,

18
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,393
someone is going to lose their life.

19
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:42,803
There's something I wanted to ask you.

20
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,803
Move!

21
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:48,043
I must find him before the police do.

22
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:49,743
Open the door, you punk!

23
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:55,713
Mr. Shin.

24
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:59,253
Before Yun Dong Hee's doctor died, the last person she spoke with...

25
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,953
was the director of the director of Federal Medical Center.

26
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:03,983
The hospital director?

27
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:08,793
He's behind Yun Dong Hee's release, or he's the next target.

28
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:13,133
What's your theory, Detective Choi?

29
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:16,103
That's why I'm going to meet him in person.

30
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,453
Hey, I got the director's address.

31
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:47,293
Excuse me.

32
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:48,733
Can you hear me?

33
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,273
Open the door, you punk!

34
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,503
Open up, you punk!

35
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,253
Vehicle 6645 has now entered the Bukbu Interchange.

36
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,063
Moving into the right lane.

37
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:21,363
Approaching from behind to intercept.

38
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:34,113
Team 1 is at the Bukbu Tollgate. Moving in to provide rear support.

39
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,233
Darn it.

40
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,933
Okay.

41
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:08,643
Hey!

42
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,293
Hey, you there.

43
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:24,993
Are you okay?

44
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:34,773
Yun Dong Hee.

00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:52,793
(Episode 9)

47
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:58,863
Sir, try to stay with me. Okay? Sir.

(Paramedics)

50
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,443
Abdominal stab wound. There was significant blood loss.

51
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,013
There could also be retroperitoneal damage.

52
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:16,743
Prep an OR and get him a CT.

53
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:19,383
- Are you with General Surgery?
- No, Neuropsychiatry.

54
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,833
(Operation Room)

55
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:44,773
Director.

56
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:48,183
I'm sorry, we lost him.

57
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:50,013
No, please. I'm the one who should be sorry.

58
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,983
The detective took the knife for me.

59
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:54,583
We will catch him. I promise.

60
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,883
But about Yun Dong Hee...

61
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,293
How would he have known where you live, Director?

62
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,363
I have no idea how he knew.

63
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:06,363
- Did he say anything to you?
- It all happened...

64
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,033
so fast.

65
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:11,903
We've arranged for your protection. There are officers waiting outside.

66
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,903
- Thank you.
- Of course.

67
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:27,253
- How is Detective Choi?
- He's in surgery right now.

68
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,753
We'll have to see how his recovery goes.

69
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,853
You're Director Lee Heo Jun, right?

70
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,523
Yes, I am.

71
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,693
I have something to ask you.

72
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:40,963
Why would Yun Dong Hee want you dead with so many witnesses around?

73
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:42,463
Excuse me, but...

74
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:46,133
who are you? You don't look like a cop.

75
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,303
Fifteen years ago...

76
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,043
I lost my son to Yun Dong Hee.

77
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,483
I am so sorry.

78
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,883
I take full responsibility for my failure to manage the inmates.

79
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,583
About you and Yun Dong Hee,

80
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,453
how long have you known each other?

81
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,163
We have no personal connection.

82
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:14,863
It's just that some patients feel anger and resentment.

83
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:17,263
And they may express that...

84
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:22,073
in irrational, bizarre, and violent ways.

85
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:26,773
Can you really call stabbing someone 'bizarre'?

86
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:35,753
I meant that some patients express their feelings in a distorted way.

87
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:43,693
- Is that so?
- I have a question for you.

88
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:49,363
Did you know Yun Dong Hee was going to be there?

89
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,303
No. I went because I was curious.

90
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:54,403
About what?

91
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:55,943
Detective Choi said...

92
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:59,773
the last person to speak with Yun Dong Hee's personal physician...

93
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,883
was either the mastermind or his target.

94
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,053
So I went there to find out which it was.

95
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:15,363
Are you saying you looked into my call history?

96
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:16,593
No.

97
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:18,693
I found out by chance.

98
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,603
You think I'm the one behind him?

99
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,973
I find that accusation deeply unfair,

100
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:32,973
but did you find the answer you were looking for?

101
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,883
I apologise if I was out of line.

102
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,783
Doctor...

103
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,723
The surgery was a success.

104
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:47,593
The wound is deep, but fortunately, his internal organs weren't damaged.

105
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,623
- Thank you.
- It's not life-threatening, right?

106
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:51,733
Right.

107
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:56,603
Are you sure?

108
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,133
No money was deposited into Yun Dong Hee's account today?

109
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,973
I told you, there was nothing! Why?

110
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:03,343
Did another "accident" happen and that caused someone to die?

111
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:06,643
Yun Dong Hee showed up with a knife himself.

112
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,903
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable...

113
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:48,013
- Are you okay?
- Detective Choi.

114
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,323
No, no, don't move.

115
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:54,053
He's behind Yun Dong Hee's release, or he's the next target.

116
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,263
You think I'm the one behind him?

117
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,493
I find that accusation deeply unfair,

118
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,263
but did you find the answer you were looking for?

119
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,843
(Boss Kim)

120
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,253
Hello.

121
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,383
Yes, sir. I've got the package ready for you.

122
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,993
It's been a while since we've been in touch.

123
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:31,123
And he hasn't been to work in a long time, either.

124
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,893
Hold on a second.

125
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:40,973
The number you have dialled is not in service.

126
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:48,583
He changed his number. Looks like he took off for good.

127
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,383
Doo Dong Seok?

128
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:57,283
Yes, he changed his number. I was wondering if you have it.

129
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,123
Sorry, I don't.

130
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:02,063
By the way, is Lawyer Doo's suspension over?

131
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,023
Suspension?

132
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:07,833
Lawyer Doo's suspension was lifted back in January.

133
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,563
January...

134
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,533
So he hid his suspension and got a job as a legal consultant.

135
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,973
(Chicken Center)

136
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:22,983
"As independent, equal partners, working hours are flexible...

137
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:25,753
and are not subject to penalties for absence or tardiness."

138
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,113
We were hit with tons of penalties.

139
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:30,083
We paid late fees and had our pay cut.

140
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:31,993
- That's right.
- What about this part?

141
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:34,823
"Maintain dress code and cleanliness."

142
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:38,333
He made us clean like maniacs, wiping down every single dumbbell,

143
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,593
and he'd lose it if there was even a fingerprint on the mirrors.

144
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,533
And you were penalized for this?

145
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:46,573
Yes. If we were late, we had to pay an extra late fee.

146
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,103
There it is.

147
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:51,473
Giving you direct orders about your work hours...

148
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,543
and then penalizing you for not following them...

149
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:56,383
proves he treated you as employees and gave you orders.

150
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:59,683
If we sue, a court will likely recognise you as employees.

151
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:00,683
I see.

152
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:02,823
They tried to pull a fast one and it backfired on them.

153
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,383
Nice.

154
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,823
But how long will it take?

155
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,493
We should see some results within a year.

156
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,033
A year? We're owed six months' back pay.

157
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:16,633
I can't wait that long.

158
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:19,633
I don't have the energy or the luxury to wait.

159
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:22,673
Hold on. Pillip!

160
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,373
Come on, is there any other way?

161
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:28,173
Come on, some other article or clause in the law books.

162
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,683
How about this?

163
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:41,893
Sun Mi.

164
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,593
What are you doing here all alone?

165
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,503
So much for Bali. Look where I ended up.

166
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,773
I haven't had a drink in forever.

167
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:57,603
So why do you want to go to Bali?

168
00:13:00,773 --> 00:13:03,043
Because it's so suffocating here.

169
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:07,053
I thought things would get better if I just kept working.

170
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:10,523
I kept telling myself it'd be okay if I just held on, but...

171
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:14,153
when I look back, I was just getting pushed around and worn down...

172
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,923
and I had nothing left to show for it.

173
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:22,933
And before I knew it,

174
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,433
I'd completely forgotten what I really wanted to do.

175
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,003
I know what you mean.

176
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:31,203
For me too, up until just recently,

177
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:35,343
what I wanted to do didn't matter at all.

178
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:46,253
That's why I was so grateful to Lawyer Cho.

179
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:48,463
Why is that?

180
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:53,563
He told me that being pushed around isn't something you have to accept.

181
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,573
Getting our staff all their back pay.

182
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,973
Keeping my promise to our members.

183
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:05,743
And after all that, I'm going to figure out...

184
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:07,613
what I really want to do.

185
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,253
Get home safe.

186
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:19,893
Looks like you've got plans.

187
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:23,293
Yes. I've got a curfew.

188
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,503
- Take care.
- Thanks for dinner.

189
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:32,703
- See you next time.
- I'll be in touch.

190
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:41,643
What is it?

191
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,633
What do you think you're doing?

192
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,703
I know you have no appetite, but please eat.

193
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,943
You lost so much blood. You need to eat to get your strength.

194
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:13,613
Hey, my blood is boiling right now as it is.

195
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,553
Besides, I got stabbed in the gut, not my hands. I can feed myself.

196
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:19,953
Stop that.

197
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,123
Still no luck finding Yun Dong Hee's car?

198
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:27,153
Don't even ask. The Team Leader said it's personal,

199
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:28,293
so he's out looking for him himself.

200
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:31,093
But they tracked the traffic CCTVs, right?

201
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,233
They lost the trail at an intersection.

202
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,663
I was in the situation room...

203
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,363
and then I came to bring you your meal.

204
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,673
Why would you be the one to bring my...

205
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:43,373
Hey! I'll eat on my own,

206
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,673
so you go and give me a status report or something.

207
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:48,743
I can't do that. Team Leader said until you've eaten,

208
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:52,583
- I'm to stay by your side.
- Go stand there. You're hovering.

209
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:55,013
Just have a little bit. Please?

210
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,623
Mr. Shin.

211
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:03,023
Hey, could you step outside for a minute?

212
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:04,693
Yes, sir.

213
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:13,333
- How are you feeling?
- It's been a wake-up call.

214
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,003
I'm furious I let that jerk get away right in front of me,

215
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,343
and it's humiliating that I got hurt. Darn it.

216
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:21,373
I'm so sorry.

217
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,843
I feel like I pushed you into it,

218
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,883
and that's why you got hurt, Detective Choi.

219
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:28,923
No, that's not it at all.

220
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:32,623
A cop's job is to catch criminals. It's just what we do.

221
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:37,563
Now I have a personal reason to chase him to the end of the earth.

222
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,163
Detective Choi, I looked into it,

223
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:44,933
and there were no payments made to Yun Dong Hee this time.

224
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:46,733
That's weird.

225
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,673
So it wasn't a hit job this time.

226
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,573
He acted on his own?

227
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,243
Detective Choi.

228
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,983
On October 11th and November 11th, 2009,

229
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,713
did something happen?

230
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,583
(Death of Han Ji Young, October 11th, 2009)

231
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,593
Ji Young!

232
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,093

233
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:16,763
(Death of Lee Han Jun, November 11th, 2009)

234
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:35,423
His blood and tox screen were clean. Nothing out of the ordinary.

235
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,293
He was there on the day Han Ji Young died.

236
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:54,433
Lee Han Jun was at a soup restaurant right before his accident.

237
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:57,873
If you look here, you see this guy, right?

238
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,943
And...

239
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,913
On the day Han Ji Young died. Look at this.

240
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:04,143
It's the same guy.

241
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:05,853
Who is he?

242
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:07,813
Yun Dong Hee.

243
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,453
Do you...

244
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:14,523
know who these people are?

245
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,133
I've never seen them before.

246
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,703
Both cases were ruled accidental deaths,

247
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,873
but to me, they're still cold cases.

248
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,173
The same goes for Cha So Yeon's case.

249
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:37,983
- Are the three of them connected?
- I looked into it,

250
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:41,153
and Cha So Yeon has no connection to the other two.

251
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:42,753
But I'm certain...

252
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:45,393
there's something more to it.

(If the shoe-seller comes, I'll buy you a pair)

257
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,253
I figured you might need some tools, so I had my boys bring some over.

258

Use them as you please.

259
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,723
- Hey.
- Yes, Mr. Shin.

260
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:53,223
Let's say someone gives you about a million bucks...

261
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:56,663
and asks you to take someone out. What would you do?

262
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,023
A million bucks?

263
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,693
For that much, I'd wipe them off the face of the earth.

264
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:02,263
Of course, I'm out of the game now,

265
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:05,003
but for a million bucks, I might reconsider.

266
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,833
So, do you think...

267
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,643
a guy who was paid for killing people...

268
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:12,243
would do a job like that for free?

269
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,243
But then again, who would do business at a loss?

270
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:16,843
To be blunt,

271
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:19,113
Getting involved will cause you trouble...

272
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:20,283
and ruin your entire business.

273
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,583
In that case, it's usually...

274
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:27,193
either I wanted to kill him myself, or I messed up. One of the two.

275
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:29,923
So it is about the money, right?

276
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,963
In capitalism, money can do anything.

277
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,733
For a million bucks? Even more so.

Hey, I thought you said you weren't going to sue.

290
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:41,493
I'm not. What good would suing do me?

291
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,363
Even with a fast-tracked trial, it would still take over a year.

- Then what?
- I have to get my back pay first.

313

to his wife's account,

315

but starting this January, he switched it to his own account.

- A link?

You said he gets a coded text every time a deposit is made, right?

343
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,343
I suppose I can send one, but do you think he'll even read it?

344
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:13,653
It seems like he only checks certain messages.

345
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,083
Just send one for me.

00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,453
With the same code.

347
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:18,983
So when he clicks it, my message will pop up.

349
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:23,863

00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,893
- Where are you going?
- To meet someone.

356
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:58,723
Boss Kim...

357
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,593
Boss Kim...

358
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:02,933
He's a construction contractor and used to be a gangster.

359
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:14,913
What is he giving him?

360
00:25:23,223 --> 00:25:24,383
The machines are gone?

361
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,423
What are you talking about?

362
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,693
Hey, who would steal something that heavy?

363
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:35,163
I'm telling you, it's true.

364
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:38,403
You sure they're not just skimming and lying about it?

365
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:41,173
We dealt with them when we sold the first branch's machines.

366
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,173
I'm telling you, I already went to their warehouse and checked.

367
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:45,173
Then who took them?

368
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:48,613
Hey, that's 30 grand we're talking about! 30 grand!

369
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:51,343
Seriously, why is your second branch always causing problems?

370
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,213
I'm sorry, sir.

371
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:56,223
Unbelievable.

372
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,173
What is he giving him?

373
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:23,213
- What's this key for?
- Remember when we went to the gym?

374
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:27,813
You saw the gear's price list, right? And the QR stickers?

375
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:29,423
That's how I figured it out.

376
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,023
Hey, Boss Kim.

377
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,193
Are your guys still good at flexing their muscles?

378
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:36,593
Man, don't even get me started.

379
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,963
When my guys bowl, they shatter pins.

380
00:26:39,963 --> 00:26:41,693
When they play ball, they break bats.

381
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,333
All the boys are former athletes.

382
00:26:45,463 --> 00:26:47,403
Boss, we're ready.

383
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,773
All right, get it done.

384
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,503
- Let's go, move it.
- Yes, sir.

385
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,283
What is wrong?

386
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,193
We're here for the gear, but it's gone.

387
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,223
Did you sell it to someone else?

388
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:13,533
The door won't even open. What's he talking about?

389
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,693
I'm telling you, come and see for yourself.

390
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,463
You're the one who took the gym gear?

391
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:21,833
I got there first and took it.

392
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:25,343
If I hadn't, the secondhand dealer would've taken it.

393
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,913
If we sell it, for the trainers who came with Mo Sun Mi,

394
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:31,043
it'll cover their salaries for a few months.

395
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:32,853
But that's stealing.

396
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:36,923
No! If I hadn't, Doo Dong Seok would have kept it.

397
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,023
And you think that jerk would've sold it...

398
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,393
and used the money to pay the employees their back wages?

399
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,833
It's your call, Pillip.

400
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,603
You can either give it back to those con artists...

401
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:53,073
or sell it and pay the staff.

402
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,753
Right. What they're doing is illegal, so...

403
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,953
But it's stolen property.

404
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:12,053
It's stolen property.

405
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:17,293
But if I sell it, I could pay some wages, right?

406
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,593
But am I even allowed to sell it?

407
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,503
It's stolen property. But I could pay off the wages.

408
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:25,763
But that would make me a criminal too.

409
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:32,403
I don't know!

410
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:34,973
I don't know!

411
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:47,023
And you think that jerk would've sold it...

412
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:49,693
and used the money to pay the employees their back wages?

413
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:52,593
It's your call, Pillip.

414
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:55,393
You can either give it back to those con artists...

415
00:28:55,863 --> 00:28:57,463
or sell it and pay the staff.

416
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:06,673
Hello, is this the place that buys used gym equipment?

417
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:09,883
(Welcome, CEO Charles Hong)

418
00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:18,583
- Si On.
- I'm startled.

419
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,893
Mr, Shin.

420
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:22,423
What are you doing here?

421
00:29:23,323 --> 00:29:25,323
I wanted to see what this Charles Hong guy looks like.

422
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,993
A boss taking vacations abroad with his employees' wages...

423
00:29:28,993 --> 00:29:31,563
must have some serious nerve, don't you think?

424
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:36,303
- You were worried, weren't you?
- No.

425
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:39,143
Of all of us, you're the one I worry about the least.

426
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:45,143
I was a little intimidated, but I'm glad you're here now.

427
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:48,753
The airport is so much bigger than I expected.

428
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:50,723
And there are tons of people.

429
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,753
They can't all be here to catch a flight, right?

430
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:55,953
We're not here to catch a flight either.

431
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:00,093
Si On. We should come back to fly next time...

432
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,233
with Ye On.

433
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,033
I'd love that.

434
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,033
- Oh!
- What?

435
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:09,303
There he is.

436
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,113
(Welcome, CEO Charles Hong)

437
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:17,883
Dong Seok sent you, I take it?

438
00:30:19,143 --> 00:30:20,713
You're CEO Charles Hong, right?

439
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,653
Yes, I am.

440
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,123
I'm Charles Hong.

441
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:29,393
Seriously...

442
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:30,963
And you are?

443
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,293
Is this the pushover Doo Dong Seok was talking about?

444
00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:36,263
Pushover?

445
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,263
Not a pushover. Then what was it? A figurehead?

446
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:43,343
- What?
- Your so-called legal adviser...

447
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:47,973
breaks the law, committing fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust.

448
00:30:48,773 --> 00:30:50,183
Did you know about that?

449
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:54,583
Who are you accusing of these crimes?

450
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:55,653
He is definitely a pushover.

451
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,083
Manager Lee.

452
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,283
- Yes, sir.
- You brought the documents, right?

453
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:00,423
Of course.

454
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,263
You think you're getting these for free?

455
00:31:08,363 --> 00:31:13,003
- So, what do you want from me?
- Let's have a word.

456
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,481
So...

457
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,921
What exactly did Dong Seok skim off the top?

458
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:30,791
It says right here. Acted as an unlicensed legal advisor,

459
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:34,991
siphoned off money for unpaid wages, and skimmed the holiday bonuses.

460
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,861
And when he sold the gym equipment, he skimmed a commission off the top.

461
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,871
You're making a big deal out of chump change.

462
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,471
What a pushover.

463
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:47,741
You'll be flooded with lawsuits for embezzlement and whatnot.

464
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,711
Yes, right. You can go to jail over a few bucks.

465
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:52,381
And pay your debt by doing time.

466
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,011
Jail? You mean actual jail?

467
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:56,151
Why me?

468
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:57,921
If you do the crime, you do the time.

469
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,321
You totally lied to your employees about the Bali Branch.

470
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:01,651
What Bali Branch?

471
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:04,161
You strung them along, saying they'd be the manager of the Bali Branch!

472
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:05,491
Don't talk to me so casually.

473
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:09,831
- That son of a...
- Look, there is no Bali Branch,

474
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,361
so how could they be the manager?

475
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:17,271
Dong Seok just said Bali was great, so I went there on vacation.

476
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:21,041
Look at this sucker. Just look at him.

477
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:24,511
Dong Seok really screwed you over.

478
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:28,911
And Doo Dong Seok also bought a 3 million dollar house in Gangnam.

479
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:31,251
- All in cash.
- Three million dollars?

480
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:33,051
- Yes.
- Three million dollars?

481
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,991
You didn't even know that?

482
00:32:39,461 --> 00:32:41,231
You're the king of all suckers.

483
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:49,171
Do you know where Doo Dong Seok is right now?

484
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:53,671
Come on.

485
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,441
Hey! You...

486
00:32:58,511 --> 00:32:59,511
What are you doing here?

487
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:07,891
- Going on a trip?
- What? Why are you here?

488
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:11,861
Why do you think? I'm here to permanently disbar you.

489
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:15,961
Permanently disbarred? Don't give me that crap.

490
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,931
Hey, are you trying to threaten me?

491
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,331
You can't touch me legally.

492
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:23,901
That Mo Sun Mi girl? I gave her money.

493
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:27,441
And just in case, I even got her to sign a receipt.

494
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:30,481
Yes. You gave her one month's pay and called it the full amount.

495
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,941
And used legalese to pass it off as full payment?

496
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:36,451
You...

497
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:40,521
seem to think you're pretty clever.

498
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:42,151
So, where should I start?

499
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:44,691
- What?
- How about unlicensed practice?

500
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:46,861
Violating labour laws?

501
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:49,301
Or how about embezzling company funds behind the CEO's back?

502
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,361
Come on...

503
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:53,071
Get in the car. Let's talk in there.

504
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,001
No way! Why would I get in a criminal's car?

505
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:57,541
Criminal? There's no criminal...

506
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:00,171
- Isn't that Mr. Doo, the lawyer?
- Yes, that's him.

507
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,941
Yes, hello. Please, go on in. Yes.

508
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:07,451
- What do you think you're doing?
- Help! A lawyer's kidnapping me!

509
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:09,951
- Who? Who's kidnapping someone?
- Sir.

510
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:11,481
- Yes?
- Should we call the police?

511
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:13,621
No, no, it's all right. Please, just go on inside. Go on.

512
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:16,021
My friend here just has a really loud voice.

513
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:19,021
Why are you doing this to me?

514
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:20,761
Unbelievable.

515
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:26,971
Hey.

516
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:32,141
You can't use this in court anyway. It's inadmissible.

517
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,011
And what? Embezzlement?

518
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:37,781
Charles is the one who authorized that.

519
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:39,181
You don't even know what you're talking about!

520
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:41,011
Who said anything about using it in court?

521
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:44,181
This kind of thing is usually used for...

522
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:48,291
Whistleblowing, sowing discord, public humiliation.

523
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,961
In a word, complete social ruin.

524
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,791
Pillip, why are you doing this to me?

525
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:56,531
First, sign here, and pay the employees their back pay.

526
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:59,231
Do that, and maybe I'll cut you some slack.

527
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:02,571
- But if you don't...
- So what if I don't? What then?

528
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:08,771
- Jenny.
- Daddy!

529
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,681
Oh, there's my girl. Oh, my goodness.

530
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:14,081
- You have fun at preschool today?
- Yes.

531
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,521
- Aren't you a cutie?
- So you must be Jenny.

532
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,621
Hey, you big sucker.

533
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:30,101
If it were me, first thing I'd do is chop off his hand.

534
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,301
That's the hand he used to steal your identity...

535
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:35,201
and forged all kinds of documents.

536
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:37,671
Are you threatening me?

537
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:41,841
A threat is what might happen. I'm telling you what will happen.

538
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:44,341
You want me to tell you what happens next?

539
00:35:46,151 --> 00:35:48,151
Keep going. This is getting interesting.

540
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:51,481
Your cards will be cancelled, accounts frozen, and charges filed.

541
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,521
I'll post in your building group chat.

542
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:57,021
"The Scumbag Lawyer in Unit 1103."

543
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,591
Your kid at preschool...

544
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:02,801
and your wife will be the talk of the town.

545
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:05,901
She might even ask for a divorce.

546
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,901
There's nothing to even think about, man.

547
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,611
Either you go down with Dong Seok,

548
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:16,481
or you crawl your way out of this mess alone.

549
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,181
Or you can just sign.

550
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:20,851
I'll give you three minutes.

551
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:28,291
(Three Minutes)

552
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,161
You're running out of time.

553
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:34,761
- Two minutes, 30 seconds.
- Oh, come on.

554
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,201
Daddy's sorry.

555
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:45,641
Excuse me...

556
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:47,171
I'm here to turn myself in.

557
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:50,741
(Police)

558
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:52,751
I'm here to turn myself in.

559
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,691
The other instructors got paid too. Thank you so much.

560
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:05,421
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

561
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:06,731
This is so great.

562
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:10,701
So the store manager and that lawyer will be punished, right?

563
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:13,201
The sentence for withholding wages is pretty light.

564
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:17,241
He paid it all back and surrendered, so they'll probably go easy on him.

565
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,371
But wait,

566
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:21,211
But we just barely got the money we were owed.

567
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:23,381
And on top of that, we lost our jobs.

568
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,381
Then why do they get off so easy?

569
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:28,551
That's just how the law works.

570
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,851
That's what Doo Dong Seok was counting on.

571
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:36,121
That's why I had to get a little creative.

572
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,361
It takes a legal thug to catch an evil lawyer,

573
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:40,691
and that's me.

574
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:42,701
The wages you all just received...

575
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,631
I squeezed them out of Doo Dong Seok himself.

576
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,331
Really?

577
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:49,771
Thank you.

578
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:53,211
- You're exactly what you described.
- Thank you.

579
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,311
They're quite similar.

580
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:58,341
Officer, as you can see,

581
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,811
all of this was all Charles Hong's plan. I just...

582
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:04,081
What do you mean I did it all, you jerk!

583
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,151
- Get out here!
- Hey...

584
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:09,991
Hey! You spent my 3 million dollars on a house,

585
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:12,191
and now you're trying to pin it all on me?

586
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:14,661
- You jerk!
- Grab him! Grab him!

587
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,231
- Let me go!
- Sir, please calm down.

588
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:17,901
- Stop it, sir.
- Let go!

589
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:21,131
Get over here. Get over here, you jerk.

590
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,801
Wait, hold on! What's this?

591
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:25,301
- No, don't do it.
- What is this?

592
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:27,771
Don't! Stop it! Please, don't. Anything but this...

593
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:30,641
You!

594
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:34,851
Is your life all about lies and getting high, you jerk?

595
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:36,681
You punk!

596
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,451
Hey! I've had enough of this too!

597
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:48,461
Mister!

598
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:52,331
I've filed for fraud and embezzlement against him.

599
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:56,271
The evidence and the complaint are in that yellow envelope.

600
00:38:56,341 --> 00:38:59,441
Evidence? Hey, what kind of evidence? You filed a complaint?

601
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,171
You think I wrote it myself, you idiot?

602
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:05,981
Someone much smarter than you wrote it. You darn con artist!

603
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,681
You darn junkie!

604
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:12,751
- You thug, Cho Pillip!
- You're the thug, you jerk!

605
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:16,121
And I'm submitting this as evidence too.

606
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:20,491
He must have bought this with my money. This jerk.

607
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:22,361
Look at him. He just can't quit.

608
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:25,931
I've never seen a jerk like this. Just working out.

609
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:29,201
(Labour Without Discrimination, Starting Now)

610
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:36,211
My goodness.

611
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,341
I'll help you bring it down, so you just need to finish the lift.

612
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,881
Wait, you'll help me? Shouldn't I be doing it myself?

613
00:39:40,951 --> 00:39:42,481
And exhale.

614
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,821
All right, good.

615
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:46,291
Four.

616
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:49,691
With all you trainers here, it feels just like being at the gym.

617
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:52,061
I was upset that the gym closed,

618
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:54,261
but I prefer working out outside now.

619
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:57,061
I'm so grateful to you all for your trust and patience.

620
00:39:57,531 --> 00:40:00,731
So, what are we signing for?

621
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,971
It's to protect employee rights and contracted labourers...

622
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,711
Hate working and not getting paid? This is a law to stop that.

623
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:10,441
Because the powerless have no one to help them when they're cheated.

624
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,351
It's to make sure people get paid for the work they do.

625
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,481
That's wonderful. We absolutely need a law like this.

626
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:17,851
Come on, let's sign.

627
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:20,121
- Here you go.
- So Yeong!

628
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:22,391
- Am I cool?
- Come sign this.

629
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:23,461
Yes, of course.

630
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,891
- Look at this crowd. Hello.
- Hey, you made it.

631
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:28,961
Hey, Si On.

632
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:30,331
Hello. the lady is here too.

633
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:31,531
Hey, thanks for all your hard work.

634
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:35,071
- So this is Mangheon City Park Gym?
- You're here.

635
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:36,201
Hello.

636
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,711
I noticed during your trial that your core is incredibly weak.

637
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:41,211
Who, me?

638
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:43,111
He must be the one.

639
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:47,111
Obviously, it's you. How strong can your tiny waist be?

640
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,581
I seem to recall you two being pretty similar.

641
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:50,821
What's that supposed to mean?

642
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,421
I'm not even married yet.

643
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:56,161
That's my point. An unmarried man with a weak core?

644
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,291
Why'd you hit me? I'm telling you, it's still in mint condition.

645
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:59,761
Mint condition? Yes, right.

646
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:01,161
Come on over here.

647
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:03,361
Let's focus on the core exercises today.

648
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:06,501
You've got a real knack for escalating things.

649
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,741
The citizens enjoy free training,

650
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:14,271
and the trainers get protected. It's a win-win.

651
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,681
- I heard you sold the equipment.
- They first offered 30,000 dollars,

652
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,281
but I sold it for 32,000 dollars.

653
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:23,421
Didn't you just say it was stolen? I thought you didn't deal with that.

654
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,751
It wasn't illegal. I got the ownership papers first.

655
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,351
Same difference.

656
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:32,591
And you "legally" blackmailed him into signing those papers.

657
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:33,961
Blackmail?

658
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:37,901
It's a negotiation technique for steering their choice.

659
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,101
Without forcing their hand,

660
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:43,871
you make them choose the path you've already laid out.

661
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:46,671
How did you figure that out?

662
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,781
It's not just a basic tactic, it's an advanced one.

663
00:41:56,951 --> 00:41:58,621
- See? I was right, wasn't I?
- What?

664
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:00,221
I'm telling you, he's a carbon copy of you.

665
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:02,591
He's just as smug about it, too.

666
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:06,231
"I guess you haven't heard of me. I'm Cho Philip".

667
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,491
Oh, really? Is that what he said?

668
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,461
Anyone who hasn't signed yet?

669
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:22,111
They're workers in name only. They do the work of an employee,

670
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:24,441
- but receive none of the benefits.
- Hello.

671
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:26,781
- Freelancers, gig workers, - Please take a look and sign this.

672
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:30,451
And other independent contractors. Lee Seung Eun has the story.

673
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:33,251
Oh! There it is. It's on.

674
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,121
The gym trainers who recently had their wages withheld...

675
00:42:36,191 --> 00:42:39,521
have been helping people with their workouts...

676
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,731
to protect the rights and interests of workers and service providers...

677
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,261
while petitioning for a revised ordinance.

678
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:46,601
(Proposed Ordinance for Maheon Workers and Service Providers)

679
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:50,971
This ordinance covers freelancers and gig workers...

680
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:54,041
What right do you have to speak for the citizens at City Hall?

681
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:58,311
I went to meet Councilman Kwon. Of course I had to be the one to go.

682
00:42:58,381 --> 00:43:00,881
Would Kwon Bong Geun have been elected if it weren't for me?

683
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,221
He represents the city, and I represent the citizens.

684
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,751
Look.

685
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:11,961
- You actually changed the law?
- Not that I couldn't do it too.

686
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:15,961
- That's actually pretty cool.
- And you're really photogenic.

687
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:18,101
Whatever.

688
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:45,291
See if someone's waiting downstairs.

689
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:51,561
What's going on?

690
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:53,831
Ji Woo's phone is off.

691
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,401
This has never happened before.

692
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:59,401
What about her dorm? Have you contacted her friends?

693
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:02,741
I can't reach her best friend, and she's not at her dorm.

694
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:05,081
It's the middle of the day, so she should be in class, but...

695
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:07,411
her exams ended last week,

696
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:09,581
and she said she was taking this week off.

697
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:12,051
I'm so sorry.

698
00:44:12,451 --> 00:44:15,051
- I'm sorry to bother you again...
- No, no. You did the right thing.

699
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,261
I'm glad Manager Bae called me.

700
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:20,191
How long has Ji Woo's phone been off?

701
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:25,501
I first tried calling five hours ago. We spoke last night before bed,

702
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:27,601
so I think it's been off since this morning.

703
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:29,431
Has this ever happened before?

704
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:32,571
No.

705
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,071
She's missed my calls before, but...

706
00:44:40,851 --> 00:44:41,851
Ji Woo?

707
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,221
What happened?

708
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:46,721
Is something wrong?

709
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:50,221
Mom, I'm sorry. I forgot to charge my phone,

710
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,221
and didn't even realise it had died.

711
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:53,991
Kim Ji Woo.

712
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,961
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

713
00:44:56,031 --> 00:45:00,931
I was out with Estelle. Her phone was dead too, so we couldn't.

714
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:05,501
You two are unbelievable. I'll call you back later. Bye.

715
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:14,411
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be. I'm glad she's okay.

716
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:33,201
What are you doing here?

717
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:35,571
What I do here is none of your business.

718
00:45:36,771 --> 00:45:38,071
What do you mean, it's none of our business?

719
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,341
- You've spied on me.
- I wasn't spying on you.

720
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,741
- Come with me.
- Get off me, you jerk!

721
00:45:47,651 --> 00:45:52,281
You're making a scene. Manager Bae, give our friend here a little shot.

722
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:56,921
- A shot? What kind of shot?
- One that'll shut you up.

723
00:45:57,491 --> 00:45:59,521
My friend here is very good with needles.

724
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:01,691
Want a strong one?

725
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:10,671
I'm going to kill that jerk today and then turn myself in.

726
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,171
The feeling's mutual.

727
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:14,911
Hey, once I find my item, I'll not come back here.

728
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:16,311
Your item?

729
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:20,751
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

730
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:24,121
Something urgent has come up, so I'm afraid I have to close.

731
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:31,421
What's in this?

732
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:34,261
What's it to you? What are you going to do?

733
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:36,901
This is my meal ticket.

734
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,931
Kim Yong Woo. How could you harm your kid's doll?

735
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,901
- She almost died because of that!
- Did she?

736
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,201
But she didn't!

737
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:49,841
You said this guy saved her. All I need is my item, and I'm done.

738
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:52,281
How much is this worth?

739
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:57,151
A few hundred grand?

740
00:46:57,421 --> 00:46:58,651
That money. Who's paying you?

741
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:02,251
- So what if they are?
- I'm asking who you have dirt on.

742
00:47:02,621 --> 00:47:07,261
You're sharp. How'd you figure out it was blackmail?

743
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:10,001
Let's keep this simple.

744
00:47:10,101 --> 00:47:13,331
Once I find my item, I'll not come back here.

745
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,201
You really think that item is still here?

746
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:19,911
- What?
- Lay low and stay out of sight.

747
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:24,341
If I catch you hanging around, I'll hand you right over to them.

748
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,851
Do you even know who "they" are to be making threats?

749
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:33,591
I'll handle that my way.

750
00:47:34,591 --> 00:47:36,051
How about a shot before you go?

751
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:37,361
Manager Bae.

752
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:39,961
Seriously... Back off.

753
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:44,661
He can barely take care of himself, and he's meddling.

754
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:51,141
This isn't his first time, is it?

755
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:55,071
Actually, he was here not too long ago.

756
00:47:56,311 --> 00:47:58,511
Ever since that man showed up,

757
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,151
I've been worried about Ji Woo.

758
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,951
So I've been a little on edge.

759
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:05,521
Thank you.

760
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,321
Of course.

761
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:21,031
Everyone's speaking Korean!

762
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:23,171
Are you sure you don't want to tell your mom?

763
00:48:23,841 --> 00:48:26,401
I'm going to surprise her after the concert later.

764
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,071
Let's hurry and get some tteokbokki. Then the merch store.

765
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:31,481
- The birthday cafe for the guys!
- Totally!

766
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:34,411
- Is that the bus stop over there?
- Yes.

767
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:35,481
Let's go!

768
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:43,121
The Bazaar Resident Consent Form. I need it by next week.

769
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:47,231
- I'll get it done, no matter what.
- And one more thing.

770
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:50,431
Hey, I thought this was a one-for-one deal.

771
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:54,071
Hey now. You think an assistant's on my level?

772
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:56,641
What is it?

773
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:00,241
From now on, I want you to stick to Mr. Shin's side.

774
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,411
I'm already on it.

775
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:07,351
Do an even better job. When Mr. Shin is in danger,

776
00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:09,211
make sure you're right there with him.

777
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,481
This is about Yun Dong Hee, isn't it?

778
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:14,421
How would you know about that?

779
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:17,121
I can put two and two together.

780
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,361
A friend of mine from the Police University told me.

781
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:21,161
And I saw the case file.

782
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:23,731
The man who killed Jun has escaped,

783
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:26,131
so Mr. Shin isn't just going to sit back and do nothing.

784
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:29,071
You're smarter than I thought.

785
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:30,741
That's a relief.

786
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:34,741
What, you thought I was an idiot?

787
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,881
No, it's just...

788
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:39,281
I had my doubts.

789
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:45,821
(Hujin Arcade)

790
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:05,171
Once I find my item, I'll not come back here.

791
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:08,241
Shut up. Bring me the item Kim Yong Woo stole.

792
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:13,011
- How much is this worth?
- A few hundred grand?

793
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:18,281
Every time money enters his account, someone is going to die.

794
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:21,521
Before Yun Dong Hee's doctor died, the last person she spoke with...

795
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,091
was the director of the director of Federal Medical Center.

796
00:50:23,661 --> 00:50:27,831
Did you know Yun Dong Hee was going to be there?

797
00:50:35,471 --> 00:50:39,971
He's behind Yun Dong Hee's release, or he's the next target.

798
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:47,581
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

799
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:49,111
I'm telling you I didn't do it!

800
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:54,421
Mom...

801
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:55,891
Why did it have to happen?

802
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,191
Why did it have to be the same day?

803
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:12,327
Mr. Shin, where are you going?

804
00:51:12,757 --> 00:51:14,957
- A delivery.
- Where to?

805
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:21,067
If President Sin's in any danger,

806
00:51:21,367 --> 00:51:22,797
you stick right by his side.

807
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:06,247
I'll wait ten minutes. If he doesn't come down, I'm going up.

808
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:11,287
Lee Heo Jun, a leading candidate...

809
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:14,257
for Health Minister, has resigned as director of the FMC.

810
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:17,757
While taking full responsibility for the recent inmate escape,

811
00:52:17,957 --> 00:52:21,357
he also blasted the staff shortages at the Federal Medical Center.

812
00:52:21,497 --> 00:52:24,427
A few days ago, I lost a cherished student...

813
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,267
and a brilliant colleague.

814
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:32,807
He alone cared for over a hundred forensic patients.

815
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:35,437
And though he was suffering from overwork and stress,

816
00:52:36,137 --> 00:52:38,977
he never once let his patients see how much he was struggling.

817
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:44,117
The working conditions at our hospital...

818
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:45,647
and this incident...

819
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:50,657
- Hey, you made it.
- Hope I'm not interrupting.

820
00:52:50,757 --> 00:52:54,297
Not at all. Getting stabbed didn't kill me,

821
00:52:54,557 --> 00:52:57,497
but I was dying of boredom these past few days.

822
00:52:59,397 --> 00:53:00,397
Just kidding.

823
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:03,937
You saved my life,

824
00:53:04,637 --> 00:53:06,237
and I haven't even had the chance to thank you properly.

825
00:53:07,607 --> 00:53:08,607
Thank you.

826
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:10,807
Please. Don't mention it.

827
00:53:17,617 --> 00:53:18,687
I heard you were investigating...

828
00:53:19,117 --> 00:53:21,287
Yun Dong Hee for a long time.

829
00:53:21,457 --> 00:53:23,887
I have. Thanks to him,

830
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,457
I've practically rewritten the book on police disciplinary actions.

831
00:53:26,697 --> 00:53:27,897
And I hear you visited our hospital...

832
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:31,567
- several times.
- Yes.

833
00:53:32,097 --> 00:53:33,097
Every time I went,

834
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:35,467
your staff was never very cooperative.

835
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:37,607
I figured this is...

836
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:39,267
what you really came for.

837
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:43,777
It's a copy of Yun Dong Hee's medical records.

838
00:53:45,147 --> 00:53:46,647
It's not much,

839
00:53:47,377 --> 00:53:48,377
but it's all I can do to help.

840
00:53:49,047 --> 00:53:51,687
(Forensic Patient Medical Record)

841
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,517
(Yun Dong Hee Admitted: Sep. 20, 2010)

842
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:54,587
(Dept: Psych. Sex, Age: M, 40 Dr: Cha So Yeon)

843
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:58,987
So the director has pull after all.

844
00:53:59,127 --> 00:54:00,757
I guess it's my turn...

845
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:02,557
to rewrite the book on disciplinary action.

846
00:54:05,627 --> 00:54:08,567
- I'm kidding.
- Hey, that's a sore subject for me.

847
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:10,867
Not funny at all.

848
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:00,557
- This is so good.
- I know.

849
00:55:01,287 --> 00:55:03,627
Hey, dig in. I call dibs on the spicy drumstick.

850
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:04,887
The original is good too.

851
00:55:06,997 --> 00:55:10,427
The person who brought this chicken, did you see which way hey went?

852
00:55:10,697 --> 00:55:11,697
I'm not sure which way he went,

853
00:55:12,227 --> 00:55:14,997
- but he just left.
- Thank you.

854
00:55:15,537 --> 00:55:17,207
(Ward 21)

855
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:43,927
You asked me if I knew Yun Dong Hee, didn't you?

856
00:55:44,627 --> 00:55:45,927
And you said you didn't.

857
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:52,267
I was reviewing the inmate's file, and it turns out...

858
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:55,037
we did have a connection in the past.

859
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:58,547
About twenty years ago, at a juvenile detention center,

860
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:02,617
I volunteered as a medical counsellor. Back then,

861
00:56:02,947 --> 00:56:04,817
I had a session with a young Yun Dong Hee.

862
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:09,757
I wasn't intentionally withholding that information.

863
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:11,527
Honestly,

864
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:14,857
he was just one of many patients to me,

865
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:17,667
and he didn't really leave a lasting impression.

866
00:56:17,997 --> 00:56:19,297
So I didn't remember him.

867
00:56:21,497 --> 00:56:22,767
Is that so?

868
00:56:23,237 --> 00:56:25,367
And I also confirmed...

869
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:28,107
that you visit Yun Dong Hee...

870
00:56:28,737 --> 00:56:31,807
on the anniversary of your child's death.

871
00:56:33,077 --> 00:56:36,447
Frankly, a case like this is quite unusual,

872
00:56:36,547 --> 00:56:39,847
so I was wondering what your motivation might be,

873
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:41,887
if you don't mind me asking?

874
00:56:48,327 --> 00:56:50,597
How could I possibly explain something like that?

875
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:54,767
I suppose not.

876
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:57,937
A parent's feelings after losing a child...

877
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:01,577
are more than just simple sadness.

878
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,977
A sense of loss.

879
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:07,117
Sometimes, guilt.

880
00:57:07,617 --> 00:57:08,917
A sense of responsibility.

881
00:57:09,647 --> 00:57:11,887
And anger all get intertwined,

882
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:14,017
creating a very complex...

883
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:16,857
grieving process.

884
00:57:17,687 --> 00:57:21,027
I believe your repeated visits to the assailant...

885
00:57:21,227 --> 00:57:24,497
stem from one of those emotions.

886
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:27,867
Then...

887
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:31,437
What do you think my reason is?

888
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:36,507
Atonement...

889
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:38,307
for your late child.

890
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:40,147
And...

891
00:57:40,817 --> 00:57:42,347
solace...

892
00:57:43,517 --> 00:57:44,517
for yourself?

893
00:57:52,027 --> 00:57:53,257
If by any chance,

894
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:55,997
you ever need someone to talk to,

895
00:57:56,927 --> 00:57:58,267
please feel free to reach out.

897
00:58:40,677 --> 00:58:42,337
Let me know when you have the money.

(Cash Cow)

899
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,227
(Let me know when you have the money.)

900
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,697
(The evidence?)

901
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:11,907
These guys are completely nuts.

(Shin's Project)

903
01:00:11,297 --> 01:00:13,427
About what happened to you,

904
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:16,237
I know all about it. And I want to help.

905
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:20,137
People could die. You might have to kill someone.

906
01:00:20,677 --> 01:00:23,177
It depends on the kind of revenge you're talking about.

907
01:00:23,237 --> 01:00:26,907
Their link might go back further than you think.

908
01:00:26,977 --> 01:00:31,417
- Pluto didn't open up?
- They have to go to Andong.

909
01:00:31,747 --> 01:00:35,517
- Who let you come back to Korea?
- Ji Woo!

910
01:00:36,317 --> 01:00:37,527
You want me to kill...

911
01:00:38,027 --> 01:00:39,257
this man?

912
01:00:40,727 --> 01:00:42,597
I'm going to put an end to this now.
