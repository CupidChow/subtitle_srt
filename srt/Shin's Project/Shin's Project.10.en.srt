(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,650
I tried to call you...

5
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,650
a few times, but I...

6
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,320
Luckily, the guy didn't die.

7
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,960
- He didn't?
- Didn't we agree...

8
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,160
you'd just graze me?

9
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,960
Yes.

10
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:33,605
So why did you have to blow it up like that?

11
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,270
Please spare me, sir. I...

12
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,040
Please, I'm begging you. I'm so sorry.

13
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,180
When you screw up like that,

14
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,780
it really upsets me.

15
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,920
You get that?

16
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,350
I was wrong, sir. I'll do better.

17
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,560
I'll do much better, sir.

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,260
Please spare my life.

19
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,190
The person who followed you that day.

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,370
Excuse me. Could you call 911?

21
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,530
Wait.

22
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,500
Open the door, you jerk!

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,470
Tell me everything you remember about him.

24
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
I...

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
My memory...

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,680
I can't remember.

27
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,390
Sir.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,790
Wait, I remember now.

29
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,320
He said he was going to kill me.

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,830
I don't know why,

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,330
but he just kept saying he was going to kill me.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,770
I remember now, sir.

33
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,820
An atonement...

34
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
for your dead child.

35
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,680
And...

36
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,890
for yourself,

37
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320

40
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,980
What took you so long?

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,750
- How did you know I was here?
- You sure keep yourself busy.

42
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,720
Making laws, frying chicken, dating,

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,820
and investigating your boss.

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,860
I know everything that happened...

45
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,860
to you, Mr. Shin.

46
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,660
So?

47
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,570
I want to help.

48
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,230
Forget it.

49
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,440
- We have to catch Yun Dong Hee.
- I'll get him. My way.

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,910
Right. Your way, Mr. Shin.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,750
Someone could die,

52
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,710
or I might have to kill someone.

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,050
So don't act like you're in on this.

(Shin's Project)

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,480
Because of Kim Yong Woo,

56
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,290
you went through so much 15 years ago.

57
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,490
This time, you must finish it right. That's the only way this all ends.

58
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,190
Got it?

59
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Yes.

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,940
We go way back, don't we?

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,340
If I hadn't met you back then,

62
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,240
I would've rotted in prison for life.

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,040
Think of your late mother.

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,910
Because of that jerk, Kim Yong Woo,

65
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,550
she was stuck in the hospital for so long.

66
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,050
That's not it.

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,150
You cared for my mother till the end.

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,590
And look at the life I have now.

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,660
You more than deserve it.

70
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,330
Here, take this.

71
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,870
What is this?

72
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,270
Open it.

73
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,010
The sun's bright in Europe, so sunglasses are a must-have.

74
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,750
- They look great on you.
- Really?

75
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,920
But sir.

76
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,890
You didn't know the cops were coming either, did you?

77
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,530
Of course.

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,330
I didn't know either.

79
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,300
I should've gone through with it.

80
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,670
- I'm so sorry.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

81
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,380
Just don't make the same mistake again.

82
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,750
Right.

83
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,550
A detective was stabbed outside the Federal Med Center director's house.

84
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,480
And Mr. Shin was right there when it happened.

85
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
What?

86
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,920
It could have been Mr. Shin who got stabbed.

87
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,460
- I want to help too.
- Someone could die,

88
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,390
or you could end up killing someone.

89
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,800
Why are you here?

90
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,800
To go on deliveries with you. Let's go.

91
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,480
This one here and that one up ahead, right?

92
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,750
Yes.

93
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,500
Are you sure you just came to do deliveries?

94
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,970
Yes.

95
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,300
Just making sure you're in good shape for your exams.

96
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,610
That's not it.

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
Something's bothering you, isn't it?

98
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,510
Spit it out. Did you fight with Mr. Shin again?

99
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,110
What do you mean, "again?"

100
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,550
When have I ever fought with Mr. Shin?

101
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,750
That's true. It's usually him giving you a hard time, isn't it?

102
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,460
What's that supposed to mean?

103
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,490
Seriously, did something happen with Mr. Shin?

104
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,330
So don't act like you're in on this.

105
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I want to help him somehow,

106
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,740
but I don't think Mr. Shin wants my help.

107
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,850
And I thought it was something serious.

108
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,820
It's too early for this nonsense.

109
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,090
- What?
- This second-guessing...

110
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,790
and consideration.

111
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,820
With all that, when are you ever going to help?

112
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,230
Guess who said that?

113
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,400
- Mr. Shin.
- Exactly.

114
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,870
If you want to help, you just help.

115
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,840
I saw Mr. Shin sighing a lot lately, so I figured something was up.

116
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,580
You're great and all,

117
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,350
but you think too much.

118
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,350
You think so?

119
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,160
Hey, hold still for a second.

120
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,840
If I do this like this,

121
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,740
it releases a hormone that gets rid of stress,

122
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,310
and your worries disappear.

123

- Yes.

127

You were the one behind it, right?

Mr. Shin and many others helped me a lot.

139
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,070
Right. So, how's Mr. Shin been lately?

140
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,410
I think he's really worried about Yun Dong Hee.

141
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,070
Is that so?

142
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,140
- Did he tell you that himself?
- No. I found out myself.

143
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,080
You're the one who told me to find things out on my own.

144
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,990
It's good you want to help Mr. Shin and protect him,

145
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,690
but the police have to be the ones to catch Yun Dong Hee.

146
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,020
That's the only way Mr. Shin won't get hurt.

147
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,790
Also, bring me the report on the ordinance amendment,

148
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,300
- so I can use it for reference.
- But given Mr. Shin's situation...

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,390
He was almost murdered by a patient he'd been counselling,

183
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,890
but for him to be so calm about it...

184
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,490
I just don't get it.

185
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,360
Director Lee Heo Jun counselled him?

186
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,070
The inmate he was with died.

187
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,270
This guy. Something's not right.

188
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,270
But besides Yun Dong Hee,

189
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,080
didn't you say you weren't interested in anyone else?

190
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,050
There's been a slight change of plans.

191

(Director Lee Heo Jun)

193
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,310
What kind of man is he? Yun Dong Hee.

194
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,280
Why are you so curious about Yun Dong Hee?

195
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,950
Because Jun is no longer with us.

196
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,350
But that monster, Yun Dong Hee,

197
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,120
gets to walk around like nothing happened.

198
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,630
So, what you're really curious about is...

199
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,630
why Yun Dong Hee did what he did, isn't it?

200
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,530
More than that.

201
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,270
I'm planning to put an end to it.

202
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,640
So it is anger.

203
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,850
Anger can be what keeps us going,

204
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,720
but if you hold on to it too long, it will eat you up inside.

205
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,990
I don't care.

206
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,100
If that's how you're coping,

207
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
I won't try to stop you.

208
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,510
Are you saying it's okay for me to get my revenge?

209
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,380
That depends on what kind of revenge.

210
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,720
You're the first person who's ever said that to me.

211
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,160
And this is the first time I've ever opened up to anyone like this.

212
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,560
That's a good start.

213
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,030
I'm glad I came here.

214
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,530
Well, then.

215
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,200
I should get going.

216
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,800

240

Look, I'm not going to let that happen.

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Yes, sir.

242

You're going to ace the test tomorrow.

251
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,470
I went over them a few times.

252
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,370
I still missed a couple.

253
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,010

254
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,750
No, it's okay. You've helped me more than enough.

I've marked the ones I got wrong,

256
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,550

260

261
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,700

262
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,130

(Gum, Headache Medicine, Antacid)

Take this after lunch for indigestion. It's a gentle antacid.

265
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,110
If you get a headache from no sleep, take the headache medicine.

266
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,250
You might get sleepy after the rush, so chew some gum during your break.

You're something else.

268
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,590

- Can you make it look pretty?
- Of course.

- Go outside and take a look around.
- Yes, ma'am.

283

- Surprise!
- You weren't followed, were you?

284
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,160
Who would follow me?

285
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,630
Looks like she's clear.

286

287
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,500
I was hoping it wasn't true,

288
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,470
but you really came back to Korea? Did you have to lie to me?

289
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,140
Do you have any idea how worried I've been?

290
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,580
But I just...

291
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,420
I went to the ZB1 concert, and I wanted to surprise you.

292
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,890
Who said you could just come back to Korea?

293
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,930
I'll take her.

Ji Woo.

295
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,860
Do you recognise...

296
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,490
You don't recognise me? Don't you remember?

297
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,930
- Who are you?
- Right.

298
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,160
It's been a while, so I get it.

299
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,570
I'm your father.

300
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,510
Ji Woo, there's something in there that I really need right now.

301
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,610
Hey! What are you doing?

302
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,580
Wait, hold on. Just stay still for a second, okay?

303
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
Just a second.

304
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,480
Ji Woo!

305
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,090
Ji Woo! Have a good life.

306
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,430
Ji Woo, are you okay?

307
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,570
Ji Woo!

308
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Mom!

309
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,550
You...

310
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,310
Did something happen to you?

311
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,850
Did he...

312
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,730
I had no idea that happened when I was little.

313
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,600
Why can't I remember any of it?

314
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,600
They say you can block out memories if the trauma is too great.

315
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,270
That's what the doctor said.

316
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,180
So that's why you didn't want me to come to Korea.

317
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,550
And I had no idea.

318
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,690
- He's here.
- Right.

319
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,120
Did you get hurt anywhere?

320
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,620
I'm fine.

321
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,960
So you must be Ji Woo.

322
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,570
Ji Woo, say hello.

323
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,570
He's the man I just told you about, the one who saved you back then.

324
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,110
Right.

325
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,480
Thank you.

326
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,710
Of course.

327
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,920
Look how much you've grown.

328
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,390
That's right.

329
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,790

There we go.

333

I even have this picture.

334

- Lee Si On!
- Lee Si On!

338
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,730
Let's go, Lee Si On!

339
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,230
- Lee Si On!
- Pass that test!

- Si On!
- Lee Si On!

341
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,830
Go, Si On! Pass the test, Si On.

342
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,430
I made you wild abalone porridge. It's easy to digest.

343
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,070
I made some lightly seasoned beef bulgogi for your protein.

344
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,410
- Some blueberries for your brain.
- Blueberries.

345
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,310
And if you don't know an answer, just make a good guess.

346
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,710
- Why am I so nervous?
- Hey, for someone who's so nervous,

347
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,180
why are you making such a big deal...

348
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,550
about "wild" this and "protein" that?

349
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,850
You're pressuring her so much, she'll get an upset stomach.

350
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,290
- Si On, keep this with you always.
- Gosh, what's that?

351
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,360
It's for yin and yang and the five elements.

352
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,560
This pouch contains universal energy. See?

353
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,970
I didn't use a sewing machine. I sewed every single stitch by hand.

354
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,670
There's chocolate inside,

355
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,340
so eat some if your blood sugar's low.

356
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,410
- Thank you.
- That'll just give her cavities.

357
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,840
It's dark chocolate. It's 98 percent cacao.

358
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,980
- You're going to be late. Let's go.
- Right. Let's go, Si On.

359
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,380
- Go, Lee Si On!
- Let's go!

360
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,450
Go, Si On! You got this!

361
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,890
Let's go!

362
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,790
You can do it!

363
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,220
- Hey!
- Si On, you can do it!

364
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,520
Stop trying to take all the credit.

365
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,490
How is mentioning wild abalone taking credit?

366
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,130
Just give her the lunchbox. Why go on about protein?

367
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,530
It's "wild this" and "blueberry that."

368
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,070
You'd know if you'd ever taken a big exam before.

369
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,670
What? What did you say?

370
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,540
(Maheon Test Center 5, Entrance)

371
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,870
You got this.

372
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,780
Don't be nervous. Just relax.

373
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,610
All right, Si On.

374
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,320
I'll get you when you're done, okay?

375
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
Take your time, be calm, and finish it.

376
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,250
Okay. I'm heading in.

377
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,290
Okay.

378
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,760
- Mr. Shin.
- Yes?

379
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,230
I know you're worried about me.

380
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,840
But I'm worried about you too.

381
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,910
I know.

382
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,710
Then we're on the same page.

383
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,410
You do things your way,

384
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,680
and I'll do what I can.

385
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,850
You're something else.

386
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,720
So stubborn. You really are.

387
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,090
(Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency)

388
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,460
- He's here! Everyone, get ready.
- Come on, on your feet.

389
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,770
Hey! A round of applause!

390
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,970
Hey, cut it out. What, applause for getting stabbed?

391
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,780
Seriously. How dare they hurt one of our best?

392
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,710
Our team will catch jerk, Yun Dong Hee! Got it?

393
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,120
- Yes, sir!
- Give me a break.

394
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,750
What a circus. Darn it.

395
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,320
Since the investigation went public, he's been like this every morning.

396
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,390
Hey, come here a second.

397
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,130
Any word from the police substation?

398
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,830
Are you kidding?

399
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,760
We're getting reports on every death,

400
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,360
down to seniors who died of old age.

401
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,030
Come with me to the scene where I was stabbed.

402
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,040
- Why are we going there?
- Doesn't it seem off to you?

403
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,140
This time, the pattern's different.

404
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,040
He always stages them as accidents. He's a perfectionist in his own way.

405
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,540
But this time, it was on a main road.

406
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,240
And he was even carrying a knife.

407
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,950
Let's go.

408
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,000
The last person my wife spoke to was the hospital director.

409
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,830
You mean Director Lee Heo Jun?

410
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,900
From the Federal Medical Center?

411
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,540
Every time money is spent from Yun Dong Hee's account,

412
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,850
someone is going to die.

413
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,320
Watch out!

414
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,790
While Yun Dong Hee was in detention, Director Lee Heo Jun was also there.

415
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,630
- What?
- He was his counsellor.

416
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,070
The two of them might go back further than we think.

417
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,310
Are you okay? Hey, can you hear me?

418
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,850
He either got Yun Dong Hee released or he's a target.

419
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,520
It's got to be one or the other.

420
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,160
So, Detective Choi, which do you think is more likely?

421
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,760
Sir.

422
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,870
- Are you done here? Should we go?
- Let's go.

423
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,010
Hey, mister.

424
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,750
Hold on a second.

425
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,350
(Choi Cheol, National Police)

426
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,750
- What are you doing at this house?
- I was just passing by.

427
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,060
Come on, I just saw you snooping around the front gate.

428
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,530
I wasn't snooping. I was just admiring the house. It's my style.

429
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,730
Let me see your ID.

430
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:23,770
But I haven't done anything wrong. Can you stop anyone for no reason?

431
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,970
You were acting suspiciously. Now give me your ID.

432
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,170
Excuse us, sir. There was a recent incident here.

433
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,770
This is part of our investigation, so we'd appreciate your cooperation.

434
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,840
Look, I used to be a riot cop myself.

435
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,210
I trained at Jeungpyeong.

436
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
There. Are we good?

437
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,520
Gosh, what spoiled luck.

438
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,490
Hey, what did you just say? You just spat, didn't you?

439
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,660
- Sir.
- No, I didn't.

440
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,190
What do you mean? You just did.

441
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,030
- No, I was just pretending.
- Hey, get over here!

442
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,800
- I was just pretending.
- You just spat on the ground!

443
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,570
That's a 100-dollar fine for you.

444
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,030
- That's enough.
- I said get over here.

445
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,440
That's enough. You're not even fully recovered.

446
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,140
Seriously.

447
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,640
All right, it should be over.

448
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,880
I hope she didn't get off by one on the answer sheet or something.

449
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,920
Don't you think you worry too much? It's not like you, Mr. Shin.

450
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,760
Look who's talking. You're a nervous wreck about Si On.

451
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,020
I have faith in Si On.

452
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,230
What's that supposed to mean?

453
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,700
You think I'm doing this because I don't trust her?

454
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,000
Si On!

455
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,010
You worked so hard. Good job. How did it go?

456
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,140
Let's not talk about the test.

457
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,910
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.

458
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,250
- Let's go.
- Okay.

459
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:50,027
This is amazing.

460
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,627
Isn't this a bit much, Mr. Shin?

461
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,937
- What?
- Let's eat up.

462
00:35:54,997 --> 00:35:56,037
Because I don't think we'll ever have...

463
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,107
a company dinner like this again.

464
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,507
Don't we get a company dinner for the CSAT too?

465
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,545
Are you going to take the CSAT, Si On?

466
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:03,885
I just realised something.

467
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:06,385
I think I might have a knack for studying.

468
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:09,255
Don't you think it's because you have an excellent tutor?

469
00:36:09,385 --> 00:36:14,225
What does that matter? The point is Si On's taking the CSAT.

470
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:16,665
I'll get you all the CSAT exam tips.

471
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:17,695
Deal!

472
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:27,705
Pillip, you were really zeroed in on that lobster earlier.

473
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:30,175
Excuse me, I have a reservation under the name Shin Mal Ja.

474
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,645
I changed my name ages ago.

475
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:33,675
Dad?

476
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,775
What?

477
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,485
Judge Cho!

478
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:41,255
Son! Since you were eating out, we decided to eat out as well.

479
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:44,355
- A company dinner?
- And this is my boss.

480
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:47,025
Hello, Judge Kim Sang Geun recommended him,

481
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:49,195
and your Judge Cho is helping me so much.

482
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:52,495
You've certainly raised a fine, dependable son.

483
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:53,765
- Thank you so much.
- Is that right?

484
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:58,035
Hello.

485
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:03,075
This is Lee Si On. She works with Mr. Shin here.

486
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:05,675
It's nice to meet you.

487
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:08,915
Enjoy your meal. I'll see you at home.

488
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:09,915
Okay, dear.

489
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:12,215
Perhaps you could join us for dessert?

490
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:14,115
No, that's quite all right.

491
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:15,615
Please, enjoy your meal.

492
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:19,855
Let's go. So tactless to offer dessert. You all have a good time.

493
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,125
- You have a wonderful evening.
- Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

494
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,225
- Yes, of course.
- Thanks.

496
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,075
For crying out loud.

498
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:55,195
Si On! Hold on a second.

499
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:57,625
Just a minute. Come on in.

500
00:37:57,765 --> 00:37:58,825
We have a situation.

00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:03,505
(Chicken Center)

00:38:03,605 --> 00:38:05,835
(Hujin Arcade)

503
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:12,745
Wait, what's wrong? What happened?

504
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,615
Pluto isn't open.

505
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:17,215
- What?
- Mr. Jang won't pick up either.

506
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,255
(Pluto)

507
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:23,855
Chil Bong, did you two fight again?

508
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:25,785
It wasn't me this time.

509
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,395
He called me yesterday, crying.

510
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,295
Apparently, he fought with his girlfriend.

511
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,325
Mr. Jang has a girlfriend?

512
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,035
Yes. She's in Andong.

513
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:35,335
A long-distance relationship?

514
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:38,305
Come on. His legs aren't that long.

515
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,075
They were about to meet the parents,

516
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:43,675
and now he's a mess with cold feet.

517
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:47,815
But he can't just close up shop.

518
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,945
What are his regular customers supposed to do?

519
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:57,025
All right, this won't do. I need you two to go...

520
00:38:57,155 --> 00:38:58,455
and bring him back.

521
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,895
- The two of us?
- Yes.

522
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:03,195
Where are we supposed to go get him?

523
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:05,995
To Andong, of course. Both of you.

524
00:39:08,495 --> 00:39:09,595
So the two of you are going?

525
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,235
I'd hear Mr. Jang...

526
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:15,175
on the phone sometimes with someone,

527
00:39:15,175 --> 00:39:16,605
but I didn't know it was long-distance.

528
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:19,705
What I'm wondering is...

529
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,815
Why did Mr. Shin send just the two of us?

530
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:26,515
Another reason besides bringing Mr. Jang?

531
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:27,555
Yes.

532
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:30,985

(Andong Bus Terminal)

534
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,062
- He's not picking up?
- He's not.

535
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,962
Let's send him a text and grab a bite.

536
00:39:53,162 --> 00:39:54,862
Okay. I'm starving.

537
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:55,932

539
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:04,272
- Enjoy your meal!
- Thank you.

540
00:40:05,342 --> 00:40:07,812
We work at a fried chicken place, but we came all the way...

541
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,412
to Andong to eat braised chicken?

542
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:11,012
But it's what they're famous for here.

543
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:15,752
Is it any good?

544
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:28,762
Time to dig in.

545
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:58,862
Mr. Jang!

546
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,392
- He's still not picking up.
- The number you dialled...

547
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:01,392
is not available.

548
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:03,362
We texted him, so let's just wait and see.

549
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,302
Hey, wait up!

550
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,402
Hurry up.

551
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:32,292
Mr. Shin? We got here okay.

552
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,592
Hey. Have you met with Mr. Jang?

553
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,162
Not yet. I texted him, but he hasn't gotten back to me.

554
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:38,832
Mr. Shin, what are you up to?

555
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,932
What do you think? I'm frying chicken.

556
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:45,942
It's swamped here with you and Si On gone.

557
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:48,872
All right. Make sure you bring him back.

558
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,312
I'm hanging up.

559
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:02,492
- Something feels off.
- Cho Pillip.

560
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:04,362
Come on.

561
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:05,862
Sure!

562
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:13,162
Careful! You'll get hurt.

563
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,002
When we get back to Seoul,

564
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:17,972
let's start your tutoring right away.

565

There's not much time before the CSAT.

566
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,712
The GED results aren't even out yet, you know.

567
00:42:23,242 --> 00:42:25,682
Of course you passed. Look who your tutor was.

568
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:27,482
Whatever.

569
00:42:35,192 --> 00:42:36,192
Si On.

570
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:37,692
Yes?

571
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:38,722
What's your dream?

572
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:39,892
My dream?

573
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,532
For my grandma to be healthy...

574
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:49,332
- and for Ye On to grow up well?
- Besides your grandma and Ye On.

575
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:51,572
Your dream.

576
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,172
Isn't there anything you want to do for yourself?

577
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,052
To be honest,

578
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:04,252
I didn't really have any dreams before.

579
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,352
But I do now.

580
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:08,052
What is it?

581
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:11,292
It's a secret. I'll tell you after the CSAT.

582
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,262
- Why? Just tell me now.
- No.

583
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,462
Come on, tell me.

584
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:20,632
Oh! It's Mr. Jang.

585
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:23,702
Mr. Jang!

586
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,142
Where are you?

587
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:26,672
Where is he?

588
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:30,882
Mr. Jang.

589
00:43:31,282 --> 00:43:32,582
We were all so worried.

590
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:36,352
I'm sorry. I was drinking until dawn...

591
00:43:36,812 --> 00:43:39,422
and cried myself to sleep, so I didn't even realise you called.

592
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:42,992
Mr. Shin told us to bring you back.

593
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:46,122
Mr. Jang, did you break up with your girlfriend?

594
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:51,332
I'm sorry.

595
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:53,972
I'll call you guys later.

596
00:43:54,572 --> 00:43:55,632
Jang Tong Woo!

597
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:58,072
Yes. I'm coming.

598
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,942
Get back to Seoul safely.

599
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:02,272
No, excuse me, sir.

600
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,682
- Hey, where did you go...
- Si On.

601
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:09,812
- What?
- You can't...

602
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:11,022
- just ask someone that.
- I'm sorry.

603
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:13,722
- Attention! At ease!
- No, I was just...

604
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:15,292
Was that a bad thing to ask?

605
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:18,262
Let's just go.

606
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:19,592
I think we should get going.

607
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:21,132
Okay.

608
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:28,532
- Good evening.
- All clear, sir.

Yes!

612

613
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:16,052
- It's a hit!
- Congratulations!

614
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:18,082
Congratulations.

615
00:45:20,322 --> 00:45:21,652
Let's meet in person.

616

That punk...

617
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:07,532
Hey. Do me a favour.

618
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:09,702
I don't want to.

619
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:13,442
I think someone's tailing me. Go get the money from that guy for me.

620
00:46:15,312 --> 00:46:16,312
What? And why would I do that?

621
00:46:20,182 --> 00:46:22,152
Darn it! Thirty grand!

622
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:23,652
I'll give you half.

623
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:26,182
This is a huge deal. A really huge deal!

624
00:46:26,652 --> 00:46:27,652
Have you heard of him?

625
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:30,322

626
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:34,362
Who? Who did you just say that was?

00:46:34,462 --> 00:46:35,592
Lee Heo Jun!

628
00:46:36,032 --> 00:46:38,532
I got his car plate number and his accomplice.

629
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:39,562
Who's the accomplice?

630
00:46:39,662 --> 00:46:41,372
The accomplice? Beats me.

631
00:46:41,872 --> 00:46:43,172
Guess you'll find out from the USB.

632
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:46,542
- Are you going to help me?
- Where's the USB drive?

633
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:49,742
- I've hidden the original.
- What I have with me is a copy.

634
00:46:50,172 --> 00:46:51,182
Where are you now?

635
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:52,842
I'm heading to the meeting spot.

636
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:55,952
And I already shook the guy who was following me.

637
00:46:57,152 --> 00:46:58,782
Postpone the deal until tomorrow.

638
00:46:59,222 --> 00:47:00,222
What? Why?

639
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:02,222
Tell him you want to meet him tomorrow, then go dark.

640
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:07,292
Listen, Kim Yong Woo. If you want to live, do as I say.

641
00:47:07,462 --> 00:47:08,462
Got it?

642
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:10,902
Okay.

643
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:14,572
I'll get the money for you, so where did you hide the original?

644
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:20,672
Don't you want the money?

645
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:24,482
Somewhere Joo Yeong Mi would know.

646
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:27,312
Got it.

647
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,312
We'll talk in person.

648
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:19,262
Looks like he's dead.

649
00:49:19,692 --> 00:49:20,962
I think he's dead.

650
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:24,262
- I think he's dead!
- What do we do?

651
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:28,272
- What do we do?
- They say it was a hit-and-run.

652
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:29,532
Please stay back.

653
00:49:38,782 --> 00:49:40,182
Oh, no...

654
00:49:40,442 --> 00:49:42,082

Another one's dead.

657
00:50:13,982 --> 00:50:15,482
What? Where?

658
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:16,892
Yes.

659
00:50:17,692 --> 00:50:20,892
Sir, it's a hit-and-run. The victim's a man in his 40s.

660
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:22,992
Right. Got it.

662
00:50:38,312 --> 00:50:39,342
It's him, right?

663
00:50:39,342 --> 00:50:40,482

664

Let me see your ID.

665
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:44,452
Can you stop anyone for no reason?

666
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:47,022
He's the guy I had a run-in with in front of Lee Heo Jun's house.

667
00:50:47,682 --> 00:50:48,782
Check for witnesses.

668

00:55:45,252 --> 00:55:46,352
I just got back with some food.

715
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:50,282
I'm one to talk, but you're a real piece of work.

716
00:55:50,892 --> 00:55:55,892
I'd like to go home too, you know. I went out of my way for this food,

717
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:58,432
so this isn't easy for me either.

718
00:55:58,762 --> 00:56:00,162
You're not the warm and fuzzy type, are you?

719
00:56:00,632 --> 00:56:01,832
Stone cold. That's me.

720
00:56:03,302 --> 00:56:06,202
- This place looks familiar.
- Where?

721
00:56:06,272 --> 00:56:08,402
Hey! Come take a look at this.

722
00:56:11,512 --> 00:56:14,012
That's Maheon City. It's in our jurisdiction.

723
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:15,842
- Right?
- Yes.

724
00:56:21,822 --> 00:56:22,882
(Pluto)

725
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:27,062
That's Yun Dong Hee.

726
00:56:27,722 --> 00:56:30,532
So if Yun Dong Hee was tailing Kim Yong Woo...

727
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:36,132
Where are you going?

728
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:39,772
What is with him? Seriously!

729
00:56:43,002 --> 00:56:46,112
(Chicken Center)

730
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:51,012
(Hujin Arcade Management Office)

731
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:57,592
(Hujin Arcade, Chicken Center)

732
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:38,592
(Shin's Project)

733
00:58:39,492 --> 00:58:42,192
I haven't heard anything back yet.

734
00:58:42,492 --> 00:58:46,232
- I need a location check.
- As a detective, I'll do my job.

735
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:48,762
From now on, you're my negotiator.

736
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:50,532
I'll be calling the shots this time.

737
00:58:50,832 --> 00:58:53,772
- We have to find that USB.
- Leave it to me!

738
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:55,172
What is going on?

739
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:58,172
Is it about your kid who died?

740
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:01,242
You absolutely cannot take matters into your own hands.

741
00:59:01,312 --> 00:59:05,112
Why did you do it? Remember every single detail.
