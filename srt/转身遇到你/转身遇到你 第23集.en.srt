1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,600
Let's stand up.

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,100
Come here, Wan Xinxin.

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,320
Come on.

5
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,800
No.

6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,640
Don't.

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Come here.

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,960
Ahead of us,

9
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,080
we'll face many more difficulties like this.

10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,940
When we encounter difficulties,

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
do we choose to cry?

12
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,120
To stare at them helplessly in despair?

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,340
But for the sake of our loved ones,

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,039
we must not despair.

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,370
When facing difficulties,

16
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,480
we must first confront them.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,880
Understand them.

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,780
We need to start learning about them.

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,920
Look for opportunities.

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,920
Knock it down.

21
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,040
But I can't knock it down.

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,160
Yes, you can.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Wan Xinxin, repeat after me.

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
Face it.

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,840
Say 'face it.'

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,040
Face it.

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,440
Recognize it.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,760
Recognize it.

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,980
Understand it.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Understand it.

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,079
Find a chance to knock it down.

32
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,720
Find a chance to knock it down.

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
Face it.

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
Face it.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,680
Recognize it.

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,600
Recognize it.

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
Understand it.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
Understand it.

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Find a chance to knock it down.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
Find a chance to knock it down.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,240
Louder!

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,100
I refuse to believe I can't knock it down!

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Knock it down! Knock it down! Knock it down!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,080
Knock it down! Knock it down!

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,960
Miss Wan,

46
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,079
I really admire your personal work.

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,040
However, for this position,

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,300
we've already hired someone. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,079
Perhaps I could leave

50
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,540
my resume with you anyway.

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
If there's an opportunity in the future,

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
please give me a call.

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,290
Hello, I have an appointment with Manager Li.

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm here to drop off my resume today.

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm sorry, we've already filled the position.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
I'm really sorry,

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,079
but we've found a more suitable candidate.

58
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,480
You might want to try elsewhere.

59
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,200
I'm sorry,

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,160
we already have a suitable candidate for this position.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,000
My apologies.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,570
How many places have you tried?

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,440
About 7 or 8 places already.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,890
And all 7 or 8 politely turned you down?

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,240
What do you mean politely?

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,080
It was flat-out rejection.

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,399
They must have called ahead,

68
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,529
just to prevent you from finding a job.

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,450
That's exactly what makes me so angry.

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,600
How can they control everything like this?

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
I feel like

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm just like Sun Wukong,

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,130
unable to escape from Buddha's palm no matter how hard I try.

74
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Okay.

75
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,240
Don't be upset, don't worry.

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,440
If it doesn't work out, we'll try again.

77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
What can we do?

78
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,000
My major is design,

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,120
and Liu Wei's company is so huge.

80
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,080
All design companies

81
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,000
try to curry favor with them and want to collaborate with them.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,440
They've almost monopolized the entire industry.

83
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,560
Where am I supposed to find a job?

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,200
Design...

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,200
Wait a minute.

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,200
What is it?

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Help me remember something.

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,220
Didn't you tell me once

89
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,120
that you mentioned

90
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,840
when you were in school, your paintings

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,440
someone was willing to buy them at a high price?

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,490
Did you say that?

93
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
Yes, so what?

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
Everything's settled.

95
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,120
If they won't let us find jobs, then we won't.

96
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
We'll be our own bosses in the future.

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,170
Open a gallery and sell paintings.

98
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
Be our own bosses?

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,960
Open a gallery?

100
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,880
No, don't talk like it's so easy.

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,240
Let's not even talk about whether my paintings

102
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,300
will sell or if anyone would buy them.

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,690
Just opening a gallery,

104
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,520
do you know how much money that requires?

105
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,240
Where would I get that kind of money?

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,480
Wan Xinxin, right now

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
the first thing is to find a job

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,450
because that will be persuasive in court.

109
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
You think I don't know all this?

110
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,840
What am I supposed to do?

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,960
I'm so worried I'm about to lose all my hair.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
Xinxin.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,400
From today on, you can focus on your painting.

114
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,360
Leave everything else to me.

115
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,330
I'll leave it to you.

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,400
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,560
Happy birthday, Ruirui.

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
Happy birthday to you.

119
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,360
Happy birthday, Ruirui.

120
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,640
Hello.

121
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,600
Mr. Ruan, right?

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,360
Mr. Huaming, hello.

123
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,040
Hello. Sorry to keep you waiting.

124
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,880
It's fine.

125
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,159
Mr. Huaming, look.

126
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,840
This complex I'm about to show you

127
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,720
used to be home to artists.

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,240
The chef who lives here now,

129
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,600
this place was previously rented by an antique dealer.

130
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Any random antique he had

131
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,280
was worth a fortune.

132
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,320
This warehouse I'm taking you to see now

133
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,040
has been rented by several painters

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
as their studio.

135
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,940
They occasionally hold exhibitions there now.

136
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,080
Have they held exhibitions here before?

137
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Yes,

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,660
and quite a lot of people came.

139
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,760
Well, Mr. Huaming,

140
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,160
why don't I take you to see

141
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,840
that warehouse now?

142
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,240
Sure, thanks.

143
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,890
You're back.

144
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,080
I'll give you three seconds

145
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,940
to restore my computer right now.

146
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm giving you three seconds

147
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,400
to completely abandon that idea.

148
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
Stop messing around.

149
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,160
You have no idea how stressed I am right now.

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm like an ant on a hot pan.

151
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,960
If I can't find a job soon,

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm really doomed.

153
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,040
Can you really find a job on this?

154
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,640
Why don't you continue in the field you're good at?

155
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,920
My familiar field?

156
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,920
What?

157
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,440
Painting.

158
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
You saw me the other day,

159
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,160
sitting in front of the canvas like an idiot,

160
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,690
holding a brush but unable to paint anything.

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
That's all in the past now.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,040
Do you know why?

163
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,960
It's not your problem, it's my house's problem.

164
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,600
The whole layout of my place is too rigid.

165
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,320
You can't possibly find inspiration in this kind of space.

166
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,780
Artists need a sense of space to be inspired.

167
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Understand?

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,980
What I want to say is...

169
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,040
It's a shame.

170
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,400
Such a pity.

171
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,680
Wait, what's a shame?

172
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,610
Don't tell me

173
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,160
you've rented a studio for me to create art?

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,680
With one swipe of my finger,

175
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,800
I've paid the deposit to someone else.

176
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,640
That place is really spacious,

177
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
spring-like all year round with abundant sunlight.

178
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,720
Every afternoon, you can finish painting

179
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
and sit there enjoying afternoon tea.

180
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,400
It's really super cool and awesome.

181
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,360
But if you don't want it,

182
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,370
I can sublet it to someone else.

183
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,280
So if I don't go this time,

184
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,600
will you be disappointed?

185
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,560
If you don't go this time,

186
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
you might be

187
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,180
disappointing me for the first time.

188
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,130
That's a nice painting.

189
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,260
How much are you selling this for?

190
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,440
You can take a look at these.

191
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,000
Feel free to choose any.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I haven't set prices yet. Pick one and I'll decide.

193
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,800
I meant draw a portrait of us.

194
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
I don't do portraits.

195
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,400
No portraits?

196
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,680
You...

197
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,120
But these non-portrait paintings look great.

198
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,720
Just draw one for us, please?

199
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
Look, it's my first day here.

200
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,600
If you like any of my existing works,

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,640
you can pick one.

202
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
Then we can discuss the price.

203
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,360
But I really don't do portraits.

204
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,840
If you don't do portraits, why are you even on the street?

205
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,600
I...

206
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,640
You want portraits, right?

207
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,240
Yes.

208
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,080
Over there. They do portraits over there.

209
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
You should go there instead.

210
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,120
We don't like that style.

211
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,320
I think your paintings are really good.

212
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,120
She already said she won't paint anymore.

213
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,960
You can't keep pressuring her like this.

214
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,880
Who are you?

215
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Just a bystander.

216
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,040
This has nothing to do with you.

217
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,970
Mind your own business.

218
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,200
What's all this noise about?

219
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
No more painting. Let's go.

220
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,960
She said she won't paint anymore.

221
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,020
You guys are crazy.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Thanks, girl.

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Don't mention it.

224
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,690
How much for your painting?

225
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
I haven't set a price yet.

226
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,440
How about this? Which one do you like?

227
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll give you one for free.

228
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,240
I want

229
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,920
a custom piece.

230
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,120
Sure, no problem.

231
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,200
Great.

232
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,480
So, you don't paint portraits, right?

233
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,400
Then paint me in a landscape.

234
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,610
So you're aspiring to be an artist?

235
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,660
Have you signed with any gallery?

236
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,760
No.

237
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,840
I want to open my own gallery.

238
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,240
That's quite ambitious.

239
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,340
Do you understand the art market?

240
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
Not really.

241
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,370
You're certainly starting at the top.

242
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,920
That's why I haven't dared to open one yet.

243
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
I thought I'd come out to the street first

244
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,920
to see if anyone likes my paintings.

245
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,720
Do you think people on the street

246
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,400
are the same as those who buy art in galleries?

247
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,880
Not necessarily.

248
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,410
Aren't you interested in buying my painting?

249
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,320
Alright, come take a look at the sketch.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,460
This can't be discounted.

251
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,400
With your skill level,

252
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,200
you're worse than those street artists

253
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,440
who charge fixed prices for portraits.

254
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,080
Wait, what gives you the right to say that?

255
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,960
This is just a creative draft.

256
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,680
Tell me, what style is this supposed to be?

257
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,560
Who taught you?

258
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,840
I didn't learn from anyone.

259
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,900
No school, no style. I'm my own style.

260
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,600
I asked for a themed creation.

261
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,140
Yes, I'm creating according to your requirements.

262
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,300
If you just draw whatever you see,

263
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,930
I might as well take a photo.

264
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,960
I don't see any creativity here,

265
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,760
so I don't want this painting anymore.

266
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,000
Look,

267
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,520
are you just messing with me?

268
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,060
I really don't have time for that.

269
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
If you don't have the skill,

270
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,780
don't scam people under the pretense of running a gallery.

271
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,000
So...

272
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,930
These paintings weren't even done by you.

273
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,680
Every single one of these paintings was done by me.

274
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,610
My name is Jiang Xiaoyu.

275
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,720
Please have the actual artist

276
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,080
contact me. Goodbye.

277
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,240
Jiang Xiaoyu

278
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,680
Someone bought Mom's painting so quickly.

279
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,600
Mom is amazing.

280
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,010
Come on, blow Mom a kiss.

281
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,680
Give me a break.

282
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,220
She came to pick a fight with me today.

283
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,280
How did she pick a fight with you?

284
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,810
She insisted my paintings weren't done by me.

285
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,320
Let me check.

286
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,960
Jiang Xiaoyu.

287
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,880
Famous blogger.

288
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,600
The youngest PhD student at Southeast Art Academy.

289
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,400
She has so many followers.

290
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,400
Famous art critic.

291
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
Quite a lot of titles.

292
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,760
So many followers.

293
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,680
Yes.

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,720
She's what they call a big influencer on Weibo, right?

295
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,920
I'm surprised you know about influencers.

296
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,280
Well, take a look.

297
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
This is serious.

298
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,640
With so many followers,

299
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,440
isn't it good that she's paying attention to you?

300
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,680
What's good about it?

301
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,220
If she criticizes me once, it would be a disaster for me.

302
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,120
I hate people like her.

303
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,040
Tell me,

304
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,200
why should her words be considered authoritative?

305
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,080
How can she represent authority?

306
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,520
But she's a PhD.

307
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
PhD? So what?

308
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,570
These days post-docs are everywhere.

309
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
Besides, she called me a fraud.

310
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,400
Does that automatically make me one?

311
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,730
I need to argue with her.

312
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,250
Forget it. Don't reply.

313
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm asking her why her words should be considered authoritative.

314
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,760
It seems one-sided to me.

315
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Isn't she a PhD?

316
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
She replied.

317
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,480
Let the work speak for itself. What's fake can't become real.

318
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,200
This is getting heated. Let it go.

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Her followers left comments for me.

320
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,520
Saying I'm trying to use her to get famous.

321
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,960
What kind of situation is this?

322
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,920
I mean, do her fans have any brains?

323
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,480
My grades at the art academy were outstanding.

324
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,410
CrystalGlasses00: That's a huge difference! They're clearly lying!

325
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
She's a Weibo celebrity.

326
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,320
She gets hundreds of comments instantly.

327
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
If she says anything negative about you,

328
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,880
you won't be able to sell any of your paintings.

329
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
Do you realize what time it is? This is a critical period.

330
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
We're in the middle of a lawsuit.

331
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,800
It could very well affect

332
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,960
the outcome of the case. Do you understand?

333
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,080
That's exactly why

334
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,130
I need to argue with her about this.

335
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,920
Mom is so stubborn.

336
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,250
Hitting her won't help.

337
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,080
Hey, Jiang Xiaoyu.

338
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,700
I want to meet with you.

339
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,520
Do you dare to come?

340
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,300
You're quite persistent.

341
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,260
I can't stand being wrongly accused.

342
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,320
Can I take a photo?

343
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,640
Of course.

344
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,440
Can I post this painting online?

345
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,760
Whatever.

346
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,820
What are you doing?

347
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,530
I told you, what's fake can't become real.

348
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,700
All these paintings are mine.

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,130
Do you think this one

350
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,770
is the same as those others?

351
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,440
How can I prove you wrong?

352
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040
Don't bother, okay?

353
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,140
Being cheerful is beautiful.

354
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,460
Tell me, what exactly is the problem?

355
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,280
The problem is

356
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,760
these paintings weren't done by you at all.

357
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,640
How can I prove you wrong?

358
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,290
Don't bother, okay?

359
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,160
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.

360
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,040
I'll be waiting for you here.

361
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,000
I really don't have time to keep playing this game.

362
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,880
Goodbye.

363
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,400
You must come.

364
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,960
Have you heard?

365
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,200
About what?

366
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,740
Wan Xinxin has become famous.

367
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
What happened?

368
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,360
Didn't she want to open an art gallery?

369
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,720
But she was torn apart

370
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
by a famous critic.

371
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,760
I see.

372
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,880
Her lawyer must have told her

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,160
that she needs legitimate income

374
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,720
to win custody of her child.

375
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,080
But her gallery hasn't even opened yet

376
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,760
and her reputation is already so bad.

377
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,620
She's just waiting to lose money.

378
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,880
This is good news for me.

379
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,090
I'll definitely win this lawsuit.

380
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
Then I'll take this child

381
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,960
with me to America to show my mother.

382
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,640
My mother might not acknowledge me as her son,

383
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,560
but she can't deny her grandson.

384
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,680
Now whoever has custody of the child

385
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,920
will get that money.

386
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Never mind her lousy lawyer.

387
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,440
Just the fact that she can't afford to raise the child

388
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,170
means we're guaranteed to win.

389
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,680
Wan Xinxin.

390
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,650
This gallery will be yours from now on.

391
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,120
I feel like

392
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm just one big joke.

393
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,920
How could you be a joke?

394
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,920
Let me tell you, you're my biggest investment.

395
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,360
Xiao Ruan who rents from me told me

396
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,760
that this art district has produced masters before.

397
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,320
You're going to be a future master.

398
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,360
Me, a master?

399
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,700
Don't joke around.

400
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,160
Have you ever seen a master who hasn't even debuted yet,

401
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
who before creating anything

402
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,330
is already being criticized everywhere?

403
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,140
Everything has two sides.

404
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,000
Well,

405
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,980
you can turn defeat into victory.

406
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,800
Old friend,

407
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,160
let's just give up this gallery.

408
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm just a money-losing investment.

409
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,520
No.

410
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,360
I don't want to hear that.

411
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,920
Really, I'm begging you.

412
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
It's not as simple as just giving up.

413
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,680
The money's been paid and can't be refunded.

414
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,540
Whether you can do it or not, you have to make it work.

415
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,080
I don't even believe in myself.

416
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,080
I'll definitely disappoint you.

417
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,760
You've never disappointed me.

418
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,420
You've only scared me before.

419
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,720
Come, let's drink first.

420
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,560
Well, I can only thank you.

421
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,540
When I win the lawsuit,

422
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,370
I'll give myself to you.

423
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,660
What's with that face?

424
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,880
Everything for my dear brother.

425
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,740
I'll give it my all.

426
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,040
Sis, thank you for your hard work.

427
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,840
It's nothing.

428
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,960
Huaming,

429
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,090
you can't just let her have her way.

430
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,520
If this goes to court,

431
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,040
whether she can support the child

432
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,160
is what matters most.

433
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Opening an art gallery?

434
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,600
When will that ever make money?

435
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
You'd be better off

436
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,120
investing in something else.

437
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,720
Sis, what should I invest in?

438
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
Open a bun shop.

439
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,130
A bun shop makes money from day one.

440
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,450
Running a bun shop requires skills

441
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,640
that Xinxin can't handle.

442
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,920
What can't I handle?

443
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,120
Sister was just saying...

444
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,280
Fine, you two talk it out.

445
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,760
Sister was saying you should focus on your painting.

446
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,520
We're open!

447
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,680
What are you doing here?

448
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,480
Look at you, all talented and painting now.

449
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,760
What's it to you? Is it any of your business?

450
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,220
Business is booming, huh?

451
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,570
I want to buy a painting.

452
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,440
Let me see.

453
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,520
100, 5.

454
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,880
107. That should be enough to buy one of your paintings.

455
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Qin Gang, you're deliberately trying to cause trouble, aren't you?

456
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,800
No, I'm just...

457
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,480
supporting your first sale of the day.

458
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
No.

459
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
Look, it's your opening day. It's auspicious,

460
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,600
isn't it?

461
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,920
Come on, Mr. Qin is just helping with your first sale.

462
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,980
That's nice of him.

463
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,280
It will help with your future business.

464
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

465
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,760
However, Mr. Qin,

466
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,240
our Xinxin here is a renowned female artist.

467
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,880
So this amount of money won't actually buy one of her paintings.

468
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,240
100, 5, 1, 2...

469
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,320
107 yuan.

470
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,740
Just wait a moment.

471
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,680
If you pay, you get to take a painting.

472
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,080
See how reasonable he is?

473
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,520
A good opening brings prosperity. Harmony brings wealth.

474
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,920
Why are you so hot-tempered?

475
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,080
How will you get any customers?

476
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,800
With your intelligence, shouldn't you be offering 250?

477
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,440
You don't even meet that standard yet.

478
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,920
No, no. I'm talking about you.

479
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm talking about you.

480
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,260
Mr. Qin.

481
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm talking about you.

482
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,100
Mr. Qin. I'm also an amateur painter.

483
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,400
It's just that my paintings aren't very valuable.

484
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,760
But with this money of yours,

485
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,480
you could buy a painting like this.

486
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,000
Qin Gang.

487
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,120
Today, let me make my first sale.

488
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,080
Is this all you two are capable of?

489
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,480
Yes, that's all we've got.

490
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,440
You think opening an art gallery will help you win the case?

491
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,560
Keep dreaming.

492
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
Let me tell you what I'm most worried about.

493
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,080
It's that when Xiaobao grows up, he'll be mocked

494
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,200
because his mother is a street artist

495
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,080
and a fraud.

496
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,280
Still better than having a jerk for a father, isn't it?

497
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Stop it, please.

498
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,320
Mr. Qin.

499
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, let's talk this through calmly.

500
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,160
Even if you want to sue, there's no need for bad blood.

501
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,800
Well...

502
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,480
Sis.

503
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,360
Look, um...

504
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,120
We just opened and things aren't perfect yet.

505
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,250
Come back next time. Let me see you out.

506
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,800
We'll see about that.

507
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,930
Just get out of here.

508
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,160
Does it look like you?

509
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
Qin Gang,

510
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
don't you want your self-portrait?

511
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,320
You can take this home to ward off evil spirits.

512
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,180
Xinxin, come here.

513
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,720
Come here.

514
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,610
Congratulations on the grand opening of Wan Xinxin's gallery.

515
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,960
Xinxin, even when you're right, you should be gracious.

516
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Why do you have to argue with people?

517
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,960
Didn't you say

518
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,760
I should thank my enemies?

519
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,840
I can't believe this Jiang Xiaoyu.

520
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,170
I have to fight her to the bitter end today.

521
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,960
Do you know what I admire most about you?

522
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,320
This resilient spirit that can't be beaten down.

523
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,450
I bow to you for that.

524
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,760
I'll get it.

525
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,720
Coming.

526
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,360
Hello.

527
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,700
Delivery for Miss Wan.

528
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,280
Who?

529
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,440
Miss Wan.

530
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,160
Okay.

531
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,140
Your delivery.

532
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,520
What is it?

533
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
A summons.

534
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,650
The court hearing is next Tuesday.

535
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,560
Don't sigh like that.

536
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,880
What's meant to come will come eventually.

537
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,000
Do you know why

538
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,120
I'm fighting so hard with this Jiang Xiaoyu?

539
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,320
Because she's right.

540
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,720
These paintings aren't mine.

541
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,080
At least not painted by who I am now.

542
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,480
I hate it when she says things like that,

543
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,080
but I can't argue against it.

544
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,320
Everything is wrong.

545
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,120
Nothing is right. It's all terribly wrong.

546
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Xinxin.

547
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,650
Creative work needs inspiration.

548
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,560
Don't worry. Take your time.

549
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,080
No, how can I take my time?

550
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't have time. The hearing is next Tuesday.

551
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,320
When the judge asks me

552
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,080
how I plan to support my child,

553
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,000
what am I supposed to say?

554
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,660
That I rely on a gallery that can't sell paintings and loses money?

555
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,200
The key issue is that I'm being flooded with negative comments online.

556
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,520
Do you think the judge will award custody

557
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,650
to someone who's being called a fraud?

558
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,000
She replied.

559
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,880
She's crazy.

560
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,880
She talked about Mr. Qin like that.

561
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,920
I don't know if I can keep my job.

562
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,040
I tried to stop her.

563
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,840
You didn't see it.

564
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,730
Qin Gang was really out of line.

565
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,280
If I were Xinxin,

566
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,970
I would've slapped him too.

567
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
They're already divorced,

568
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,360
yet he's still fighting for custody,

569
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,160
and bullying Xinxin at her home.

570
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,520
I held back only because of your job.

571
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,380
Otherwise I would've lost it too.

572
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,000
Get this straight, Xu Chunli.

573
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
What do you mean 'for my job'?

574
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,240
It's for Xiaoxiao's schooling, right?

575
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,240
Your sister, let me tell you,

576
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,160
causes us trouble every day.

577
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,440
She's never been someone who stays out of trouble.

578
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,920
What did I say?

579
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,960
She brings problems wherever she goes.

580
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,160
Don't talk like that.

581
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,140
She's the one who got you this job.

582
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,480
Yes, and because of the job she recommended,

583
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,680
you have no idea how much I suffer at this company,

584
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,320
how much humiliation I endure,

585
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,920
how much abuse I take.

586
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,770
Should I thank her for that?

587
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,120
If there's anything to be thankful for,

588
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,960
it's that I haven't divorced you yet.

589
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,890
So you're still thinking about divorcing me?

590
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,600
I don't work outside the home,

591
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,840
I just serve you at home,

592
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,360
and it's making me sick.

593
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,920
What do you mean?

594
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,360
You want to get a job?

595
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,640
Great! That would be wonderful.

596
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,280
I'd love for you to find a job

597
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,280
and share some of the burden.

598
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,660
If that's how you feel,

599
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,040
I'll go look for a job tomorrow.

600
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,090
It won't be easy.

601
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,360
You're nothing but a

602
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
haggard housewife.

603
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,320
I'm a haggard housewife?

604
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,240
I...

605
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,360
I look this way because of you!

606
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,200
I...

607
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,560
Besides, get up and look at me.

608
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,600
Get up and look!

609
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,560
Am I really a haggard housewife?

610
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,160
Xu Chunli!

611
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm a haggard housewife?

612
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,040
Xu Chunli,

613
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,160
you need to look in the mirror yourself.

614
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,200
It's not up to me.

615
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm going to sleep.

616
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,000
Go away!

617
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,000
I...

618
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm a haggard housewife?

619
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,930
Do I look like an old hag?

620
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,320
Xinxin, look at me.

621
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,720
Talk to me.

622
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,560
Sis, stop bothering me.

623
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,650
I'm creating right now.

624
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Just look at me. Do I really look that haggard?

625
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Fine.

626
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,970
Congratulations, Master Wan.

627
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,400
Is this for me?

628
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,960
Sis.

629
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
Sis, hello.

630
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,570
I didn't know you were here.

631
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,800
Xinxin, turn around and look at me.

632
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm talking to you.

633
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,440
Honey,

634
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,040
are you free this afternoon?

635
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,640
No plans.

636
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,890
Want to go shopping?

637
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
Shopping?

638
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,560
Shopping is fine. What's up?

639
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,980
Then go with my sister.

640
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,920
No, I mean...

641
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,440
Xu Ke has great taste.

642
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
Sis, he picked out all my clothes.

643
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,530
Really, he loves shopping with girls.

644
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,360
I...

645
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,210
Right, Xu Ke?

646
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,800
Sis...

647
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,080
Sis, what's wrong?

648
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Xu Ke,

649
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,060
tell me something.

650
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,960
Am I a frumpy housewife?

651
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Who said that?

652
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,620
I'll kill whoever said it. Who was it?

653
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,660
Your brother-in-law.

654
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,320
My brother-in-law said that?

655
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,920
My brother-in-law is wrong.

656
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,400
Well,

657
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,160
leave it to me, sis.

658
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,640
Reliable.

659
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,640
Let's go!

660
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,520
Come on!

661
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,360
Go ahead, sis.

662
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,480
Alright, let's go.

663
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,530
Don't worry, I'm telling you, sis,

664
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,840
I may not be good at other things,

665
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,360
but I can make you look 10 years younger.

666
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,680
Sis,

667
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,280
you look fine now, you know?

668
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,880
But clothes make the man.

669
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,900
I'll help you get all fixed up.

670
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,960
I guarantee when your husband sees you tonight,

671
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,420
his hair will stand on end.

672
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
My hair is already standing on end.

673
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,160
I... I...

674
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,200
We're practically family now,

675
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,760
and you've been friends with Xinxin for so many years,

676
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,760
but I've never had anyone shop with me for these things.

677
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,400
How about I go in and pick something first,

678
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,760
and you wait here for me? Okay?

679
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,800
Oh my god!

680
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,520
Sis.

681
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,500
No, why are you so old-fashioned?

682
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,160
You just said I've been with Xinxin for so many years.

683
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,720
Who am I? I'm Xinxin's best friend.

684
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,770
Do you know what that means?

685
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,360
You're so funny.

686
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Sis, you're my own sister.

687
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,240
For the happiness of you and my brother-in-law,

688
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,640
I'm helping you pick out a nightgown. What's wrong with that?

689
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,440
Right?

690
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,600
Let's go.

691
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,360
Yes, that's not a problem.

692
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,360
But I...

693
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,280
Sis, I usually don't...

694
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
I didn't bring any money with me.

695
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,200
No money.

696
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,770
How much is a nightgown? It's my treat.

697
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,760
Let's go.

698
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,639
This one is nice.

699
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,840
Nice? How?

700
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,679
It's so ugly and outdated.

701
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,239
Excuse me!

702
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,679
Do you have anything

703
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,320
more trendy and stylish?

704
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,480
Trendy, you say?

705
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,360
How about this one?

706
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,440
This is nice too.

707
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,440
Put it down.

708
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,360
No, sis, why is your taste so outdated?

709
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,250
You're so beautiful and young.

710
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,000
Let me choose for you.

711
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,360
Watch me.

712
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,260
Well, let her choose then.

713
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,000
Look at this one.

714
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
How about it? It's perfect.

715
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,400
This...

716
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:55,760
Yes,

717
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,219
this...

718
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,650
I couldn't possibly wear this.

719
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,240
What's wrong with it? It's just a slip dress.

720
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,440
But this is... this...

721
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,960
Won't you catch cold with your shoulders exposed?

722
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,360
How would you catch cold?

723
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,160
Look,

724
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,640
girls all over town are running around in these.

725
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,500
This is the one.

726
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,410
Excuse me, please wrap this up.

727
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,160
Sure.

728
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,560
Sir, what size does your wife wear?

729
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
I'll get you a new one.

730
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,960
What did you say?

731
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,280
I said, your wife...

732
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Your wife? This is my sister!

733
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,020
What are you thinking?

734
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm sorry.

735
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,760
Hurry up.

736
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,960
Get me a new one.

737
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,680
Okay,

738
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,360
same size.

739
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,000
Look at this, what is all this, really.

740
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,060
I'll go first then.

741
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,280
I'm leaving.

742
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,760
No, wait for me.

743
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,360
Mr. Jiang, look,

744
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,480
these two products aren't selling well lately,

745
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,280
what should we do?

746
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,320
I'm aware of the situation,

747
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,560
so we all need to work together.

748
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,040
Yes.

749
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,800
For example, during yesterday's meeting,

750
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,720
we discussed

751
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,600
whether this product could be...

752
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Jiang Kaiyang.

753
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,680
Mr. Qin, what can I do for you?

754
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,680
You haven't been working very hard lately.

755
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,680
Mr. Qin, who told you that?

756
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,800
You don't know the whole story.

757
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,720
I've been working on several big deals lately.

758
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,960
If they go through, our company's performance

759
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,920
will double.

760
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,170
But I haven't seen any results.

761
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,640
Do you see that position over there?

762
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,360
In the back.

763
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,000
That's the new position I've prepared for you.

764
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,720
Reception desk?

765
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,440
Mr. Qin, this job isn't suitable for me.

766
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,440
How could I possibly work at the reception desk?

767
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,320
With my appearance?

768
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,850
If I sit there, I'll scare away the customers.

769
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,400
I know.

770
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,020
I know you haven't been in a good mood lately.

771
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Wan Xinxin must have made you angry.

772
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,080
Did I mention Wan Xinxin?

773
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Did I say anything about Wan Xinxin?

774
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,980
Do you think that as long as Wan Xinxin is around,

775
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,800
it guarantees

776
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,560
that I won't fire you? Is that it?

777
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,040
No, I understand this.

778
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,640
You can fire me anytime.

779
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,810
Of course, that's not what I meant.

780
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,900
What I meant is that it's good to have you around.

781
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,080
Thank you.

782
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,680
As another punching bag.

783
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,320
Right.

784
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,680
Mr. Qin, if I can be your punching bag,

785
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,800
I'd be incredibly proud, right?

786
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,520
Well,

787
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,840
but I have other skills too.

788
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,520
For example,

789
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,920
I'm negotiating several big deals.

790
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,960
If they go through, our store's business

791
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,520
will really double.

792
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,560
Really?

793
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,080
I can stake my reputation on it.

794
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,160
Fine. You said it yourself.

795
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,400
If you succeed,

796
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,080
I'll make you the store manager.

797
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,360
If you fail,

798
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,170
you'll work at the reception desk.

799
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Sis, I think you need to loosen up a bit.

800
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,120
You need to make your husband interested in you again.

801
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,200
You need to make him feel

802
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,040
that you're attractive in his eyes,

803
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,840
not just some frumpy housewife.

804
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,720
Our generation was all about

805
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,080
studying, finding jobs, getting married, having kids.

806
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,210
We never thought about all this stuff.

807
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,280
So let me tell you, sis.

808
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,120
Well...

809
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,960
Men, you see...

810
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,080
The seven-year itch.

811
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,160
You've been together more than seven years, right?

812
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,490
So you need to keep reinventing yourself.

813
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,040
That's how you'll keep

814
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,460
your husband's heart.

815
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,840
This nightgown is just the beginning.

816
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,640
It's only the start.

817
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,920
Next you need to learn how to do makeup,

818
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,050
how to wear perfume,

819
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,620
how to dress beautifully.

820
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,160
And so on.

821
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,880
If a woman wants to be loved,

822
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,720
she must love herself first.

823
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,600
Women your age

824
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,320
all have the same problem.

825
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,120
You always think that managing the household well

826
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,240
and being thrifty is enough to keep a man's heart.

827
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,040
That's right.

828
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,740
Right? No, completely wrong!

829
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,680
Relationships need to be maintained.

830
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,960
You know, you need to...

831
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,720
You need a new hairstyle.

832
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,120
This hair won't do.

833
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,260
It's too late for that now.

834
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,250
I still need to go home and cook.

835
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,880
I just finished telling you,

836
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,940
and there's your old thinking again.

837
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,160
Anyone can talk.

838
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,600
But if I don't cook,

839
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,260
he'll just start an argument.

840
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,560
Well, well...

841
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,160
It's too late anyway.

842
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,400
I'll take you to get something intense.

843
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,920
Xu Chunli.

844
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,380
Xu Chunli, why haven't you made any food?

845
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Xu Chunli.

846
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Xu Chunli.

847
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,200
Kaiyang.

848
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,060
What are you doing? Why are you closing the curtains

849
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,600
in broad daylight?

850
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
What's going on? It's the middle of the day.

851
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,880
What are you

852
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,920
doing right now?

853
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

854
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,600
This is more like a shock.

855
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,560
This...

856
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,400
Take it off.

857
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,040
Doesn't it look good?

858
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,080
What are you trying to do?

859
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,720
How could this possibly look good?

860
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,380
How old are you now, Xu Chunli?

861
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
I did my makeup just like this on our wedding day.

862
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,160
When you got married, you were

863
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,960
a young girl.

864
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,520
But now you've done yourself up like this.

865
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,880
Just look at your lips.

866
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,720
Wipe it off quickly.

867
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
I'm wiping it off.

868
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,320
What are you trying to do?

869
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm about to lose my job,

870
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,240
and you're doing this every day.

871
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,240
I haven't even eaten yet.

872
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,760
I'll go make something for you.

873
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,290
Make what? Do I even have an appetite anymore?

874
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,260
Do you understand?

875
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,240
Where are you going then?

876
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,890
I'm going out for some noodles.

877
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,920
Miss Wan.

878
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,980
Attorney Chen.

879
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,600
Xinxin, why bother?

880
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,280
With your pathetic little team,

881
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,960
you still think you can win this case?

882
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,800
Give it up.

883
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,600
Give Xiaobao to me,

884
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,880
and I'll give him a good life.

885
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Don't worry.

886
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,660
I will never hand Xiaobao over to you.

887
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,540
Your Honor, members of the court.

888
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,720
I have an important matter to add.

889
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,360
Wan Xinxin has been

890
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,720
fired multiple times over the past few months.

891
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,280
She has been unemployed for a long time.

892
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,130
Even her basic living expenses

893
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,660
have to be covered by her friends and family.

894
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li
