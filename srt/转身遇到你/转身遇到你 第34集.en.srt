1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,120
Director Chen says you're an expert in this field.

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,479
You're the only one who can save her now.

4
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,220
Xinxin, do you understand

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
surgery is not a game?

6
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,370
Mrs. Qin has helped many patients.

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
I wish I could help her too, but

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,009
I'm not in the right condition to perform surgery right now.

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,520
Huaming.

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
Could you

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,800
do this surgery for me?

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
I believe in you. I know you can do it.

13
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,120
Please, I'm begging you.

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,480
Huaming.

15
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,880
I've already contacted Professor Wei.

16
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,560
He agreed to provide guidance

17
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,760
via video call during our operation.

18
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,130
I hope you'll be the lead surgeon and I'll assist you.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,560
It's all up to you now.

20
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,640
Hello, Dr. Wei.

21
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,400
Huaming.

22
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
I'm really sorry.

23
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,320
Something urgent came up

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,380
and I can't make it there for the surgery.

25
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,090
Now you'll have to complete it on your own.

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,440
Believe in yourself.

27
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
I understand.

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
Prepare for surgery.

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
Thank you.

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,800
Doctor, excuse me.

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
Who's the lead surgeon?

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,320
It's Dr. Hua Ming.

34
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,170
Isn't Hua Ming a veterinarian?

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,280
He's like a god in our medical field.

36
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
He's very famous.

37
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,440
Who would have thought that after leaving medicine for three years,

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,680
he'd return to lead such a complex surgery.

39
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
It's remarkable.

40
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,260
That's absolutely right.

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,160
How can this be happening?

42
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,040
Director Chen just explained that

43
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,760
your wife's condition is an emergency.

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,820
Right now, only Hua Ming can save her.

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Director Chen is assisting him,

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,620
and Professor Wei from America is providing remote guidance.

47
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,010
Don't worry. Worrying won't help.

48
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
Let's pray together

49
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,769
for the success of her surgery.

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,520
Are you ready?

51
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,760
Ready.

52
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,450
Let's begin the operation.

53
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Dr. Chen.

54
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,880
I'm going to separate the surface of the wound now.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,330
Move gently and follow my lead.

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,930
Alright.

57
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,360
Let's start.

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,080
Qin Gang.

59
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,250
Why are you here?

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm worried about your mom and you.

61
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,300
Of course I should be with you at a time like this.

62
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,960
Xinxin is here too.

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,560
The lead surgeon is Huaming.

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Xinxin came to cheer him up.

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,000
Besides,

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Enough. No need to explain.

67
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
At a time like this, I understand.

68
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,200
Dr. Ye,

69
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,800
get ready.

70
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,120
Monitor breathing, blood pressure, and vital signs constantly.

71
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,640
Okay.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,640
Slowly.

73
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,500
Has Mrs. Qin mentioned anything about property division?

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,640
The old lady is still in surgery.

75
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,120
I can't believe you're bringing this up.

76
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
Are you cursing her?

77
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm only thinking of your best interests.

78
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
What if Mrs. Qin

79
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
has some kind of accident?

80
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,320
You and your little boy won't get a penny.

81
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,159
Wouldn't that be a huge loss?

82
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,760
I never wanted anything.

83
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,000
But Mrs. Qin will definitely leave a large sum of money

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,530
for her precious grandson.

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,530
That's her decision. It has nothing to do with me.

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,680
Leaving it to her grandson is basically leaving it to you.

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Wan Xinxin, you're so lucky.

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,160
It seems everyone likes you.

89
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Doesn't Qin Gang like you a lot too?

90
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,920
Who knows?

91
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,520
What he really thinks deep down,

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,260
I'm not entirely sure.

93
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,320
I really feel sorry for Qin Gang.

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,360
You've been together for so long,

95
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,690
and you still doubt him.

96
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,440
Wan Xinxin.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,700
Actually, I don't hate you that much.

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
To be honest, sometimes

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm even a bit jealous of you.

100
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Money?

101
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,360
Mrs. Qin will definitely leave you a fortune.

102
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,400
Career?

103
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,370
Hua Ming would sell everything he has to open an art gallery for you.

104
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,200
Love?

105
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,720
You're a divorced woman with a child,

106
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,320
yet Hua Ming is still so devoted to you.

107
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,720
Your life is simply perfect.

108
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,440
Sometimes I feel like

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,820
even Qin Gang was just your handout to me.

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,480
Think whatever you want.

111
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,760
I'm not the fluid in your brain.

112
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,610
I can't stop your thoughts.

113
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,080
So whenever I see you,

114
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
I feel suffocated.

115
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,980
Stop beating around the bush.

116
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,370
What do you want now?

117
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,360
I really want to congratulate you and Hua Ming.

118
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,040
But I think the two of you together

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,520
is truly pathetic.

120
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,450
More pathetic than you?

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,240
Don't you think

122
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,080
there's something familiar about Hua Ming?

123
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,560
Yes, I feel like we

124
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,760
even have that old married couple vibe.

125
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,340
Do you really think you two are right for each other?

126
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,340
More suitable than with Qin Gang.

127
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,280
The one who failed to save your father

128
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,440
was also a famous neurosurgeon.

129
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,890
What do you mean?

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,760
You should go back

131
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,360
and take a close look at that death certificate.

132
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,620
You might find a surprising revelation.

133
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,060
Heart rate 140.

134
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,490
Spasm on the right side.

135
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,880
0.2 phenol injection.

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,880
Good.

137
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,480
Intravenous.

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,920
Let the senior handle it.

139
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,000
Heart rate is returning to normal.

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,280
Spasm relieved.

141
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,880
Xiao Qing.

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,460
Yes.

143
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,120
Wipe the sweat.

144
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,640
Okay.

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,040
Everyone pay attention. I'm going to do the final suture.

146
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,640
Done.

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
Dr. Hua, the surgery was successful.

148
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,650
Systolic pressure 100.

149
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,160
Heart rate 60.

150
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
This case.

151
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,000
The malignant glioma surgery

152
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,180
has been successful thanks to everyone's efforts.

153
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you all.

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,760
Good work.

155
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,300
It's a success.

156
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,000
Huaming.

157
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,660
You're still the same.

158
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,280
Our top neurosurgeon.

159
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,320
Welcome back.

160
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,240
Take it easy.

161
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,880
Mom.

162
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,080
Mom.

163
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,480
Mom.

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,730
Doctor, how is my mother doing?

165
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,280
The surgery was successful.

166
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,680
I told you so.

167
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,440
Your mother is blessed with good fortune.

168
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,040
She'll definitely recover.

169
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,520
Let's not talk too much and hurry to the ICU.

170
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,880
We'll talk more after the patient wakes up.

171
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,200
Mom, can you hear me?

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
The surgery was successful.

173
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,280
Did you know all along?

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,820
Why did you hide it from me?

175
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,080
Are you with me out of pity?

176
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,000
Do you pity me?

177
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,000
What are you to me exactly?

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
Why does it have to be you?

179
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,760
Why does it have to be you?

180
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,690
Xinxin, what are you doing?

181
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,980
This is a hospital.

182
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,340
W-what's going on?

183
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,480
Xinxin.

184
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,100
You've been working hard these days.

185
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,500
As long as my mom is safe and sound,

186
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,450
this little effort is nothing.

187
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,160
I love this about you.

188
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,340
You've been working hard too these days.

189
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,480
I haven't been able to spend much time with you lately.

190
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,540
By the way, how's the 4S dealership acquisition going?

191
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,600
It's going well.

192
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,500
Everything is under control.

193
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,780
Just focus on taking care of your mother.

194
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,240
When she gets better,

195
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,440
we'll give her a big surprise together.

196
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,120
Xinxin.

197
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
Please stop avoiding me.

198
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,320
Can we meet?

199
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,040
Please.

200
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,890
All vital signs are stable.

201
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,010
Can you predict when the patient will wake up?

202
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,040
Probably within 24 hours.

203
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,770
Director Chen, I need your help with this.

204
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,400
Regarding the patient's condition,

205
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
please monitor her constantly.

206
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,960
I'll arrange it.

207
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,360
Good.

208
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,000
Is my mom okay?

209
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,600
Qin Gang, I just checked.

210
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
All her vital signs are very stable.

211
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,330
If there are no complications,

212
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,240
your mother's life expectancy

213
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,640
could be extended by 3 to 5 years without any problem.

214
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,720
But there's one thing you must pay attention to.

215
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,800
After she wakes up,

216
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,320
you can't let her experience any emotional fluctuations.

217
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,160
Because any emotional disturbance

218
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,880
could potentially be fatal for her.

219
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,200
Okay, I understand.

220
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,780
Talk to her more often.

221
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
Huaming, you've surprised me again.

222
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,320
Dr. Wei, I

223
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,200
just did what I was supposed to do.

224
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,240
It was your surgical plan

225
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,570
that was so successful.

226
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,720
Professor Wei.

227
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,560
Huaming can take your job now.

228
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
Let him try.

229
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
It's always good to have competition.

230
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,760
Huaming.

231
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,040
I knew you would complete the surgery successfully.

232
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,760
But I really didn't expect

233
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,400
you could also perform

234
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,490
the carmustine release procedure simultaneously.

235
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,130
Though you haven't operated for three years,

236
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,120
you haven't lost your skills at all.

237
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,480
Teacher, you're too kind.

238
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,260
Huaming, you'll have to teach me more in the future.

239
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,360
Senior, what are you talking about?

240
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,560
Our mentor is right here.

241
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,000
How could I dare show off?

242
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,720
Alright, let's stop being so formal.

243
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,360
Huaming, through this surgery,

244
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
you've fully recovered,

245
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,360
even surpassed your previous level.

246
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,720
I really want you to join my team in America.

247
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,040
Professor Wei.

248
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,480
You're trying to steal my person!

249
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Weimin, I want him to come

250
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,400
to do some research projects with me.

251
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,220
He can also perform surgeries at your hospital.

252
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
It won't interfere with either.

253
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,160
It'll just take a bit longer.

254
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,250
This is a good thing.

255
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
Then it's happily decided.

256
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,400
One is a mentor like my father,

257
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
one is my senior.

258
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
I haven't even said anything yet,

259
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,890
and you've already decided for me.

260
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,800
Mom.

261
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,200
Doctor, come quickly! My mother is awake!

262
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,770
Doctor, hurry! My mother is awake!

263
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,210
All vital signs are normal.

264
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,000
Good.

265
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,800
Thank you.

266
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,960
Huaming, you have the nerve to come see me.

267
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,840
Auntie, I'm your attending physician.

268
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,060
Of course I had to come.

269
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,520
You made me a promise.

270
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,120
While in America,

271
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,240
Dr. Wei assembled a team of specialists

272
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,040
specifically for your surgical treatment.

273
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,840
They created a special treatment plan,

274
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,760
and he thought I was the best candidate,

275
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,960
so I came back.

276
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,320
Then I still need to thank you.

277
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,000
But you broke your promise.

278
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,720
Auntie, let's discuss this when you're feeling better.

279
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,080
What you need now is emotional calm.

280
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,680
I am calm.

281
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,600
I just want to know

282
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,480
how you plan to face Xinxin.

283
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,160
She already knows.

284
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,440
You can't hide forever.

285
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,520
I thought if you two separated,

286
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,250
everything would be resolved.

287
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,120
Now it seems my efforts were in vain.

288
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,360
Dr. Hua.

289
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,960
I have one more request.

290
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,050
Please tell me, Auntie.

291
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,200
Xiaogang is too naive.

292
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,440
For him to grow,

293
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
he will certainly face setbacks.

294
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
I'm afraid when these challenges come unexpectedly,

295
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,850
he won't be able to handle them.

296
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,160
So I'm asking you,

297
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,840
when he's at his most difficult time and needs help,

298
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,640
that you'll step in and help him.

299
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,200
Auntie, you're a good person.

300
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,240
You've donated so much money

301
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,940
and helped so many people.

302
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,090
You deserve help yourself.

303
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,320
I promise you, no matter what,

304
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,600
whenever Qin Gang faces any difficulties,

305
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,880
if he needs my help,

306
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,570
I will absolutely do everything I can.

307
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,280
Your word is enough for me.

308
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,880
I hope you'll be a person who keeps their promises.

309
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,320
Don't worry.

310
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,560
Ma'am.

311
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,050
I don't want to deceive you.

312
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,120
Your condition can't be cured, only managed to extend your time.

313
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,280
I know.

314
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I never expected that one surgery

315
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,680
would lead to a complete recovery.

316
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,440
Hey, Liu Chang.

317
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,160
I saw Wan Xinxin holding a dog

318
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,320
taking photos at your place.

319
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,040
When was that taken?

320
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,200
Okay, never mind.

321
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,760
I'll go in by myself.

322
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,610
Why are you still following me?

323
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,840
I want to see your mom too.

324
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,040
Hua Ming told me

325
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,960
my mother can't handle any stress right now.

326
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
So please bear with it.

327
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,040
But why do you believe

328
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,320
what that vet said?

329
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,840
This isn't the time for us

330
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,600
to be arguing, okay? My mom-

331
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,520
Qin Gang.

332
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
Who are you talking to?

333
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,480
Look.

334
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,200
Auntie.

335
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
See? I told you.

336
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,940
Good people are blessed. You're fine after all.

337
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,960
Thank you for your concern, Miss Liu.

338
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Xiaogang.

339
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,960
I need to talk to you.

340
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,920
Mom, go ahead.

341
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,240
I'll excuse myself then.

342
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,240
No need.

343
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Miss Liu might as well hear this too.

344
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,040
Xiaogang, I know about my condition.

345
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,600
If someday

346
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,640
something happens to me,

347
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,320
I've already arranged our family assets.

348
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,580
The lawyer will come to our house as soon as I'm discharged.

349
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,720
Mom,

350
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,080
can we not talk about this right now?

351
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,280
Just focus on getting better.

352
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,400
No, right now

353
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,170
it's even more necessary to discuss this.

354
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,920
Since Miss Liu has been concerned about it too.

355
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,720
Auntie, I haven't at all.

356
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,880
We're all sensible people here.

357
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,320
No need to hide anything.

358
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,120
Actually, the distribution of our family assets is quite simple.

359
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,600
The 4S dealership and the villa go to Qin Gang.

360
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,160
All my other assets

361
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,970
will belong to my grandson.

362
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,640
Before Xiaobao comes of age,

363
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,760
Wan Xinxin will manage and control them.

364
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,000
No.

365
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,080
Mom.

366
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,040
What?

367
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,360
How could you do this?

368
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,640
Xinxin is indeed Xiaobao's mother.

369
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,120
But she's still an outsider.

370
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,840
Why can't I manage things anymore?

371
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Are you really that afraid

372
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,900
that I'll embezzle all these assets?

373
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,280
Yes, auntie.

374
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,610
I also think what you're doing is inappropriate.

375
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,240
I'm informing you,

376
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,000
not consulting with you.

377
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
No, Mom, you—

378
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,800
Enough.

379
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,280
Let's go.

380
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,130
Mom, let me tell you.

381
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,800
Wan Xinxin

382
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,020
Congratulations.

383
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,820
What do you want to say now?

384
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,400
What are you telling her?

385
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,920
Why can't I say it?

386
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,000
Auntie plans

387
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
to leave all her property to Bao

388
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,680
for you to manage.

389
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,840
Yes. Perhaps you thought

390
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,520
Qin Gang wronged you first.

391
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,610
But he has already apologized.

392
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,440
I can also apologize to him

393
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,250
and to you again right here.

394
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm begging you, please don't agree to Auntie's request.

395
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,890
I won't treat you unfairly.

396
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,920
I'll give you a large sum of money so you won't have to worry about anything.

397
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Are you finished?

398
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,130
Are you done?

399
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,090
Then please step aside.

400
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,640
Wait.

401
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,720
Xinxin, I want to hear your thoughts.

402
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,420
I'm just here to see Auntie today.

403
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,580
I don't have as many schemes as you do.

404
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,320
Mrs. Qin.

405
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,960
Xinxin.

406
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,370
Are you feeling better?

407
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm better.

408
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,560
Much better now.

409
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,680
Thank God.

410
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,600
The surgery was so successful.

411
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,640
Xinxin, after going through this ordeal,

412
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,600
I worry about you the most.

413
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,600
These days,

414
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,440
even in my dreams, I see you and Xiaogang

415
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,440
together with the baby.

416
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,280
Since you're both here,

417
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,400
let me speak from my heart.

418
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,730
Please go ahead.

419
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,720
It seems unlikely now

420
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,320
for you and Xiaogang to remarry.

421
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,320
It's between you two,

422
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,679
I shouldn't interfere too much.

423
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,000
But Xinxin,

424
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,000
my greatest wish is for you and Xiaogang

425
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,159
to raise the baby together.

426
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,239
Don't worry, Mrs. Qin.

427
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,960
I'll make sure the baby grows up happy.

428
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,000
As for Qin Gang and me,

429
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,260
we'll let fate decide.

430
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
Mom, please don't worry.

431
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm not worried.

432
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,400
You're actually my biggest concern.

433
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,960
Tell me if you two

434
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,040
can give me any hope.

435
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,440
I could die in peace then.

436
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,960
Mom, you need to rest well now

437
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,220
and focus on recovery.

438
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,040
Xinxin and I

439
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,000
will sort things out ourselves.

440
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,720
Well...

441
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,040
Xinxin, tell me,

442
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,400
is there any chance you two might get back together?

443
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,800
Your main priority now

444
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,240
is to get proper rest.

445
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,840
Once you're better, you can leave the hospital

446
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,900
and we can all be together as a family.

447
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,960
Do you hate Xiaogang?

448
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,140
No, I don't.

449
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,200
Do you hate Huaming then?

450
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,120
Can you forgive Huaming?

451
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,760
You see, this is fate.

452
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,540
Let me tell you something.

453
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,960
The person you truly love

454
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,000
may not necessarily be

455
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,280
the one who spends their life with you.

456
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,640
But Xiaogang is different.

457
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,240
Can you give him another chance?

458
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,720
I understand, auntie.

459
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,770
Please focus on getting better first.

460
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,360
We can discuss this after you're discharged, okay?

461
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,770
Look at your situation now.

462
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,240
You already know

463
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,600
you and Huaming can never be together.

464
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,520
He's the one who hurt your father.

465
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,060
Please, I'm begging you, don't say anymore.

466
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,960
Okay, I'm sorry.

467
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,000
I just had surgery

468
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,320
and my mind isn't clear. I'm saying too much.

469
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,720
Xinxin.

470
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,760
Auntie,

471
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,420
I'll come back another day

472
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,010
and bring your grandson to see you.

473
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Good.

474
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,040
Hello,

475
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,360
Xuke, wait for me at the gallery.

476
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,480
I'll be right back.

477
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,960
Xinxin,

478
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,410
listen to me.

479
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,360
Xinxin!

480
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
Oh my!

481
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,920
Wow, you two have

482
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,650
such a huge secret between you.

483
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,760
What the hell did he do?

484
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,120
I guess he didn't know before.

485
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,460
It was just a coincidence.

486
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,720
No, I need to talk to him.

487
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,120
Look, things are like this.

488
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,920
He still insists he's not wrong.

489
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,760
Is something going on?

490
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,280
Logically, he's not the type of person

491
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,880
who avoids responsibility.

492
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,920
I think I fell in love with the wrong person.

493
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,840
No, no, no.

494
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,040
Calm down first. Don't think like that.

495
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,570
Don't jump to conclusions.

496
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,440
I think, you see...

497
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,520
He'd rather hurt your feelings

498
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,380
than compromise his principles.

499
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,320
This can only mean one thing.

500
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,860
He has his reasons.

501
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,040
So you should give him a chance.

502
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,290
There's no chance for this matter.

503
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,600
I mean give him a chance to explain.

504
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,090
Stay here. I'll go find him.

505
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,400
Don't say anything, bro.

506
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,900
I know everything.

507
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,770
Wan Xinxin told me everything.

508
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,010
She understands you now

509
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,800
but can't face you.

510
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,480
As your good friend and her best friend,

511
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,120
I don't want

512
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,050
things to have turned out this way.

513
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,640
I've watched your relationship develop all along.

514
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,300
I know how deep your feelings are for each other.

515
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,080
Otherwise I wouldn't have flown back

516
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,840
from my honeymoon, right?

517
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,640
Bro, I just want to say one thing.

518
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,760
I'll do my best

519
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,120
to get Wan Xinxin to see you.

520
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,040
But how that conversation goes

521
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,160
is between you two.

522
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,980
In this situation,

523
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,720
no one can help you.

524
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,040
Bro,

525
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,400
it's up to you now.

526
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,780
I've said my piece.

527
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,320
Xiaoyu,

528
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,210
I need a favor today.

529
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Please transfer all the money

530
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,240
I've kept with you to my account.

531
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,240
Just say what you want to say.

532
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,080
You're awake. I'm Xu Ke.

533
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,040
I just got back from out of town.

534
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,440
I heard you had surgery, so I came to see you.

535
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,920
Okay. Thank you.

536
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,400
We don't know each other well. Please get to the point.

537
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,640
Then I'll be direct.

538
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,640
I'm here about Wan Xinxin.

539
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,040
Yes, I mainly want to ask you a question.

540
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,320
If Wan Xinxin were your daughter,

541
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,080
would you want her to be with Qin Gang

542
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,370
or with Hua Ming?

543
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,880
You don't need to answer right away.

544
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,960
I'm just asking.

545
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,360
Because right now, those two

546
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,380
can't see each other anymore.

547
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,360
Because Wan Xinxin

548
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,720
won't even give Hua Ming a chance to explain.

549
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,520
I'm her best friend, and even I can't persuade her.

550
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,880
I know what you're thinking.

551
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,240
You've always wanted

552
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,100
Qin Gang and Wan Xinxin to get back together, right?

553
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,080
So, back to my question.

554
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,850
If Wan Xinxin's parents were still alive,

555
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,290
they would also want her to have a good future,

556
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,260
wouldn't they?

557
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,890
So she really needs someone's help right now.

558
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,520
How to choose?

559
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,450
It's all up to you in the end.

560
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,240
