1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,560
Xu Ke, I've got the child.

3
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,820
The car is in position. Get ready to move.

4
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,320
Look! In the hallway! Look!

5
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
No, wait! Someone's carrying the child! Hurry!

6
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,560
Alert! Alert!

7
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,680
Someone has the child!

8
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,480
Stop her quickly!

9
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,240
In the hallway!

10
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,300
Do you see the baby?

11
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,320
Xu Ke, start the engine!

12
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:34,960
What?

13
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,440
Start the car! Drive!

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,860
Where are they?

15
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,260
Over there!

16
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,140
After them!

17
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Stop right there.

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,880
Take me far away.

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,280
Alright, stop singing.

20
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
Stop flying around.

21
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,680
Let me ask you.

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
Why were you rushing

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
out of there just now?

24
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,240
You have no idea.

25
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,960
I finally escaped.

26
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
A place that costs tens of thousands a month,

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,800
and you're making it sound like prison.

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
You really don't know.

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,970
It's worse than prison.

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Let me tell you.

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
All I do all day is eat and sleep.

32
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,290
If I cough even once,

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,480
a crowd of people rush over.

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,520
They practically want to give me a full-body examination.

35
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,280
How many pregnant women in this country can be like you,

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
taking your blessings for granted?

37
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,920
I'm telling you, your husband's money is being wasted.

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,720
Where did you get this luxury car today?

39
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,360
How about it? Isn't it cool?

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,160
Did you meet some rich lady recently?

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,960
Oh, stop it.

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
It's rented.

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,980
Today's client is a beautiful woman. A real beauty.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,960
She says she's Miss Liu.

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
I told her we'll meet another day.

46
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,900
She insists on seeing you.

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,290
I don't even want to see myself.

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,400
Let me do it.

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Take it easy.

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,520
He's fallen asleep.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,920
Alright, honey. Let's go see Dad.

52
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,160
Go ahead.

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,959
Wait, aren't you coming with me?

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,519
I'll pass.

55
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,480
Your husband and I don't get along.

56
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,400
Besides, I have to meet a beautiful client.

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,040
Get lost.

58
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,160
Aren't you going to congratulate me on my success?

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,730
I waited for you for 6 years.

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Only to hear that you got married.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
My mother was seriously ill.

62
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,600
All she wanted was to hold her grandchild.

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,659
But where were you?

64
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,400
Qin Gang.

65
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm back.

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,450
I realized I still love you.

67
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,170
That's why I got divorced and came back to you.

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,080
I know you still love me too.

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,180
This time I'm back,

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,130
let's never be apart again.

71
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,440
Okay?

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
Hello, Mrs. Qin.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,440
Hello.

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,320
Mrs. Qin.

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,120
Lili.

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,720
How's the baby?

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,880
Look.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
Oh, so cute!

79
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,890
Where's Mr. Qin?

80
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
He's in the office.

81
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,140
I'll go ahead then.

82
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,480
You already have a son.

83
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,820
Liu Wei.

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,960
Do you truly love her?

85
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,280
Can you really spend the rest of your life with her?

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,400
Baby.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
Honey, look who's here.

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,280
You... why are you here?

89
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Who is she?

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,700
She's a friend of mine.

91
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,500
What bullshit friend.

92
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,600
Stop lying to me.

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,400
Don't mess around.

94
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,320
I'm not lying to anyone.

95
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,780
Stop fooling around, kid.

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,480
Beast!

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
Beast! Beast!

98
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Xinxin!

99
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,520
Qin Gang!

100
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
Does it hurt?

101
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
I'll go after her.

102
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,320
Hey, Zheng.

103
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,060
Okay, I'll be right there.

104
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,160
The number you have dialed is currently switched off.

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,640
Please try again later.

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,850
Driver, could you please roll up the window a bit?

107
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,570
Who's there?

108
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,040
Who are you?

109
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
What are you doing in my car?

110
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
You scared me to death! Who are you?

111
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm talking to you.

112
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,650
Do you know how badly you scared me?

113
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,400
Don't go!

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
Who are you?

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,120
I'm asking you a question. Who are you?

116
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,720
What? Sorry for what?

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,920
Don't you know scaring people like that can be deadly?

119
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Look at my arm hair.

120
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,960
It's all standing on end.

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,020
Who... who are you?

122
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,160
Don't go!

123
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,340
Is this your child?

124
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,930
Are you a child trafficker?

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Who are you calling a trafficker?

126
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,800
What do you mean?

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,280
Why are you in my car?

128
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,360
Don't go.

129
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
Explain yourself or we're going to the police station.

130
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,920
Listen, don't mess with me.

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,800
You'd better disappear from my sight right now.

132
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,880
What? Why should I disappear?

133
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,040
This is my car. Why should I leave?

134
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,200
Why are you in my car?

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,360
Talking to me and closing the window.

136
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,690
Explain yourself or you're going to the police station.

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,720
Don't cry.

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,039
I'm not crying, why are you?

139
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,020
The baby is hungry.

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
I need to find a place to breastfeed.

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,880
Can I borrow your car for a while?

142
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,120
You're really rude.

143
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,220
Alright, alright.

144
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,360
You're watching me breastfeed?

145
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,960
Step back further.

146
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,800
What's going on here?

147
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,640
Come on, let me see.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,800
Ouch! Okay, okay.

149
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,120
Can you believe a grown person

150
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,720
just disappeared like that?

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,120
And of all people,

152
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,240
a fragile woman who just gave birth.

153
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,720
Sis.

154
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,180
Qin Gang, why are you here?

155
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,560
Where's

156
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,880
Xinxin? Where is she?

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,500
Qin Gang, don't panic.

158
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,560
She probably felt cooped up in here

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,890
and just stepped out. She'll be back soon.

160
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,760
This time it's different.

161
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,890
How is it different?

162
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,800
Listen, if she comes back,

163
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,840
notify me immediately.

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,800
And remember one thing:

165
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,640
tell her that whatever the issue is,

166
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,480
we'll discuss it when we meet.

167
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,200
That's it.

168
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,320
Okay, I got it.

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,180
I'll give her a good talking-to when she comes back.

170
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,800
What's wrong with him?

171
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,400
The number you have dialed is currently switched off.

172
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,800
Please try again later.

173
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,880
Oh my goodness.

174
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,520
What drama is this now?

175
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,560
Qin Gang, you bastard!

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
You bastard, Qin Gang!

177
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,040
Why are you treating me like this?

178
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Beast!

179
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,320
Calling you a beast

180
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
isn't an exaggeration at all.

181
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,480
You bastard, Qin Gang!

182
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,520
Why are you doing this to me?

183
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,640
Beast!

184
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,680
That beast Qin Gang!

185
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,680
Bastard!

186
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,920
Miss?

187
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
Bastard!

188
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,800
Miss, where's your tail?

189
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,960
To hell with your tail!

190
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,560
No, look.

191
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
The sea, the reef.

192
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,240
Do you think you're a mermaid?

193
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
You are a mermaid.

194
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,120
Miss.

195
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,760
Mermaid, yes, look.

196
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,220
Look, just like a mermaid.

197
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,320
See? Your head facing me, your tail facing the sea.

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,040
You're the mermaid!

199
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,600
Your whole family are mermaids!

200
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,560
Get lost!

201
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,480
Look.

202
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,120
Miss, the sea breeze is quite strong.

203
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,480
I need to take this little mermaid

204
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,610
back to shore first.

205
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,160
Stop right there!

206
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,840
I won't move.

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,400
Look.

208
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,220
Not moving.

209
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,690
Get lost!

210
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,240
Okay, I'm going.

211
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm not moving.

212
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,800
Leave me alone!

213
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
Bastard!

214
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,820
I must have been blind to fall for you!

215
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,680
Bastard!

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,080
Beast!

217
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,240
Beast!

218
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,440
Beast!

219
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,240
Miss.

220
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,200
Miss, it's dangerous! Get up!

221
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
Don't touch me!

222
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,400
Leave me alone!

223
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,840
Bastard!

224
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,200
You think your money gives you the right to cheat?

225
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,460
I'll let go. Please stop pulling my hair.

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,920
Come on, let me take you home.

227
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,980
I'll take you home. Where do you live?

228
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,800
I have no home.

229
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
What? No home?

230
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,640
Everyone has a home.

231
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,700
Where do you live? I'll take you back.

232
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,840
You're such a beast!

233
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,640
Why did you cheat?

234
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,480
I didn't cheat. I don't even know you, miss.

235
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,280
The child is still so young!

236
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Okay, I understand.

237
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,520
You're right about everything.

238
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
Phone! Your phone is ringing!

239
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,800
Your phone is ringing.

240
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
Your phone. See if someone's looking for you.

241
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,800
Please let go of my hand first.

242
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
Hello? Husband?

243
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,120
Who are you?

244
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
Never mind who I am.

245
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,440
Your wife is drunk.

246
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
And she has a child with her.

247
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,320
My child?

248
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,820
What have you done to them?

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,280
Bring them to me!

250
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,480
How can I bring them to you?

251
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,880
I can't handle her.

252
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,880
You should come pick her up.

253
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,680
Well,

254
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,440
where are you? I'll come get them.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,960
Bihai Park.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
Please take care of them there.

257
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,020
I'll come get them right away.

258
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240
I found Xinxin and the child!

259
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,680
Over here! Over here!

260
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,200
Is this them?

261
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,760
This way! This way!

262
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,220
Xinxin!

263
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,480
What's going on here?

264
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,880
Is the child safe with you?

266
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,800
Don't worry.

267
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,120
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,640
Please take this.

270
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,480
What are you doing?

271
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,010
That's not enough. Come on.

272
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,960
What's not enough?

273
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,000
You guys are so unreliable.

274
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,240
What time did I call you?

275
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,760
And you're only coming to pick me up now.

276
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,160
They've held me for hours.

277
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,560
Quickly, make her let go.

278
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

279
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
Excuse me, excuse me.

280
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,440
Xinxin.

281
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,080
What's wrong with your family?

282
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,240
You're all so unreliable.

283
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,570
Let's go, let's go home.

284
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,920
Oh my goodness.

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
Stop messing around. Let's go.

286
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,000
Go. Let's go.

287
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Tell her to let go.

288
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,920
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,570
Let's go.

290
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
No, don't pull so hard.

291
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,960
You go. You.

292
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,040
Xinxin, let go.

293
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
Let go, miss.

294
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Stop struggling.

295
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,720
Why are you hitting me?

296
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,880
Let go of him.

298
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,080
I'm so sorry.

299
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,280
I'm so sorry.

300
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,160
No, sis, please go take care of the child in the car first.

301
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,960
Don't worry.

302
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,820
Come, sit here.

303
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,130
The internal fixation looks good.

304
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,210
Do you know how lucky you are to have met me?

305
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,560
Here.

306
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
You said you would

307
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,210
wait for me forever.

308
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,260
I believed you.

309
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,640
So I got divorced.

310
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
And came back to find you.

311
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,360
I've always known

312
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,570
that men's words can't be trusted.

313
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,920
If my mother hadn't been so eager to have a grandchild,

314
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,850
I would never have gotten married.

315
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
And my mother threatened

316
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,160
to leave her inheritance to her grandchild.

317
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,820
It seems we were destined to meet but not to be together.

318
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,600
Alright then.

319
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,599
We'll keep each other in our hearts.

320
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,319
From now on,

321
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,200
I won't disturb your happy life anymore.

322
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,520
Weiwei.

323
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,119
You know what?

324
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,359
That place in my heart

325
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,280
has always been yours.

326
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,250
The reason I got married

327
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,819
was because I missed you too much.

328
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,680
I wanted to find someone else

329
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,240
to take your place,

330
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,600
to fill the void of missing you.

331
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,520
Really?

332
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,320
Really.

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,560
Take me to meet your wife.

334
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,160
What are you going to do?

335
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,960
Don't worry.

336
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,240
I'm not going there to make trouble.

337
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,880
It's just that if you two

338
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,280
want to continue living happily together,

339
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,920
we need to resolve what happened that day.

340
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,620
Remember this.

341
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,520
No matter what you've done to me,

342
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,960
I still love you.

343
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,360
As long as I see you happy,

344
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
I'll do anything for you.

345
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,600
Thank you.

346
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,010
Xinxin, you're finally awake.

347
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,940
Where's my son?

348
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,900
Don't worry. He's in the nursery.

349
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,960
You were completely drunk last night.

350
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,320
Someone from the pet hospital

351
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
brought you home.

352
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,250
What person from the pet hospital?

353
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,480
An older man.

354
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,240
Xinxin.

355
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
I don't mean to lecture you, but

356
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,680
you're a mother now.

357
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,360
You can't be as reckless as before.

358
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,400
I know.

359
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,200
You...

360
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Qin Gang is here.

361
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,900
You guys...

362
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,520
How dare you show up here!

363
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,480
Get out!

364
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,280
Qin Gang explained everything to me.

365
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,560
You misunderstood, Xinxin.

366
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,040
What?

367
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,960
Listen to me.

368
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,040
This is my client, Liu Wei.

369
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,360
The other day,

370
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,160
she found out about our misunderstanding,

371
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,360
so she came specially to explain.

372
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,160
You must be Wan Xinxin.

373
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,480
So young and beautiful.

374
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
Mr. Qin is so lucky.

375
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,480
I'm Liu Wei, Mr. Qin's client.

376
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,560
I heard that day,

377
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,160
because of me, you two had a misunderstanding.

378
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,410
Misunderstanding?

379
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,280
You were on the office couch

380
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,840
hugging my husband.

381
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,320
I saw it with my own eyes and you call it a misunderstanding?

382
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
Do you think I'm blind?

383
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,040
Don't be angry. Let me explain.

384
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,640
It's all my fault.

385
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,000
That day I accidentally

386
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,640
spilled coffee on Mr. Qin.

387
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,080
When you arrived,

388
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,200
I was helping him clean his clothes.

389
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,780
That's why the misunderstanding happened.

390
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,600
Honey,

391
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,740
is what she's saying true?

392
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,640
Well...

393
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,680
You don't have to believe me,

394
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
but you must trust your husband.

395
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,850
This is a small gift from me.

396
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Please accept it.

397
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
I'll be going now. You take good rest.

398
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,520
Mr. Qin, take good care of your wife.

399
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,800
I'll be going now.

400
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:00,820
Moon

401
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,720
Xinxin,

402
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,660
what mistress would come apologize to the wife?

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,160
Exactly. See?

404
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,480
My client

405
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,180
came specially to apologize and explain to you.

406
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,360
Besides, Qin Gang isn't stupid.

407
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,720
You two just got married,

408
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,080
and you've had a healthy baby boy.

409
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,520
How could he bear to leave you?

410
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,320
You have no idea,

411
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,200
he was so worried last night, looking everywhere for you.

412
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,360
I didn't sleep all night

413
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,600
watching over you.

414
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,600
Right? Don't you agree?

415
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Honey, is what she's saying true?

416
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Open the door!

417
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,560
Open up now!

418
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,040
Open the door!

419
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,960
Sir, wait a moment.

420
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,680
Sir, what can I do for you?

421
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,320
Sir?

422
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,080
Sir?

423
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,160
Cut the nonsense.

424
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,080
Someone saw you pick up my son yesterday.

425
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,760
Where have you hidden him?

426
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,720
No, I...

427
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,160
My son!

428
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,000
What's wrong with you?

429
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,760
Is this your dog?

430
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Who did this to you?

431
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,960
Sir, yesterday I caught it at the beach.

432
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,200
How could you do this to it?

433
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,400
No, it's me.

434
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,240
Listen to me.

435
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,120
How could you do this to it?

436
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
I didn't harm it.

437
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,520
Sir, sir, come here.

438
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,840
You've done this to it.

439
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,480
Sir!

440
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
If you have any issues, take it up with me.

441
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,600
No, no.

442
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,080
Ming, what's going on here?

443
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,340
Are you the owner here?

444
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,680
Yes, I'm the owner.

445
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,250
Someone from your place

446
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,120
injured my son.

447
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,320
You must give me an explanation today.

448
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,240
Look, sir,

449
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,440
you don't have any proof.

450
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,080
You can't falsely accuse people, right?

451
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,840
What proof?

452
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,680
I saw it with my own eyes yesterday.

453
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
He was the one who hit him.

454
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,480
He was the one who did it.

455
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,540
Sir, how could I...

456
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Sir, sir.

457
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,960
Please calm down. Please calm down.

458
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,920
Listen to what our doctor has to say.

459
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,720
Look, could you please calm down

460
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,680
and let me say something?

461
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,440
That's right.

462
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,160
I didn't hit it. I saved it.

463
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,720
I've just finished operating on it.

464
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,560
You came in here

465
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,120
and didn't even give me a chance to speak.

466
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,180
Listen carefully.

467
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,160
Our doctor saved your dog.

468
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,860
You're talking nonsense.

469
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,160
If you don't give me an explanation today,

470
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm not leaving.

471
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,000
Look, sir,

472
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
if you really claim I hit your dog, show me the evidence.

473
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,280
Do you have evidence?

474
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,480
You say you didn't hit it.

475
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,280
Didn't hit it.

476
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,760
Then what evidence do you have?

477
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,490
Who can prove you didn't hit it?

478
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,480
Who can prove it? Tell me.

479
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,100
Someone really did see it.

480
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,880
It's normal. The child is completely fine.

481
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,810
Good. Thank you.

482
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,000
Please come in.

483
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,240
Everything is normal.

484
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,840
Now I can relax.

485
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,320
Hello.

486
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,920
Hello. You are?

487
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm

488
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,920
The rideshare guy.

489
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,010
Dr. Hua Ming from the pet hospital.

490
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,760
I brought you some fruit.

491
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,560
You even bought me fruit.

492
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
No, I should have been the one visiting you.

493
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,920
And you bought me fruit. This is so embarrassing.

494
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,080
Um, I drank too much yesterday.

495
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,440
I didn't cause you too much trouble, did I?

496
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
No, not at all.

497
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
You don't need to say anything. I know.

498
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,120
I have this one problem.

499
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,880
When I drink too much, I always do

500
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,520
really strange things.

501
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,400
I came to ask for your help.

502
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,280
You need my help?

503
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,480
I'll help if I can.

504
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,920
You can definitely help with this.

505
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,080
When you and the baby were in the car,

506
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,480
I suddenly saw

507
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,440
a dog hit by a car on the roadside.

508
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,320
I got out and rescued the dog.

509
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,760
Now the dog's owner has found me

510
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,200
and claims I hit the dog.

511
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,360
I want you to go

512
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
and be my witness

513
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
to testify that I didn't hit the dog.

514
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,800
Right now?

515
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,560
Yes, let's go now.

516
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
No problem.

517
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Oh, wait. I can't.

518
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm staying at a postpartum care center.

519
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,520
I need someone to vouch for me to get permission to leave.

520
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,040
Not a witness, a guarantor.

521
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,440
Or you could go to the front desk and ask for leave on my behalf.

522
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,480
Although we know each other,

523
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,640
your surname is Wan?

524
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,720
Wan Xinxin.

525
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,120
Okay, thank you.

526
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,040
Thank you.

527
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,240
This baby is so cute.

528
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,640
You're buying fruit too?

529
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,680
Son.

530
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,280
Honey,

531
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
we can go out again. Did you know that?

532
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,320
What's this for?

533
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
That's a dog language translator.

534
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,720
Dog language translator?

535
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
That's so fancy!

536
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,920
What's that hanging in the front of your car?

537
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,580
That's a photo of my daughter.

538
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,040
Can I see it?

539
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,120
Thank you.

540
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,120
Such a loving man,

541
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,250
hanging his daughter's photo.

542
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
Your daughter is so grown up.

543
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,140
She doesn't look like you though.

544
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Why isn't there a photo of your wife?

545
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,380
You're not divorced, are you?

546
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,500
Thank you. Can I have it back, please?

547
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,960
Sure.

548
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,160
Stop the car! Pull over!

549
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,840
Stop!

550
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,760
Wait,

551
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,420
Miss Wan, where are you going?

552
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
Wait for me here.

553
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,480
You can't park here.

554
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,240
Miss Wan!

555
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,640
Are you looking for me?

556
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,760
Were you just with my husband?

557
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,010
Come in quickly.

558
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,320
I'm Qin Gang's client.

559
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,360
But I'm also his ex-girlfriend.

560
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I love him.

561
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,400
And he loves me too.

562
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,560
You two have only known each other

563
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,890
for just one short year.

564
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,440
But he and I

565
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,770
have known each other for almost 10 years.

566
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,600
You're nothing but a substitute.

567
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,800
There's no real love between you two.

568
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
That's nonsense!

569
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,960
We are married now.

570
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,440
We've got our marriage certificate.

571
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
He is my husband now.

572
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,520
We already have a child together.

573
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,360
Do you think having a child

574
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,080
can keep a man's heart?

575
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,280
You're just the other woman now.

576
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,290
What do you have to compete with me?

577
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,360
Listen to this.

578
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,000
That place in my heart

579
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,920
has always been yours.

580
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,520
The reason I got married.

581
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
is that I wanted to find someone else

582
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,240
to replace you.

583
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,680
You've been paid so much money.

584
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,080
What are you even good for?

585
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
Handing a patient over

586
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,360
to a complete stranger.

587
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,000
Dr. Hua is not a stranger.

588
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,890
He's my college classmate.

589
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,840
Besides, Wan Xinxin said she knows him too.

590
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,400
And we got Mr. Qin's approval.

591
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,040
Director Li.

592
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,680
It's okay. Please go ahead with your work.

593
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,720
Sorry for the trouble. I'll talk to her myself.

594
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,600
Fine.

595
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,560
I still have questions. Why did you let her leave?

596
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,800
I really don't know.

597
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,880
You're a grown man.

598
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,840
How could you not keep an eye on a young girl?

599
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,560
Listen, Wan Xinxin has already run away.

600
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,520
So think about it.

601
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,920
Is there anywhere she might have gone?

602
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
I'll get people to search for her.

603
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,000
We need to find her.

604
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,840
How would I know?

605
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,960
What's going on? Didn't you tell me

606
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,520
Qin Gang,

607
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
that she'd just give testimony and come back?

608
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,760
Yes, Mr. Qin.

609
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,080
I didn't expect she would run away.

610
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,640
Did she run away or did you sell her?

611
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,240
Tell me.

612
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,760
I saved her.

613
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,080
Where did you sell the mother and child?

614
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,800
Tell me or I'm calling the police.

615
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Enough.

616
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
That's enough.

617
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,800
This isn't the first time she's run off.

618
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
She keeps doing this.

619
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,400
Forget it. I'm tired of this.

620
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,960
Let's just leave it. I'm not looking for her anymore.

621
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,800
Qin Gang, don't be like this.

622
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,760
Xinxin may be a bit willful,

623
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
but you can't be so heartless.

624
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,040
Just abandoning her like that.

625
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,480
She's not alone anymore.

626
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,320
Besides, you need to think about your son.

627
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,840
Sister,

628
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
what am I supposed to think?

629
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,480
When you forced me to get married,

630
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,600
how did you promise me with your hand on your heart?

631
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,060
You said Wan Xinxin had grown up and matured.

632
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,800
It's only been a few days since she gave birth,

633
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
only a few days of behaving herself.

634
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,800
I married a wife,

635
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,120
not a princess who needs constant pampering.

636
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,640
If Wan Xinxin keeps causing trouble like this,

637
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,040
we're getting divorced.

638
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,960
It's okay, baby.

639
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,080
Baby, it's alright.

640
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,480
Let's be happy, okay?

641
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Look, you've been crying

642
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,600
for three hours. A full three hours now.

643
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,400
Where do you get all these tears?

644
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,640
Can you please stop crying?

645
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,200
If you cry anymore, the Great Wall might collapse, you know?

646
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,860
You don't understand a thing!

647
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
My heart is broken now,

648
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,120
shattered into pieces.

649
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,360
I've always said that

650
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,480
the tears a woman sheds after marriage

651
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,560
are just the water that got into her head before marriage.

652
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
I told you long ago

653
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,800
that Qin Gang was no good.

654
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,040
But you wouldn't listen.

655
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,240
Now look what happened. You're facing the consequences.

656
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,160
I'm already in such a state,

657
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,920
don't you have any conscience?

658
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,440
Alright, alright.

659
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,480
Come on,

660
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,920
get up, get up.

661
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,480
Look at me. Look at me.

662
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,600
Why should I look at you?

663
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,440
Come on, relax.

664
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,560
Breathe.

665
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,120
Inhale.

666
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,600
Relax again.

667
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,760
Breathe again.

668
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,960
How do you feel now?

669
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,200
I'm hungry.

670
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,200
Hey, Mom.

671
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,200
I asked you to send me photos of my grandson.

672
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,280
Why haven't you sent them yet?

673
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,200
Don't worry.

674
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,720
Let me explain.

675
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,960
When Xiaobao was just born,

676
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,920
I had a monk do some divination.

677
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
He said the baby was a bit premature,

678
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,520
so we can't take photos too early.

679
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,080
Otherwise, it might capture his soul.

680
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,880
Xu's Special Nutritional Meal.

681
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,280
Premium ingredients.

682
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,600
Specially customized for you.

683
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,760
Quick!

684
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,240
What's wrong?

685
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,960
Why does this food taste bitter?

686
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,720
Bitter?

687
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,560
Yes.

688
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,920
I heard that

689
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,520
astragalus and codonopsis are good for new mothers,

690
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,650
so I added a bit more.

691
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,960
Too much.

692
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,920
Alright, bye-bye.

693
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
We can't even find the person and they still want photos.

694
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,840
If she chose to run away,

695
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,970
there's nothing you could do about it.

696
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,960
Why not just tell the old lady the truth?

697
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,170
That won't work.

698
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,840
My mother's condition gets worse when she's anxious.

699
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,700
So what are you planning to do now?

700
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,920
What else? Get a divorce.

701
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,120
It's not that simple.

702
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,480
What about the child if you divorce?

703
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,520
I'll raise the child myself, of course.

704
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,560
When my little boy turns 18,

705
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,290
he'll kill that scoundrel and avenge his mother.

706
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
Come on. First make sure

707
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,940
you can survive the next 18 years.

708
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,620
That's why I have you, don't I?

709
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,720
My lady, I have something to tell you.

710
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,680
It's not good news, is it?

711
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,640
It is good news.

712
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,280
Speak.

713
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,020
I've taken a lucrative job

714
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,540
and need to go on a trip.

715
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,080
You just said you'd stick with me through thick and thin,

716
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,720
and now this. Men are as reliable as pigs flying.

717
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,080
Look, while you were drowning in your emotional drama,

718
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
I was signing a contract.

719
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,520
What's more important, the contract or me?

720
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,160
You are.

721
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,600
Exactly.

722
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,000
But...

723
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,840
But what?

724
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,080
You left with nothing,

725
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,320
and I'm completely broke.

726
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,210
I've arranged everything for you.

727
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,930
Don't worry.

728
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,480
Wait, Xu Ke.

729
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,960
Is this all the money you have?

730
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
And you're showing off your wallet?

731
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,400
This is all I have, my dear.

732
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,170
Don't worry, it'll last until I come back.

733
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
Also, the gas bill

734
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,240
probably needs to be paid soon.

735
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
You'll need to pay it at the property management office.

736
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,840
So I have to deal with the gas bill too?

737
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Alright, I've told you everything.

738
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,480
When I return rich,

739
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,000
I'll treat you and your son to a life of luxury.

740
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,880
Okay, let's try another one.

741
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Good, beautiful.

742
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,360
Come on, that's so sexy. Good.

743
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,280
Alright, let's go.

744
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
One, two. Show me your leg.

745
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,840
Good.

746
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,360
Change the pose, change the pose.

747
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
The eyes! Focus on the eyes!

748
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,400
Again, keep going.

749
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,760
Beautiful.

750
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,880
Come on, next one, next one.

751
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,639
Two.

752
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,239
This one is so cute.

753
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,440
Look, honey. Isn't it pretty?

754
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,900
You like it too, right?

755
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,420
Why is it so expensive?

756
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,480
Is this a parent-child matching outfit?

757
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,080
Yes, it is.

758
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,679
So cute.

759
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,320
But this one isn't really suitable for your baby.

760
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,880
How about this one?

761
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,760
This one is nice too. It's suitable for him to wear now.

762
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
Okay, I'll take all of these.

763
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,480
Great!

764
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,460
How much is it in total?

765
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,880
Hello, the total is 3,288.

766
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,440
How much?

767
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,560
3,288.

768
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,720
Anyway, you're joint property between me and him.

769
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,400
Go ahead and charge it.

770
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,040
Okay.

771
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,540
So Wan Xinxin is shopping at the mall.

772
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,200
I'll go find her.

773
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,400
What's the point of going now?

774
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,660
By the time you get there, she'll be gone.

775
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,040
You got this credit card for Wan Xinxin, right?

776
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,080
Yes.

777
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,960
I used to manage all her money.

778
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,560
Actually, since you helped her get the card,

779
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,680
we could just cancel it.

780
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,520
When she runs out of money, she'll naturally come back to you.

781
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,320
That's right.

782
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,960
Sweetie.

783
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,840
Ruirui, it must be early morning where you are.

784
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,450
Why aren't you sleeping in?

785
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I miss you.

786
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,560
Dad, it's the weekend. How could you forget?

787
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,560
Listen, Daddy is outside right now.

788
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,880
Can we video chat after I get home?

789
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,320
No. Go eat first.

790
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,250
Don't look at me.

791
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Yes, sir.

792
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,440
Hurry up.

793
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,200
Don't lie to me.

794
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,000
Okay, okay. Hey, Ruirui.

795
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,560
I'll eat whatever you want me to eat.

796
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,890
Shopping malls are truly evil places.

797
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,400
But Mom's feeling much better now.

798
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,360
I suddenly have a craving for hot pot.

799
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,480
No, I can't give in. I should go home and eat instant noodles.

800
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,680
But if I don't treat myself to something nice,

801
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,320
how can I face my own stomach?

802
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,480
Right, if I don't eat well,

803
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,080
I won't have the strength to carry all this stuff home,

804
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,560
right?

805
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,560
If I don't eat enough, I won't have energy to raise you either.

806
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,680
Okay, it's decided then.

807
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,410
Hot pot it is!

808
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,240
Hello.

809
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,960
Can I leave my things here for now?

810
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,200
Thank you.

811
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,480
Thanks.

812
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,800
Excuse me.

813
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,280
Could you bring me some hot water?

814
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,840
I need to sterilize a baby bottle.

815
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Great, thank you.

816
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,200
Baby, daddy ordered double portions.

817
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,000
I'll eat your favorite dishes for you.

818
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,480
We'll have food soon.

819
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,500
Mom will feed you after she finishes eating.

820
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,410
Oh, it's you.

821
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,520
It's not me.

822
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,650
What do you mean it's not you? It is you.

823
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,080
Goodbye.

824
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,120
I should take you back to the maternity center.

825
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,640
I was planning to go back.

826
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,170
I'll go back after I finish eating.

827
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,240
Well...

828
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,280
I ordered enough for two people.

829
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Too much for just me.

830
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,410
Let's eat together.

831
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,880
Don't be so polite.

832
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,480
It's fine. Don't mention it.

833
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,940
Please.

834
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,360
Okay.

835
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,520
Waiter,

836
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,840
bring us a spicy pot.

837
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,440
Waiter,

838
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,520
that won't be necessary.

839
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,920
Well,

840
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,560
during breastfeeding,

841
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,320
it's not good to eat spicy food.

842
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,400
Actually,

843
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,530
I ordered a clear broth pot that hasn't been touched yet.

844
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,120
Just have a bite.

845
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,320
Look at me, my brain isn't working properly.

846
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
Pregnancy makes you stupid for three years.

847
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,160
I haven't fed my baby yet.

848
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,820
Maybe I should go feed the baby first.

849
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,520
Feed the baby back at the maternity center. It won't take long.

850
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,980
Let me feed the baby first.

851
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,570
Here's the hot water you asked for. Do you want to sterilize the bottle?

852
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,840
Thank you.

853
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,920
Hurry up and eat something.

854
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,650
After we finish eating, I'll take you back to the maternity center.

855
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,280
Are you serious?

856
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,560
I'm a grown woman. Can't I go back by myself?

857
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,760
No, miss, it's like this.

858
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,680
I rescued you.

859
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,600
Let's not talk about this anymore.

860
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,800
I'm the one who brought you out from the maternity center.

861
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,040
I promised them I'd take you back.

862
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,240
After you return to the maternity center,

863
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
whatever you do is none of my business.

864
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,170
Hurry up and eat. We'll leave soon.

865
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,680
Listen, sir,

866
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,220
why are you being so stubborn?

867
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,720
Yes, you saved me,

868
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,580
but you can't control me forever.

869
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,400
I'll say it again.

870
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,360
After I take you back,

871
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,890
whatever you want to do is none of my business.

872
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,530
Hurry up and eat.

873
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,240
Oh! Oh no!

874
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,920
I need to use the restroom.

875
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,370
Go ahead, child. I'll keep an eye on it for you.

876
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Okay. Make sure you watch it carefully.

877
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,640
I will.

878
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,000
Baby, your mom is

879
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,200
very sneaky.

880
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,160
Ma'am,

881
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,000
are you from the neighborhood committee downstairs?

882
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,720
Yes, I am.

883
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,840
I have a favor to ask you.

884
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,440
What is it?

885
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,770
Don't go.

886
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,580
What's wrong with you?

887
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,980
Do you think this is appropriate?

888
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,040
Huahua, are you asking for trouble?

889
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,240
It took you forever to answer the phone.

890
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,850
Don't think I don't know

891
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,720
where you took your phone.

892
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,650
Put the phone against your ear now.

893
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,560
I'm listening, I'm listening.

894
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,480
Your Highness,

895
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,040
do you have any instructions?

896
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,530
I'm in a hurry, please get to the point.

897
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,640
What urgent matter? You're just chasing girls,

898
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,040
don't think I don't know.

899
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,160
Yang Ming.

900
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:46,720
Wang Yaping.
